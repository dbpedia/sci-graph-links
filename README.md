#  Guideline to SciGraph-DBpedia Data Repository

We worked on interlinking SciGraph and DBpedia datasets by using Link Discovery approach for the structured content and Named Entity Recognition approach for unstructured text. The goals of this work are:

* Enrich the data with additional relations by annotating content

* Integrating data with widely used sources

* Increase the discoverability of the data

* Improve identity resolution
