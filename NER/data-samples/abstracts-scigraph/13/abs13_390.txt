Abstract Mood and sensory perception questionnaires were applied to high school, university and teachers' college students in Brisbane during winter. Responses were related by multiple regression procedures to outdoor and indoor atmospheric parameters. Various complex associations emerged between the moods and warmth, humidity, cloudiness, intensity of sunlight and windiness. There is evidence for the practical need to reduce thermal stress indoors since this appears to be associated with increased aggression and decreased endurance, play and liking of school. Overall, there are indications that more energetic mood states are related to increased intensities in weather elements, while thermal neutrality outdoors seems to be most conducive to the learning situation.
