Abstract This study examines knowledge needs for dictionary reference skills among Korean teachers of English within the context of a 12-h in-service teacher-training course in dictionary use. As an integral part of the curriculum development project, the study looked into various aspects of English teachers’ dictionary training needs, mainly by means of multiple survey instruments (i.e., before- and after-training questionnaires) and the qualitative analysis of the teachers’ during-course comments throughout multiple phases of the training process. The trainee-teachers’ spontaneous questions regarding dictionary use as well as their during-training feedback provided particularly useful information about the skills that should be focused on to meet the perceived training needs of current Korean teachers of English. The study has identified a clear need for typological and functional knowledge about the various dictionaries available, for informed dictionary choices, and for skills to exploit electronic dictionary functions. Most of the perceived needs were found to be related to across-dictionary skills, rather than skills specific to a particular dictionary. From this study, it was also found that explicit skill training can be a very effective mode of teaching for specific user-groups such as non-native teachers of English.
