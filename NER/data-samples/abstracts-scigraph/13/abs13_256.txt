Abstract This article examines a long-dormant teaching methodology known as the Personalized System of Instruction (PSI). The literature documenting the effectiveness of PSI is reviewed, showing that it is superior to traditional instruction. Even given this evidence, few educators employ this instructional strategy today. Arguments against PSI are examined, and suggestions are made on how to avoid the pitfalls associated with PSI. The article also discusses how to implement PSI in a college chemistry course.
