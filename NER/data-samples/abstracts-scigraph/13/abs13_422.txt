Abstract â€‚This paper describes how the LGC and the Nuffield Curriculum Projects Centre set up an analysis competition for 16- to 19-year-old students. The competition was based on the procedure for proficiency testing. The results and reports give some insight into current standards of teaching and learning about analytical procedures and the treatment of uncertainty in courses at this level. The outcomes justify the production of a good-practice guide for teachers so that they can introduce concepts of valid analytical measurement into pre-university courses.
