Abstract BackgroundTelementoring offers the possibility of making extended education oversight available on a cost-effective, large-scale basis. It expands the mentor/proctor pool and makes these educational assets more widely available to assist in protecting the public. However, it is an application that if haphazardly implemented rapidly losses its effectiveness and is more dangerous to the patient. Like all programs that can cite demonstrable outcome consistency, telementoring should be established on a foundation of sound training methodology. This article discusses the history of telementoring and where this modality stands today and outlines a validated methodology for successful telementoring missions. MethodsThis algorithm includes preprocedural assessment and enhancement of laparoscopic surgical skills, establishment of a standardized approach to the procedure, tactical information deployment, telementoring simulation laboratories, and establishment of the doctor/patient relationship. ResultsTelementoring can make cost-effective extended education oversight available on a large-scale basis. DiscussionBecause of an overwhelming need for mentors/proctors and supporting evidence in the literature, telementoring is an application whose time has come.
