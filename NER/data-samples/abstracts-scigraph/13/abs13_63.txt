Abstract This paper presents a summary of proposals and new learning scenarios for the 21st century related to the theme of “Education, Culture and Technology”. These proposals and scenarios are based on the work conducted in 2014 by a group of experts from Andorra, Catalonia, the United States and the United Kingdom during the International Forum on Education and Technology (FIET) held in Tarragona, Spain. The main aim of this work is to analyze the interconnection between education and culture through the discussion and selection of best practices and to identify the role played by technology in this process. The methodology used in this qualitative research was the focus group, whereby a group of experts analyzed and selected a range of good practices related to the main issue. The results of this process were shared at two plenary sessions with 100 expert reviewers and 500 educators. After considering the challenges faced by education in the 21st century and the best practices selected by the experts, it was agreed that digital technology can promote the dialogue that is needed to create a culture of innovation and enhance new ways of learning, participating, and contributing to local and global culture. At the end of this paper we make several proposals and recommendations for constructing learning environments that integrate education, culture and technology for a transformative experience.
