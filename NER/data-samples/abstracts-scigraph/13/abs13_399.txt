Abstract The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of a flipped English classroom intervention on high school students’ information and communication technology (ICT) and English reading comprehension in Taiwan. Forty 10th graders were randomly selected from a representative senior high school as an experimental group (EG) to attend a 12-h flipped English classroom intervention while another 37 10th graders were randomly selected from the same school to be the comparison group. All participants completed the high school student questionnaire that assessed students’ ICT, English reading comprehension at the beginning and end of this study. In addition, 4 target students with the lowest pretest scores on ICT from the EG were selected to be observed weekly and interviewed following the posttest. The findings showed that the EG students’ ICT, and English reading comprehension improved significantly during the intervention. The interview and observation results were consistent with the quantitative findings. Educational implications and research recommendations are discussed.
