Abstract The aim of this paper is to investigate the global stability and periodic nature of the positive solutions of the difference equation $$x_{n + 1} = \frac{{A + Bx_{n - 2k - 1} }} {{C + D\prod\limits_{i = 1}^k {x_{n - 2i} } }}, n = 0,1,2, \ldots ,$$ where A, B are nonnegative real numbers, C,D > 0 and l, k are nonnegative integers such that l â‰¤ k.
