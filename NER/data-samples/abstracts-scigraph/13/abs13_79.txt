Abstract In this paper, the development of a methodology for the calculation of questionsâ€™ difficulty degree and creation of exams for distance education trainees is presented. The methodology is based on the principles of multicriteria decision analysis and multiobjective linear programming. The UTA* method is used in order to calculate the difficulty degree of any hypothetical question that can be described from the criteria defined and the Global Criterion method is used in order to solve the multiobjective mixed integer linear programming model that is constructed in order to create a test for the trainees.
