Abstract This article explores the potential of critical mathematics (CM) in terms of its ability to disrupt traditional patterns of student participation in classroom discourse. It draws on tools from critical discourse analysis to examine transcripts from CM activities taught in a remedial high school setting. It points to the promise of CM in terms of its ability to alter established patterns of participation and achievement and to engage previously disengaged students. It indicates how CM instruction might open up a discursive space for traditionally marginalized students to express their ideas and to assert their subjectivity. However, it also raises issues that mathematics educators interested in critical pedagogy should consider, including ongoing issues of passive and active student resistance to CM.
