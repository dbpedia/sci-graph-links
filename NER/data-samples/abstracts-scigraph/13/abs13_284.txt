Abstract Since the academic year 2001â€“2002, inter-laboratory trials for students of Analytical Chemistry in Spanish Universities have been organised by the Department of Analytical Chemistry at the University of Barcelona in collaboration with the Complutense University of Madrid, the University of Cordoba and the University of Huelva. The aim of these exercises is to train students in the use of tools for the assessment and improvement of quality in analytical laboratories. Representative samples of environmental and food analysis, agricultural soils and a type of beer were selected. The ethanol content of the beer and the pH, conductivity, and extractable phosphorus and potassium content in the soil were the chosen analytical parameters. Sample preparation, homogeneity and stability studies, as well as the statistical treatment of data from participants, were carried out by the laboratory Mat Control of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the University of Barcelona. The paper presented heregives the results obtained after two years of experience.
