Summary. 5-Isopropylidene-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (the condensation product of Meldrumâ€™s acid and acetone) reacts smoothly with tert-butyl isocyanide in the presence of primary or secondary amines to produce N-tert-butyl-2,2-dimethylbutyramide derivatives and/or 1-tert-butyl-4,4-dimethyl-2,5-dioxopyrrolidine-3-carboxamides in good yields.
