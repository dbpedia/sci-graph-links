Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate students’ conceptions of the greenhouse effect, global warming, and climate change. The study was descriptive in nature and reflected a cross-age design involving the collection of qualitative data from 51 secondary students from three different schools in the Midwest, USA. These data were analyzed for content in an inductive manner to identify student’s conceptions. The categories that emerged from the students’ responses reflected different degrees of sophistication of students’ conceptions about the greenhouse effect, global warming, and climate change. Based on these findings we make curricular recommendations that build on the students’ conceptions, the IPCC Findings, the NRC (1996) science education standards, and NOAA’s climate literacy framework.
