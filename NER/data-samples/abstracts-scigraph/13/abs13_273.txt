Abstract This study examines the affect of IMF-induced structural adjustment programs on several key indicators regarding the status of women in Ecuador. In particular, we focus on the evolution of female primary and secondary school enrollment and female labor force participation in time series data from 1987 to 2003. The analysis is conducted using ordinary least squares regression with corrections for heteroscedasticity. The findings suggest that structural adjustment programs reduced female enrollment in primary and secondary schools and caused a reduction in the reported female labor force participation rate.
