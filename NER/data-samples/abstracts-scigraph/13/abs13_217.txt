Abstract A literature review of 37 papers cited by MEDLINE between 1986 and April 1996 under the terms “diabetes”, “patient education” and “randomized” was carried out. The articles were analysed on the basis of a check list (Educational Procedure Check List), which contains 27 items grouped into 8 areas: study objectives, educational objectives, population, educational strategy, content, evaluation, outcome, final results. The results of our study show that authors do not describe the educational interventions that they have used; thus, we suggest that editors request randomized trial studies containing information on indentification of patients' needs, elaboration of learning objectives, and planning and running of the program and the evaluation system used.
