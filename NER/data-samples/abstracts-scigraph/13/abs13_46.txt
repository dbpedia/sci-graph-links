Abstract This paper considers a comparative study on model-scale sloshing tests. There are two primary scopes of this study: the comparison of sloshing pressure measured in 1/50-scale model tests at Seoul National University (SNU) with (1) the data measured at the other facility for the same model, and (2) the data measured on a smaller scale model. For the comparative study, model tanks are excited with the same irregular motions with Froude scale, and sloshing pressure signals are measured at the same locations. The statistical quantities of 1/50-scale model tests are compared with those of other facility and 1/70-scale model tests. In this study, it is found that peak pressure measured at SNU are slightly lower than those of other facility, and this difference may be due to different sensor types and sensing diameters.
