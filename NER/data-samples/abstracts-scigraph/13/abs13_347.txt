Abstract Worcester Polytechnic Institute's (WPI) unique academic plan enables students to study sustainable development and the environment as part of an international educational experience. As a technological university, WPI requires students to complete an interdisciplinary project on the interaction of science or technology and society. This paper describes the environmental projects completed by WPI students, in Bangkok, Venice and Guayaquil. The lessons from WPI's experience provide a model for environmental education at other institutions. These interdisciplinary projects not only promote environmental awareness among students, but they also provide tangible assistance to regions which are developing strategies for sustainable development.
