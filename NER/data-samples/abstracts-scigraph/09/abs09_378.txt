Abstract In this work, we have prepared electrochemically and studied a composite materials based on an organic conducting polymer, polyaniline (PANI), in which inorganic semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles were incorporated with different concentrations. The polyaniline/titanium dioxide composite material which had been deposited by cyclic voltammetry on substrates of indium tin oxide was then characterized. The cyclic voltammogram showed one redox couple characteristic of the oxidation and reduction states of the produced composite material. The impedance spectroscopy study showed that the resistance of the film increases with the TiO2 cocntent incorporated in the polymer. The incorporation of TiO2 in PANI covering the surfaces was confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy and the energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The morphological analysis of the film surfaces showed that the TiO2 nanoparticle increased the roughness. These observations allow to consider a new approach to improve the physicochemical properties of the interface between the organic and inorganic material. The I–V characteristics of PANI+TiO2 heterostructure diode showed the nonlinear nature of the I–V curve of PANI+TiO2 heterostructure device.
