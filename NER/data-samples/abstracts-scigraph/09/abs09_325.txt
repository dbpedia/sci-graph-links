Conclusions 1.Tin bronze OTsSN3-7-5-1, which has a low cavitation and corrosion—cavitation resistance, should be replaced with more resistant alloys in marine pumps.2.Of the alloys tested, the corrosion—cavitation resistance in sea water is highest for bronze AZhMts 10-3-1.5, which can be considered a cavitation resistant alloy.3.Alloys for hydraulic applications should be selected on the basis of cavitation and corrosion—cavitation resistance.
