Abstract An energy concept of safety of structural elements which, in contrast to the force concept based only on the strength characteristics of materials, based on use of the energy properties of materials, is proposed. Calculation of the resources of plasticity and strain or low-temperature hardening in determination of the allowable stresses provides a relative advantage of hardening constructional materials over nonhardening and eliminates such a basic disadvantage characteristic of all existing standards for strength calculation in machine building as establishment of the same strength safety factors for materials of different types (classes). For the purpose of rational use of the strength reserves of materials they have been systematized based on the level of strain hardenability and a universal strain hardenability diagram of materials has been constructed. This diagram also provides the possibility of directed work on improving the basic mechanical properties of constructional materials by metallurgical and production methods.
