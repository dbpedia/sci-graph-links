Abstract We focus on the synthesis by ball milling and on the electrochemical characterization of nanocrystalline bimetallic and composite materials to be employed as anodes in Li ion batteries. Ni3Sn4 and Ni3Sn2 based compounds were obtained by ball milling of three different Ni–Sn mixtures. The properties of the resulting anodes for Li ion batteries were evaluated as a function of composition. Moreover, a biphasic system is presented, with CoSn2 and CoSn type structures, arising from the synthesis of the Sn31Co28C41 composition. When cycled in a Li cell, this material showed a high reversible specific capacity, about 450 mA h g−1, and a very good electrochemical and structural stability, making it of interest for application purposes.
