Conclusions We investigated the stability of thermomechanical strengthening of steel 40, in which there is a partial intermediate transformation. Complete removal of the strengthening effect of HTTMT requires that the steel be annealed four times at 900° for 4 h. Intermediate annealing at 600° or normalization at 840° with holding up to 10 h does not impair the mechanical properties.
