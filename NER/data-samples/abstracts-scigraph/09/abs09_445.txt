Conclusions The sintering of a chromium carbide composite is accompanied by the formation of a stable carbide (Cr, Fe)7C3, whose relative iron and chromium contents are determined by the chemical composition of the matrix phase and temperature. The relative amounts of the matrix and carbide phases in the charge, type of the starting carbide, and the latter's iron content have no significant effect on the composition of the carbide phase in the resultant sintered composite. The discrete character of dissolution of iron in the carbide Nr7N3 and closeness of resultant carbides to the stoichiometric composition Nr4Fa3N3 or Cr5Fe2C3 lead to the conclusion that during the sintering of iron-chromium carbides the iron does not merely act as an alloying element, but rather takes part in the carbide formation reaction.
