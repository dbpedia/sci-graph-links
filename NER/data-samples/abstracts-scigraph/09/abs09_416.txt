Summary The three-dimensional structure of a composite material found in alveolar exudate of oxygen poisoned lungs but also present in normal lungs is stereologically analysed. It is composed of tubules of 450 Å diameter which are tightly packed in a quadratic lattice. The wall of the tub vile is formed by “four-winged” osmiophilic filaments which are located in the corners of the quadratic lattice; their interior is made up of a hydrophilic substance which contains either a tubule or a filament of moderate electron density. The osmiophilic substance of the walls is continuous with associated myelin figures which can be resolved into lamellae with a periodicity of 42 Å and can thus be considered to be water crystals of phospholipids. The nature of the content of the tubules, which presumably exerts the formative force on the phospholipid lamellae to form tubules, remains undetermined.
