Abstract The impact of the MgO/Fe interface oxidation state on the electric-field-modified magnetic anisotropy in MgO/Fe has been revealed by density functional calculations. It is shown that the influence of the interface oxidation is strong enough to dominate the effect of the electric field on the magnetic anisotropy of MgO/Fe-based films. The magnetoelectric coefficients are calculated to be positive for the ideal and overoxidized MgO/Fe interface, but an abnormal negative value emerges in the underoxidized case. By analyzing the interface states based on density of states and band structures, we demonstrate that the considerably different electronic structures of the three oxidized MgO/Fe interfaces lead to the strong discrepancy in the electric-field modulation of the interfacial magnetic anisotropy. These results are of considerable interest in the area of electric-field-controlled magnetic anisotropy and switching.
