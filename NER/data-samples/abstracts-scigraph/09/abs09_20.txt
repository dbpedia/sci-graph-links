Abstract An integrating sphere is used together with a Fourier transform spectrometer for directional-hemispherical reflectance measurements in the spectral range from 1μm to 15μm. Comparisons with PTB's fundamental sphere reflectometer around 1μm show that the uncertainty of the infrared measurements is ±0.01.
