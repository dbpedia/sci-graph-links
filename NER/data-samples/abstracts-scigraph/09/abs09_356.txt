Abstract In this article, we report a new method for micro/nano fluidic channel fabrication by focused ion beams (FIB) utilizing the redeposition flux, or what we will refer to in this paper as SRM (sputter-redeposition method). Sputtered particles are byproduct of sputter process whereas it limits the focused ion beam (FIB) process. However, the sputtered particles can be useful in the fabrication of certain shapes of structures. The objective of this article is the demonstration of active utilization of the sputtered particles. A micro/nano-fluidic channel fabrication is demonstrated for the topic. As an application, in the fluidic channel fabrication we demonstrate two-step process; trench formation and automatic sealing in the micro-/nanometer range. This method channels from hundreds to tens of nanometers wide can be fabricated by using silicon as a channel substrate. The shape and dimensions of the channel cross-section are readily changed by varying the process parameters. This control of redeposition technique is advantageous because of the accuracy and simplicity of the process compare to other fluidic channel fabrication process.
