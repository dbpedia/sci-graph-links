Summary The paper discusses the two dimensional problem of diffraction of shear waves by a rigid strip in an infinite medium of monoclinic type. This problem is reduced to a system of dual integral equations of which the solution provides the diffracted field. The method of steepest descent has been used in the determination of the diffracted fields at a large distance from the strip. Diffraction pattern for displacement and stress field have been computed and the effect of anisotropy is distinctly marked.
