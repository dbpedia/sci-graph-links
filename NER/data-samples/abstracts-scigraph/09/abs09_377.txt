Abstract AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) was successfully fabricated by complementary metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor-compatible fabrication method, and the label-free, electrical detection of prostate specific antigen in real time using the biomolecule-gate AlGaN/GaN HEMT sensor was presented. It shows a rapid response when target prostate biomarker in buffer solution was added to the antibody-immobilized sensing area. The linear range for target prostate specific antigen detection has been demonstrated from 0.1 pg/ml to 10.269 ng/ml and a low detection below 0.1 pg/ml level is estimated, which is the best result of AlGaN/GaN HEMT biosensor for prostate specific antigen (PSA) detection till now. The sensitivity of 0.027 % is determined for 0.1 pg/ml prostate specific antigen solution. The electrical result of the biomolecule-gated AlGaN/GaN HEMT biosensor suggested that this biosensor might be a useful tool for the prostate cancer screening.
