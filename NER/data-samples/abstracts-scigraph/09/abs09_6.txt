Abstractâ€‚ This paper is to report a novel method to synthesize diamond crystal by using a well developed chemical vapor deposition process, but on a liquid substrate, while substrates of prevailing practice are solid. The substrate materials are metals which become liquid at diamond deposition temperature, such as elements Sn and Ga, and eutectic alloys of Cu-Ge, Sn-Ge. One result is that, while reported diamond crystal size was about 10 to 40 micrometers on the solid substrate, on the liquid substrate, the crystal size has reached so far about 300 micrometers.
