Abstract The dependence of the relief character of surface degradation of adhesive joints on the degree of substrate porosity and thermoaging modes has been experimentally studied. The discovered phenomenon is anisotropy of thermal-oxidative degradation of the adhesive in the adhesive joints of metal-sealant-glass ceramics (glass), which appears at high-temperature modes of thermal aging and has a critical effect on the processes responsible for the decrease in the adhesive joint strength and formation of the relief of the surface degradation of adhesive joints. Possible reasons for abnormal thermal degradation and ways of its elimination have been considered.
