Abstract A novel vapor-liquid-solid epitaxy (VLSE) process has been developed to synthesize high-density semiconductor nanowire arrays. The nanowires generally are single crystalline and have diameters of 10-200 nm and aspect ratios of 10-100. The areal density of the array can readily approach 1010 cm-2. Results based on Si and ZnO nanowire systems are reported here. Because of their single crystallinity and high surface area, these nanowire arrays could find unique applications in photocatalysis and photovoltaics.
