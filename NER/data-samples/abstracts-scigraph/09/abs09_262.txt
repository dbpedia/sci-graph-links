Abstract An investigation about influence of deposition current density on electrodeposited magnetic film is reported in this paper. Ferromagnetic NiFe thin films were electrodeposited on copper wires of 100 μm diameter for various electrdepostion current densities ranging from 10 to 60 mA/cm2 maintaining equal thickness in all films. The composition of deposited film varied with deposition current density and in particular, a composition of Ni79Fe21 was achieved for a current density of 20 mA/cm2. The surface microstructure of the film deposited at the current density of 20 mA/cm2 was found to have excellent smoothness. The coercivity of the film was lowest and highest value of magnetoimpedance was measured for this film. The influence of current density on film composition and hence magnetic properties was attributed to the change of deposition mechanism.
