The sorption properties of a titanium-base hydrogen-accumulating Ti – 42% Fe – 5% Zr – 1% Mo alloy, in which the formed hydride phases are more stable and hydrogen-accumulating than in the known TiFe compound, are studied. It is shown that the alloy bearing hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon is a catalytically active material. It can be used for synthesizing aliphatic amino acids and hydrocarbons.
