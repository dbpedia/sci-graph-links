Abstract This paper introduces the finite element method is used for predicting the temperature distribution in underground cable, using arch-shaped finite elements with explicitly derived solution matrices. A general derivation of the finite element equations by the method of weighted residuals (Galerkin’s method) is introduced. The arch-shaped finite elements are very suitable for cable geometries, and the explicit nature of the solution matrices allows for optimal computer usage. A 18-element two-dimensional slice of core conductor (single) bounded by two 90 °C inclined planes divided into arc shaped elements, are used for solution to a transient heating problem, and this defines the scope of this technique. The model is applied to one 3-core underground cables of 6.6 kV.
