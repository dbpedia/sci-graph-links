Conclusions Using fast heating it is possible to obtain carbon and economically alloyed steels with strength properties corresponding to similar characteristics of complexalloy steels, hardened by traditional methods. This opens up a wide field for the economy in expensive alloying elements. Recently great need has arisen for the development of steels intended especially for fast thermal hardening.
