Abstract  In this paper a new microgripper will be presented. The specific feature is the microfabrication based on a UV-lithographic process in microstructurable, photosensitive glass. Technological and manufacturing problems of the gripper will be described. The developed microgripper is actuated by a piezoelectric ceramic (monomorph). Glass microstructures are used as solid state hinges. With the special design of the gripper it is possible to realise a high distance ratio. The deflection of the gripping arms is some hundred micrometers. The gripping forces are a few mN up to 50 mN. The new grippers were fabricated and tested successfully.
