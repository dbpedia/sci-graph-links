Abstract Tungsten-titanium (WTi) thin films are known as potential adhesion promoters and diffusion barriers. The barrier efficiency of WTi thin films against indium (In) diffusion was experimentally studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements during in situ annealing. Specific multilayered samples were designed to estimate the diffusion barrier properties using the Ni/In system. These diffusion samples were made up of a 100-nm-thick WTi layer prepared by magnetron sputtering from an alloyed target (W:Ti ≈ 70:30 at.%), sandwiched between Ni and Au/In layers. WTi film microstructures were observed to depend on the working pressure. Diffusion barrier breakdown was monitored upon annealing by the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMC) (intermixing between Ni and In). Annealing was performed at temperatures of 573 K, 623 K, and 673 K (homologous temperatures $$T/T_{\rm m}^{\rm In} \simeq 1.34, 1.45$$ T/TmIn≃1.34,1.45 , and 1.57, respectively) and under primary vacuum. The diffusion coefficients of In in WTi were determined. The correlation between WTi film microstructure and diffusion barrier efficiency was established. Better diffusion barrier performance was obtained for WTi films with dense microstructure associated with a compressive residual stress state. Hence, tuning the sputtering conditions allows significant improvement of barrier performance against diffusion through a change of the film microstructure.
