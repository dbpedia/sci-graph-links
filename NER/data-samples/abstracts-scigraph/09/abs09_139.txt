Abstract This paper analyzes the thermal deformation in SU-8 polymer materials when subjected to different fabricating parameters and exposed to a high power light source for long durations for 45° micro-mirror applications. By experimentally optimizing the fabrication process, new fabricating technologies for micro-optical components can be developed. During the fabrication process, a polymer-based material is subjected to different soft bake, post exposure bake (PEB), hard baking temperatures; also, the baking times and exposure dosages were varied. Any of these variables can change the thermal stability of the material’s bonding energy and dynamic molecular behavior. There have not been many studies on the thermal deformation of a micro-mirror structure. A thermal dilatometer DIL-402C was used in this study to measure the thermal stability and determine changes in the material phase of SU-8 material. After optimizing the process parameters and finding that the inclined surface roughness was 49 nm, the thermal deformation was found to be 25 ppm (at 100°C).
