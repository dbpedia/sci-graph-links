Abstract The effect of friction treatment by a hard-alloy indenter on the microhardness and resistance to the heat-induced softening upon tempering of hardened medium-and high-carbon steels at 100–600°C is studied. The x-ray and electron microscopy methods are used to determine the causes of the increase in the heat resistance of the friction-strained steel surfaces. A comparative analysis of the effect of the hardening treatment by a hard-alloy indenter and by abrasive particles on the friction-induced heat resistance is performed for the case of high-speed friction treatment of a high-carbon laser-hardened steel.
