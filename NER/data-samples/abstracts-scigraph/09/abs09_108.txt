Abstract In this paper we deal with energy functionals depending on elastic strain and chemical composition and we obtain lower semicontinuity results, existence theorems and relaxation in the spacesH 1,p(Ω; ℝn)×L q (Ω; ℝd) with respect to weak convergence. Our proofs use parametrized measures associated with weakly converging sequences.
