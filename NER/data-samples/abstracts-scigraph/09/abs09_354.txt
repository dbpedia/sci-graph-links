Summary The spermatids of Campodea C. remyi Denis are clumped in small bundles of 236 to 650 elements during spermiogenesis, their acrosomes being embedded within an homogeneous electron dense material. The spermatid comprises an acrosomal region and a postacrosomal region within which, the two mitochondrial derivatives and the nucleus are arranged in parallel. The acrosome is rather long, it is reinforced by seven to ten microtubules. The axoneme is of the 9+9+ pattern. The mitochondria are of almost equal length. The shorter nucleus shows a very electron dense chromatin. At mid-nuclear level the cytoplasmic membrane is folded up to form a sort of collar opening backwards. Distal to the nucleus, superimposed lamellar structures are found located in an expanded part of the spermatid.
