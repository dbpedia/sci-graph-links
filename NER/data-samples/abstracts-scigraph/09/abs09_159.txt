Abstract The existence of various families of super conducting materials and their TC values are qualitatively rationalized within a simple model. Novel families of superconducting materials, particularly those based on fluoride and hydride anions, are predicted. Figure We predict that existing families of moderate- and high-TC superconductors should hopefully be enriched by novel compounds containing hardly polarizable anions (such as F-). Covalent chlorides and hydrides also merit careful exploration.
