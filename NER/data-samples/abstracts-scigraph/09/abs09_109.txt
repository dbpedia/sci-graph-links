Conclusions 1.The structure and properties of Ti−Al alloys with 0–22 wt. % Al were investigated after annealing at 700°C for 30 min.2.In the metastable condition it is possible for α2 phase to exist in Ti−Al alloys with about 6 wt. % Al or more. The alloy with about 16 wt. % Al has a structure of Ti3Al. The precipitation of {ie622-2} phase is evidently due to uneven distribution of aluminum in microvolumes of α phase.3.The precipitation of α2 phase affects the physical and mechanical properties of Ti−Al alloys.
