Abstract The systematic error is considered in measuring the normal component of the magnetic induction at the pole surfaces of a permanent magnet in the display of the magnetic field distribution by means of a film sensor based on a bismuth-bearing ferrite-garnet. A criterion is proposed for selecting film structures for use in magnetooptic detectors.
