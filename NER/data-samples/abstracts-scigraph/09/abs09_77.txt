Abstract Metal-ceramic-composite casting has a huge potential as a new manufacturing method for the production of complex-shaped micro sized parts or microsystems consisting of different metals and ceramics. The fundamental advantage of this method is the capability of multi-component part fabrication in one step avoiding first time consuming joining or assembling techniques; second the used material combinations can fulfill complex functionalities and enhanced mechanical properties. One of the most challenging factors in micro composite casting is a stable mechanical bonding between the used individual materials. But under consideration of the different physical properties like thermal expansion coefficient as well as of the wettability of the ceramic inserts and of the applied metal casting material it is possible to manufacture form and force fitting microsystems. Within the framework of this feasibility study complex metal-ceramic micro composites have been realized successfully using the lost-wax casting process. Casting experiments were performed at different muffle preheating temperatures with Al-bronze of the type CuAl10Ni5Fe4 as casting material. The ceramic parts, respectively inserts cast around by metal are micro gear wheels (2.5Â mm diameter) consisting of ZrO2 and Al2O3.
