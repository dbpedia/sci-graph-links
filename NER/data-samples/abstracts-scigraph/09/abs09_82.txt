Conclusions 1.A change in the form of temperature dependence for elasticity modulus of Fe-Ni-Cr Elinvars with a change in their composition both under the action of deformation and annealing points to the possibility of creating an alloy with thermally stable elasticity over a wide temperature range including the range 77–300°K.2.It is possible to use the Kersten-Becker-Doring equation to estimate the value of the ΔEλ-effect in Elinvars. With standard treatment for Elinvar 36NKh11 (drawing with the level of deformation at 60%, annealing at 500°C [3]) the contribution to the ΔEλ-effect of movement (not less than −180°) of interdomain boundaries and magnetization vector rotation is approximately the same.
