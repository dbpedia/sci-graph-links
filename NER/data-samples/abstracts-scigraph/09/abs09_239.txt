Abstract A setup for testing materials and processing the results obtained with construction of complete stressâ€“strain diagrams is described. The setup has been created with allowance for the authors' previous experience and new ideas in testing materials of various classes under conditions of equilibrium deformation, as well as computer-based state-of-the-art technologies. The efficiency of the use of the setup developed is illustrated by the example of testing a maraging steel under equilibrium deformation involving construction of complete diagrams.
