Conclusions 1.Electric furnaces with a movable chamber that provide continuous rotation of large crankshafts throughout the nitriding process can be used commercially.2.The treatment of crankshafts in these furnaces makes it possible to eliminate the undesirable operations of hot straightening and grinding after nitriding.3.The use of these furnaces leads to substantial savings due to considerable improvement in the operating characteristics of the crankshafts and the reduction of the manufacturing costs.4.Electric furnaces of this type can also be used for heat treating (nitriding, tempering) other bodies of rotation.
