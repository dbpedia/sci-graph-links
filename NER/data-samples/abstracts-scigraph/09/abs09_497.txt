Abstract This survey deals with the problems of composite proton electrolytes based on superprotonic acid salts M m H n (XO4) p (M = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li, NH4; A = S, Se, As, P), their transport, structural properties, and thermal stability. The main factors determining the composite properties are the type of oxide matrix, its morphology, surface acidity of the components, structural peculiarities of the salts, hydrogen bond network, and relative humidity. The review discusses briefly the synthesis and structures of these materials, as well as the influence of disordered states of the salt in composites on their unusual properties. The important role of hydrogen bonds for the interfacial interaction in the composite solid electrolytes is discussed.
