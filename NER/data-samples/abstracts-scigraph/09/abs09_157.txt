Summary The introduction of « magnetic » charges in a Higgs Lagrangian is studied in the limit for which the gauge field becomes very massive. It is found that in such a case the scalar Higgs field may be confined to the string. Further the equivalent of the Dirac condition is found for the case of a point charge and a massive gauge field and it is seen that there is no constraint between « electric » and « magnetic » charges. Rather it appears that the world area traced out by the string on looping it around an electric charge is quantized.
