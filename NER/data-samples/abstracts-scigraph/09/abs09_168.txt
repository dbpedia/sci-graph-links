Abstract Nanocomposite materials based on vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymer and organically modified montmorillonite Cloisite®15A were prepared by two different methods: melt mixing and co-precipitation. The changes taking place in crystalline structure, tensile strength, thermal behavior and the formation of piezoelectric b-phase as a result of the polymer system dissolution in dimethyl sulfoxide were studied. The technological specificity of each method has certain effect on the properties of the obtained nanocomposites. The highest content of b-phase — 95 % was achieved by co-precipitation from the solution of vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymer in dimethyl sulfoxide and 6 mass % content of Cloisite®15A. Despite the common view that the use of solvents and prolonged technological procedure lead to overall higher expenses, the obtained nanocomposites could be promising for the preparation of new piezo-materials.
