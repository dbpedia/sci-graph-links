Abstract Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fibers were melt-spun to prepare mono and multifilament yarns. To find optimum spinning and drawing conditions, various parameters such as spinning temperature, spinneret diameter, drawing temperature, and drawing ratio were examined. From the observation of the spinnability under various conditions, we found that the optimum conditions were as following: the extrusion temperature and die temperature were 175–180°C and 185–190°C, and the drawing temperature and drawing ratio were 85–95°C and 3.4, respectively. Under these conditions, the spinneret diameter could be reduced to the minimum value, 0.5 mm. Spun PVC filament yarns were subjected to the different yarn texturing process of stuffing box and pin false-twist method. The PVC yarn fabric was prepared by the knitting of textured yarns. Finally, the anion-emission and antibiotic properties of the knitted PVC fabrics were precisely evaluated.
