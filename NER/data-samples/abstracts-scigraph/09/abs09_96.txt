Abstract Various types of polymer surfaces with a nanolens array, which has an entrant shape with a low aspect ratio, were fabricated and the wettability of the fabricated surfaces was evaluated in both theoretical and experimental ways. The nanolens array was replicated on three different polymer surfaces of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) by means of replica molding and hot embossing with a nanodimpled aluminum mold that was manufactured by a chemical oxidation process. From the theoretical and experimental evaluations of the wettability it was found that the measured contact angles were very similar with the theoretically estimated ones and also the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the hydrophilic PMMA and hydrophobic PDMS, respectively, surfaces were reinforced by the nanolens array within the Wenzel wetting state.
