Abstract This article presents the design, fabrication and characterization of a micromachined energy harvester utilizing aluminium nitride (AlN) as a piezoelectric thin film material for energy conversion of random vibrational excitations. The harvester was designed and fabricated using silicon micromachining technology where AlN is sandwiched between two electrodes on top of a silicon cantilever beam which is terminated by a silicon seismic mass. The harvester generates electric power when subjected to mechanical vibrations. The generated electrical response of the device was experimentally evaluated at various acceleration levels. A maximum power of 34.78 μW was obtained for the device with a seismic mass of 5.6 × 5.6 mm2 at an acceleration value of 2 g. Various fabricated devices were tested and evaluated in terms of the generated electrical power as well as the resonant frequency.
