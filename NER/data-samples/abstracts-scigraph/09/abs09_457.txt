Abstract Selecting the material for a scaffold is critically important for the success of tissue engineering. To simplify complicated biosynthetic matrices and achieve a novel class of potential materials, a model of polyion complex fibers was prepared from alginate and chitosan. In the current in vitro study, we thought that alginate-based chitosan hybrid biomaterials could provide excellent supports for fibroblast adhesion. In the current study, alginate polymer fiber (alginate group) and alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fibers (alginate with 0.05% chitosan, alginate-chitosan 0.05% group; alginate with 0.1% chitosan, alginate-chitosan 0.1% group) were originally prepared. We investigated the adhesion behavior of rabbit tendon fibroblast onto alginate polymer fibers versus the adhesion of the fibroblast onto alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fibers. Furthermore, mechanical properties and synthesis of the extracellular matrix were investigated. Mechanically, the novel fiber has considerable tensile strength of more than 200â€‰MPa. We demonstrated that the alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fibers showed much improved adhesion capacity with fibroblast compared with alginate polymer fiber. Additionally, morphologic studies revealed the dense fiber of the type I collagen produced by the fibroblast in the hybrid polymer fibers. We concluded that an alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fiber has considerable potential as a desirable biomaterial scaffold for tendon and ligament tissue engineering.
