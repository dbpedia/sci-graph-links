Conclusions 1.Among transition elements (iron, nickel, cobalt), iron and cobalt improve the mechanical properties of AV000 aluminum in concentrations up to 0.5% and can be recommended for alloying aluminum wire.2.Cerium is the best alloying addition for aluminum wire, since it increases the strength, the ductility remains high, and the electrical conductivity hardly decreases.
