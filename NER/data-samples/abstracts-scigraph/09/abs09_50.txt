Abstract The electrical and thermal transport properties of three electrodeposited Ni-alloys for LIGA applications were investigated. Electrodeposted Ni from a sulfamate bath was shown to possess a microcrystalline grain structure with a thermal conductivity (82 W/mK) and electrical resistivity (7.9 μΩcm) similar to bulk Ni. The addition of saccharin additives or Mn alloying resulted in refinement of the grain structure which elevated the electrical resistivity and decreased the thermal conductivity. The effects of thermal aging were studied through isothermal annealing. Data show that the Ni-Mn samples were most thermally stable both in grain structure and transport properties. Ni-Watts with saccharin resulted in rapid grain growth and an increase in thermal conductivity and decrease in electrical resistivity to that near bulk Ni. The measurements of transport properties were shown to be sensitive to the initial changes in grain structure in the Ni-Watts and Ni-Mn materials, and thus, can be used to track microstructural evolution.
