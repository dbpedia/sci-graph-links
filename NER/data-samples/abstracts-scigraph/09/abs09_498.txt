Abstract A direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) is an all-solid-state electricity generation device that operates directly with solid carbon as fuel, without any liquid medium and feeding gas. Tubular electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), with silver-gadolinium doped ceria (Ag-GDC) as both anode and cathode materials, are fabricated and operated directly with activated carbon as fuel. The kinetics of the DC-SOFCs is carried out through analyzing the correlations of the cell reaction rates to the emitting rates of CO and CO2. It turns out that higher operating current corresponds to higher rates of consuming and producing CO, through electrochemical oxidation at the anode and the Boudouard reaction at the carbon fuel, respectively. The rate of consuming CO can be maintained constant by controlling the operating current while the rate of producing CO decreases with time because of carbon consumption. When the CO producing rate becomes smaller than the CO consuming rate, the operation will be terminated. Compared to the rates of the chemical reactions, the diffusion rates of CO and CO2 are so fast that their impeding effect on the cell performance can be neglected.
