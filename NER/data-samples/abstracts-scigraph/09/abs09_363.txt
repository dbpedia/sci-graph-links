Abstract The phase transformation behavior of a thermally grown oxide scale of FeO on pure-Fe and an Fe–2wt%Au alloy was investigated. Particular attention was paid to formation of a magnetite seam, which is the Fe3O4 layer formed at the FeO/alloy interface at an initial stage of the phase transformation, since it has important effects on the overall phase transformation of FeO scale. A thin Au(Fe) layer was found to develop on the Fe–Au alloy at the FeO/alloy interface after 32 min of oxidation at 750 °C in air. This Au(Fe) layer prevented formation of a magnetite seam and accelerated the FeO eutectoid reaction. The Au(Fe) layer acted as a “chemical diffusion barrier” for inward diffusion of Fe from the FeO to the alloy substrate across the FeO/alloy interface and prevented magnetite seam formation.
