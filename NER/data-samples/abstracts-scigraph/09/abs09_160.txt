Abstract Currently used ultrasonic welded joints for assembly and packaging of Li-Ion batteries have reliability concerns for automotive applications, as the battery is subjected to vibration and other mechanical loads. The sealing of the battery can is very critical for safety. Due to battery weld failures in recent years, the postal service has put ban on shipping Li-ion batteries via regular mail. A laser based alternative joining technology has the potential to offer robust, fast and cost-effective processing of Li-Ion batteries. Before the technology can be fully implemented, it is imperative to understand the effects of various process parameters on the robustness of the weld. In the present analysis, a preliminary study is performed to understand the effect of laser scanning speed on the micro-structural and physical characteristics of the materials in the weld area that ultimately affect the bond quality. Samples are created by welding aluminum and copper in lap shear configuration using a continuous wave fiber laser. Two sets of samples are created using a laser power of 225 W; however, the scanning speeds are 300 and 400 mm/s. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy are performed in the weld area to understand the microstructural and physical characteristics of the joint that may have been affected by the processing parameters.
