Abstract Surface exchange reactions and diffusion of oxygen in ceramic composites consisting of a dilute and random distribution of inclusions in a polycrystalline matrix (host phase) are modeled phenomenologically by employing the finite element method. The microstructure of the mixed conducting composite is described by means of a square grain model, including grain boundaries of the matrix and interphase boundaries between the inclusions and grains of the host phase. An instantaneous change of the oxygen partial pressure in the surrounding atmosphere may give rise to an oxygen exchange process, i.e., oxidation or reduction of the ceramic composite. Relaxation curves for the total amount of exchanged oxygen are calculated, emphasizing the role played by fast diffusion along the interfaces. The relaxation curves are interpreted in terms of effective medium diffusion, introducing appropriate equations for the effective diffusion coefficient and the effective surface exchange coefficient. When extremely fast diffusion along the grain and interphase boundaries is assumed, the re-equilibration process shows two different time constants. Analytical approximations for the relaxation process and relations for the separate relaxation times are provided for this limiting case as well as for blocking interphase boundaries. Furthermore, conductivity relaxation curves are calculated by coupling diffusion and dc conduction. In the case of effective medium diffusion, the conductivity relaxation curves do not deviate from those for the total amount of exchanged oxygen. On the contrary, the conductivity relaxation curves differ remarkably from the time dependence of the total amount of exchanged oxygen, when the different phases of the composite re-equilibrate with separate time constants.
