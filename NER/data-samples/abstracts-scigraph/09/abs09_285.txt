Abstract This work presents an experimental determination of residual stresses in 35CrMo4 (Euronorm) low alloyed steel substrates with thermally sprayed coatings. Two different materials were separately deposited. The first one consisted of a blend of two superalloys: Cr-Ni steel and Cr-Mn steel, designated 55E and 65E, respectively. The second material was molybdenum. In a first part, basic characteristics of the deposited layers (metallographic analysis, hardness, and adhesion) are presented. In a second part, the determination of the residual stresses, in both substrate and thermal sprayed layers is performed using an extensometric method in combination with a simultaneous progressive electrolytic polishing. The influence of a nickel-aluminum (80:20%) bond-coat and/or a post-annealing at 850 Â°C in air for 1 h is studied.
