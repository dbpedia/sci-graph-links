Summary (abstract) This paper describes the electron microscope morphology of gels of aluminium hydroxide and of aluminium oxide monohydrate BÃ¶hmite and the transformations which occur at room temperature during the aging of C-alpha gel prepared from ammonium alum. A mechanism for the morphological transformations during the aging of C-alpha gel and for the formation of somatoids is suggested.
