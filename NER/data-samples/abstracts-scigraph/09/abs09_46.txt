Abstract It is found that the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit of a material consisting of a large number of ball-shaped semiconductor or metal particles can be much more than unity. The introduction of an insulator into the space between the particles is shown to sharply increase the power of the converter of heat energy into electric current energy.
