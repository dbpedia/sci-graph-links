Abstract Let u be a weak solution of (−Δ) m u = f with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a smooth bounded domain Ω ⊂ R n . Then, the main goal of this paper is to prove the following a priori estimate: $$ \left\| u \right\|_{W_\omega ^{2m,p} (\Omega )} \leqslant C\left\| f \right\|_{L_\omega ^p (\Omega )} $$, where ω is a weight in the Muckenhoupt class A p .
