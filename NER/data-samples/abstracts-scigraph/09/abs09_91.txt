Conclusions 1.For alloys of the Al−Si−Cu system that bear a diminished iron content the optimum alloying combination is Ti+B+Cd, which increases the dispersity of the structure and elevates the properties due to the modifying action of the alloying elements.2.Microalloying of cast alloy AK11M5 with an alloying set of 0.17% Ti+0.04% B+0.15% Cd increases the strength by ≥25% with a simultaneous increase in the ductility.
