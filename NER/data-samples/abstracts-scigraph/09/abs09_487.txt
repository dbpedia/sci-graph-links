Abstract In this paper, a new zero-divisor graph $\overline{\G}(S)$ is defined and studied for a commutative semigroup $S$ with zero element. The properties and the structure of the graph are studied; for any complete graph and complete bipartite graph $G$, commutative semigroups $S$ are constructed such that the graph $G$ is isomorphic to $\overline{\G}(S)$.
