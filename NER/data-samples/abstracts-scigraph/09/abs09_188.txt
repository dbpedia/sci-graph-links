Abstract ObjectivesTo know the importance of CAD/CAM in the fabrication of implant retained prosthesis frameworkReview of the studies showing the fit of the implant prosthesis framework fabricated by CAD/CAM Discussion:Initially, CAD/CAM was used to fabricate implant components from titanium and titanium alloy. To date, CAD/CAM is the only way of producing implant components from high-strength ceramics such as densely sintered alumina and partially stabilized zirconia.The accuracy can be measured by vertical fit of CAD/CAM frameworks ranged from 1 to 27Î¼m which was significantly better than cast implant frameworks. In addition, a similar level of fit was observed for implant CAD/CAM frameworks produced from zirconia and titanium.CAD/CAM produces zirconia workpieces that require no subsequent alteration, unnecessary weakening is avoided. This ensures durability of the prosthesis. Maximal abutment and framework thickness is desirable and increases the fracture resistance. The risk of veneering ceramic fracture is expected to be minimized in the future by the continuously improving veneering strategies.In comparison to the lost wax/casting protocol, CAD/CAM is much simpler and requires less technical time and involvement. The whole CAD/CAM process is fully automated following the scanning step. Conclusion:CAD/CAM plays a key role in fabrication of implant prosthesis framework because of bypassing most of the laboratory works and manual handling. By using CAD/CAM frameworks, fixed partial or full-arch dental prostheses can be fabricated. Clinical significance:Application of CAD/CAM is cost effective as well as less chair-side adjustments required especially with prosthesis requiring frameworks.
