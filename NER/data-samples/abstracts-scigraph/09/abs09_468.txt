Abstract The effect of magnesium oxide on the phase composition of metallurgical slag is studied. Heterogeneity of the slag and its final melting point are shown to increase with MgO concentration. A model for the slag infiltration into a periclase refractory is considered. A nomogram is plotted to show the dependence of the depth of slag penetration on slag viscosity, contact angle, surface tension, pore radius, and molten slag-refractory contact time.
