Abstract The present study focuses on the proton-conducting polymer electrolytes; poly (N-vinyl pyrrolidone)–ammonium thiocyanate and poly (N-vinyl pyrrolidone)–ammonium acetate prepared by solution casting technique. The XRD analysis indicates the amorphous nature of the polymer electrolytes. The Raman spectra of the C=O vibration of pure polymer PVP at 1,663 cm−1 has been appeared as doublet in the polymer electrolytes. The introduction of this new peak in the salt-doped polymer electrolytes may be due to interaction of the cation with the polymer. The room temperature ionic conductivity σ 303κ has been found to be high, 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 for 80 mol% PVP–20 mol% NH4SCN and 1.5 × 10−6 S cm−1 for 75 mol% PVP–25 mol% CH3COONH4. The polymer electrolytes have been tested for their application in Zn–air battery.
