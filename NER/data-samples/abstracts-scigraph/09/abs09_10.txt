Abstract. We have studied a K3H(SO4)2 (KHS) crystal doped with Cr3+ ions by X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The spin Hamiltonian parameters, direction cosines and coordination of the Cr3+ impurity in the crystal matrices were determined at room temperature. The line width ΔH pp versus temperature and an external direct current electric field was measured. The line width anomaly of Cr3+ is compared with our earlier results for KHS:Mn2+ indicating the molecular mechanisms responsible for both anomalies in the 25–460 K temperature range.
