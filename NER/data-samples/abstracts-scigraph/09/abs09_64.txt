Abstract Copper–graphite composite materials in the range of 0–10 vol% of carbon phase were prepared from the mixture of copper and graphite powders by hot isostatic pressing. The microstructure, mechanical (tensile strength, elongation to fracture) and physical (electrical and thermal conductivity) properties of composite samples were investigated, and the cross-property connections were calculated. It was shown that electrical and thermal conductivity cross-property (Lorenz number) is almost constant and increases only slightly (no more than 10 % increase was observed). This implies that in the investigated composition range the Lorenz number of a copper–graphite composite system behaves according to Franz–Wiedemann law for pure metals at constant temperature. On the contrary, the conductivity to tensile strength cross-property connections showed significant linear increase (over 200 % in the investigated composition range) for both electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of composite materials. The cross-property connections of conductivity to the elongation to fracture exhibit a nonlinear dependence on the volume fraction of graphite.
