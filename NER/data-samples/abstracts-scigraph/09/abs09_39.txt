Summary 1.Tempering for four hours at 200–350°C (390–660°F) and for one hour at 275–350°C (525–660°F) greatly lowers the mechanical properties of previously hardened (i.e. solution treated) ML5. Articles of ML5-T4 (cooled in air after four hours at 415°C) tempered in one of the above ways must be rehardened to restore their properties to the original level.2.Heating for four hours at 20–175°C (70–350°F) and 400–415°C (750–780°F) and for one hour at 0–225°C (32–420°F) and 400–415°C has an insignificant effect on the mechanical properties of ML5-T4. Products subjected to these treatments have the same properties as after hardening and do not need further heat treatment.
