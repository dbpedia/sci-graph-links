Summary. The elastostatic problem of an edge cracked orthotropic strip is considered. The crack possesses a semi-infinite length. The crack surfaces are subjected to opening mode I fracture, by a concentrated force action, while the strip surfaces are traction free. Fourier transforms and asymptotic analyses are employed to reduce the problem to a first kind singular integral equation. The stress intensity factor is determined in a closed form expression. The effects of geometric and elastic characteristics of the strip on the values of the stress intensity factor are explained.
