Abstract The influence of calcination conditions on changes in phase composition and porous structure was studied for hydrous aluminium oxide, obtained by leaching out potassium salts from the products of roasting basic aluminium-potassium sulfate in hydrogen atmosphere at 600°C. The product of calcination at 350°C in vacuum has the most developed porous structure with most pores of internal radius within 10–60 Å. Calcination in air atmosphere at temperatures 700, 800, 900, or 1000°C resulted in decrease of specific surface of aluminium oxide and increase of the share of pores with internal radius above 60 Å in the overall porosity of the samples. The reconstruction of the porous structure proceeds mainly as a result of coalescent sintering.
