Abstract It is shown for (111) and (001) interfaces that at an identical degree of strain relaxation in semi-conductor epitaxial films, the ratio of distances D between neighboring dislocations is D (111)/D (001) = 1.5. This allows us to establish that dislocation interface (7 7 10) contains partial 90° Shockley dislocations lying in three directions of 〈110〉.
