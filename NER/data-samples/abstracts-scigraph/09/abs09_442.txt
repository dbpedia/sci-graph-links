Conclusions 1.A study was made of the contact phenomena occurring during the electromachining of the transition metals with some refractory compounds (carbides and borides). The relationships between tool electrode wear and the moduli of elasticity and thermal conductivities of materials machined are examined. It is shown that, as these parameters increase, the propensity toward seizure diminishes as a result of an increase in the strength of atomic bonds in the lattice and a fall in temperature in the contact zone.2.The correlation is analyzed between the wear of the tool electrode and the degree of localization of valence electrons in the material being machined. It is demonstrated that, with rise in the degree of localization, the propensity toward seizure decreases. The propensity toward seizure of tool electrode materials is a measure of their ability to yield electrons. For the carbides investigated, the order of donor capacities is WC> NbC> TiC. Titanium diboride occupies an intermediate position between niobium and titanium carbides.
