Abstract We propose a novel composite organic-inorganic coating in the form of a redox polymer film for protection of stainless steel against general corrosion in strong acid medium (2 M H2SO4). We utilize an anion exchange polymer, protonated poly(4-vinylpyridine), into which hexacyanoferrate anions have been introduced. Owing to the presence of Fe(CN)6 3−/4− at the interface formed by the film and the steel, a sparingly soluble metal hexacyanoferrate (mostly Prussian blue, PB) is formed as an overcoating on the steel’s surface, presumably on the passive (metal oxide) layer. The redox polymer film on the steel seems to act as a composite three-dimensional bilayer-type coating in which hexacyanoferrate(III,II) anions (that are capable of effective charge storage) exist in the outer portions of the film, whereas the inner PB layer improves the system’s overall adherence and stability. By analogy to a conducting polymer (e.g. polyaniline, polypyrrole), introduction of the redox polymer composite film leads to stabilization of the steel substrate’s potential within the passive range.
