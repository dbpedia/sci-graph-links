Abstract In the present study, the high-temperature deformation behavior of a cast and subsequently hot-isostatic pressed (HIPed) b-solidifying γ-TiAl-based alloy with a nominal composition of Ti-43.5Al-4Nb-1Mo-0.1B (in at.%), termed TNM alloy, is investigated. Isothermal compression tests on cylindrical specimens are carried out on a Gleeble 3500 simulator in order to investigate the dynamic recrystallization processes in the three-phase field region (α/α2+b/b0+γ−phase field) of the TNM alloy. The deformed microstructure along with the dynamically recrystallized grain size during hot deformation is examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two phenomenological-type constitutive models are presented and compared to experimental flow stress data.
