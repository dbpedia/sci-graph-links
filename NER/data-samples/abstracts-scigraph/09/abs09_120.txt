Abstract FT-IR-ATR (Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance) technique was used to measure the SiOH and SiH contents in the thermal oxide films grown on Si wafers. It was found that the SiOH groups in the bulk could be eliminated by low temperature annealing, whereas SiOH at the Si/SiO2 interface could only be removed by high temperature annealing. It was also found that gamma ray irradiation generated SiOH and SiH in the thin oxide film.
