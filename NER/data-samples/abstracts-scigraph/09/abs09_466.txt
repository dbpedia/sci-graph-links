Abstract Let n be a positive integer, and C n (r) the set of all n × n r-circulant matrices over the Boolean algebra B = {0, 1}, $$G_n = \bigcup\limits_{r = 0}^{n - 1} {C_n (r)} $$ . For any fixed r-circulant matrix C (C ≠ 0) in G n , we define an operation “*” in G n as follows: A * B = ACB for any A, B in G n , where ACB is the usual product of Boolean matrices. Then (G n , *) is a semigroup. We denote this semigroup by G n (C) and call it the sandwich semigroup of generalized circulant Boolean matrices with sandwich matrix C. Let F be an idempotent element in G n (C) and M(F) the maximal subgroup in G n (C) containing the idempotent element F. In this paper, the elements in M(F) are characterized and an algorithm to determine all the elements in M(F) is given.
