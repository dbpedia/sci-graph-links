Abstract â€‚Injection molding technology and its different modifications represent established processes for manufacturing polymer products with high accuracy in large scale production. Enhanced machine and tool technologies like evacuation units and special temperization systems have already been adapted to the molding of microstructures with high aspect ratios. Cycle times are actually in the range of minutes and depend on the geometry of the microstructures and the materials used. Based on injection molding of lost plastic microforms new processes for the manufacturing of ceramic or metal microstructures are being developed.
