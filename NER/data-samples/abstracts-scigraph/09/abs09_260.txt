Abstract The binary germanium—selenium system was investigated by differential thermal analysis; from the results a temperature-composition diagram was constructed. The existence of the two compounds GeSe and GeSe2 was confirmed. Furthermore, it could be shown that between 920±4 and 939±2 K GeSe transforms to a high-temperature modification which is slightly richer in selenium and decomposes peritectically at 948±2 K. On the germanium-rich side of the system a monotectic equilibrium exists at 1 177±2 K. Two thermal effects, one between 908 and 918 K, the other one at 851±3 K, were shown to be non-equilibrium effects. GeSe and GeSe2 form a eutectic at 856±2 K and 56.0±0.5 at% Se. The congruent melting point of GeSe2 was determined as 1 015±2 K. Between GeSe2 and Se another eutectic exists at 485±1 K and 94.5±0.5 at% Se.
