Summary The multiaxial MATMOD-4V model has been modified to enable the predictions of distorted small strain offset yield surfaces. This has been achieved by using a variable Hill-type anisotropy tensor, which modifies the yield function in the model. AllowingM ij to be a function of both the short and long range back stresses (the kinematic hardening variables in the model) results in an evolution of anisotropy during deformation. This improved model retains its capability to predict expansion and translation of the yield surface, as well as a wide variety of mechanical behaviors described previously ([1], [2]). The derivation of this model is presented here while examples of its behavior are given in part II of this paper [3].
