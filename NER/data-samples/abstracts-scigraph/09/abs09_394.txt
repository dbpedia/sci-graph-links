Abstract The high-temperature deformation behavior of AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel was studied by torsion tests. The deformation tests were performed in the temperature range of 900–1100°C and strain rate range of 5.0×10−2 −5.0/sec. The evolutions of flow stress and microstructure show the characteristics of continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX). The flow stress gradually decreased with strain over the peak stress without steady state. Below the 100% effective strain, grains appeared in small angle grain boundaries with a misorientation of 3–9°. In addition, when heavy deformation (>300%) was applied, higher misorientation (∼15°) was achieved. The tendency of CDRX increased with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature. The dependence of CDRX grain size on the strain rate and temperature was discussed.
