Conclusions 1.The temperature dependence of crack-resistance parameters for low-alloy steel 15KhSND has been determined in the operating temperature range (+20 to −80°C) by a procedure making it possible to use relatively thin specimens.2.The reliability of results obtained was confirmed by data for indirect determination of KIc by a method using fracture surface zone characteristics (combination of ductile and brittle zones) observed in specimens of the test steel close to the transitional temperature (0 to +20°C).
