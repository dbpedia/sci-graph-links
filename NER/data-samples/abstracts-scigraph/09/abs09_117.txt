Conclusions 1.We investigated and introduced in production a process of low-temperature carbonitriding for structural steels in triethanolamine without preliminary pyrolysis.2.The microhardness of the ɛ layer in different steels was HV20 800–950, with satisfactory brittleness (group 1).3.The best results were obtained with steels 20Kh, 18KhGT, 12KhN3A, 20, and 38KhMYuA.4.The optima parameters of the process are as follows: 600°, 6–7 h, 40–70 mm water column, and 60–80 drops/min of triethanolamine for alloy steels; 600° and 6 h for carbon and nickel steels.
