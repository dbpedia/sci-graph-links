Abstract In this letter we report a simple technique to produce volume holographic gratings based on photopolymerizable composites containing TiO2 nanoparticles. Diffraction gratings with high refractive index modulation amplitude (up to 1.25 × 10−2) have been formed due to the periodic distribution of high refractive index nanoparticles in a low refractive index polymer matrix. The diffraction efficiency increases strongly on increasing the nanoparticle concentration. Taking the mixture with 10 wt.% TiO2 nanoparticles, gratings with high diffraction efficiency, low level of scattering and high transparency in the visible-wavelength range have been obtained. This will ultimately lead to different applications of diffractive optical elements based on nanocomposites. The dependence of the gratings’ diffraction efficiency on the intensity of probe laser pulses at 1064 nm has been explored. It is shown that the nonlinear response of the gratings is attributed mainly to the nonlinear properties of the TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in the polymer matrix. The mechanism of the grating formation and the reasons for the nonlinear behavior of the diffraction efficiency are discussed.
