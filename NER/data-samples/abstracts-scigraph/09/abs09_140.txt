Conclusions 1.Data have been obtained on the influence exerted by low-temperature oxidation of porous titanium carbide specimens on the impregnation process of these specimens by liquid steels of various grades.2.It was demonstrated that complete impregnation of porous (63% porosity) titanium carbide specimens can only take place when their grain surface is oxidized to a weight-gain range of 0.0085â€“0.049 g/m2.3.During the reaction of liquid steel with porous carbide specimens subjected to low-temperature oxidation, the oxides on the carbide are reduced, presumably by the gaseous CO phase generated during the melting of steel under vacuum conditions, which activates the impregnation process.
