Abstract Thin films have been deposited in a low-pressure glow discharge of tetramethylsilane. The study of the deposition kinetics has shown that the determining parameter is the ratio W/PTMS of the RF power over the TMS partial pressure. The role of oxygenated impurities present in the starting monomer is emphasized. High values of the W/PTMS ratio give films of low oxygen content as shown by IR spectroscopy measurements (<5% of Si-O bonds). These films have high densities (ρ∼1.7–2 g/cm3) and refractive indices (1.7) and are similar to amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide films. On the contrary, low values of W/PTMS result in the formation of a significant amount of Si-O bonds which are formed at the expense of Si-H bonds. The deposited films show lower densities (0.98–1.6 g/cm3) and lower refractive indices (1.47). It is postulated that this oxygen, which affects the kinetics and the film properties, comes from oxygenated pollutants (H2O) carried along with the monomer, and that its concentration depends on the temperature of the TMS cooling bath.
