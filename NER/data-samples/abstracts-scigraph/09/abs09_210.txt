Summary A triple-axis neutron spectrometer was used to investigate the scattering function of a 15 M NaOD solution in D2O. The solute acts as an amorphising agent, so that both the liquid and amorphous phases could be studied by changing the temperature from 300 K to 77 K. The experiment was directed to the study of the collective excitations. A dispersion relation could be established in both phases in the momentum range 0.4≤Q≤2.4Å−1 that was investigated in the experiment, though at the higherQ values the excitation energy width was found to be comparable to the energy.
