Conclusions 1.With slow heating and a hold in the temperature range of primary recrystallization of ferrite (550–620°C) the process of dispersion (with redistribution) of the carbide phase, which includes solution of the cementite of the pearlite in the ferritic matrix in strain aging and subsequent uniform precipitation of fintely dispersed cementite particles in the volume of the ferritic matrix, occurs in cold rolled 08GSYuT steel, as the result of which a well-expressed ferritic-cementite structure is formed.2.A structure of colonies of coarse lamellar pearlite and structurally free cementite in a ferrite matrix is formed as the result of overheating above Ac1 in recrystallization annealing. As the result of the sufficient stability of the dispersed cementite toward solution in the ferritic matrix the ferritic-cementite structure is preserved with an insignificant degree of overheating and short (up to 5 h) holds at temperatures above the Ac1.3.An increase in the hold temperature in the first step of annealing to 620°C causes an increase in the stability of the dispersed cementite toward overheating and also some refinement of the ferritic grains after the full two-step recrystallization annealing cycle.4.Temperature-time cycles of bell-furnace annealing causing an increase in stability of the mechanical properties of 08GSYuT steel strip of different thicknesses have been developed and tested under production conditions.
