Abstract Nickel oxide (NiO) nanotubes for supercapacitors were synthesized by chemically depositing nickel hydroxide in anodic aluminum oxide templates and thermally annealing at 360 °C. The synthesized nanotubes have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The capacitive behavior of the NiO nanotubes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge experiment, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 6 M KOH. The electrochemical data demonstrate that the NiO nanotubes display good capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 266 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and excellent specific capacitance retention of ca. 93% after 1,000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, indicating that the NiO nanotubes can become promising electroactive materials for supercapacitor.
