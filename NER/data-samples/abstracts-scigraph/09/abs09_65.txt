Abstract We report on the crystal structures of two hydrates of benzenehexasulfonic acid, its water sorption isotherm, temperature- and humidity-dependent conductivity, along with 1H NMR studies. At comparable humidities and temperatures, this crystalline material shows conductivity similar to Nafion, which conducts protons via liquid water channels. We believe that the presented discovery of fast protonic conductivity in benzenehexasulfonic acid at low humidities is encouraging for further efforts in developing highly sulfonated polymers as membranes for fuel cells.
