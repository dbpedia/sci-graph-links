Abstract Iron oxides are considered as the promising pseudocapacitive materials for high-performance supercapacitors due to their high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost, environmental benignity, and natural abundance. In this work, we study capacitive behavior of different magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles/carbon black (CB) composites ratios. These composites are synthesized by the coprecipitation method in the presence of ultrasonic waves. The structural and morphological characteristics of the magnetite/CB composites are investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The electrochemical performance of magnetite/CB composite electrodes is tested by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge in a Na2SO4 electrolyte. The results indicate that the magnetite/CB electrodes show typical pseudo-capacitive behavior in Na2SO4 solution. Moreover, in comparison to the pure Fe3O4 (37 F g−1) and carbon black (23 F g−1), the as-prepared 45 % magnetite/CB nanocomposite electrode shows a higher specific capacitance (300 F g−1). Additionally, the supercapacitor device of the magnetite/CB nanocomposite exhibits excellent long cycle life along with 98.5 % specific capacitance retained after 10,000 cycle tests.
