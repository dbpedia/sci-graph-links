Conclusions 1.Plastic deformation of austenite during HTTMT shifts the isothermal transformation curves to the left and reduces the hardenability of steel.2.A method was proposed for plotting a calibration curve in order to determine the relationship between the hardenability of steel after HTTMT and after standard quenching.3.A calibration curve was plotted and an empirical equation was obtained making it possible to determine the standard end-quench hardenability of alloy structural steels with a high carbon content (0.50–0.70% C) after HTTMT under the following conditions: TAust.=900–1000°, TDeform.=850–950°, ε=20–30%.
