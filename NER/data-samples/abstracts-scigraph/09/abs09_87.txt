Abstract The diffusion-dependent component of the thermo-emf of ordered binary alloys was calculated. It was shown that the temperature dependence of Q is given by the ratio of elastic scattering to phonon scattering and by the change which occurs in the electron spectrum upon the development of order. When the Fermi surface is situated near the boundary of a superband, Q changes abnormally in the range of the temperatures of the order-disorder transition.
