Abstract We report the synthesis and characterization of Carbon and CdTe quantum dots (QDs), as well as the observed improvement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of photovoltaic devices upon the incorporation of the synthesized aforementioned nanostructures. Even though C quantum dots were observed to have a relatively smaller influence on solar cell performance, they are considered to be a more attractive option due to their affordability and minimal impact in the environment that could ultimately promote their widespread utilization on photovoltaic structures.
