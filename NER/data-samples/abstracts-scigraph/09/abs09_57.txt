Abstract The thickness uniformity and the cross-sectional profiles of electroplated individual nickel microstructures were investigated in given electroplating conditions. The main factors influencing the thickness uniformity of microstructures were discussed. An effective method to overcome the burning problem by increasing the sacrifice seed layer structure is proposed. It is shown that the thickness uniformity and the cross-sectional profiles of the microstructures can be controlled by changing the process conditions. The current crowding observed in patterned specimens is responsible for the saddle shape profile of individual microstructures, while the combination of the current crowding and the cathodic polarizability are believed to be responsible for the abnormal cap-like profile of individual microstructures. A uniform thickness distribution and microstructures with flat profiles were obtained at optimal plating conditions of 8.05 mA/cm2 and 20°C.
