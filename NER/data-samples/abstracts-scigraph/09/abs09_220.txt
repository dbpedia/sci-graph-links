Abstract A micro hot wire anemometer sensor has been constructed. The process consists in depositing a thin doped polycrystalline silicon layer on silicon substrate, using a micro-machined technique. This paper discusses the reliability and the fabrication flaws of this sensor. The different steps of fabrication are oxidation, deposit, photolithography, chemical attack, ionic implantation and annealing. An additional step, allowing the release of the suspended structures, is added. With each technological process step, a certain number of problems can be met. Each of these problems can potentially give rise to a defect of the final structure. Various tests are carried out on the final structure to make a first approach of the micro flow sensor flaws.
