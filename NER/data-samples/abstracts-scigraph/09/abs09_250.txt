Abstract This paper illustrates both thermal and mechanical analysis methods for displacement and contact force calculating of a novel sensing silicon-polymer microgripper when heat sources are applied by an electric current via its actuators. Thermal analysis is used to obtain temperature profile by figuring out a heat conductions and convections model. Temperature profile is then applied into the mechanical structure of the gripper’s actuators to form the final equation of displacement and contact force of the jaws. Finally, the comparison among the calculation, simulation and actual measurement concludes that materialization methods are appropriate. Achieving the final equation of gripper’s jaws displacement and contact force is a major step to optimize or reform this novel structure for different sizes to meet specific applications.
