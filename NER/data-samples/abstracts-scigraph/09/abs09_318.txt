Abstract A new bonding process has been developed for polymer microstructures, especially of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which avoids the problems caused by using adhesives or solvents or applying high temperatures. It is based on photodegradation of polymers. Moulded PMMA microchannels and microspectrometer reflective gratings were covered with PMMA plates by ultraviolet irradiation of the joining faces and subsequent welding at low temperatures. Because of the low thermal load, even structures in the range of only some few micrometers and structure details in the submicron range remain dimensionally stable during the bonding process.
