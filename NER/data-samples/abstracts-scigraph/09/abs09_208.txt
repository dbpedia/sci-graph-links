Abstract To suppress the volume change of silicon and enhance the conductivity of the electrodes, nano-Si@SiOx@C composites with different carbon content are synthesized, in which nano-Si is embedded in SiOx matrix and coated by pyrolyzed C. Among the as-prepared composites, nano-Si@SiOx@22.45 wt%C exhibits the best comprehensive electrochemical performance, which delivers a first reversible capacity of 1184 mAh g−1 with capacity retention of 93% after 150 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Moreover, it also shows good rate capability. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the special structure and rational composition of the composite, in which the combination of a modest amount of coating carbon and SiOx matrix not only effectively mitigates the volume effect of nano-Si particles but also guarantees a high reversible capacity.
