Conclusions 1.A correlation was established between the corrosion fatigue strength and resistance to eavitation in chrome steels with an unstable austenite structure.2.In the austenitic chrome steel series, steel 160Kh12M shows maximum resistance to cavitation and corrosion fatigue strength.3.Preliminary deformation by reduction of unstable austenite at 450 Â°C helps to increase the resistance of steel 160Kh12M to cavitation.
