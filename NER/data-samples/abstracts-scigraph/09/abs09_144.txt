Abstract Zirconium oxide (zirconia) powder has been synthesized by co-precipitation method. The structural characterization of prepared sample was obtained by X-ray diffraction and showed monoclinic phase. Further surface morphology was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The frequency dependence of dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and impedance of the sample was investigated at room temperature. The obtained results partially motivated for alternative silicon based on devices.
