Abstract This paper describes a theoretical model that predicts the metal ion concentration distribution during electroforming high aspect ratio microstructures (HARM). The applied current density and microstructure aspect ratio were found as two important factors that affect the electroforming outcome. The analytical results are verified using experiments that electroforming microstructural posts with an aspect ratio of 10. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental and analytical solutions. Based on the ion concentration analytical prediction on the cathode surface, one can estimate the electroforming time required for fabricating a microstructure for a given aspect ratio.
