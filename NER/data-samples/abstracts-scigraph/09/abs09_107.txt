Abstract The eddy-current parameter f 0 has been studied as a function of temperature and aging time for the N32T3 Invar. Two initial states have been involved: those after quenching and after cold plastic deformation. The rise in the temperature and time of aging reduces the parameter f 0 owing to the transition of the Invar from the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state because the oversaturated solid solution decays, and the austenite is depleted of nickel. The parameter f 0 drops monotonically with the applied strain. In the strained Invar the decay of the oversaturated solid solution reduces f 0 in the temperature interval of 400 to 600Â°C.
