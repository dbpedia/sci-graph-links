Summary The determination of niobium at levels of 0.02% and above is required in certain types of stainless steels and niobium stabilized steels. A method has been developed for the determination of microgram amounts of niobium in stainless steels with the reagent 5-chloro-8-hydroxy-7-iodoquinoline in citric acid medium. The effects of heating time, pH, reagent concentration and other variables have been studied. The system obeyes Beer's law over the concentration range investigated. The optimum concentration range for measurements in 10-mm cells is 1.0–10.0μg of niobium ml−1. The molar absorptivity of the complex is 5.143 x 103l·moli−1·cm−1. The interferences from foreign ions have been evaluated. The stoichiometry of the complex ML2 (metal:ligand) was confirmed by Job's continuous variations and mole ratio methods.
