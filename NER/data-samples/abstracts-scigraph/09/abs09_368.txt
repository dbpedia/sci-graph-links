Abstract A 12-experiment Plackett-Burman screening design was used to evaluate two hydroxy functional fluorocarbon resins as components for cycloaliphatic epoxy-based cationic UV-curable formulations. The effects of six formulation variables were studied: fluoropolymer resin type, ratio of fluoropolymer resin to cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, anion of the photoinitiator, structure of the cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, photoinitiator level, and use of a thermal post cure. Physical properties (tensile strength, elongation, modulus, glass transition temperature (Tg), equilibrium modulus), yellowing after QUV exposure, water sensitivity, and coefficient of friction values for the 12 formulations were measured. The relationships between the formulation variables and the coating/film properties are discussed.
