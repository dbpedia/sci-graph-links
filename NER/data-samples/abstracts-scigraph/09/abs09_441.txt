Abstract Machining of aerospace and biomedical grade titanium alloys has always been a challenge because of their low conductivity and elastic modulus. Different machining methods and parameters have been adopted for high precision machining of titanium alloys. Machining of titanium alloys can be improved by microstructure optimization. The present study focuses on the effect of microstructure on machinability of Ti6Al4V alloys at different cutting speeds. Samples were subjected to different annealing conditions resulting in different grain sizes and local micro-strains (misorientation). Cutting forces were significantly reduced after annealing; consequently, sub-surface residual stresses were reduced. Deformation twinning was also observed on samples annealed at a higher temperature due to larger grain size. Initial strain free grains and deformation twinning during machining reduces the cutting force at higher cutting speed.
