Conclusions 1.Failure of glassmaking plant (GMP) is of intergranular nature and may set in the base metal as well as in the zone of welded joints.2.The process of operation entails recrystallization of the material of GMP with the formation of coarse grains with broad and loose boundaries.3.Crack nucleation and the onset of failure of the alloy PℓRdPdIZℓ 20-10-1-0,1, from which GMP is made, are connected with the simultaneous diffusion of substitutional and interstitial impurities to the grain boundaries and along them, with the reactive diffusion of these elements entailing the formation of phases differing from the matrix in composition, volume, and mechanical properties (eutectics, various kinds of impurities, etc.).
