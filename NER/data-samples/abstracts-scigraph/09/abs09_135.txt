Summary Following the theory of linear piezoelectricity, we consider the problem of determining the singular stress and electric fields in an orthotropic piezoelectric ceramic strip containing a Griffith crack under longitudinal shear. The crack is situated symmetrically and oriented in a direction parallel to the edges of the strip. Fourier transforms are used to reduce the problem to the solution of a pair of dual integral equations. The solution of the dual integral equations is then expressed in terms of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Numerical values on the stress intensity factor and the energy release rate for piezoelectric ceramics are obtained, and the results are graphed to display the influence of the electric field.
