Abstract The influence of nanodimensional carbon additives on the structural-phase state and properties of sintered alloys on copper, iron, and tungsten–cobalt bases is considered. It is shown that the undissolved part of the nanodimensional additive can serve as additional nucleation centers of crystals during liquid-phase sintering and crystallization of powder compositions, which promotes structure refining. It is established that the nanodimensional diamond–graphite additive in alloys able to form solid solutions with carbon or strengthening carbide phases leads to an increase in hardness of sintered composites and an improvement in their tribotechnical properties.
