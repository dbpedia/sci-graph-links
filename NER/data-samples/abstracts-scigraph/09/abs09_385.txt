Summary The buffering power is the most important characteristic of the buffer solution. This paper presents a new concept “integral capacity of buffer” which is defined as $$\Delta = \int\limits_{(pH)_0 }^{(pH)_1 } {\beta d} $$ pH. The generalized expressions relating the integral capacity with the acidity or with buffer ratio have been derived for HA-A systems. The calculations involved and brief discussions are given.
