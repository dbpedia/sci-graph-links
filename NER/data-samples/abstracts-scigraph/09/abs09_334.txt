Abstract The effect of the sintering temperature (1100–1400°C) of NiAl alloy samples with oxide Y2O3 produced by hydrostatic pressing on their structure and phase composition and the distribution of oxide particles in a NiAl-based intermetallic matrix alloyed with ∼0.5 at % Fe is considered. It is found that dispersed oxide particles in the compact material prepared from a mixture of oxide Y2O3 powder and a NiAl alloy (produced by calcium hydride reduction of a mixture of nickel and aluminum oxides) powder in a standard ball mill are nonuniformly distributed in the volume. The morphology of oxides changes during sintering: sintered samples contain rounded particles, which differ strongly from the clearly faceted angular particles of oxide Y2O3 added to a mixture (they represent conglomerates of single crystals). In the sintered samples, large aggregates of oxides are revealed along grain boundaries. Mass transfer is possible at the NiAl/Y2O3 interface in the system: it leads to partial substitution of aluminum and/or iron atoms for yttrium atoms in the Y2O3 lattice and to the formation of submicroscopic particles of (Fe,Al)5Y3O12-type oxides.
