Abstract Results of a study of long-term strength of alloy ZhS6U after deposition of strengthening coatings from seven nickel alloys of the Ni-Co-W-Mo-Cr-Al (Ta, Re, Nb, Ti) system, chromium or titanium carbides, and of an additional external refractory SDP-2 coating of the Ni-Cr-Al-Y system common for all the compositions are presented. The structure and the element composition of the coatings in the initial state and after testing for high-temperature strength are studied.
