Abstract The behavior of flat droplets of magnetic liquid with spontaneously magnetized aggregates in alternating magnetic field is studied. The droplet is found to commence rotatory movement in a certain range of external magnetic fields. It is proposed that this effect is caused by arising synchronization of movements of the magnetized aggregates present in the magnetic liquid.
