Abstract A mechanism of stress relaxation in metastable alloys is considered. It is demonstrated that structural transformations during a relaxation test lead to anomalously high stress relaxation. Two stages of structural relaxation are revealed: formation of defect-free channels and decomposition of a solid solution. A new method of program hardening of metastable alloys based on the structural relaxation processes is suggested.
