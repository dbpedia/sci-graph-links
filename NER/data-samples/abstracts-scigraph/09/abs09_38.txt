Abstract Chromomagnetic fields are studied using linear response theory. We show that the spurious pole at |k|â‰ˆg 2 T of the static transverse gluon propagator at finite temperature is cancelled, when the full magnetic permeability function is calculated toO(g 2). Consequently the chromomagnetic fields induced by static external perturbations behave regularly and, to this order, similarly to magnetic fields in QED. We further discuss the relevance of this cancellation for perturbative calculations.
