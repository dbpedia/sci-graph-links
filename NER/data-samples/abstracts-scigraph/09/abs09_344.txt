Conclusions The main reason for the increase in the red hardness and cutting properties of cobalt high-speed steel is that cobalt, in the α solid solution, changes the properties of the solid solution—increases the binding strength, reduces the grain boundary energy and the diffusion mobility of tungsten and carbon-and as the result the rate of softening of martensite is slowed down (the red hardness increases). Cobalt has no effect on the diffusion of carbon in austenite, but at temperatures, below 950°C it increases the diffusion coefficient of tungsten, and therefore during tempering cobalt promotes acceleration of the transformation of residual austenite.
