Abstract The possibilities of significant reduction of the critical energy of initiation of detonation in sprays of liquid hydrocarbon fuel in air are demonstrated experimentally. The structure developed for the purpose includes a tube of near-limiting diameter and a combination of Shchelkin spiral, tube coils, and reducing cones for transitioning a detonation wave to a tube of large diameter.
