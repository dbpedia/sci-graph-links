Abstract The boundary element method (BEM) is presented for elastoplastic analysis of cracks between two dissimilar materials. The boundary integral equations and integral representation of stress rates are written in such a form that all integrals can be evaluated by the regular Gaussian quadrature rule. An advanced multidomain BEM formulation is suggested for the solution of analysed problems where the substantial reduction of stiffness matrix is observed. The elastoplastic behaviour is modelled through the use of an approximation for the plastic component of the stresses. The boundary and the yielding zone are discretized by elements with quadratic approximations. In numerical examples the path independence of the J- and L-integrals for a straight interface crack and a circular arc-shaped interface crack are investigated, respectively. The influence of the different values of Young's modulus on the J-integral, shape and size of plastic zones is treated too.
