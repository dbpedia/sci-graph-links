Abstract Organic compounds become promising candidates for cathodes of rechargeable lithium battery (RLB) due to the high theoretical capacity and improved safety. However, they exhibit low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolyte, which leads to the low utilization of active materials and poor cycling stability of RLBs. Here, we synthesize a novel composite of activated hierarchical porous carbon supporting poly(1,5-diamino-anthraquinone) (aHPC@PDAA), using Ce(SO4)2 as oxidant and naphthalenesulfonic acid (NSA) as soft template for PDAA. The as-synthesized composite exhibits uniformly nanoporous structure with nano-sized PDAA particles distributed homogenously inside and outside of pores. The aHPC@PDAA cathode for RLBs achieves high electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity as much as 250 mAh g−1 at the current density of 100 mA g−1, which still maintains 176 mAh g−1 after 2000 charging-discharging cycles.
