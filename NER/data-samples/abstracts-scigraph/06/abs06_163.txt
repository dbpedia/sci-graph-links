Abstract The impact of parasites on host population dynamics depends on local abundance of the parasites, which may vary considerably across spatial scales. In sand hopper populations, mermithid parasites have major impacts on host dynamics, which may vary among spatially separated populations due to the sand hopperâ€™s wide, patchy distribution. The present study compared the abundance and biomass of a mermithid parasite (Thaumamermis zealandica Poinar et al., 2002) in sand hoppers (Bellorchestia quoyana (Milne-Edwards)) both within and among disconnected beaches. In addition, several variables were measured and tested as potentially important predictors of the parasite abundance and biomass. It was found that geographic isolation may only be responsible for minor differences in parasite populations compared with other factors. Host size was identified as the most important predictor of mermithid parasite abundance, but epibiont abundance, kelp patch mass and host density were poor predictors of abundance. These factors were also poor predictors of parasite biomass in hosts. This study further supports the notion that studies aiming to elucidate population dynamics or patterns should sample thoroughly across both spatial and temporal scales.
