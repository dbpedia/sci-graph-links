Abstract Protoplasts were isolated from leaves of axenic shoot cultures of Felicia bergeriana (Kingfisher Daisy) and Brachycome iberidifolia (Swan River Daisy) and from callus cultures of Felicia. Plants were regenerated from all three sources and since both species are of ornamental value (blue flowered) the establishment of plant regeneration provides a basis for their incorporation in somatic hybridisation programmes involving important ornamentals such as Chrysanthemum.
