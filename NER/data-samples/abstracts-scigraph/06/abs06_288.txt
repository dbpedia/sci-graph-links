Abstract Using column and thin layer chromatography, plasma hydrolysis of leu-enkephalin has been studied in man and several laboratory animals. The hydrolysis kinetics determined in the various species examined are considerably different. In addition, also the enzyme forms evidentiated, their molecular weight distribution and relative ratios have been found to vary greatly in the animals under test. Our data suggest that the widely different hydrolysis kinetics reported by various authors are attributable to the differences between species, rather than to differences in the analytical techniques employed.
