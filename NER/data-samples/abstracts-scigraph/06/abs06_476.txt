Abstract Culture experiments involving 23 algae strains were conducted to evaluate the algicidal effects of a newly developed algicidal thiazolidinedione (TD) derivative (TD49) on non-harmful and harmful algal bloom (HAB) species. We also assessed the effect of various concentrations of TD49 on various growth phases (lag, logarithmic, and stationary) of the harmful algae Heterocapsa circularisquama (Dinophyceae) and Heterosigma akashiwo (Raphidophyceae; hereafter, Heterosigma) and the non-harmful diatoms Skeletonema costatum and Chaetoceros didymus. The inhibitory ratios (%) for H. circularisquama and Heterosigma at 2.0 μM TD49 were significantly higher than those at other concentrations, and the inhibitory ratio varied depending on growth phase and species as follows: logarithmic ≥ stationary > lag phase for H. circularisquama and logarithmic ≥ lag > stationary phase for Heterosigma. Although the inhibitory ratios for C. didymus were similar to those for the two harmful algae (H. circularisquama and Heterosigma), inhibitory effects on S. costatum were not apparent at >2.0 μM in any growth phase. The algicidal activity of TD49 on the harmful and non-harmful algae was as follows: unarmored HAB species > armored HAB species > diatom species > cryptophyte species. TD49 was algicidal to most HABs but had a little inhibitory effect on some non-harmful algae, implying that TD49 has selective algicidal activity. Our results indicate that TD49 is potentially of use in the control of HAB species within semi-enclosed bays.
