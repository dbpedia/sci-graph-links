Abstract This study evaluated the effects of environmental and biological variables on the toxicity (LC50) of mercuric chloride on the fish Notopterus notopterus. The results reveal that the change in temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and fish size in experiments is highly significant both at 1 and 5% levels except in size, where it is insignificant at 1% level.
