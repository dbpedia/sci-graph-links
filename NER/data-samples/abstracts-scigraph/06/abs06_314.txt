Summary The relationship between the food selection of four leaf beetle species (Phratora vitellinae, Plagiodera versicolora, Lochmaea capreae, Galerucella lineola) and the phenolic glycosides of willow (Salix spp.) leaves was tested in laboratory food choice experiments. Four willow species native to the study area (Eastern Finland) and four introduced, cultivated willows were tested. The willow species exhibited profound differences in their phenolic glycoside composition and total concentration. The food selection patterns of the leaf beetles followed closely the phenolic glycoside spectra of the willow species. Both the total amount and the composition of phenolic glycosides affected the feeding by the beetles. Phenolic glycosides apparently have both stimulatory and inhibitory influences on leaf beetle feeding depending on the degree of adaptation of a particular insect. Very rare glycosides or exceptional combination of several glycoside types seem to provide certain willow species with high level of resistance against most herbivorous insects. Analogously the average absolute amount of leaf beetle feeding was lower on the introduced willows than on the native species to which the local herbivores have a good opportunity to become adapted.
