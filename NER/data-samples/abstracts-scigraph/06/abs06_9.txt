Summary Some immunological and physiological properties of insulin preparations from a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate species have been compared with those of crystalline ox and cod insulin, and the yields of insulin from several of these islet preparations are given. — Highly potent guinea pig and horse antisera to ox insulin were unable to provoke hyperglycaemia in the marine TeleostCottus scorpius (the sculpin) and in the CyclostomeMyxine glutinosa (the hagfish), respectively. — Crystalline ox and cod insulin provoked hypoglycaemia and death in both the sculpin and the hagfish, but only after large doses and several days' observation time. These findings contrast with the ease and fair rapidity of eliciting a hypoglycaemic response in the hagfish when the hagfish's own insulin was used. No marked quantitative differences were noted between the effects of ox, cod, and sculpin insulins in the sculpin, neither between ox and cod insulin in the hagfish. — The results indicate a species-specificity of insulin, both immunologically and hormonally.
