Abstract The Delaware Bay contains the world’s largest population of horseshoe crabs, which constitute an ecologically significant component of this estuarine ecosystem. The North Atlantic speciesLimulus polyphemus has an extensive geographical distribution, ranging from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent assessments of the Delaware Bay population based on beach spawning and trawling data have suggested a considerable decrease in the number of adult animals since 1990. Considerable debate has centered on the accuracy of these estimates and their impact on marine fisheries management planning. Compounding this problem is the lack of information concerning the genetic structure of Atlantic horseshoe crab populations. This study assessed patterns of genetic variation within and between the horseshoe crab populations of Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay, using both Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and DNA sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). We examined 41 animals from Delaware Bay and 14 animals from the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. To provide high quality, uncontaminated genomic DNA for RAPD analysis, DNA was isolated from hemocytes by direct cardiac puncture, purified by spin column chromatography, and quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis. RAPD fingerprints revealed a relative paucity of polymorphic fragments, with generally homogeneous banding patterns both within and between populations. DNA sequence analysis of 515 bases of the 5′ portion of the mitochondrial COI gene showed haplotype diversity in the Chesapeake Bay sample to be significantly higher than in the Delaware Bay sample, despite the larger size of the latter. Haplotype analysis indicates minimal contemporary gene flow between Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay crab populations, and further suggests that the Delaware Bay population is recovering from a recent population decline.
