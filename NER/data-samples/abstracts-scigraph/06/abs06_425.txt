Abstract Crowding effect in natural populations of three species ofSargassum, subtidal marine macrophytic algae, was investigated by harvesting all plants within a 1×1 m or 0.5×0.5m quadrat located at depths of 3–5m in Tanabe Bay (33°41′N and 135°20′E).Sargassum populations conformed to the same 3/2 power law that holds in many terrestrial plant populations.
