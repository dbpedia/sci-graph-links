Abstract Daily commercial catches, school sizes and school densities of larval anchovy, and oceanographic and meteorological variables for the fishing seasons (January to June) from 1988 to 1990 were analyzed by means of principal component analysis to identify causative factors for the aggregation and abundance of larval anchovy, which make up the grounds in the coastal waters of southwest Taiwan. The results suggested that the primary factors associated with the formation of fishing grounds were surface water temperature that related to the occurrence of Engraulis japonicus, surface water salinity that was affected by influex of offshore water and river discharge, and phosphate content and solar radiation that affected plankton production.
