Abstract Two freshwater ponds were studied periodically from April 1970 to January 1971. Both ponds, one permanent (pond 1) and the other temporary (pond 2) are located on the western Maryland shore of upper Chesapeake Bay. The temporary pond became dry in mid-September and remained so until late november. Free carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, and hardness fluctuated irregularly throughout the study. In August the pH in the permanent pond decreased greatly with little subsequent recovery. After pond 2 again contained water, hardness increased to over 400% of values before drying. Lists of aquatic flowering plants were prepared for both ponds. Each pond contained a distinct assemblage of zooplankters probably influenced by the amount of aquatic vegetation present. Total zooplankton species numbers in each pond were almost equal, but the temporary pond contained greater quantities of zooplankton. Two generations per year ofD. sanguineus were found in pond 2. Eubranchipus vernalis (Verrill) andE. holmani (Ryder) were found in December in pond 2; the general life cycle of these anostracans is briefly outlined. A congeneric occurrence of two calanoid copepodsDiaptomus birgei Marsh andD. sanguineus Forbes was found in May in temporary pond 2. Both are of the same subgenus (Onychodiaptomus Light). Various causes and mechanisms explaining congeneric occurrences are briefly reviewed. Slight size differences, insufficient time due to several factors discussed for competitive exclusion to operate to completion, and partial seasonal separation appear to best explain the present co-occurrence.
