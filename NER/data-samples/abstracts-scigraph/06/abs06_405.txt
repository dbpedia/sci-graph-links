Summary Morphological and geochemical comparisons between modern cryptic microbialites from Lizard Island/Great Barrier Reef and fossil counterparts in the Upper Jurassic (Southern Germany, Dobrogea/Romania) and late Lower Cretaceous (Aptian/Albian from Cantabria/Spain) spongiolitic environments show that there are common factors controlling the crust formations mostly independent of light despite of diverging (paleo-) oceanographic positions as well as relationships of competitors. Factors such as increased alkalinity, oligotrophy, and reduced allochthonous deposition are of major importance. Thrombolitic microbialites are interpreted as biologically induced and therefore calcified in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding sea water. Corresponding with shallowing upward cycles, microbial mats which produce stromatolitic peloidal crusts become more important. Different biomarkers are introduced for the first time extracted and analyzed from spongiolitic limestones of Lower Kimmeridgian age from Southern Germany.
