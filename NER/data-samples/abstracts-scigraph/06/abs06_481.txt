Abstract Perfluorinated organic compounds (PFCs) such as PFOS, PFOA, PFBS, PFH×S, PFOSA and PFDoA were determined in river water, river sediment, liver of market fish and liver of wildlife samples from Japan. Concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in water samples were 7.9–110 and <5.2–10 ng/L. Only PFOA were detected in sediment from Kyoto river at 1.3–3.9 ng/g dry wt. Among fish, only jack mackerel showed PFOA and PFOS at 10 and 1.6 ng/g wet wt. Wildlife liver contained PFOSA, PFOS, PFDoA, PFOA and PFH×S in the range of 0.31–362, 0.15–238, <0.03–28, >0.07–7.3 and <0.03–1.5, respectively, on ng/g wet wt. Cormorants showed maximum accumulation followed by eagle, raccoon dog and large-billed crow.
