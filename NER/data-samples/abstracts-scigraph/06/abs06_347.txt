Abstract We used an isotopic approach to investigate the intra- and interspecific differences in spatial and trophic ecology of three species of the fur seal genus Arctocephalus that inhabit distinct climatic zones: subtropical (A. australis n = 22), subantarctic (A. tropicalis n = 8), and polar (A. gazella n = 10). We obtained sequential δ 13C and δ 15N values in dentine from canine teeth of specimens found along the southern Brazilian coast. We calculated isotopic niches where axes were used as a surrogate for trophic (δ 15N) and spatial (δ 13C) dimensions of the ecological niche. Further, we adjusted generalized additive mixed models to chronological data of δ 13C and δ 15N to investigate the ontogenetic variation of the isotopic niche. The three species showed significant segregation in both spatial and the trophic dimensions as a result of foraging at different latitudes. Within A. australis, males occupied higher trophic positions than females. Furthermore, some isotopic niche overlap was found between sexes in A. tropicalis and A. gazella, though sample sizes preclude conclusive interpretation. Marked ontogenetic variation in the isotopic niche, especially in the early years, was observed in all species. Isotopic niche suggest that intra- and interspecific competition in these otariids is minimized by different degrees of spatial and trophic segregation.
