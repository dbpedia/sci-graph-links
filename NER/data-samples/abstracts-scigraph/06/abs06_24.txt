Abstract Bones contain the majority of body lipid in some marine fish. In the sheepshead wrasse Pimelometopon pulchrum and the sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, the bone lipid comprised 79 to 93% and 52 to 82% of the total body lipid, respectively. The senorita Oxyjulus california, another species of wrasse, has only 14% of its body lipid in bone. To determine whether dietary lipid is deposited quickly in the bone lipid, three species of fish were fed 1-14C-palmitic acid. Radioactivity appeared in the bone lipid as soon as 12 h after feeding, with the species rich in bone lipid incorporating the highest activity relative to the flesh. Roughly 80% of the radioactivity recovered in A. fimbria bone lipid was found in triglyceride. Radioactivity was equally distributed between phospholipid and triglyceride in P. pulchrum bone lipids. The results suggest that in some marine fish the bones contain the majority of the organism's reserve energy.
