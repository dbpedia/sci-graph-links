Abstract Abstract  The biology of two important lepidopterous pests, Prays oleae Bernard and Palpita unionalis Hübner, was studied. The target pests were reared on olive plants, Oleae europaea L. (Oleaceae) under laboratory conditions for two successive generations, from March to June 2002. For P. oleae, the duration of larval stage development in the first generation was 21.4 ± 0.18 days at 19.3–20.9 °C, 65–68 % R.H, while in the second generation it was 14.8 ± 0.10 days at 20.8–24.2 °C, 65–69 % R.H. The number of eggs laid per female ranged from 58 to 109 eggs in the first generation, and from 47 to 113 in the second. The larval stage duration of P. unionalis was 16.3 ± 0.12 days at 16.8–22.9 °C, 65–69 % R.H. and 15.5 ± 0.12 days at 21.6–25.5 °C, 66–69 % R.H. for the first and second generations, respectively. Also, the number of eggs laid per female ranged from 630 to 653 eggs, and from 425 to 493 eggs in the second generation under the same previous laboratory conditions. P. oleae laid eggs at night mostly singly on flower-buds, more on the calyx. than on the petals. The larvae mined on leaves and damaged groups of flowers. P. unionalis adults were active at night, laid eggs singly at twilight usually on the lower surface of foliage. Larvae fed on leaves spinning several leaves together to form shelter for the pupa.
