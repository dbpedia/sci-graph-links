Abstract Foraminiferal assemblages has been studied in three regions of the Mekong Delta subjected to different environmental characteristics: the Tra Vinh province, in the middle part of the Delta, under high freshwater influence; the Ca Mau peninsula, to the south, under maximum marine influence; and the Can Gio region, in the northern part of the Delta, with intermediate conditions. Intensive Rice–Shrimp Farming System is developing in these regions. Foraminiferal assemblages show the prevalence of the Mekong’s water pressure. Marine influence is strong only at a few stations along the shoreline, mainly in the Can Gio region. The rarity of allochthonous coastal species, in all the samples except one, suggests that up-river transport and settlement of foraminifera and sediment is significant only in the major channels. On a local level, foraminiferal assemblages provide a variety of information on environmental conditions. In a tidal channel of the Tra Vinh province, they suggest that lower reaches are more impacted by pollution than upper reaches; in the Ca Mau peninsula, under marine influence, low density and dominance of agglutinated species indicate the impact of deforestation and extension of acid sulfate soils; in shrimp pools, foraminifera may be used as indicators of the degradation of local conditions, in relation with accumulation of organic matter. The distribution of foraminiferal assemblages described in this study should be used as part of a reference point for further observations with a view to assessing environmental impacts of increasing human activities and/or climatic change.
