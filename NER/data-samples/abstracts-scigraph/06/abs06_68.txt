Abstract Samples of small rodent populations inhabiting Crabapple Island on Beldany Lake in NE Poland revealed that Clethrionomys glareolus was continously present there, whereas Apodemus flavicollis and Microtus agrestis appeared, stayed for some period, vanished and reappeared. It appears that sexually mature females of the bank vole are strictly territorial, their numbers are limited, and immature individuals hardly disperse at high population size. Sexually mature females of the yellow-necked mouse seem to be territorial only at low population numbers, and their numbers increase linearly with population size. Sexually mature females of the field vole exhibit high level of aggregation, and their numbers increase in streight line with growing population size. We discuss the idea that different social organization of the rodent populations is connected with various strategies (sedentary and nomadic) supporting local population persistence.
