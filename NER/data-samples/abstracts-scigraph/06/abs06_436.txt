Abstract An analysis is presented for a model of a two-species predator-prey system where each species can be harvested or stocked. Using methods from bifurcation theory the qualitative nature of the steady-state solutions is examined. The effect of harvesting and stocking rates and the prey carrying capacity is examined in detail.
