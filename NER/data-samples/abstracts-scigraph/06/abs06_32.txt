Summary A new serotype of calicivirus, designated as San Miguel sea lion virus type 6 (SMSV-6), was isolated from vesicular lesions on the flipper of a California sea lion pup. Serologic studies show that SMSV-6 neutralizing antibodies (SN) occur frequently among California sea lions and occasionally among northern fur seals. Feral swine, 1- to 6-week elephant seal pups and grey whales tested negative for SMSV-6 antibody.
