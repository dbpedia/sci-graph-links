Summary: For Melipona fasciata, M. beecheii, M. favosa and Tetragonisca angustula we found distinct intergeneric differences in foraging activity patterns. The Melipona species had a longer daily foraging activity period than T. angustula. Pollen foraging patterns of the Melipona species were different from that of T. angustula: Melipona collect pollen earlier in the day. In an experimental habitat without competitors, Melipona favosa did not collect pollen very early in the day. ¶Individually marked returning foragers demonstrated in the course of the day distinct differences in nature and frequency of interactions with nest mates. Individual foraging flight frequency was lower and the intranidal transfer of nectar was delayed when syrup of a lower concentration was offered. ¶The regulation of daily foraging activity patterns and the nectar foraging behaviour of individual worker bees are discussed.
