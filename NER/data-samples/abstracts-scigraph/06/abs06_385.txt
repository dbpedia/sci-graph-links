Abstract There are 3 genera and at least 19 species names of fossils, attributed to calcareous algae, sponges, hydrozoans, corals, ammonites, gastropods, foraminifers, and radiolarians that have been dedicated to Erik Fl√ºgel. These are listed with their original diagnosis or description and re-illustrations of the holotypes.
