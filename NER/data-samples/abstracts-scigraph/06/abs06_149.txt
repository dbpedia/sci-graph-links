Summary In a previous study (A. Prejs and K. Prejs in press) we found that at the end of the dry season small fish species trapped together with piscivorous fish in small, shallow pool varied in their level of food intake. The two smallest of these species fed little, whereas larger species fed at high rate. By examining the species and size composition of the diet and gape limitations of predatory species, I found that the decreased feeding rate of small fish was in response to a high risk of predation by gape-limited predators. The reduction of feeding rate was very substantial when compared to that of the same species in predator free area.
