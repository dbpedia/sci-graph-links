Summary We studied the covariation of six species of cavity-nesting birds to determine the extent to which species' co-occurrence patterns were attributable to interspecific relations. We tested two null hypotheses: (1) inverse relations did not exist among potential competitors for nest trees or nest cavities, and (2) there were no positive relations among potential commensals for nest cavities. Statistical power analyses, and simple, partial, and multiple partial correlation and regression analyses provided little evidence of species-species or higher-order inverse or positive relations. Most of the variation in co-occurrence patterns was associated with stand characteristics. Collectively, an abundance of nest trees and nest cavities, differences among species in acceptable nest-tree and nest-cavity dimensions, and different periods of peak nesting activity appear to be responsible for the lack of negative relations among potential competitors. Positive relations among potential commensals were weak presumably because (1) secondary cavity nesters (SCNs) frequently used cavities that originated from wind-, lightning-, and/or disease-damaged limbs and were thus not dependent completely on primary cavity nesters for cavities, and (2) the lag time for cavity use by SCNs is often two or more seasons. Interspecific relations were apparently not major determinants of community structure during our investigation; assemblages of cavity nesters appeared instead to be influenced more by independent species-specific habitat responses.
