Summary Predation on four species of triclads was investigated by exposing them to likely predators in the laboratory. The only serious littoral predators would seem to be dragonfly nymphs and adult Dytiscus marginalis. Although fish devoured triclads to some extent it is argued that predation by these in nature is unlikely. The slow movement and distastefulness of triclads contribute to their protection.
