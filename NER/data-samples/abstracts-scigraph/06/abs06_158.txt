Summary Mechanisms of dry-season drought resistance were evaluated for five evergreen shrubs (Psychotria, Rubiaceae) which occur syntopically in tropical moist forest in central Panama. Rooting depths, leaf conductance, tissue osmotic potentials and elasticity, and the timing of leaf production were evaluated. From wet to dry season, tissue osmotic potentials declined and moduli of elasticity increased in four and five species, respectively. Irrigation only affected osmotic adjustment by P. furcata. The other seasonal changes in leaf tissue properties represented ontogenetic change. Nevertheless, they made an important contribution to dry-season turgor maintenance. Small between-year differences in dry season rainfall had large effects on plant water status. In 1986, 51 mm of rain fell between 1 January and 31 March, and pre-dawn turgor potentials averaged <0.1 MPa for all five Psychotria species in March (Wright 1991). In 1989, 111 mm of rain fell in the same period, pre-dawn turgor potentials averaged from 0.75 to 1.0 MPa for three of the species in April, and only P. chagrensis lost turgor. The relation between leaf production and drought differed among species. P. limonensis was buffered against drought by the lowest dry-season conductances and the deepest roots (averaging 244% deeper than its congeners) and was the only species to produce large numbers of leaves in the dry season. P. chagrensis was most susceptible to drought, and leaf production ceased as turgor loss developed. For the other species, water stress during severe dry seasons may select against dry-season leaf production.
