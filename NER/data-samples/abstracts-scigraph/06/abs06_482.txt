Abstract Background and AimsFuture climate conditions (warmer, wetter) are expected to change aboveground plant communities with linked belowground alterations (e.g. porewater chemistry) that can influence carbon dynamics. The aims of this study were 1) to determine if porewater phenolic compound concentrations reflect the changing aboveground plant community and 2) to elucidate if changes in phenolic compounds alter belowground carbon release. MethodsWe monitored the changes in vegetation biomass, porewater phenolic compound concentrations, respired CO2 and phenol oxidase enzyme activity in 84 intact peatland mesocosms exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, elevated temperature, and decreased water table conditions in a full factorial design. ResultsPhenolic compound concentrations were indicative of the vascular plant expansion that occurred under warmer and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that phenolic compounds could be a simple indicator of northern plant community dynamics. Ecosystem CO2 respiration increased with rising phenolic compound concentrations, suggesting that phenolic compounds can decrease microbial carbon use efficiency in northern peatlands. ConclusionsUsing an aboveground-belowground framework we present a previously unrecognized mechanism influencing northern carbon dynamics; wherein, climate change conditions can restructure the plant community composition in turn increasing porewater phenolic concentrations, which results in decreased microbial carbon use efficiency and enhanced carbon release.
