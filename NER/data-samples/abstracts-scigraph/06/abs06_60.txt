Abstract 40 population samples of 17 GreekFritillaria species were examined morphologically using 22 attributes carefully selected, with a high discriminating ability. Principal component analysis with a nearest neighbour directed network and cluster analysis were used to evaluate the phenetic similarities among the species. The evidence presented here suggests: (1) A close relationship betweenF. erhartii andF. obliqua and their possible origin fromF. bithynica. (2) A strong alliance betweenF. rixii, F. euboeica, F. carica, andF. drenovskii (groupF. sibthorpiana). (3) A link between theF. epirotica andF. graeca group and some affinities betweenF. pontica, F. gussichiae, andF. graeca. Finally it is proposed thatF. tuntasia be reduced to subspecific status asF. obliqua subsp.tuntasia.
