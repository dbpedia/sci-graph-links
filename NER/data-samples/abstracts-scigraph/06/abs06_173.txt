Summary Neurohypophyses of sexually mature Acipenser güldenstädti Brandt and Acipenser stellatus Pallas maintained in hypertonic solutions were studied by means of light and electron microscopy. The fish were caught in the Ural and transferred into basins containing either freshwater (controls) or 32‰, 22‰ and 17‰ NaCl solutions respectively. The neurohypophyses of control animals kept in freshwater for two days contained a large amount of “Gomori-positive” neurosecretory material (4 arbitrary units). An abundance of neurosecretory granules of different kinds, predominantly elementary ones, was observed electron microscopically in neurosecretory fibres and terminals of these fish. A decrease in the amount of neurosecretory material was found in all experimental animals: up to 1–2 units in A. güldenstädti after 3.5–10 h in 32‰ NaCl, and up to 3.5 units in A. stellatus after 4.5–48 h in 22‰ or 17‰ NaCl. The number of neurosecretory granules decreased considerably in the fibres and terminals in all experimental series, but that of granulated, disintegrating granules and “granule-shadows” increased markedly, especially in preterminal parts of axons. An increased number of hypertrophied mitochondria, lamellar bodies, residual granules and especially “synaptic” vesicles was seen. These changes speak for an active discharge of neurohormones into the general circulation, a phenomenon well known to be characteristic of stress responses. Pathological ultrastructural changes (breakdown of terminals, extracellular wide cisternae) were visible in A. güldenstädti neurohypophyses at the end of the experiments. Also tanycytes — “narrow” ependymal cells — and pituicytes underwent noticeable changes.
