Abstract We examined the manner in which animals adjust the proportion of energy allocated to growth and storage in response to food availability. We compared univariate growth and length-mass relationships between juvenile adders (Vipera berus) reared under two different feeding regimes. Animals in the low- and high-food experimental groups were fed suckling mice once and twice weekly, respectively. Snout-vent length, body mass, and body condition (residual scores from log-log regression of body mass on snout-vent length) were measured shortly after birth, and at 4, 9, and 14 weeks. We found that growth in length and mass, as well as changes in length-mass relationships, differed between treatments; snakes with access to more food not only increased faster in length but were also heavier at the completion of the experiment than were similar sized less frequently fed snakes. There was no association between body condition of individuals measured at birth and at the end of the experiment, whereas size at birth was a good predictor of final size. Our results provide evidence for resource-dependent allocation strategies in V. berus, and suggest that somatic growth is less sensitive to environmental fluctuations than body condition, presumably because body size is of greater importance for fitness.
