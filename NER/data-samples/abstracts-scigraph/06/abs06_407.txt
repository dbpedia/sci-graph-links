Abstract Migration patterns and habitat use of sub-yearling Chinook salmon during initial ocean entrance is poorly understood. Twenty-five years ago, sub-yearling Chinook salmon were hypothesized to stay close to shore (<5 km). To test this hypothesis we sampled the surf-zone of a southern Oregon dissipative sandy beach throughout the summer of 2006 (06/07–09/29) using a beach seine in 1 m of water depth. We caught 48 sub-yearlings over six dates (07/22 to 09/01). Mean standard length of Chinook salmon caught in the surf-zone increased from 9.1 ± 0.6 (07/22/06) to 11.6 ± 0.7 cm (09/01/06), suggesting a mean increase of 0.6 mm in standard length (S.L.) per day. Early in the summer, smaller fish fed mostly on amphipods. Later in the summer, larger juveniles fed primarily on larval and juvenile fish. All prey items were common in the surf-zone. Juveniles appear to migrate from the estuary to the surf-zone where they feed on the local zooplankton for up to two summer months before migrating offshore.
