Abstract Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is generally considered an inferior piscivore compared to brown trout (Salmo trutta). However, we demonstrate that a recently described profundal spawning piscivore PP-morph of Arctic charr in a subarctic lake has evolved typical piscivore traits (i.e. large jaws, robust skulls), similar to the co-occurring brown trout but different from the sympatric littoral spawning omnivore LO-morph of Arctic charr. A few large-sized LO-morph, most large-sized PP-morph and trout constitute the piscivore guild, but they differed in prey fish selection. Of the fish-eating deep-water PP-morph, 52% had consumed charr, with a peak during the polar night period (68–80% in November–January). In contrast, the LO-morph and trout were mainly (~90%) inter-specific piscivores eating stickleback. Consequently, the PP-morph was the main charr predator and started to feed on fish at a smaller size and took larger prey relative to their body length than the trout. Stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N) ratios reflect the dietary specialisations in the upper-water (LO-morph, trout) and the deep-water (PP-morph) environments, besides the piscivorous behaviour of the PP-morph and trout. The existence of a shallow-water piscivore (trout) may explain the origin of this PP-morph, taking benefit of underutilised resources of small-sized Arctic charr in the deep-water habitat.
