Abstract Tropical rain forests have an amazingly large number of closely related, sympatric species. How the sympatric species coexist is central to understanding the maintenance of high biodiversity in tropical rain forests. We compared local and geographical distributions among trees in Scaphium (Sterculiaceae), a tropical canopy tree genus. Scaphium is endemic to the Far Eastern tropics and comprises six species. Scaphium scaphigerum is distributed in drier regions than the other species' geographical distribution ranges. Scaphium longiflorum is distributed swamp forests, whereas the others were distributed in lowland and hill tropical rain forests on undulating land. Scaphium borneense, S. longipetiolatum, and S. macropodum co-occurred in a 52-ha plot in Lambir, Sarawak and clearly showed an allopathic pattern of distribution related to elevation in it. In the plot, the elevational difference was correlated with soil variation. Consequently, the difference in edaphic condition promoted the habitat segregation of the species. Thus these five Scaphium species have divergent habitats at various spatial scales and coexist because they reduce direct competition by habitat niche differentiation. Although the non-equilibrium hypothesis for the coexistence of Scaphium species cannot be rejected categorically due to the lack of enough information about S. linearicarpum, the equilibrium force may play the predominant role which permits their coexistence.
