Abstract The coagulation profiles of 36 mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella) aged 2–6 years, and 17 Nubian ibexes (Capra ibex nubiana), aged 1–4 years, were evaluated and compared. The following parameters were determined in both species: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration (FIB), and clotting factors VII, VIII:C, IX, X, and XI. Thrombin clotting time (TCT) was also determined in mountain gazelles. The results indicated significant interspecies differences in most parameters, with lower PT, aPTT, and factors VII, IX, and XI and higher factor XIII:C activities in the Nubian ibex than the mountain gazelle. Gender seemed to have a limited influence on these parameters within each species. Both species had higher plasma FIB and factor VIII:C activity relative to humans. This study is the first record of coagulation variables in these two species of wild Arabian desert ruminants.
