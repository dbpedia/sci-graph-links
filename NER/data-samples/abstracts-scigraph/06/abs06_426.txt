The possibility of detecting extended metal objects at the bottom of fresh-water reservoirs from the reduction in the spreading resistance between electrodes submerged in the water is demonstrated. A formula is obtained for the relative change in the spreading resistance in the presence of an isolated extended conductor. Results of laboratory and natural experiments are presented.
