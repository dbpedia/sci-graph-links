Abstract Paraconsistent logics are specially tailored to deal with inconsistency, while fuzzy logics primarily deal with graded truth and vagueness. Aiming to find logics that can handle inconsistency and graded truth at once, in this paper we explore the notion of paraconsistent fuzzy logic. We show that degree-preserving fuzzy logics have paraconsistency features and study them as logics of formal inconsistency. We also consider their expansions with additional negation connectives and first-order formalisms and study their paraconsistency properties. Finally, we compare our approach to other paraconsistent logics in the literature.
