Abstract We construct a a system PLRI which is the classical propositional logic supplied with a ternary construction $${\alpha \equiv_{\gamma} \beta}$$ , interpreted as the intensional identity of statements $${\alpha}$$ and $${\beta}$$ in the context $${\gamma}$$ . PLRI is a refinement of Roman Suszkoâ€™s sentential calculus with identity (SCI) whose identity connective is a binary one. We provide a Hilbert-style axiomatization of this logic and prove its soundness and completeness with respect to some algebraic models. We also show that PLRI can be used to give a partial solution to the paradox of analysis.
