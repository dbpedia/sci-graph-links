Abstract This paper outlines an epistemological conception which attempts to relate the formal aspects of mathematical proof to its pragmatic dimensions. In addition to the key concept of application, the paper makes use of several concepts from the domain of analytical philosophy, to present a view of proof that might best be categorized as a dialectical one. A number of implications for teaching are discussed.
