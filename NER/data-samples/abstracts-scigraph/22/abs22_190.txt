Abstract This paper starts with a self-contained discussion of the so-called Akulovâ€“Volkov action $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AV}}$, which is traditionally taken to be the leading-order action of the Goldstino field. Explicit expressions for $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ and its chiral version $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AV}}^{\mathrm{ch}}$ are presented. We then turn to the issue on how these actions are related to the leading-order action $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{NL}}$ proposed in the newly proposed constrained superfield formalism. We show that $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{NL}}$ may yield $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm {AV}}/\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AV}}^{\mathrm{ch}}$ or a totally different action $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{KS}}$, depending on how the auxiliary field in the former is integrated out. However, $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{KS}}$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm {AV}}/\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{AV}}^{\mathrm{ch}}$ always yield the same S-matrix elements, as one would have expected from general considerations in quantum field theory.
