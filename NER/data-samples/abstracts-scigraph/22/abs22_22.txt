Abstract In the frame of this work we shall prove that the positive plurisubharmonic currents T are locally flat. We want show an essential point of the proof of the Main theorem which: the current T can be studied by means of the potential current U of T and we are going to use an against-example which shows the positivity of T is necessary.
