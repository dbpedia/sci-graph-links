Abstract The logic FBCI given by linearly ordered BCI-matrices is known not to be an axiomatic extension of the well-known BCI logic. In this paper we axiomatize FBCI by adding a recursively enumerable set of schemes of inference rules to BCI and show that there is no finite axiomatization for FBCI.
