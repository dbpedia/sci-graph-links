Abstract We review the theory and phenomenology of B→ (K*,ρ) γ decays. The impact of these decay modes on the determination of the CKM angles is investigated. Taking into account most recent experimental data and theoretical inputs, we present an updated analysis of the constraints induced onto the $(\bar \rho,\bar \eta)$ plane.
