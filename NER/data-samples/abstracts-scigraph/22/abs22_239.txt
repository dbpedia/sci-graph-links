Abstract. We summarize the most significant aspects in the study of transverse spin phenomena over the last few decades, focusing on Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering processes and hadronic production in e + e - annihilations. The phenomenology of transverse-momentum-dependent distribution and fragmentation functions will be reviewed in an in-depth analysis of the most recent developments and of the future perspectives.
