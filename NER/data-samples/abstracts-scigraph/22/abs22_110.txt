Abstract The various OBE approximations to the recent Bonn potential are studied in deuteron photodisintegration below Ï€-threshold. Consistent static meson-exchange currents, isobar currents, and the relativistic spin-orbit current are included. Concerning the OBEPT also the leading retardation corrections in the currents are taken into account. Comparison with experimental data is carried out in detail.
