Abstract The properties of neutrinos,s-leptons,s-quarks as well as the coloured isosinglet $$\tilde D$$ and $$\tilde D^c $$ are studied in superstring inspired models. Furthermore the neutrinoless double β-decay process is investigated, including light and heavy majorana neutrinos, as well as the contribution of the exotic Higgs scalars of the theory. From the current experimental limits onov-ββ-decay, useful constraints are imposed on the masses and Yukawa couplings of the theory.
