Abstract Evolutionary theories are characterised by another logic than the classical scientific theories as, e.g., in physics or chemistry. Since Darwin evolutionary processes are captured by algorithmic theories, i.e., theories whose logical core consists of certain fundamental algorithms. In the case of biological evolution this is a “genetic algorithm”, that is the processes of variation and selection. Other evolutionary processes like those of societies and cognitive development have to be understood by other algorithms that are characteristic for the specific domains. These considerations are illustrated with the case studies of Darwin, Marx and Piaget.
