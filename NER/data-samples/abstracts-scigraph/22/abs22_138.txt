Abstract. The philosopher Plato lived in Athens 428–348 BC. There are three starting points for his philosophy: the ethical considerations of his teacher Socrates and his disputes with the Sophists; the ontological (and logical) problems of Parmenides and his pupil Zeno; and the mathematical and physical theories of the Pythagoreans. For a period of about ten years (399–388) he lived in Sicily in close contact with Pythagoreans, especially the mathematician and statesman Archytas of Tarent. His complete work has come down to us in 27 dialogues, in many of which Socrates is the central speaker, and which are literary as well as philosophical masterpieces. (A handful more and some letters are thought to be spurious) The mathematician Theodorus, roughly contemporary with Socrates, is said to have been his teacher in mathematics. Plato knew many important theorems, which were collected in Euclid's ELEMENTS (ca. 300 BC).
