Abstract The idea of the transformative nature of mental distress and, more particularly, of the wounded healer is geographically and temporally widespread, being attributed variously to classical Greece, biblical Judaism, Siberian Shamanism, the Jungian analytical psychology tradition, Alcoholics Anonymous, and self-help movements. It is also a commonplace in modern and contemporary Christian theology and spirituality. This paper will explore the idea as it is found in the writings of Henri Nouwen, focusing on his experience of depression as an occasion for spiritual growth. It will then critically evaluate a potentially transformative view, drawing on Nouwen and other sources, and suggesting some important emphases a transformative view needs to adopt if it is to avoid philosophical and pastoral pitfalls.
