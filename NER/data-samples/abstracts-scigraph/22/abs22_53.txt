Abstract. The perspectives of a search for the rare decay $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ at a $\Phi$â€“factory are discussed. After a general analysis, we focus on the realistic case of KLOE and DA $\Phi$NE, showing that limits of the order of $10^{-9}$ on BR( $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$) are achievable in the next few years. We also discuss the theoretical implications of this kind of measurements.
