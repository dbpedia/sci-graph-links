Abstract Recently several theories have been proposed to account for the state reduction due to measurement. The resulting evolution is given by a new density matrix equation which suppresses linear superpositions of states with large spatial separations. We raise some pertinent questions regarding these theories. We also show that the evolution for the density matrix obtained in these theories has a classical analog.
