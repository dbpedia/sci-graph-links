Abstract A necessary and sufficient criterion of inertia is presented, for the flat space-time theory of general frames of reference, in terms of the vanishing of some typical components of the affine connection pertaining to curvilinear coordinate systems. The physical identification of inertial forces thus arises in the context of the special theory of relativity.
