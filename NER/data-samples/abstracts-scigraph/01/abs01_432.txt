Abstract In this paper we first present a theorem for a monotone iteration method, where the conditions for the considered operators are affine invariant. Then we apply this method to systems of nonlinear elliptic differential equations arising from the Volterra-Lotka model with diffusion. Finally an extended predator-prey system is considered. One numerical example is given.
