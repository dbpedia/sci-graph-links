Abstract We characterize effect algebras and pseudo effect algebras that can be represented as an interval of the lexicographic product of an antilattice unital po-group (H, u) with a directed po-group G, both with the Riesz Decomposition Property (RDP). We show that a crucial condition is the existence of a lexicographic normal ideal. Finally, we present a categorical equivalence of the category of (H, u)-lexicographic pseudo effect algebras having RDP with the category of directed po-groups with RDP. In addition, a weaker form of the (H, u)-lexicographic pseudo effect algebra is studied.
