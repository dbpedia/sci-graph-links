Abstract Time-varying differential systems with infinite delay are considered. Explicit criteria for global exponential stability of linear (nonlinear) systems are presented. Furthermore, an explicit robust stability bound for linear systems subject to time-varying perturbations is given. The exponential stability criteria for nonlinear systems are used to investigate exponential stability of equilibria of neural networks. Three examples are given to illustrate obtained results. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this paper are new.
