Summary A modification of Bergman's integral operator method is applied to a hodograph system descriptive of linearly polarised plane electromagnetic pulse propagation in non-linear dielectrics. Series solutions of the system are thereby generated corresponding to general D-E and B-H relations. For certain non-linear ‘constitutive laws’ the governing wave propagation equations are reduced to a hyperbolic canonical form associated with the classical wave equation and closed form integration is thereby achieved. The availability of arbitrary parameters in these laws allows approximation to non-linear dielectric laws derived empirically. Moreover, it is noted how a generalised version of Weinstein's Correspondence Principle may be utilised to generate iteratively more general non-linear constitutive laws for which reduction to canonical form may be obtained.
