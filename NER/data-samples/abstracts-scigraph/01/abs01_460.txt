Abstract This paper addresses characterizations of integral input-to-state stability (iISS) for hybrid systems. In particular, we give a Lyapunov characterization of iISS unifying and generalizing the existing theory for pure continuous-time and pure discrete-time systems. Moreover, iISS is related to dissipativity and detectability notions. Robustness of iISS to sufficiently small perturbations is also investigated. As an application of our results, we provide a maximum allowable sampling period guaranteeing iISS for sampled-data control systems with an emulated controller.
