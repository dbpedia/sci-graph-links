Abstract. We study the higher eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the so-called $\infty$-eigenvalue problem. The problem arises as an asymptotic limit of the nonlinear eigenvalue problems for the p-Laplace operators and is very closely related to the geometry of the underlying domain. We are able to prove several properties that are known in the linear case p = 2 of the Laplacian, but are unknown for other values of p. In particular, we establish the validity of the Payne-PÃ³lya-Weinberger conjecture regarding the ratio of the first two eigenvalues and the Payne nodal conjecture, which deals with the zero set of a second eigenfunction. The limit problem also exhibits phenomena that are not encountered for any $1 < p < \infty$.
