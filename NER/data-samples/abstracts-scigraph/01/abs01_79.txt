Abstract In this study, we first establish an identity for a stochastic fifth-order Kawahara operator, and then, applying this identity, we obtain two global Carleman estimates for linear stochastic Kawahara equation. Based on these estimates, we obtain two types of unique continuation property for linear stochastic Kawahara equation.
