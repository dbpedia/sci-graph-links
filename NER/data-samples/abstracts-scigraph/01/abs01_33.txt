Abstract. Let X be a closed smooth 4-manifold which is homotopy equivalent to S 2 × S 2. In this paper we use Seiberg-Witten theory to prove that if X admits a spin symmetric group S 4 action of even type with b 2 + (X/S 4) = b 2 + (X), then as an element of R (S 4), Ind S4 D X = k 1 (1 − θ) + k 2(ψ1 − ψ2) for some integers k 1 and k 2, where 1, θ, ψ1, ψ2 are irreducible characters of S 4 of degree 1, 1, 3, and 3 respectively.
