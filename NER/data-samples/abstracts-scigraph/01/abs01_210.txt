Abstract Using the methods of the theory of charged corepresentation, the laws of dispersion were studied in the vicinity of symmetry points in the Brillouin zone for class D2d crystals which form the simple tetragonal lattice Î“q. Possible variants from the dispersion laws were obtained by quadratic approximation of the parametric expansion of the wave-vector components, taking into consideration and neglecting spin-orbit coupling. The zero inclination points were determined.
