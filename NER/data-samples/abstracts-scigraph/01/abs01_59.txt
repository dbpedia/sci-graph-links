Abstract We carry out a careful study of operator algebras associated with Delone dynamical systems. A von Neumann algebra is defined using noncommutative integration theory. Features of these algebras and the operators they contain are discussed. We restrict our attention to a certain C *-subalgebra to discuss a Shubin trace formula.
