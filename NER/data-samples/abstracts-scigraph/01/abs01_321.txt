Abstract PurposeCryo-electron microscopy is a technique in structural biology for determining the 3D structure of macromolecules. A key step in this process is detecting common lines of intersection between unknown embedded image planes. We wish to characterize such common lines in terms of the unembedded geometric data detected in experiments. MethodsWe use techniques from spherical geometry, real algebraic geometry, and linear algebra. ResultsWe show that common lines are the solutions to a system of polynomial equalities and inequalities, i.e., they form a semi-algebraic set. These polynomials are low degree, and we explicitly derive them in this paper. ConclusionsThe polynomials we derive provide the desired intrinsic characterization of common lines. We discuss possible applications of these polynomials to reconstruction algorithms that are robust to the high levels of noise present in cryo-electron images.
