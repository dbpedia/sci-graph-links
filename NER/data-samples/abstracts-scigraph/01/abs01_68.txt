Abstract A numerical method for objective interpolation of boundary-layer data in the height-time domain is presented. The method is based on a diffusive transport hypothesis and allows for the determination of the optimal ratio between the height and time scales to be used for non-dimensionalising the independent variables z and t. This ratio, with dimensions of a velocity, may be related to the vertical transfer properties of the atmosphere. A few cases during springtime with different stability conditions are discussed, showing that this ratio varies by at least one order of magnitude between day and night.
