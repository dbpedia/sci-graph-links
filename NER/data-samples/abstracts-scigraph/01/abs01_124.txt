Abstract This note contains iterative procedures which bound the solution of characteristic initial-value problems with hyperbolic differential equationz st =f(s, t, z) with the aid of interval-analytical methods and possibilities for speeding up convergence. The method applied is a generalization of the proceeding for ordinary differential equations described in [5].
