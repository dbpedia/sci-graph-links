Abstract A long-standing misconception about the mathematical validity of utilizing Green's function solutions to coronal magnetic fields is discussed. Although this type of solution does not fit the observed line-of-sight component of the photospheric magnetic field, but rather the net flux in a region, the solution does obey Laplace's equation in the inner corona.
