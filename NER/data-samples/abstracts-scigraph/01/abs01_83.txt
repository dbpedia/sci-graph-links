Abstract. In this paper we consider the problem $-\Delta u + a(x)u = \vert u\vert ^{p-2}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, where p > 2 and $p < 2^* = \frac{2N}{N-2} $ if N > 2. Assuming that the potential a(x) is a regular function such that $\liminf_{\vert x\vert\rightarrow + \infty} a(x) = a_\infty > 0$ and that verifies suitable decay assumptions, but not requiring any symmetry property on it, we prove that the problem has infinitely many solutions.
