Abstract Partial differential equations have recently been used for image compression purposes. One of the most successful frameworks solves the Laplace equation using a weighting scheme to determine the importance of individual pixels. We provide a physical interpretation of this approach in terms of the Helmholtz equation which explains its superiority. For better reconstruction quality, we subsequently formulate an optimisation task for the corresponding finite difference discretisation to maximise the influence of the physical traits of the Helmholtz equation. Our findings show that sharper contrasts and lower errors in the reconstruction are possible.
