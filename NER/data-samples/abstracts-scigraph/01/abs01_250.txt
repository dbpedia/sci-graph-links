Abstract We present a three-dimensional technique for the solution of the magnetohydrostatic equations when we are modeling structures bounded by a current sheet that is free to move to satisfy pressure balance. The magnetic field is expressed in terms of Euler potentials and the equations are transformed to flux coordinates, greatly simplifying the problem of locating the free boundary. Multi-grid techniques are used to rapidly solve the resulting nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. The method is tested against Low's (1982) exact solution of a bipolar plasma loop. It is shown that fast, accurate solutions can be found.
