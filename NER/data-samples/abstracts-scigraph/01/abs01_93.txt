Abstract We study the influence of additive and parametric slowly varying harmonic (at the Chandler frequency and doubled frequency) and stochastic Gaussian broadband perturbations on mathematical expectations, variances, and covariations of oscillations of the Earth’s pole. The influence of perturbations on both regular and irregular stochastic oscillations is considered in detail. Results of numerical experiments are presented. The developed models and software are included into information resources on the fundamental problem “Statistical dynamics of the Earth’s rotation” of Russian Academy of Sciences.
