Abstract In the first part of this article series, we had derived Domain Decomposition (DD) preconditioners containing three block matrices which must be specified for specific applications. In the present paper, we consider finite element equations arising from the DD discretization of plane, symmetric, 2nd-order, elliptic b.v.p.s and specify the matrices involved in the preconditioner via multigrid and hierarchical techniques. The resulting DD-PCCG methods are asymptotically almost optimal with respect to the operation count and well suited for parallel computations on MIMD computers with local memory and message passing. The numerical experiments performed on a transputer hypercube confirm the efficiency of the DD preconditioners proposed.
