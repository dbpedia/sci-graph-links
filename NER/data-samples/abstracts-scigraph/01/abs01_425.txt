Summary We examine under what conditions the « minimal internal coupling » between the inhomogeneous Lorentz group and an internal symmetry group, which was introduced in an earlier paper (2), arises naturally. We also answer the question whether the momenta in an irreducible representation can be diagonalized when the internal symmetry group is compact.
