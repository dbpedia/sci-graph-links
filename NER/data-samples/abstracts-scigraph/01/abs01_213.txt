Abstract. In this paper we study the Liouville equation $ \Delta u = e^{-2u} $ in dimension two. We prove that an entire solution u determines, up to a subgroup of MÃ¶bius transformations, a unique entire meromorphic function which generates u globally, obtaining in the process the Liouville's formula. Our method is based on global solutions of a linear system of partial differential equations, contrasting to Liouville's proof of his formula, which is clearly local.
