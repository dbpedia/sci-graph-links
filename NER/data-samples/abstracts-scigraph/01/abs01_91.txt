Abstract The QCD motivated integral equation for three reggeised gluons in the oddC colour singlet channel is solved for large external masses of gluons. It generates a Regge singularity forj≅1. Possible contribution of this singularity to the “non-singlet” structure functionxF 3 is examined atx≅0, where in principle it should give a constant term and dominate over the valence quark contribution. The coupling of the three gluon system to currents is, however, shown to vanish in the lowest order and in higher orders in the multi-Regge approximation.
