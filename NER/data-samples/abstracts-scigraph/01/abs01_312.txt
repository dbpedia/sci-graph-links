Abstract Selection of processing and geometrical parameters is a crucial step in the extrusion process design. Optimized parameters may result in desirable microstructure at minimum load. The purpose of this paper is determination of the optimal cold forward extrusion parameters with the minimization of tool load as the objective function. This paper deals with different optimization approaches in order to determine the optimal values of logarithmic strain, die angle, and friction with the purpose of finding the minimal tool loading obtained by cold forward extrusion process. The obtained extrusion force model as a fitness function was used to carry out the optimization. Based upon the objective function, metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm and simulated annealing were adopted as optimization methods for finding the optimum values of cold forward extrusion parameters and the obtained results were compared with those in literature. The better results lead to the smallest energy consumption, longer tool life, better formability of the work material, and the quality of the finished product.
