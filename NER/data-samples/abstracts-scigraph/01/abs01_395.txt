Summary The theory of distributions is applied to determine the source of the Kerr geometry. The stress-energy tensor is obtained, via Einstein’s field equations, by adopting the «branch cut» interpretation of the equatorial disk which spans the ring singularity. The stress-energy tensor is thus assumed to be a distribution having its support throughout the disk and along the ring. A simple model, which accounts for the tensor so obtained, is set up. Upon the disk it consists in a mixture of gas and dust rotating as a whole about the symmetry axis with constant angular velocity ω=a −1. The linear velocity, in turn, increases from zero at the centre of the disk up to the speed of light on its edge. The energy densities of both perfect fluids have the same absolute value, but are of opposite sign. On the other hand, the source on the ring is made up of dustlike particles having infinite positive energy and a finite radial dipole moment. Although these particles circulate along the ring with the speed of light, they cannot escape because they are pulled by an infinite tension (negative pressure) of the gas lying on the disk. It is further verified that the stress-energy tensor correctly reproduces the values of the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr black hole.
