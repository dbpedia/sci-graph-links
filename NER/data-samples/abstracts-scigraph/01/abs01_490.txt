Abstract In this paper, fuzzy polynomial systems in dual form are considered and an algebraic approach for finding their solutions is presented. A dual fuzzy polynomial system in the form $$AX+B=CX+D $$ AX+B=CX+D , where $$A, B, C,$$ A,B,C, and $$D$$ D are fuzzy matrices, is converted to a system with real coefficients and variables first. Then, Wuâ€™s algorithm is used as a solution procedure for solving this system. This algorithm leads to solving characteristic sets that are amenable to easy solution. Finally, the accuracy of the presented algorithm is shown via some examples.
