Abstract. We study curves of genus 3 over algebraically closed fields of characteristic 2 with the canonical theta characteristic totally supported in one point. We compute the moduli dimension of such curves and focus on some of them which have two Weierstrass points with Weierstrass directions towards the support of the theta characteristic. We answer questions related to order sequence and Weierstrass weight of Weierstrass points and the existence of other Weierstrass points with similar properties.
