Abstract. â€‚Under the Riemann Hypothesis for the classical Riemann zeta function, there exist infinitely many arithmetically non-isomorphic arithmetical semigroups with the property that one of the associated L-functions vanishes at . Moreover, there are no restrictions in the distribution of prime divisors of a given norm except an obvious one concerning the order of magnitude.
