Abstract. In a recent paper, Ghenciu and Lewis studied strong Dunford-Pettis sets and made the following two assertions: (1)The Banach space X * contains a nonrelatively compact strong Dunford-Pettis set if and only if ℓ∞ ↪ X *.(2)If c 0 ↪ Y and H is a complemented subspace of X so that H * is a strong Dunford-Pettis space, then W(X, Y) is not complemented in L(X, Y). While the statements are correct, the proofs are flawed. The difficulty with the proofs is discussed, and a fundamental result of Elton is used to establish a simple lemma which leads to quick proofs of both (1) and (2).
