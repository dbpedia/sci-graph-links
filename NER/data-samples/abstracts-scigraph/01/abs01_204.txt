Abstract In wireless sensor networks, cluster head selection and routing are two well-known optimization problems associated with high computational complexity. Harmony search algorithm (HSA) is one of the metaheuristics, used to solve a wide range of NP-Hard problems. In this paper, first we propose an HSA-based cluster head (CH) selection algorithm by devising a fitness function with energy, distance and node degree as parameters. Next, we derived a potential function for the assignment of non-CH nodes to the CHs. Finally, an HSA-based routing algorithm is also proposed using the same parameters, i.e., energy, distance and node degree in the derivation of the fitness function. Three test cases have been considered in this study for performance evaluation. The proposed algorithm has been tested with some of the existing related techniques. Simulation results depict that the proposed algorithm (CRHS) shows superior performance over the existing techniques.
