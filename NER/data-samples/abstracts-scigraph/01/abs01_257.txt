Abstract The rotation characteristics of large-scale (global) magnetic fields (GMF) and their relation to the activity of local fields (LMF) are studied over a long time interval (1915–1996). The main results are as follows. The GMF rotation rates and LMF activity vary in anticorrelation. Both variations have similar periods (11 years and a quasi-secular period of about 55–60 years), but are shifted relative to each other by half an 11-year cycle. Therefore, (1) the GMF rotation rate increases at the minimum of the 11-year cycle of LMF activity. (2) The GMF rotation rate is faster in the less active hemisphere. (3) The GMF rotation period slows down at the maximum of the secular LMF activity (cycles 18 and 19).
