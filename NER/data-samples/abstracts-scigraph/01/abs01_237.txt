Abstract In the paper the structure of quasi-copulas and copulas on a finite discrete scale is studied. The possibility of construction of quasi-copulas (copulas) from given values at diagonal points is investigated. Moreover, the problem of the uniqueness of the existence of a quasiâ€“copula (copula) with given diagonal section is solved. Several examples are included.
