Abstract In this paper we characterize complex extreme points in Marcinkiewicz spaces $$M_W$$ MW , with a non-increasing weight $$w$$ w . We showed that $$f \in S_{M_W}$$ f∈SMW is a complex extreme point of the unit ball $$B_{M_W}$$ BMW if and only if $$\liminf _{t\rightarrow \infty }\{\int _0^t w(s)\,ds-\int _0^t f(s)\,ds\}=0$$ lim inft→∞{∫0tw(s)ds-∫0tf(s)ds}=0 . Moreover, we proved that the unit ball is the weak star closure of its complex extreme points.
