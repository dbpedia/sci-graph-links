Abstract The spiral structure of M33 has been examined on the basis of 197 associations. The parameters of the orientation of the plane are derived. It is supposed to be a system consisting of seven logarithmic spirals. Two principal arms have been interpreted through the use of the density-wave theory. The remaining multiple arm features of M33 may be explained with the stochastic self-propagating model. The distribution of surface brightness segments speaks for the existence of different mechanisms of star formation in M33.
