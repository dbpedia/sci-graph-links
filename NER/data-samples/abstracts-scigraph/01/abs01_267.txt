Abstract Here we present a certain modified collocation method which is a fully discretized numerical method for the solution of Fredholm integral equations of the first kind with logarithmic kernel as principal part. The scheme combines high accuracy from Galerkin's method with the high speed of collocation methods. The corresponding asymptotic error analysis shows optimal order of convergence in the sense of finite element approximation. The whole method is an improved boundary integral method for a wide class of plane boundary value problems involving finite element approximations on the boundary curve. The numerical experiments reveal both, high speed and high accuracy.
