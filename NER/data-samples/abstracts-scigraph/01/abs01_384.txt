Abstract We study the nonlinear fractional equation $$(-\Delta )^su=f(u)$$ in $$\mathbb R ^n,$$ for all fractions $$0<s<1$$ and all nonlinearities $$f$$. For every fractional power $$s\in (0,1)$$, we obtain sharp energy estimates for bounded global minimizers and for bounded monotone solutions. They are sharp since they are optimal for solutions depending only on one Euclidian variable. As a consequence, we deduce the one-dimensional symmetry of bounded global minimizers and of bounded monotone solutions in dimension $$n=3$$ whenever $$1/2\le s<1$$. This result is the analogue of a conjecture of De Giorgi on one-dimensional symmetry for the classical equation $$-\Delta u=f(u)$$ in $$\mathbb R ^n$$. It remains open for $$n=3$$ and $$s<1/2$$, and also for $$n\ge 4$$ and all $$s$$.
