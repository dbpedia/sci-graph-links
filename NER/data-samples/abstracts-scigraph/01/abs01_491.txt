Abstract A comparative analysis of time series is not feasible if the observation times are different. Not even a simple dispersion diagram is possible. In this article we propose a Gaussian process model to interpolate an unequally spaced time series and produce predictions for equally spaced observation times. The dependence between two observations is assumed a function of the time differences. The novelty of the proposal relies on parametrizing the correlation function in terms of Weibull and Log-logistic survival functions. We further allow the correlation to be positive or negative. Inference on the model is made under a Bayesian approach and interpolation is done via the posterior predictive conditional distributions given the closest $$m$$ m observed times. Performance of the model is illustrated via a simulation study as well as with real data sets of temperature and CO$$_2$$ 2 observed over 800,000 years before the present.
