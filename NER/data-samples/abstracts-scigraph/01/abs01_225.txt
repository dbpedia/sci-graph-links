Abstract This work continues that begun in [9]. Our investigation has led us to the following conjecture: a cyclic subnormal operator is cellular-indecomposable if and only if it is quasi-similar to an analytic Toeplitz operator whose symbol is a weak-star generator of Hâˆž. In this paper some particular cases of the conjecture are verified.
