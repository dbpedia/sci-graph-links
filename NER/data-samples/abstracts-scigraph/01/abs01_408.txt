For a semigroup S, the set of all isomorphisms between the subsemigroups of the semigroup S with respect to composition is an inverse monoid denoted by PA(S) and called the monoid of local automorphisms of the semigroup S. The semigroup S is called permutable if, for any couple of congruences ρ and σ on S, we have ρ ∘ σ = σ ∘ ρ. We describe the structures of a finite commutative inverse semigroup and a finite bundle whose monoids of local automorphisms are permutable.
