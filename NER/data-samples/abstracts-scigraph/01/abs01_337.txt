Abstract We obtain asymptotic expressions for the eigenvalue difference of the waveguide modes of an optical fiber with step-index profile. The estimation of accuracy of the formulas is presented. Relationship between the indices of the modes that form linearly polarized groups and the roots of the characteristic equation and the principal mode number is considered. Estimates for the difference between the eigenvalues and the decay length of linearly polarized groups in a perfect dielectric fiber are obtained. The results of experimental studies of the integral degree of linear polarization of the output radiation are shown for different input angles and their comparison with the theory is carried out.
