Abstract In the present note we further explore the possibility of measuring the number of $$\bar vv$$ generations by means of $$Z^0 \to \bar vv$$ decays. We investigate in particular the case where the radiative transitionse + e − →γZ 0 are studied on theZ 0 resonance itself. The various background reactions are discussed as well as the statistical significance that can be obtained for an additional $$\bar vv$$ generation.
