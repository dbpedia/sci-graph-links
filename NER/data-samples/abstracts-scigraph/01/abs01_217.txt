Abstract In the nonequilibrium-statistical-operator (NSO) method a correction to the Hamiltonian of a system is found, corresponding to a source in the Liouville equation, which destroys the invariance of this equation with respect to time reversal. Analysis of this correction enables one to conclude that the forces leading to the irreversible behavior of a system are of an essentially nonpotential nature. Inclusion of the causality principle in the Hamiltonian of a system also makes it possible to give a new representation of the NSO.
