Abstract This paper is devoted to the investigation of quasilinear hyperbolic equations of first order with convex and nonconvex hysteresis operator. It is shown that in the nonconvex case the equation, whose nonlinearity is caused by the hysteresis term, has properties analogous to the quasilinear hyperbolic equation of first order. Hysteresis is represented by a functional describing adsorption and desorption on the particles of the substance. An existence result is achieved by using an approximation of implicit time discretization scheme, a priori estimates and passage to the limit; in the convex case it implies the existence of a continuous solution.
