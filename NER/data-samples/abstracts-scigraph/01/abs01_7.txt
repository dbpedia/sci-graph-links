Abstract In this paper, we study the perturbations of invertible operators and stability of g-frames in Hilbert spaces. In particular, we obtain some conditions under which the perturbations of an invertible operator are still an invertible operator, the perturbations of a right invertible operator or a surjective operator are still a right invertible operator or surjective operator. Then we apply the perturbations of invertible operators to study the stability of g-frames which is close related with the invertibility (or right invertibility) property of operators.
