Abstract. â€‚In this article we investigate the number of lattice points in a three-dimensional convex body which contains non-isolated points with Gaussian curvature zero but a finite number of flat points at the boundary. Especially, in case of rational tangential planes in these points we investigate not only the influence of the flat points but also of the other points with Gaussian curvature zero on the estimation of the lattice rest.
