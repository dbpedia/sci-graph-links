Abstract We study the exact solutions of a particular class of N confined particles of equal mass, with $$N=3^k \ (k=2,3, \ldots ),$$ N=3k(k=2,3,…), in the $$D=1$$ D=1 dimensional space. The particles are clustered in clusters of three particles. The interactions involve a confining mean field, two-body Calogero type of potentials inside the cluster, interactions between the centres of mass of the clusters and finally a non-translationally invariant N-body potential. The case of nine particles is exactly solved, in a first step, by providing the full eigensolutions and eigenenergies. Extending this procedure, the general case of N particles ($$N=3^k, \ k \ge 2$$ N=3k,k≥2 ) is studied in a second step. The exact solutions are obtained via appropriate coordinate transformations and separation of variables. The eigenwave functions and the corresponding energy spectrum are provided.
