Abstract We prove a result on the backward dynamics of a rational function nearby a point not contained in the ω-limit set of a recurrent critical point. As a corollary we show that a compact invariant subset of the Julia set, not containing critical or parabolic points, and not intersecting the ω-limit set ofrecurrent critical points, is expanding, thus extending a classical criteria of Fatou. We also prove that the boundary of a Siegel disk is always contained in the ω-limit set of arecurrent critical point.
