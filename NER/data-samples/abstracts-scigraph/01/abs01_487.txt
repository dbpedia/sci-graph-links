Abstract Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. The set $$\text {F}^{r}(M)$$ Fr(M) consisting of sequences $$(f_{i})_{i\in {\mathbb {Z}}}$$ (fi)i∈Z of $$C^{r}$$ Cr -diffeomorphisms on M can be endowed with the compact topology or with the strong topology. A notion of topological entropy is given for these sequences. I will prove this entropy is discontinuous at each sequence if we consider the compact topology on $$\text {F}^{r}(M)$$ Fr(M) . On the other hand, if $$ r\ge 1$$ r≥1 and we consider the strong topology on $$\text {F}^{r}(M)$$ Fr(M) , this entropy is a continuous map.
