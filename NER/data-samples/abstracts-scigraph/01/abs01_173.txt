Abstract We study the asymptotic behavior of smooth, origin-symmetric, strictly convex bodies under the centro-affine normal flows. By means of a stability version of the Blaschke–Santaló inequality, we obtain regularity of the solutions provided that initial convex bodies have almost maximum Mahler volume. We prove that suitably rescaled solutions converge sequentially to the unit ball in the $$\mathcal {C}^{\infty }$$ C∞ topology modulo $$SL(n+1)$$ SL(n+1) .
