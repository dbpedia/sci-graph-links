Abstract In this paper we discuss the growth of solutions of the higher order nonhomogeneous linear differential equation $${f^{(k)}} + {A_{k - 1}}{f^{(k - 1)}} + ... + {A_2}f" + ({D_1}(z) + {A_1}(z){e^{az}})f' + ({D_0}(z) + {A_0}(z){e^{bz}})f = F(k \ge 2),$$ where a, b are complex constants that satisfy ab(a − b) ≠ 0 and A j (z) (j = 0, 1, …, k − 1), D j (z) (j = 0, 1), F(z) are entire functions with max{ϱ(A j ) (j = 0, 1, …, k − 1), ϱ(D j ) (j = 0, 1) < 1. We also investigate the relationship between small functions and the solutions of the above equation.
