In the case where initial data are generalized functions of the Gevrey-distribution type for which the classical notion of equality of two functions on a set is well defined, we establish the principle of local strengthening of the convergence of a solution of the Cauchy problem to its limit value as t â†’ +0 for one class of degenerate parabolic equations of the Kolmogorov type with $ \overrightarrow {2b} $-parabolic part whose coefficients are continuous functions that depend only on t.
