Abstract The concept of t-designs in compact symmetric spaces of rank 1 is a generalization of the theory of classical t-designs. In this paper we obtain new lower bounds on the cardinality of designs in projective compact symmetric spaces of rank 1. With one exception our bounds are the first improvements of the classical bounds by more than one. We use the linear programming technique and follow the approach we have proposed for spherical codes and designs. Some examples are shown and compared with the classical bounds.
