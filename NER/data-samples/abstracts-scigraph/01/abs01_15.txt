Abstract. Consistently, there is an uncountable almost disjoint family $ \scr A $ on $ \scr w $ which generates a Boolean algebra isomorphic to each uncountable subalgebra. Inspection of the proof gives a pre-caliber $ \scr {w}_1$ iteration $ \mathbb{P} \star \mathbb{Q} $ for which $ \mid \vdash_{\mathbb{P}} \mathbb{Q}^2 $ is not ccc.
