Abstract For a closed normal subgroupN of a locally compact groupG view a closed subset $$\tilde E$$ of Prim* L 1 (G/N) as a subsetE of Prim* L 1 (G) in the canonical way and writeN ⊥ for Prim* L 1 (G/N) as a subset of Prim* L 1 (G); then the injection theorem says: IfE is spectral (i.e. of synthesis), then $$\tilde E$$ is so; and if $$\tilde E$$ andN ⊥ are spectral, thenE is too. In case of a group of polynomial growth with symmetricL 1-algebra, where smallest idealsj (E) with given hulls exist, it is known thatN ⊥ is always spectral. For a closed,G-invariant subsetF of Prim* L 1 (N) define a closed subsetE of Prim* L 1 (G) by $$E = \{ \ker \pi ; \ker \pi |{\rm N} \supseteq \mathop \cap \limits_{P \in F} P\} $$ . Denote by e (I') the ideal generated byC 00 (G)*I', where theG-invariant idealI' ofL 1 (N) is viewed as a subset of measures onG, then the projection theorem states: IfE is spectral, thenF is so, and ifF is spectral withe (j (F))=j (E) thenE is spectral. All assumptions are fulfilled for instance, ifG andN are of polynomial growth with symmetricL 1-algebra and eitherSIN-groups or solvable.
