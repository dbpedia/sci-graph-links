Abstract. An analysis is made of reality conditions within the context of non-commutative geometry. We show that if a covariant derivative satisfies a given left Leibniz rule then a right Leibniz rule fixes the reality condition for the covariant derivative itself. We show also that the map which determines the right Leibniz rule must satisfy the braid equation if the extension of the covariant derivative to tensor products is to satisfy the reality condition.
