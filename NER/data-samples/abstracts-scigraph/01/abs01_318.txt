Abstract We study local automorphisms of holomorphic Cartan geometries. This leads to classification results for compact complex manifolds admitting holomorphic Cartan geometries. We prove that a compact Kähler Calabi–Yau manifold bearing a holomorphic Cartan geometry of algebraic type admits a finite unramified cover which is a complex torus.
