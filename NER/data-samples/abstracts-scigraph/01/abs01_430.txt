Summary The Schwarzschild interior solution is known to have a conformal structure. It is shown here that it is the only solution of Einsteinâ€™s equations which is static and conformally flat for a spherically symmetric perfect-fluid distribution. Its homogeneous limits are exhibited as cosmological metrics and the explicit co-ordinate transformations associated with the conformal mapping to these cosmological spaces are given. Co-moving co-ordinates and matching to the exterior metric are also discussed.
