Summary The balance equations of a compressible immiscible mixture of two perfect fluids are derived by using a variational principle. It is shown that the equations of such a mixture obey Truesdell's third metaphysical principle. Then the governing equations, specialized by assuming that both phases have the same motion, are studied by means of a suitable asymptotic approach. It is derived an evolution equation representing a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation containing also nonlinear terms in the higher order derivatives. Finally, the travelling wave solutions of this evolution equation are discussed.
