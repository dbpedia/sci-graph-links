Abstract LetM=ΓG/K be a locally symmetric space of finite volume and rank ≥ 2. We show that any map fromM of weighted finite energy in the sense of Saper can be deformed into a finite energy map. As a consequence such maps can be deformed into totally geodesic ones, and a geometric generalization of Margulis' superrigidity theorem is obtained.
