Abstract To every Ricci flow on a manifold $${\mathcal{M}}$$ over a time interval $${I\subset\mathbb{R}_-}$$, we associate a shrinking Ricci soliton on the space–time $${\mathcal{M}\times I}$$. We relate properties of the original Ricci flow to properties of the new higher-dimensional Ricci flow equipped with its own time-parameter. This geometric construction was discovered by consideration of the theory of optimal transportation, and in particular the results of the second author Topping (J Reine Angew Math 636:93–122, 2009), and McCann and the second author (Am J Math 132:711–730, 2010); we briefly survey the link between these subjects.
