Abstract We propose a mathematical theory of rigorous construction and specialization of determining relations for hardening elastoplastic materials simple in Noll's sense with fading memory of the form of trajectory in which plastic strains occur immediately after the application of loading and monotonically increase in the process of deformation. Strains and the type of symmetry of the material are arbitrary. For the processes of deformation close to proportional and slightly different from the stress- and strain-free configuration, we deduce physical equations for materials without memory of form of the trajectory with weakly fading memory, and fading memory of the nth order. On the basis of these equations, we deduce determining relations for isotropic materials.
