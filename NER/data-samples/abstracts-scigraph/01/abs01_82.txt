Abstract In this paper, a system of quasilinear elliptic equations is investigated, which involves critical exponents and multiple Hardy-type terms. By variational methods and analytic techniques, the existence of positive solutions to the system is established. The conclusions are new even when the Hardy-type terms disappear.
