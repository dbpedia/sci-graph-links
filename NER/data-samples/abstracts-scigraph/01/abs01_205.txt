Abstract We study a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system that is modeled by a system of parabolic equations with power-law nonlinear terms. The proposed construction of exact solutions enables us to split the process of finding the components depending on time and the spatial coordinates. We construct multiparametric families of exact solutions in elementary functions. The cases are elaborated of blow-up solutions as well as exact solutions time-periodic but spatially anisotropic.
