Abstract Up to the classification of Hermitian forms a classification has been given of triplesP=(VF; U1, U2), consisting of a finite dimensional vector space V over a field of characteristic ≠ 2 with a symmetric, or a skew-symmetric, or Hermitian form F and two subspaces U1, U2. Two triplesP andP′ are identified with each other if there exists an isometry ϕ ∶ Vf → V′f′ such that ϕ (Ui)=Ui′, i=1, 2.
