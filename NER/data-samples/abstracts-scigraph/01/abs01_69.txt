Abstract A regular cover of a connected graph is called dihedral or cyclic if its transformation group is dihedral or cyclic, respectively. Let X be a connected cubic symmetric graph of order 2p for a prime p. Several publications have investigated the classification of edge-transitive dihedral or cyclic covers of X for specific p. The edge-transitive dihedral covers of X have been classified for p=2 and the edge-transitive cyclic covers of X have been classified for pâ‰¤5. In this paper an extension of the above results to an arbitrary prime p is presented.
