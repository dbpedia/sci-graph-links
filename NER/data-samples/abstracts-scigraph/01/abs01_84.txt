Abstract We study order-sequences of linear systems on smooth curves and establish the formula:b j +b N−j ≤b N for allj, where {b 0<b 1<...<b N } is the order-sequence of a linear system on a curve. As an application of the formula, we describe all linear systems on curves which have no Weierstrass points.
