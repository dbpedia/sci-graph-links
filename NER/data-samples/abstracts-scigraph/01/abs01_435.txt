Abstract A triharmonic map is a critical point of the 3-energy in the space of smooth maps between two Riemannian manifolds. We study the generalized Chen’s conjecture for a triharmonic isometric immersion $$\varphi $$ φ into a space form of non-positive constant curvature. We show that if the domain is complete and both the 4-energy of $$\varphi $$ φ , and the $$L^4$$ L4 -norm of the tension field $$\tau (\varphi )$$ τ(φ) , are finite, then such an immersion $$\varphi $$ φ is minimal.
