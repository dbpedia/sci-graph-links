Abstract IfCâŠ‚E(G) is a maximum cardinality cocircuit of a 2-connected graphG, then no other maximum cocircuit is contained in one and the same block ofG-C. The analogous conjecture for real representable matroids would have important applications to classifying convex bodies with a certain Helly type property.
