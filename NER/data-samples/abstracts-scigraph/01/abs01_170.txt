Abstract It is shown that it is possible to describe a particle with spin of 3/2 and anomolous magnetic moment within the theory of first-order relativistic wave equations in matrix form by introducing a minimum interaction with the external electromagnetic field. This is done by expanding the space of Lorentz group representations.
