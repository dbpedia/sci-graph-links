Abstract Using Malliavin calculus techniques, we derive an analytical formula for the price of European options, for any model including local volatility and Poisson jump processes. We show that the accuracy of the formula depends on the smoothness of the payoff function. Our approach relies on an asymptotic expansion related to small diffusion and small jump frequency/size. Our formula has excellent accuracy (the error on implied Black–Scholes volatilities for call options is smaller than 2 bp for various strikes and maturities). Additionally, model calibration becomes very rapid.
