Abstract We study the lattice. C(S) of congruences of a monoid S which is the Bruck-Reilly extension of a monoid T by a homomorphism Î±. The inclusion, meet and join of congruences are described in terms of congruences and ideals of T. We show that C(S) can be naturally decomposed into three sublattices, corresponding (roughly speaking) to the three different types of congruences on such semigroups.
