Abstract Elliott Rudwick’s 1957 examination of the methodology and sociological significance of the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory served as the singular treatise on this topic for nearly fifty years. This query departs from Rudwick’s publication through its critique of the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory beyond a conceptual frame that compares the school’s methodological techniques with advancements in the discipline at a later period in time, but, instead, challenges Rudwick’s conclusion that the methodology was unsophisticated and of low quality and that the sociological significance was, at best, minimal.
