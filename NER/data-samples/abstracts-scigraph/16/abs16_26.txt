Abstract There is within the field of the education of the visually handicapped, a surge to provide adequate sex education to all visually impaired individuals. Parents and professionals are seeking specialized training, better tactual models are being sought and more materials are being brailled and taped so that sexual information is more readily available. Sex education is finally being recognized as a means for the blind to better understand themselves and others. With this understanding comes an increased chance for the blind to become totally integrated into society.
