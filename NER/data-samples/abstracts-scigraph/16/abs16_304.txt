Abstract Most work on capacities has focused on the 2-alternating and sub 2-alternating. In this paper we consider the capacities-g-probabilities derived from pengâ€™s g-expectations. When g satisfies some conditions, we show that the g-probabilities fail to be 2-alternating but are sub 2-alternating.
