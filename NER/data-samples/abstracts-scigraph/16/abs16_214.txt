Abstract Drawing upon field research in two distinct settings, the authors reflect upon the uses of and problems associated with social constructionism in academic and applied contexts. Miller’s research on brief therapists and Fox’s on an AIDS prevention program, both of which utilize the principles of social constructionism, bring into relief various issues within social constructionism. The authors suggest that academic contructionists’ consideration of applied uses might bear insight into the relationship between theory and sociological practice. As practitioners of everyday life who are responsible to practical concerns, social constructionists' knowledge claims are socially contingent. The mutable claims to expertise and authority in applied settings highlight these contingencies. Moreover, within applied constructionist settings, decisions to priviledge some knowledge forms over others reflect the ontological gerry-mandering problem in academic versions of constructionism.
