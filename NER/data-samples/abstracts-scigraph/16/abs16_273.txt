Abstract An interval extension of a function written in the centered form or the mean value form offers a second order approximation to the range of values of the function over an interval. However, the two forms differ with respect to inclusion monotonicity; the mean value form is inclusion monotone while the centered form is not. This is demonstrated in the following paper. Further, the mean value form is more generally applicable, and a mean value form for an integral operator is considered. It is shown that this form is also a second order inclusion monotone approximation.
