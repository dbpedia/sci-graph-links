Abstract Given the widespread use of many digitalized communication channels, knowledge production activities have rapidly become interrelated. As the term “network society” implies, knowledge-based innovation systems have been built mainly on the mediated social infrastructure, which has lead to the emergence of the N-Tuple Helix model. I wish to contribute to this special issue by offering an interview with Prof. Dr. Elias G. Carayannis and Dr. David F. J. Campbell, the two co-authors and co-creators of the Quadruple (Government, University, Industry and Civil Society) and Quintuple (Quadruple Innovation Helix plus Environment) Innovation Helix concepts that extend, expand and complement the Triple Innovation Helix rubric. This article starts with brief background information on N-Tuple Helices and concludes with some implications for developing and transitional economies.
