Abstract In an axiomatic way a divergence between fuzzy sets is introduced which extends the symmetric difference between crisp sets. Any fuzzy measure of the divergence between two fuzzy sets weighs their “distance”. The distance between a fuzzy set and the family of crisp sets is fuzziness measure.
