Abstract. We show that for any compact set $K\subset M^{N\times n}$, $L_c(K)=C(K)$ if and only if $Q(K)=C(K)$, $L_c(K)$, $Q(K)$ and $C(K)$ being the closed lamination convex hull, quasiconvex hull and convex hull of $K$ respectively. When $K\subset M^{2\times 2}$, we show that $L_c(K)=C(K)$ if and only if $P(K)=C(K)$, where $P(K)$ is the polyconvex hull of $K$. We give some estimates of these relations by using quasiconvexifications of distance functions.
