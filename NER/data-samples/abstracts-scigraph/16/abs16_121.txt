Abstract It is demonstrated that the periodic (along the path) rearrangement of the spatial (in depth and horizontal distance) interference structure of the acoustic field generated in an oceanic waveguide by a CW point source is accompanied by a diffraction focusing of the field with the corresponding spatial period. It is found that, in an oceanic waveguide with a monotone angular dependence of the Brillouin ray cycle, the spatial period of both the rearrangement of the interference structure and the diffraction focusing of the field is directly proportional to the square of the characteristic vertical scale of the waveguide and inversely proportional to the wavelength; in a waveguide with a nonmonotone dependence, the corresponding spatial period is directly proportional to the cube of the aforementioned waveguide scale and inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength.
