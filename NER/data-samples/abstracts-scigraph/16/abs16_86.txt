Abstract The double-differential production cross-section of positive pions, $d^2\sigma^{\pi^{+}}/d pd\Omega$, measured in the HARP experiment is presented. The incident particles are 8.9 GeV/c protons directed onto a beryllium target with a thickness of 5% of a nuclear interaction length. The measured cross-section has a direct impact on the prediction of neutrino fluxes for the MiniBooNE and SciBooNE experiments at Fermilab. After cuts, 13 million protons on target produced about 96000 reconstructed secondary tracks which were used in this analysis. Cross-section results are presented in the kinematic range 0.75 GeV/c≤pπ≤ 6.5 GeV/c and 30 mrad≤θπ≤ 210 mrad in the laboratory frame.
