Abstract Given aZ n+1-periodic variational principle onR n+1 we look for solutionsu:R n →R minimizing the variational integral with respect to compactly supported variations. To every vector α εR n we consider a subset ℳα of solutions which have an average slope α when averaging overR n. The minimal average action A(α) is defined by the average value of the variational integral given by a solution with average slope α. Our main result is:A is differentiable at α if and only if the set ℳα is totally ordered (in the natural sense). In case that ℳα is not totally ordered,A is differentiable at α in some direction βε R n{0} if and only if β is orthogonal to the subspace defined by the rational dependency of α. Assuming that the ith component of α is rational with denominator si εN in lowest terms, we show: The difference of right- and left-sided derivative in the ith standard unit direction is bounded by const · $$\tfrac{1}{{s^i }}$$ .
