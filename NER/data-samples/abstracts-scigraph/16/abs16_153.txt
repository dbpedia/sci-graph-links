Summary The paper attempts to analyze some system specific properties of the Marxian approach. The more conventional strands of economics have a strong praxiological or decision theoretic character, which makes them to identify the economic with a purely conceptual system. They are mainly interested in developments inside the system. Marx deals preferentially with developments of the system itself. His concept of a social system is, therefore, dialectical in the sense that it contains an evolutionary hypothesis. Furthermore, Marx does not start from isolated individuals, as does conventional theory: he rather views society as a totality of people interacting in the process of production. The historical conditions and determinants of this production process are the object of his thinking.
