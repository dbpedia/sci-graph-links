Abstract In this paper we study the initial value problem for the scalar semilinear strictly hyperbolic equation in multidimensional space with data strongly singular at one point. Under the assumption of the initial data being conormal with respect to one point and bounded or regular with a certain low degree, the existence of the solution to this problem is obtained; meanwhile, it is proved that the singularity of the solution will spread on the forward characteristic cone of the hyperbolic operator issuing from this point, and the solution is bounded and conormal with respect to this cone.
