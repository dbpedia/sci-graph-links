Summary The present investigation has been undertaken to obtain data for the analysis of the chromosome movement at anaphase and the formation of a cleavage furrow. The study is based on simultaneous measurements of the spindle and cell diameters as well as of the chromosome separation in living spermatocyte divisions of the grasshoppers, Podisma sapporense and Acrydium japonicum. Evidence from the present investigation shows that the movement of chromosomes to the poles and the elongation of the spindle are separated in time; the spindle length remains unchanged through out anaphase. Spindle elongation is not associated with the separation of daughter chromosomes. The cell, and the spindle as well, elongate after the chromosomes have reached the poles. Cell elongation may follow the stretching of the spindle, and cause sufficient tension to distort the cell wall, resulting in the subsequent formation of a cleavage furrow.
