Abstract This article reviews actual and projected college enrollments, and demand for faculty, during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although new PhDs were finding satisfying employment in government, business and industry, many graduate programs in sociology were slow to expand their academically-oriented curricula to include a concern with sociological practice when the academic job market contracted in the late 1970s. This suggests that departments may quickly reestablish narrowly focused curricula once the academic market expands again in the late 1990s. As a result, the multiple career options currently available to graduate students again may be replaced by an exclusive focus on research careers in academia.
