Abstract This paper discusses whether and to what extent the field of the sociology of deviance is “dead,” relevant to sociology generally, or intellectually vital, and, if it is less vital than it once was, how and why it declined in vigor, and what might be done to return it to its glory days. It also addresses the implications of the election of 2004 for the field of deviance studies.
