Summary A solution is presented for determining the stresses in an infinite elastic plate containing an elastic rectangular inclusion subjected to a uniform stress field. The bond stresses are obtained by treating the plate and the inclusion separately and satisfying continuity of displacements at discrete points rather than continuously. An example of a square elastic inclusion is treated in detail. Comparison is made between the solution obtained by point-matching techniques and the exact solution for a rigid square inclusion. Excellent agreement is observed. The practical motivation behind this research was the estimation of the bond stresses induced between the fibers and matrix of multifiber composite sheets.
