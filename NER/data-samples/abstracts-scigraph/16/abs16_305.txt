Abstract The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamics underlying disparities in Internet use among school age children in the US. The analysis found that a broad range of demographic, geographic and economic factors significantly influence Internet use among children. Significantly, the availability of household computing resources and adult Internet users in the household were most important in explaining disparities in use among children. To expand universal Internet access, future public policy should focus on providing support for in-home access; continued support for public access at out-of-home locations such as schools, and providing technical support, training and expertise to school age children.
