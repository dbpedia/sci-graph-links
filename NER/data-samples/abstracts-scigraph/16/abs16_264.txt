Abstract We investigate finite sections of Gabor frames and study the asymptotic behavior of their lower Riesz bound. From a numerical point of view, these sets of time-frequency shifts are linearly dependent, whereas from a rigorous analytic point of view, they are conjectured to be linearly independent.
