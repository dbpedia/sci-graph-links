Abstract The inverse problem of reconstructing the pressure at the moving boundary of a cylindrical plasma piston from the pulsating pressure at a point in the wave zone is solved for the first time. The law of motion of the plasma piston was unknown and needed to be determined. Kinematic and dynamic parameters of the expanding piston were obtained to determine the law of power deposition into the channel. As a result of an exact analytic solution of the problem, it is shown that if the pressure function at the channel wall is a series of pulses of increasing amplitude, the pressure function at a fixed point in the wave zone is also a series of increasing pulses. The pulsation period of the pressure curve at the channel wall is equal to the pulsation period of the power deposition curve and the pulsation period of the pressure curve at a fixed point in the wave zone.
