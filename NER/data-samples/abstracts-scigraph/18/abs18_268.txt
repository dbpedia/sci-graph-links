Abstract Contrary to Northrup's claim, the pinch effect, predicted by either the Biot-Savart law or the original Ampere law, accounts for less than half the necessary force to drive Hering's pump. The longitudinal Ampere tension, which is not predicted by the Biot-Savart law, is sufficient to account for the remaining force necessary.
