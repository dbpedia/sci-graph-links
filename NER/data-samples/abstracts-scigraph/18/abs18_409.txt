Abstract The extraterritoriality clause in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 amended Title VII and the ADA to include employment discrimination protection for US citizens working abroad for US employers. A review of recent court rulings demonstrates an absence of lawsuits involving alleged violations of the extraterritorial provision. Instead, recent cases show that Americans working outside of the US are filing charges against foreign employers rather than US employers and applying state level employment statutes rather than federal legislation. In addition, non US citizens are exhibiting a trend toward invoking US federal and state statutes against US employers. These cases are reviewed and implications discussed for managing employment relations in an increasingly international workplace.
