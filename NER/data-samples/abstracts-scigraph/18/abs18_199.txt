Summary We prove a general theorem for the precise rate at which the convex hull of Brownian motion gets created. The latter result relates large deviation theory to P. Lévy's geometric proof of Strassen's law of the iterated logarithm. This also answers a question of S. Evans. Moreover, we give a partial solution to a question of J. Hammersley and P. Lévy regarding the slowness of the growth of the hull process. Several examples, some classical and some new, are given to illustrate the theorems. Finally, we present applications to the convex hull of random walks ind dimensions.
