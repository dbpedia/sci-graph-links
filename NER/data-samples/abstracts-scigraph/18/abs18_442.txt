Abstract We propose a two-component model for the momentum distributions at high energy in the same manner as the analysis of the multiplicity distribution. The effect of the diffraction dissociation is investigated from the view point of the scaling law for the distribution functions. Our results are qualitatively quite in good agreement with the present experimental data, and seem to be valid for future experiments.
