Summary Noether's theorem on variational principles in which the associated functionals are invariant under a group of infinitesimal transformations is used to establish conservation laws associated with linear viscoelastostatics. One of them may be regarded as a viscoelastic generalization of Rice'sJ-integral in elasticity. In addition, those conservation laws are discussed briefly in physics.
