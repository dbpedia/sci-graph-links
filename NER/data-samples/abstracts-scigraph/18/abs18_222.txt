Abstract Given a latticeL we are looking for a basisB=[b 1, ...b n ] ofL with the property that bothB and the associated basisB *=[b 1*, ...,b n *] of the reciprocal latticeL * consist of short vectors. For any such basisB with reciprocal basisB * let $$S(B) = \mathop {\max }\limits_{1 \leqslant i \leqslant n} (|b_i | \cdot |b_i^ * |)$$ . Håstad and Lagarias [7] show that each latticeL of full rank has a basisB withS(B)≤exp(c 1·n 1/3) for a constantc 1 independent ofn. We improve this upper bound toS(B)≤exp(c 2·(lnn)2) withc 2 independent ofn. We will also introduce some new kinds of lattice basis reduction and an algorithm to compute one of them. The new algorithm proceeds by reducing the quantity $$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {|b|^2 } \cdot |b_i^ * |^2 $$ . In combination with an exhaustive search procedure, one obtains an algorithm to compute the shortest vector and a Korkine-Zolotarev reduced basis of a lattice that is efficient in practice for dimension up to 30.
