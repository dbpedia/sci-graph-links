Abstract In this paper, we construct the travelling wave solutions to the perturbed nonlinear Schrödinger’s equation (NLSE) with Kerr law non-linearity by the extended (G′/G)-expansion method. Based on this method, we obtain abundant exact travelling wave solutions of NLSE with Kerr law nonlinearity with arbitrary parameters. The travelling wave solutions are expressed by the hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions and rational functions.
