Summary The red complex formed between chromium(III) and 4-(2-thiazolylazo)-resorcinol (1 ∶ 2) at pH 5.0, on heating the reactants to 90° for 45 minutes, is used for Spectrophotometric determination of chromium, the absorbance being measured at 525 nm. Beer's law is obeyed for chromium concentration of 0.06 to 1.1μg per ml. Molar absorptivity is 4.98×104 and Sandell sensitivity 0.001μg cm−2. This method has been applied to the determination of chromium content in steel samples.
