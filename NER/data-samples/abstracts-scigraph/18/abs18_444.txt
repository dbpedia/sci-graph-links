Abstract In this letter, we use the Parikh–Wilczek tunneling model of Hawking radiation to illustrate that a reformulation of Verlinde’s entropic gravity is needed to derive Newton’s law for a temperature-varying screen, required by the conservation of energy. Furthermore, the entropy stored in the holographic screen is shown to be additive and its temperature dependence can be obtained.
