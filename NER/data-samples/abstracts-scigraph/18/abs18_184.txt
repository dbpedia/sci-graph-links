Abstract In the course of forensic DNA analysis, the interpretation of DNA profiles of mixed stains, i.e. cell material from more than a single donor, has become increasingly more important. The German Stain Commission, a joint commission of Institutes of Forensic Science and Legal Medicine, has therefore developed guidelines aiming to harmonize the evaluation of mixed stains in German criminal cases.
