Abstract Consider a linearly edge-reinforced random walk defined on the b-ary tree, bâ‰¥70. We prove the strong law of large numbers for the distance of this process from the root. We give a sufficient condition for this strong law to hold for general edge-reinforced random walks and random walks in a random environment. We also provide a central limit theorem.
