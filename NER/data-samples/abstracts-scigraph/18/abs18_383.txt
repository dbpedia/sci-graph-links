Summary Creep failure of elastic-damageable beams is investigated using a simple Continuum Damage Mechanics model. A single-degree-of-freedom system is first studied for the bending problem of the visco-damage spring. The strong analogy between the behavior of such a system and the one of an imperfection sensitive viscoelastic column, with specific references to the buckling of columns is shown. In particular, the saddle-node bifurcation is clearly recognized in the bifurcation diagram. Large displacement analysis is considered when the true collapse mode is studied. The continuous beam is then studied with a local damage constitutive law. It is shown that the evolution problem, composed of a loading range and the creep test, is well posed for this statically determinate beam. It appears that it is not necessary to introduce some non-locality in the constitutive law, in order to regularize the evolution problem. The stability analysis at the structural level leads to a similar conclusion. There is a limit point in the bifurcation diagram (which is a functional space for this continuous problem). This limit point is obtained via analytical arguments. The limit load depends on the geometrical and material characteristics of the problem but does not depend on the viscosity of the local constitutive law. Numerical simulations illustrate the collapse mode.
