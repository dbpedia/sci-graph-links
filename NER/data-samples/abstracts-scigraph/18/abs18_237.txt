Summary A simple and direct method for the spectrophotometric determination of chloride, based on the formation of chromyl chloride and its extraction into carbon tetrachloride has been developed. The absorption spectrum of the organic extract shows two bands at 300 and 415 nm; Beer's law is obeyed at both wavelengths over the range 20–320μg of chloride. The best conditions for the spectrophotometric determination of chloride are determined and a procedure is recommended. Interferences from some of the most common anions are studied.
