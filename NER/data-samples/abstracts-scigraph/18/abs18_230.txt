Abstract Every residuated lattice can be considered as an idempotent semiring. Conversely, if an idempotent semiring is finite, then it can be organized into a residuated lattice. Unfortunately, this does not hold in general. We show that if an idempotent semiring is equipped with an involution which satisfies certain conditions, then it can be organized into a residuated lattice satisfying the double negation law. Also conversely, every residuated lattice satisfying the double negation law can be considered as an idempotent semiring with an involution satisfying the mentioned conditions.
