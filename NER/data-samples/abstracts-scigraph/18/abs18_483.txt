Summary In this paper Noether's theorem is formulated for the nonlocal field together with the appropriate general conservation law. Then using the Euclidean group of transformation, the equivalence between the conservation law and the Euclidean invariance is demonstrated. As a consequence a novel result for the conservation law in nonlocal elastodynamics has been obtained.
