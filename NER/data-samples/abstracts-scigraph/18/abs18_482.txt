Abstract We prove that if there is a strongly connected digraph of ordern, maximum degreed, diameterk and connectivityc, thenn≤c d k−d /d−1+d+1. It improves the previous known results, and it, in fact, is the best possible for several interesting cases. A similar result for arc connectivity is also established.
