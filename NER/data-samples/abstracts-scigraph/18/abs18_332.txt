Summary A visible Spectrophotometric method is described for the determination of palladium with 2,2′-diquinolyl ketoxime. The effects due to pH, time, solvents, reagent concentration and diverse ions are reported. Beer's law is obeyed and the molar extinction coefficient is 1.3·104 at 478 nm. The incorporation of EDTA into the procedure results in a highly specific method for the determination of trace amounts of palladium.
