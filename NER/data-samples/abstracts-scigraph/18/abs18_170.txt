Abstract Let ${\cal F}$ be a family of convex figures in the plane. We say that ${\cal F}$ has property T if there exists a line intersecting every member of ${\cal F}$. Also, the family ${\cal F}$ has property T(k) if every k-membered subfamily of ${\cal F}$ has property T. Let B be the unit disc centered at the origin. In this paper we prove that if a finite family ${\cal F}=\{x_i+B\colon \ i\in I\}$ of translates of B has property T(4) then the family ${\cal F'}=\{x_i+\lambda B\colon \ i\in I\}$, where $\lambda= ({1+\sqrt{5}})/{2}$, has property T. We also give some results concerning families of translates of the unit disc which has either property T(3) or property T(5).
