Abstract National laws regulating use of chemicals are becoming more numerous. These laws affect firms outside the adopting nation as well as within. The new U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act will have major international impact. Firms in the chemical industry, including soap and detergent manufacturers, are encouraged to coordinate their activities in response to such laws, helping to provide governmental agencies with the technical information needed to carry out and evaluate tests on the effects of chemicals.
