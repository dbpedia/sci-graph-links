Summary The nature of existing dislocation hardening mechanisms are analyzed. This analysis shows that the hardening mechanisms can be classified into two categories: isotropic and kinematic; consequently a general physical hardening law, which incorporates the concept of the degree of isotropy in work hardening, is proposed. The corresponding motions of yield surface in both stress and strain space are examined on the basis of this general hardening law and its two extreme cases: isotropic and kinematic hardening.
