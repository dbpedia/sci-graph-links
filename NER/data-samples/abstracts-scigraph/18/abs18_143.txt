Summary We derive characterizations of upper and lower classes in the law of the iterated logarithm for row sums of triangular arrays of Gaussian random variables. We also derive strong approximations for more general triangular arrays by Gaussian arrays. By combining these results we deduce characterizations of upper and lower classes for row sums from general arrays.
