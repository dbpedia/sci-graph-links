Summary A method is described for the extractive spectrophotometric determination of palladium or ruthenium (III) using isonitrosoethylbenzoylacetate as the reagent. The yellow Pd-INEBA complex extracted into chloroform absorbs at 410 nm and conforms to Beer's law in the range of 10–110μg of Pd per 10 ml of organic phase. The purple Ru-INEBA complex extracted into MIBK absorbs at 500 nm and conforms to Beer's law in the range of 25–125μg of Ru per 10 ml of organic phase. The method affords the determination of both Pd and Ru in the presence of large number of cations and anions.
