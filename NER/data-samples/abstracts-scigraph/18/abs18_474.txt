Abstract â€‚The need for reliability of measurements supporting legal decisions in environmental policy or medical diagnosis and treatment is well known and widely accepted. This prerequisite can be met only by ensuring that legal measurements are accurate and traceable to national or international standards. Consequently, an outline of the organizational structure of the Romanian National Institute of Metrology (INM) for ensuring uniformity, consistency and accuracy of all measurements including legal measurements performed in chemical laboratories is presented. Since reliable measurements can only be accomplished within an appropriate traceability chain, the experience of the INM in identification and evaluation of measurement uncertainty in legal activities concerning the environment and health is reviewed. Practical examples of measurement uncertainty evaluation in spectrophotometric determination of five analytes, commonly determined in environmental and clinical chemistry are described. The implications of measurement uncertainty for interpretation of regulatory compliance are discussed.
