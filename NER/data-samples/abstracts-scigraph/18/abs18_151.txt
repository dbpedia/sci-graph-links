Summary The hydrodynamic theory of lubrication for non-Newtonian power law lubricants has been recently developed by I. Teipel et al. [1], [2], and K. Wierzcholski [3]. They restricted, however, their investigations to the cylindrical journal bearings only. Moreover, the authors assumed the width of the bearing to be infinite in order to reduce a three-dimensional problem to the two-dimensional one. In this paper an attempt is made to study the non-isothermal flow of a power law lubricant through the gap of a conical journal bearing. At first, the more general equations in curvilinear coordinates are derived which describe the flow of a power law lubricant in the bearing gap of a quite arbitrary geometry. Afterwards, as a special case, a conical bearing gap is considered. It seems to the authors that they succeeded in omitting the necessity of using numerical procedures and obtained a relatively simple, analytical solution to the problem discussed.
