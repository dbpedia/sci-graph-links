Abstract We introduce a natural family of random walks $$S_n$$ on $$\mathbb{Z }$$ that scale to fractional Brownian motion. The increments $$X_n := S_n - S_{n-1} \in \{\pm 1\}$$ have the property that given $$\{ X_k : k < n \}$$, the conditional law of $$X_n$$ is that of $$X_{n - k_n}$$, where $$k_n$$ is sampled independently from a fixed law $$\mu $$ on the positive integers. When $$\mu $$ has a roughly power law decay (precisely, when $$\mu $$ lies in the domain of attraction of an $$\alpha $$-stable subordinator, for $$0<\alpha <1/2$$) the walks scale to fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $$\alpha + 1/2$$. The walks are easy to simulate and their increments satisfy an FKG inequality. In a sense we describe, they are the natural “fractional” analogues of simple random walk on $$\mathbb{Z }$$.
