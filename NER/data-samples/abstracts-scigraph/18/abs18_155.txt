Abstract The Rayleigh law that governs low-frequency sound attenuation due to the scattering by inhomogeneities in a microinhomogeneous medium is generalized to the case of particles moving in a flow or falling under gravity. Corrections to the scatteringâ€™s cross section that adjust the Rayleigh law to the case of a potential flow around inhomogeneities are calculated. It is shown that, when microinhomogeneities are moving in a viscous medium, the characteristics of discrete scatterers may considerably deviate from the Rayleigh law. Based on the data on the velocity and size distribution of falling drops of water in air, refinements are proposed for the laws of low-frequency sound scattering by rain.
