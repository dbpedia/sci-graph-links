Abstract Among 12,982 forensic autopsies, 78 cases of caf√© coronary due to bolus impaction in the larynx (bolus death) were observed from 1947 to 1988. In all cases bolus material occluded the entry to the larynx; only once was a signular occlusion of the glottis observed. The bolus frequently extended into the mouth, trachea, and bronchial tree or esophagus. In all cases small amounts of aspirated material were observed in the deeper parts of the bronchial tree. The most commonly observed bolus was not masticated meat or a meat product. In adults and the elderly the bolus was often too large to pass the physiological narrowings of the hypopharynx. It was commonly lodged above the arytenoid cartilages. Forty-five of the bolus events were observed by bystanders. In 43 of the victims vital reactions were observed by bystanders or at the autopsy. This justifies the hope that many lives could have been saved had the right diagnosis and immediate therapy been initiated. The first step should be manual extraction or use of the Heimlich maneuver; in cases of failure of both attempts, immediate tracheotomy followed by hospitalization and bronchial lavage are indicated.
