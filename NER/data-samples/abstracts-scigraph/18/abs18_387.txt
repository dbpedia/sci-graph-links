Abstract Three new experiments using cost-effective household products are used to explain the concepts of Avogadro’s law, stoichiometry, and thermodynamic properties in introductory and university level chemistry courses. These experiments are designed to grab the students’ attention by presenting some surprising effects. The methods of producing carbon dioxide and the effect of crushing containers are very different from those in the literature. These demonstrations have two advantages. First, carbon dioxide is generated in the original containers, and second, the element of surprise stimulates the students’ interest to learn more about chemistry.
