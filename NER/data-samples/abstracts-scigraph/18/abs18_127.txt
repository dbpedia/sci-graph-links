Abstract Some basic principles required for the development of a valuation procedure in life cycle assessment are described. International human rights conventions and international environmental laws and conventions are analyzed for the usefulness in obtaining general principles for the valuation step of life cycle assessment. The human right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the conventions of the Earth Summit in Rio 1992, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer 1987, and other treaties and conventions are shown to be a suitable basis for the valuation.
