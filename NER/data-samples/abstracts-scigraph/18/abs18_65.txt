Abstract By the properties of the Musielak-Orlicz function's sequence, the necessary and sufficient condition for uniform Gateaux differential (UGD) property of Musielak-Orlicz sequence spaces equipped with the Luxemburg norm and a criterion for weakly uniform rotundity of Musielak-Orlicz sequence space with Orlicz norm are given.
