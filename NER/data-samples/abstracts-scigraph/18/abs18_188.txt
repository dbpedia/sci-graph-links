Abstract. In the setting of abstract Markov maps, we prove results concerning the convergence of renormalized Birkhoff sums to normal laws or stable laws. They apply to one-dimensional maps with a neutral fixed point at 0 of the form x+x 1+α , for α∈(0, 1). In particular, for α>1/2, we show that the Birkhoff sums of a Hölder observable f converge to a normal law or a stable law, depending on whether f(0)=0 or f(0)≠0. The proof uses spectral techniques introduced by Sarig, and Wiener’s Lemma in non-commutative Banach algebras.
