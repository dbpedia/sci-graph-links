Abstract For finite sets of integers A 1,…,A n we study the cardinality of the n-fold sumset A 1+…+ A n compared to those of (n−1)-fold sumsets A 1+…+A i−1+A i+1+…+A n . We prove a superadditivity and a submultiplicativity property for these quantities. We also examine the case when the addition of elements is restricted to an addition graph between the sets.
