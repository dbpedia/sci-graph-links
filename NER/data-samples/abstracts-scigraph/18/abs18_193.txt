Abstract The effect of light on carotene accumulation was studied by analyzing the β-carotene content of 4-α-old mycelia continuously exposed to illumination of different intensities. The wild-type, mutants defective in phototropism, mutants defective in carotene regulation, and newpic mutants specifically defective for photocarotenogenesis were examined. The results indicate that photocarotenogenesis depends on a single sensory pathway which shares its earlier steps (governed by genesmadA andmadB) with the sensory pathway for phototropism. It shares its later steps (probably governed by genescarA andpicB) with one of the pathways for carotene regulation, and includes at least one specific step (governed by genepicA) not known to be involved in other responses.
