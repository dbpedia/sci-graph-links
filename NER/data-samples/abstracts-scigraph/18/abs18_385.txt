Abstract In this paper, we study the total number of progeny, W, before regenerating of multitype branching process with immigration in random environment. We show that the tail probability of |W| is of order t −κ as t → ∞, with κ some constant. As an application, we prove a stable law for (L-1) random walk in random environment, generalizing the stable law for the nearest random walk in random environment (see “Kesten, Kozlov, Spitzer: A limit law for random walk in a random environment. Compositio Math., 30, 145–168 (1975)”).
