Summary The application of the named compound for the spectrophotometric determination of scandium is described. The effects due to pH, reagent concentration, time and diverse ions are reported. Beer's law is obeyed and the molar absorbance coefficient at 555 nm is 1.55Ã—104. By using a cupferron extraction prior to analysis, the procedure is quite selective.
