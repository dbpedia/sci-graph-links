Summary A method for the spectrophotometric determination of traces of palladium with 2,2'-diquinolylketone-2"-pyridylhydrazone is described. Experimental parameters were evaluated and a study of diverse ion tolerance carried out. Beer's law was obeyed and the molar absorptivity at 624 nm was 1.95Ã—104.
