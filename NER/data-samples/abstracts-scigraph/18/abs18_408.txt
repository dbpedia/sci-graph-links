Abstract The collapse scenario of a scalar field along with a perfect fluid distribution was investigated for a conformally flat spacetime. The theorem for the integrability of an anharmonic oscillator has been utilized. For a pure power-law potential of the form $${\phi }^{n+1}$$ Ï•n+1 , it was found that a central singularity is formed which is covered by an apparent horizon for $$n>0$$ n>0 and $$n<-3$$ n<-3 . Some numerical results have also been presented for a combination of two different powers of $$\phi $$ Ï• in the potential.
