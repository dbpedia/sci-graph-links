Summary An analysis is presented of the steady-state propagation of a semi-infinite mode I crack for an infinite inhomogeneous, linearly viscoelastic body. The shear modulus is assumed to have a power-law dependence on depth from the plane of the crack. Moreover, both a general and a power-law behavior in time for the shear modulus are considered. A simple closed form expression for the normal component of stress in front of the propagating crack is derived which exhibits explicitly the form of the stress singularity and its material dependency. The crack profile is examined and its dependence on the spatial and time behavior of the shear modulus is determined.
