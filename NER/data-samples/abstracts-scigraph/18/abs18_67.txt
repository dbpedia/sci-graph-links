Abstract The essence of this article is a comparison of two major codification projects—the new codification of Chinese civil law legislation in the twenty-first century, compared with roots in similar projects of a European Union draft civil code or frame of common reference. This is further compared with the recent project at the Faculty of Law of McGill University to pursue the modern teaching of civil law and common law as a ‘transsystemic’ class-room, a theory that seems to be at play in modern Chinese legislative development.
