Abstract An alternative formulation for isotropic rate-dependent finite plasticity is developed using the theory of material evolution. In this approach, the plastic-like evolution is assumed to be volume preserving and be driven by the thermodynamically dual Mandel stress, which is also known as material or configurational stress. Restrictions on the evolution laws and the yield criteria are established based on the second law of thermodynamics and rational. A simple isotropic plastic-like evolution law and yield criteria are proposed to complete the model. It is demonstrated that these simple laws render perfect, hardening or softening plastic-like responses and are rate dependent.
