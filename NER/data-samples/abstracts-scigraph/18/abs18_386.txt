Abstract An exercise that introduces undergraduate chemistry majors to concepts associated with intellectual property is outlined. The assignment includes an introduction to the terminology associated with starting a company based on intellectual property and to nondisclosure agreements. After this, the students write a draft patent application. With over 150,000 United States patents issued annually, the role of intellectual property is prominent and becoming increasingly important in current corporations and in the formation of new businesses, as well as in government and academic settings.
