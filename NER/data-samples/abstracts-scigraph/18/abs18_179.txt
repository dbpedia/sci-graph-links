Abstract Spectroscopy of atomlike mesons composed of one heavy quarkQ and one light quark $$\bar q$$ is studied in the Dirac equation with (i) scalar power law potential, (ii) scalar logarithmic potential and (iii) Coulomb plus scalar linear potential. It is found that the potentialr 0.1 gives an excellent fit toD, F andB mesons together with Ψ and Υ families treated in the nonrelativistic theory, and that the light quark masses in atomlike mesons are very close to the current quark masses.
