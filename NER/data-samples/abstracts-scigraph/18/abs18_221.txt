Abstract A CSR guideline is an instrument aimed at guiding companies towards the application of CSR to limit the impact that the company has on society. The main problem concerned with CSR guidelines is that their legal status is blurred and as a consequence, their level of enforceability is not clearly understandable. Therefore, this paper focuses on defining the legal status of CSR guidelines through a content analysis of a sample of 34 CSR guidelines.
