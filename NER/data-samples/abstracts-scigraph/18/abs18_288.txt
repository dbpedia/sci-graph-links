Abstract It is proved that a functional law of the iterated logarithm is valid for transitiveC 2 Anosov flows on compact Riemannian manifolds when the observable belongs to a certain class of real-valued Hölder functions. The result is equally valid for semiflows over piecewise expanding interval maps that are similar to the Williams' Lorenz-attractor semiflows. Furthermore the observables need only be real-valued Hölder for these semiflows.
