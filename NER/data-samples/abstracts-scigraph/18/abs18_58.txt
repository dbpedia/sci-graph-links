Abstract Vapor phase concentrations of acetone, acetaldehyde and acetonitrile over their aqueous solutions were measured to determine Henry's law partition coefficients for these compounds in the temperature range 5–40 °C. The results are for acetone: ln(H 1/atm)=−(5286±100)T+(18.4±0.3); acetaldehyde: ln(H 1/atm)=−(5671±22)/T+(20.4±0.1); and acetonitrile: ln(H 1/atm)=−(4106±101)/T+(13.8±0.3). Artificial seawater of 3.5% salinity in place of deiionized water raisesH 1 by about 15%. A similar technique has been used to measure the equilibrium constants for the addition compounds of acetone and acetaldehyde with bisulfite in aqueous solution. The results are ln(K 1/M −1)=(4972±318)/T−(11.2±1.1) and ln(K 1/M −1)=(6240±427)/T−(8.1±1.3), respectively. The results are compared and partly combined with other data in the literature to provide an average representation.
