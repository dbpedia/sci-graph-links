Abstract This article considers the problem of finding the optimal rule for assigning liability on the basis of fault when there is (a) error in the assessment of fault, (b) a probability distribution of true fault across the population of possible litigants, and (c) a value attached to the deterrence effect of a rule. The discussion is placed in the legal context of Contributory Negligence, and parallels are drawn between the present approach and the ‘economic’ approach to liability. A contributory negligence rule is said to be optimal if it minimizes a weighted sum of the cost of assessment error and the cost of the deviation between a rule and the ‘optimally deterrent’ rule. It is shown that the form of the optimal rule depends on the ‘importance’ of deterrence and on the probability distribution of plaintiffs with respect to fault. Sufficient conditions are given for each of the extant contributory negligence rules to approximate the optimal rule. It is argued that, in designing the law, the preference among rules should be based on the relative plausibility of these sufficient conditions, some of which may be verifiable empirically.
