Abstract Cooperation is one of the most important factors in organizations. The mechanisms of cooperation remain an important area of research. Barnard analyzed the principle of cooperation but not the mechanism of cooperation, because he considered the abilities of each individual to be equal. However, not all individuals are equal, therefore we examine how connections work within a cooperative network organization when individuals are unequal in ability. We apply a percolation model of a network organization to examine the connection law under the condition of unequal abilities of individuals. The conditions of connection will take on more significance in the age of information technology than ever before.
