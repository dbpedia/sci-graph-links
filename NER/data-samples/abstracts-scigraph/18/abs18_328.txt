Summary Palladium forms a violet-red complex with pentane-2∶4-bis-(o-mercaptophenyl)-anil at pH 1.5 to 3.0. The complex has an absorption maximum at 510 nm. Beer's law is obeyed over the range 2 to 16 p. p. m. of palladium, where the percent relative error per 1% absolute photometric error is 2.70%. Palladium combines with the reagent in the ratio of 1∶1. The calculated dissociation constant is of the order 10−6 at 25°. Palladium can be determined in the presence of large excess of foreign ions, both cations and anions.
