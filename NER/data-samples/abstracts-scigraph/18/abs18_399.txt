Summary There are increasing social pressures for a better environment and these are giving rise to an increasing body of case and statutory law related to waste disposal, pollution and health. Some of the inadequacies of past and present legislation and administration are described. The legal and environmental framework for the most common subsurface waste disposal methods is discussed. Some problem areas are highlighted. Of particular hindrance to satisfactory waste disposal and environmental protection is the fragmentary nature of the legislation and administration in Australia. The importance for legislation and administration of seeing waste disposal and its environmental interaction as a continuous process is emphasised. The various types of legal controls, both governmental and private, are described for Australia and to a lesser extent the U.S.A. Legal principles associated with private controls are highlighted and subsurface property right differences between U.S.A. and Australia are noted. Some trends in statutory and civil law are indicated for both countries and several amendments to Australian legislation are suggested.
