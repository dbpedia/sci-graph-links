Abstract We consider versions of the interpolation property stronger than the Craig interpolation property and prove the Lyndon interpolation property for the Grzegorczyk logic and some of its extensions. We also establish the Lyndon interpolation property for most extensions of the intuitionistic logic with Craig interpolation property. For all modal logics over the Grzegorczyk logic as well as for all superintuitionistic logics, the uniform interpolation property is equivalent to Craigâ€™s property.
