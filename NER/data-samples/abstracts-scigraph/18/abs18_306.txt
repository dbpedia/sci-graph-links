Summary A method of determining nitrate is described which involves extraction of tetraphenylphosphonium nitrate into chloroform and measurement of its absorbance at 269 nm. Beer's law is obeyed over the range 0â€“100 ppm. Interferences have been investigated. The application of the method to water analysis is discussed.
