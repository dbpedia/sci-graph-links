Abstract We look for fluctuations expected for the QCD critical point using an intermittency analysis in the transverse momentum phase space of protons produced around midrapidity in the 12.5 % most central C+C, Si+Si and Pb+Pb collisions at the maximum SPS energy of 158A GeV. We find evidence of power-law fluctuations for the Si+Si data. The fitted power-law exponent $$\phi _{2} = 0.96^{+0.38}_{-0.25}\text { (stat.)}$$ ϕ2=0.96-0.25+0.38(stat.) $$\pm $$ ± $$0.16\text { (syst.)}$$ 0.16(syst.) is consistent with the value expected for critical fluctuations. Power-law fluctuations had previously also been observed in low-mass $$\pi ^+ \pi ^-$$ π+π- pairs in the same Si+Si collisions.
