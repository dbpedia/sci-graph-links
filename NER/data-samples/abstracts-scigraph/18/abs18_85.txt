Abstract: The realisation of the European Single Market results in the fact that more and more national legal rules originate in guidelines, ordinances and decisions of the European Union (EU). In its resolution of 7 May 1985 which refers to a ”New Approach” in the field of technical harmonisation and standardisation, the European Council decided a division of work between the European legislator and private standardisation. Also in the field of GMO Monitoring, the central requirements are made in Brussels with the European Directive on deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment 2001/18/EC and the accompanying regulations. VDI Guidelines published in German and English language serve as the German point of view in the European standardisation process. CEN/TC 264 decided at its last plenary meeting in June 2006 with Resolution 459 to establish a new working group (WG 29 “Ambient air – Monitoring of genetically modified organisms”) to work on GMO Monitoring including monitoring of pollen. Until November 2007 all members of WG 29 are asked to provide all relevant information about pollen sampling techniques to develop first drafts.
