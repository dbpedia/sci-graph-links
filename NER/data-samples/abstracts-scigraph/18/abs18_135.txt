Summary Let μ n →μ be a weakly converging sequence of Borel probability measures on a topological space X. We prove the existence of an almost surely converging sequence of random variables ξ n →ξ which obey this laws, if a certain μ-dependent countability property of the topology holds. Especially this is the case if(a) X is second countable(b) X is first countable and μ has countable support(c) X is metrizable and μ is τ-smooth. A final example disproves the existence of such random variables for (tight) measures on a Lusin space.
