Abstract Beer’s law plots are commonly straight-line graphs in which absorbance is plotted versus concentration. The errors in such a plot are accentuated in the high-absorbance region due to the logarithmic transformation. This paper discusses the errors inherent in all Beer’s law plots and the choices the student has available: the use of either linear or nonlinear plotting methods. An experiment is described in which student Beer’s law data are treated in several ways to find out if transformation errors are significant. The conclusion is that if the absorbance values obtained for the calibration data exceed A=1, then nonlinear regression or weighted linear regression is indicated.
