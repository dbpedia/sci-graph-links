Summary Two visible spectrophotometric methods are described for the determination of uranium(VI) with 3-thianaphthenoyltrifluoroacetone at aph of 6.0. The effect due toph, time, solvents, reagent concentration and diverse ions are reported. Beer's law is obeyed in both cases and the molar extinction coefficients at 408 and 446 nm are 1.7·104 and 2.3·103 respectively.
