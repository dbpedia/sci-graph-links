Abstract The article is based on a previous suggestion by the author to introduce a new temperature scale â€” named after the German physicist Boltzmann. The proposition is repeated in short, then some practical consequencies are demonstrated. The ideal gas law will take on a simpler form and the molar heat capacities will turn into dimensionless quantities. The universal gas constant and the Boltzmann constant are shown to be superfluous conversion factors. It is further demonstrated how an empirical scale for the Boltzmann temperature can be established and how dimensional analysis can be performed. Some examples from statistical mechanics show that the Boltzmann temperature is well suited when deducing the basic relations in this field. It is emphasized that the proposition does not affect the theory of thermodynamics, it only draws conclusions from well known facts. In traditional thermodynamics the so-called barometric equation is taken to actually measure the Boltzmann constant. Such measurement has no meaning in the Boltzmann temperature idiom, the result of the measurement is in this notion the Loschmidt (Avogadro) number. The molar entropy becomes a pure, dimensionless number, a property which corresponds well to the real nature of entropy. The relation to the thermodynamic probability of a state is established, and a different form of the Boltzmann equation S=k In W is given.
