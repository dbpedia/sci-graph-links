Summary The transplantation of organs and parts of organs is regulated by statutory law since 1997. Contracts governed by public law and guidelines of the German „Bundesärztekammer“ complete it. These regulations provide, through detailed regulation, for more certainty as to what the law is and furthermore secure a certain quality standard and transparency. It was hoped that it would lead to a greater willingness to donate organs. The legal certainty has been achieved as well as a certain quality standard. Organs donated from dead people however has decreased. On the other hand, at least the willigness of living persons to donate a kidney is increasing, namely under relatives or married couples.
