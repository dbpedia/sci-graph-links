Summary This work is concerned with the existence and uniqueness of a class of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions which live in the non-negative orthant of ℝ d . Loosely speaking, such a process has a semimartingale decomposition such that in the interior of the orthant the process behaves like a Brownian motion with a constant drift and covariance matrix, and at each of the (d-1)-dimensional faces that form the boundary of the orthant, the bounded variation part of the process increases in a given direction (constant for any particular face) so as to confine the process to the orthant. For historical reasons, this “pushing” at the boundary is called instantaneous reflection. In 1988, Reiman and Williams proved that a necessary condition for the existence of such a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) is that the reflection matrix formed by the directions of reflection be completely-L. In this work we prove that condition is sufficient for the existence of an SRBM and that the SRBM is unique in law. It follows from the uniqueness that an SRBM defines a strong Markov process. Our results have potential application to the study of diffusions arising as approximations tomulti-class queueing networks.
