Abstract Our aim is to present some limit theorems for capacities. We consider a sequence of pairwise negatively correlated random variables. We obtain laws of large numbers for upper probabilities and 2-alternating capacities, using some results in the classical probability theory and a non-additive version of Chebyshevâ€™s inequality and Boral-Contelli lemma for capacities.
