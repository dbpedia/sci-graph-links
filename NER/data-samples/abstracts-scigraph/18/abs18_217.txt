Summary Conditions have been established for the extraction of iridium (III) and osmium(VIII) as their phenanthrenequinone monoximates into molten naphthalene. The naphthalene is allowed to solidify, separated by filtration, dried with filter paper and dissolved in chloroform. The absorbance is measured at 470 nm for iridium and 475 nm for osmium. Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration ranges 3.2–38.6μg of iridium and 1.0–10.9μg of osmium in 10 ml of chloroform. The molar absorptivities are 2.3×104 and 8.8×104l. mole−1.cm−1 for iridium and osmium respectively. The optimum pH range for the extraction is 4.6–7.4 for iridium and 6.8–10.5 tor osmium. Interferences have been studied in detail and the method successfully applied to various synthetic mixtures. The two metals can be determined sequentially (in the absence of interfering ions), osmium first.
