Abstract Subject of the investigation are the implications of a special nonlinear hardening law on the continuity of the slopes of stresses and strains at the elastic-plastic border in plane problems with rotational symmetry. The hardening law under consideration is a nonlinear generalization of linear hardening frequently used by experimenters. The general results are illustrated by means of the cylindrical vessel under internal pressure and the shrink fit.
