Abstract. We consider a Markov chain that describes the evolution of two interacting strings of symbols. The transitions probalitities of this Markov chain depend only on the rightmost symbols of both strings. The main goal of the present paper is to prove a limit theorem (stabilization law): the distribution of the rightmost symbols converges to some limit correlation function.
