Abstract Along with economic reform, civil dispute resolution in China has developed into many channels. Utilizing representative data from a nationwide survey, this study examined which dispute resolution channels people actually used or intended to use and what factors were associated with their choices. The results showed that Chinese people responded to civil disputes in various ways, and the disparity between the intention and action was huge. Both the intended and actual use of the law varied based on gender and education. In addition, income, being farmers, dissatisfaction with justice, and out-group trust were related to intended use of civil dispute resolution.
