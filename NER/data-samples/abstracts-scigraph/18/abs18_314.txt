Summary A spectrophotometric method for the determination of uranyl ion is proposed which is based on the use of ammonium 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioate as the chromogenic reagent. Conformity to Beer's law was observed for the range between 0 to 50 ppm of uranium when spectrophotometric measurements are made at 385 nm.
