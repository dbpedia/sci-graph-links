Abstract This article examines the book, Australian Charter of Employment Rights. The book is an edited collection of work from a number of prominent employment relations’ academics and practitioners across Australia. By drawing upon both Australian and international employment rights the book allows for a critique of current and prospective legislation within Australia. This article highlights key parts of the book that should be of interest to both Australian and international readers. A great deal of the book’s content is based on international conventions concerned with equitable principles which the authors suggest should govern the workplace, for example: a workplace free of discrimination; dignity at work; fair minimum standards and effective dispute resolution. This author contends that the book should be considered by policymakers when drafting new Australian industrial relations policy. It is a welcome addition to scholarship in this field.
