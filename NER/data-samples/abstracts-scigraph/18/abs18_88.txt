Summary An extension of Fourier's law to simple materials of the differential type and of complexity one is proposed. The formulation rests on Meixner's theory wherein the Clausius-Duhem inequality is replaced by the so-called fundamental inequality. The canonical form of the extended Fourier law is derived by application of the principle of material indifference. The results are compared with those obtained previously byFox [1] on other bases.
