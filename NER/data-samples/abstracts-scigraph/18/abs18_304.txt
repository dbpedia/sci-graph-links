Summary p-Sulphobenzeneazo-4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypyridine) reacts with vanadium to form an orange-red coloured complex having maximum absorbance at 530 nm. The reaction is slow at room temperature, it is complete at 40–45° C in 5 min. The effects of temperature, time, pH, reagent concentration, and other variables have been studied. The system obeys Beer's law over the concentration range of 1–12μg vanadium(V) ml−1. The molar absorptivity is 5.453 x 103l·mole−1·cm−1. The metal:ligand ratio of 1∶2 was confirmed by Job's continuous variation and mole ratio methods.
