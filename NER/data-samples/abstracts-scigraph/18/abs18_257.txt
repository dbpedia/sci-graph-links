Summary A Spectrophotometric method for determination of the aminoglycoside antibiotics tobramycin, apramycin and kanamycin in formulations has been developed. The method is based on the formation in slightly acidic medium of an ion-pair between the protonated antibiotic and the anionic form of Bromothymol Blue. The ionpair is extracted with chloroform and the absorbance measured at 430 nm. Beer's law is followed in the range 1−5×10−3 M.
