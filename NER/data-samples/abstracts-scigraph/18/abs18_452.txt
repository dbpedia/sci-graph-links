Abstract The shapes of invariant differential cross section for identified $$\pi ^{\pm },K^{\pm }, p$$ π±,K±,p and $$\overline{p}$$ p¯ production as a function of transverse momentum measured in $$pp$$ pp collisions by the PHENIX detector are analyzed in terms of a recently introduced approach. Simultaneous fits of these data to the sum of exponential and power-law terms show a significant difference in the exponential term contributions. This effect qualitatively explains the observed shape of the experimental $$K/\pi $$ K/π and $$p/\pi $$ p/π yield ratios measured as a function of transverse momentum of produced hadrons. A picture with two types of mechanisms for hadron production is presented. Universality of the power-law term behavior for $$\pi ^{\pm },K^{\pm }, p$$ π±,K±,p , and $$\overline{p}$$ p¯ production is shown.
