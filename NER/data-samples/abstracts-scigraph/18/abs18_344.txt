Summary Let there be given a spatial or plane system of rigid rods having freely movable connections at their endpoints, the knots of the system. Such a framework is called shaky if there exists a nonisometric infinitesimal deformation of its knots which preserves the lengths of the rods. In this paper it is shown that shakiness is preserved under affine and projective transformations The method of proof gives an easy interpretation of this invariance property and leads to the construction of new shaky frameworks in space from plane ones. Furthermore it shows that there is no theoretical reason to restrict the investigations to low-dimensional ambient spaces.
