Abstract In our recent publication (Pramana â€“ J. Phys. 79, 81 (2012), DOI: 10.1007/s12043-012-0285-6), our statement on adaptive antisynchronization (AS) controller design is incorrect. In this erratum we propose a correct control law. The corresponding proof is also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
