Summary Cupric chloride-triphenylphosphine complex gives red color witho-phenylenediamine having maximum absorption at 505–520 nm and 0.5μg/ml as visual limit of identification. The reaction is specific foro-phenylenediamine and obeys Beer's law (1 to 10μg/ml). This reaction provides the basis of a new method for the Spectrophotometric determination ofo-phenylenediamine inμg quantities. Ruthenium trichloride-triphenylphosphine complex gives blue color withp-phenylenediamine having maximum absorption at 580 nm and 2μg/ml as visual limit of identification. On the basis of this color reaction a Spectrophotometric method for the determination ofp-phenylenediamine in hair dyes is described. The recovery of the dye from commercial preparations is better than 97%. Other organic compounds do not interfere.
