Summary An approximate solution for the prediction of the power-law fluid flow behaviour in the entrance region of a straight channel has been presented. This has been achieved by solving a hydrodynamically equivalent model of developing two-dimensional Newtonian flow in a channel by momentum integral method. The analysis leads to closed form expressions for the flow characteristics. A comparison of the predictions with other solutions has also been incorporated.
