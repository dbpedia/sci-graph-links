Conclusion To correlate the two sections of this review it appears that the stomatal mechanism is self regulatory. If, as above, we define the stomata as functioning when they are open and quiescent when they are closed,their principal function is to regulate that very factor which is presumed to regulate them, viz.the concentration of CO 2 in the leaf or, respectively, in the guard cells.
