Abstract Fortnightly fruit fly captures for a 2-year period at Cooloola (south-east Queensland) contained 11 species. Three species, viz., D. tryoni, D. neohumeralis and D. endiandrae predominated. The peak trap catches of 7 species corresponded with the peak fruiting times of their major hosts. There was no direct relationship between temperature and rainfall and the variations in population numbers. The host plants of some species do not grow in the Cooloola area and there is evidence that large numbers of flies migrate into the region from other breeding areas up to 100 km away. Pockets of tropical rainforest such as Cooloola could be important adult fruit fly feeding areas even in the absence of larval host plants.
