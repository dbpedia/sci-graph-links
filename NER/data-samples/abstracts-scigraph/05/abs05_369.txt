Abstract. A new technique (Aerial Video Manta Analysis) was developed for the rapid assessment of mangrove degradation due to logging and conversion for shrimp aquaculture. Video recordings were made of mangroves along the Andaman Sea coastline, Thailand, during a 2-day aerial survey (16–17 September 1997) in a small Cessna 206 aircraft at an altitude of 800–1,000 feet and flying speed of 100 knots/h. The video recordings were analysed following a modified Manta-Tow technique, originally developed for coral reef surveys. The percentage cover of good mangrove stands, mangrove areas degraded by logging, and mangrove areas converted into shrimp farms, was estimated for each consecutive 1-min interval of video playing time. The analysis revealed that 9.9±2.2% of the mangroves along the Andaman coastline were severely degraded by logging and 23.3±1.9% had been converted for shrimp farming (a total of 3,255±370 shrimp ponds were counted). The encroachment for shrimp farming was most severe (34%) in Krabi Province, while Phang-nga Province had the most (75%) good mangroves. These results demonstrate that illegal development of new shrimp farms along the Andaman Sea coast has been substantial in recent years. The results obtained by four independent observers using this new method were remarkably close (SD≤25% of mean). The new method allowed cheap, rapid and accurate evaluation of the status of the mangrove resources over a long stretch of coastline within a time-span of a few days. Aerial Video Manta Analysis is a valuable tool to support coastal conservation and management efforts.
