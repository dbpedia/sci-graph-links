Summary The distribution pattern of serotonin (5HT) in the pancreas was studied immunohistochemically by using a 5HT monoclonal antibody in various vertebrates including the eel, bullfrog, South African clawed toad, turtle, chicken, mouse, rat, guinea-pig, cat, dog and human. In all species examined, except the bullfrog, 5HT-like immunoreactivity was observed in nerve fibers, in endocrine cells, or in both. Positive nerve fibers were found in the eel, turtle, mouse, rat and guinea-pig. These fibers ran mainly along the blood vessels and partly through the gap between the exocrine glands. In the eel and guinea-pig, positive fibers invaded the pancreatic islet. Occasionally, these positive fibers were found adjacent to the surface of both exocrine and endocrine cells, suggesting a regulatory role of 5HT in pancreatic function. 5HT-positive endocrine cells were observed in the pancreas of all species except for the bullfrog and rat. In the eel and in mammals such as the mouse, guinea-pig, cat, dog and human, 5HT-positive cells were mainly observed within the pancreatic islet. In the South African clawed toad, turtle and chicken, the positive cells were mainly in the exocrine region. The present study indicates that the distribution patterns of 5HT in the pancreas varies considerably among different species.
