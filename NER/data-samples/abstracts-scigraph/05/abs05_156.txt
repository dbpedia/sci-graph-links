Abstract Kennedia coccinea (Curtis) Vent. (Fabaceae) is a floriferous vine endemic to southwest Western Australia, and plays an important role in ecological restoration of forest understorey following disturbance from logging and mining activities. We developed 11 new microsatellite markers to allow analyses of genetic diversity and population structure to inform seed sourcing strategies for revegetation. Moderate levels of diversity were detected in two natural populations, where the total number of alleles per locus ranged from 4 to 23 (mean 12), and expected and observed heterozygosity were 0.724 and 0.553 respectively. Deviation from Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium and/or null alleles were observed in one or both populations for six loci, and linkage disequilibrium between some pairs of loci occurred in one population.
