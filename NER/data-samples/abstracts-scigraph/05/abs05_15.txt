Abstract Human activities accelerate the input of plant nutrients sourced from agriculture, industrial waste, and sewage in the Hooghly River at the land ocean boundary of Indian Sunderban mangrove (21°32′–22°40′ N and 88°05′–89° E). This study reports seasonal fluctuations in the phytoplankton assemblage and the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and key environmental parameters in a highly eutrophic system. As far as seasonal perspective, the Hooghly estuarine system dominated by mangrove suffered complete change in terms of phytoplankton and other key parameters during monsoon compared to other times of the year. Diatoms were more abundant than dinoflagellates throughout all seasons with 58 species.
