Abstract Korea has large diversity in Lilium germplasm and approximately 15 different species of lilies grow naturally. In present study, a comprehensive evaluation of habitat associations and distribution patterns of Lilium tsingtauense in Korea was carried out. A total of 26 natural habitats of L. tsingtauense were investigated and data regarding its ecological and morphological characteristics under different geological and environmental conditions were collected. During survey it was observed that this species was well distributed nationwide with highly variable altitudes such as Jindo Island (82 m) and Mt. Jiri (1182 m). Most (84%) of natural habitats of this species were found in the northern slopes of mountains and the remainder (15%) habitats were present in the southern regions. Flowers with upward facing had no fragrance and flowering time of this species was in between early July to mid-July. Colonies of Larix leptolepis, as well as 106 other plant species, were mainly found in these natural habitats. The soil was strongly acidic, within the pH range of 4.3-5.3. EC, organic content, total-nitrogen content, and CEC varied among natural habitats. Most of the soils of the natural habitats were sandy loam with low clay ratios. This study can provide baseline information regarding the effective exploitation and use of L. tsingtauense resources for breeding research.
