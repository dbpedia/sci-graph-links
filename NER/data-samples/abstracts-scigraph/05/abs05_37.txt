Summary Data on mammalian, avian and invertebrate biomass in mixed broadleaf-podocarp forest of the Orongorongo Valley are summarised and compared with the biomass in other forests. Animal biomass totalled at least 504 kg/ha â€” more than twice that in several tropical forests but less than that reported from temperate deciduous forests of Europe. Earthworms (333 kg/ha) provided most animal biomass: arthropods at least 145 kg/ha, mammals (all introduced) 25 kg/ha, and birds 0.6 kg/ha. By world standards the biomass of mammals, and litter-dwelling and underground arthropods, is high and that of birds moderate. Introduced mammals have greatly altered the distribution of biomass in this forest, herbivores and predatory mammals gaining biomass at the expense of some native aboveground invertebrates and birds, several of which have been lost to this community.
