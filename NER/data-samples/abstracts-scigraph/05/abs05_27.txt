Abstract Eucalyptus urophylla (Timor mountain gum) is an economically important plantation species that occurs naturally in a series of disjunct populations on the volcanic slopes of seven islands in eastern Indonesia. Twelve microsatellite markers were used to investigate the distribution of nuclear genetic diversity among 19 geographically defined E. urophylla populations. High levels of gene diversity were observed throughout the geographic range (H E = 0.703 to 0.776). The level of genetic differentiation among populations was low (F ST = 0.031), but the amount of differentiation increased with geographic distance. A phenogram produced by a neighbor-joining analysis illustrated that populations clustered according to islands. However, a Bayesian clustering approach revealed a more cryptic population structure comprising two genetically homogeneous groups. Gene flow among the populations is likely responsible for the apparent weak influence of geographic insularity on the genetic diversity and structure of the island species. These findings provide direction for conservation and breeding strategies in E. urophylla.
