Abstract The goal of this study was to evaluate the relative influence of terrestrial habits, season, and host body size on the species richness and abundance of helminth parasites in the toad Melanophryniscus klappenbachi, for which a greater abundance of nematode parasites was expected. A total of 90 toads were collected in the Chaco Province, Argentina. The helminth community found in infected toads included 17 taxa and was dominated particularly by larval parasites. Contrary to our expectations, nematode species showed lower values of infection parameters. Infected toads harbored a maximum of seven species, and the mean helminth richness was 3.16 ± 1.66 species per infected toads. Season played a significant effect on determining the species richness and abundance of the parasite infracommunity. Similarly, the prevalence of infection of several helminth species (8/47 %) varied greatly over time. Host body size was the main factor in determining the infrapopulation structure of helminth parasites. Species richness was significantly and negatively correlated with host body size. Strong associations were observed mainly between larvae of some species. The transmission strategies of parasites suggest that this bufonid acquires infections through direct contact with larval parasites from aquatic and terrestrial habitats and by ingestion of infective larvae. The characteristic of the host tegument, such as the presence of alkaloids, could significantly contribute to the low occurrence of infection by skin-penetrating nematodes. Results also showed that diets and mobility of the host and the local microhabitat conditions play an important role in parasitic infections of toads.
