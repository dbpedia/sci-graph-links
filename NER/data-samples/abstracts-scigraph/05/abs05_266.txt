Abstract The importance of the amphibian skin for eliminating CO2 was tested by measuring the blood pH of B. REGULARIS placed for varying periods in buffer solutions (pH 7.0 and 4.9) or swathed in latex. Blood pH did not vary from pH 7.5, except after being swathed in latex, when it dropped to pH 6.5. Respiratory movements were significantly lower when toads were submerged than when they were breathing air, and lower in water at 20°C and in the buffer solutions than in water at 30°C. It is concluded that pulmonary and cutaneous respiration are closely adjusted in this species.
