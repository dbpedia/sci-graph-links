Abstract Key messageAfter determining the distribution pattern of the native species of maples in Iran, the conservation status of each species and the significant features of their habitats were defined. AbstractThe climatic requirements, distribution patterns, biogeography and conservation status of native maples of Iran were reviewed in this study. Acer L. (Sapindaceae) includes about 126 species distributed worldwide, but mainly in eastern North America and eastern Asia. Eight species of the genus are in Iran, most of which are in the northern part of the country. Using ArcGIS software, three distribution maps for each species were depicted. Thirty-second resolution DEM was used to depict elevation maps. Climate data for the recent 44Â years in Iran were used to extract the mean annual values of precipitation and temperature and to produce related maps. To determine the edaphic features in the habitats, HWSD software was employed. Based on the results, the Hyrcanian forests, with seven species, are the most species-rich regions for maples in Iran. With two species each, the Arasbaran and Zagros forests are considered to be the next most important habitats. As the most adaptable species, Acer monspessulanum is the only species distributed nearly throughout the country. Using GeoCAT to assess threatened categories, the conservation status of Acer in Iran was investigated. According to the results, three species can potentially be assessed as threatened. Based on the distribution maps and conservation categories, this research provides explicit information about the species of Acer in Iran that can be applied to conservation planning and natural resource management.
