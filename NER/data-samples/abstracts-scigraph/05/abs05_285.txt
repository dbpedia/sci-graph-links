Abstract Parasitism is the main ecological constraint for wildlife and represents an important factor in conservation, especially for endangered species like the maned wolf. This canid species is infested by several endo- and ectoparasites; however, the association of multiple parasites is a rare condition in wild or captive animals. This study reports the first case of multiparasitism in a wild maned wolf from Central–West Brazil. An adult male was captured in a Cerrado fragment in Brasília city and taken to the veterinary hospital of the Zoo. The animal died after 5 days of treatment. On clinical examination the presence of myiasis in two areas of injury, later identified as the larvae parasite Cochliomyia hominivorax, was observed. Also present were the body of the male ticks Amblyomma tigrinum and one female A. ovale. Stained blood smears were prepared with Giemsa to identify the presence and morphology of a haemoparasite, Babesia canis. Following necropsy examination of the abdominal cavity, a female nematode, Dioctophyma renale, was found. In the right kidney only the renal capsule remained, and within this was another female nematode. This is the first report of multiparasitism in a maned wolf and is the first case of babesiosis in the veterinary literature in this threatened animal.
