Abstract The ectomycorrhizal status of Keteleeria species is reported for the first time based on morphological and molecular analyses of root tips from southwestern China. Based on internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequences, we detected 26 ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal species on roots of Keteleeria evelyniana and Keteleeria davidiana collected from natural sites and a botanical garden in Kunming, China. These ECM symbionts represent six fungal lineages, including /russula–lactarius, /inocybe, /sebacina, /tomentella–thelephora, /wilcoxina, and /cenococcum. Our results provide the first evidence of ECM formation by Keteleeria and also supply ecologically important information for conservation and restoration efforts to recover populations of Keteleeria.
