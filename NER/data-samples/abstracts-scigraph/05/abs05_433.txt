Summary Genetic variability and similarity were examined in eight populations of the Kentucky cave beetle Neaphaenops tellkampfii (Coleoptera: Carabidae) using the technique of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results indicate that N. tellkampfii has high genetic variation within and high genetic similarity among local populations. These results are in sharp contrast to the patterns of low variability and similarity reported for other cave dwelling species in the same region. It is concluded that the differences in genetical population structure among cave species in the Central Kentucky Karst are related to ecological differences among the species.
