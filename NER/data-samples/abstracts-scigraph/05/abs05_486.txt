Abstract Salinity caused by land clearing is an important cause of land degradation in the Western Australian wheatbelt. Returning a proportion of the cleared land to higher water use perennial vegetation is one option for reducing or slowing the salinisation of land. Over the course of a year patterns of water use by Eucalyptus kochii subsp borealis (C. Gardner) D. Nicolle, a mallee eucalypt species, were monitored in three landscape positions with different water availability. One treatment had groundwater at 2 m, a second at 4.5 m and a third had groundwater below a silcrete hardpan thought to be impenetrable to roots. Hydraulic redistribution was observed in all landscape positions, and rates were positively correlated with the magnitude of soil water potential gradients within the soil. High rates of hydraulic redistribution, facilitated by abundant deep water may increase tree water use by wetting surface soils and reducing stomatal closure. This effect may be countered by increased soil evaporation of water moved from root to soil following hydraulic redistribution; the net volumes of redistributed water though lateral roots was calculated to be the equivalent of up to 27% of transpiration.
