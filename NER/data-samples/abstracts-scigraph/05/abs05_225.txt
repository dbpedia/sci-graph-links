Summary The covariant operators which may serve for the description of the spin of a Dirac field are considered, and their physical meaning discussed, with the aim of investigating the associated conservation laws in the case of an interacting spinor field. Particular attention is given to the case of a Dirac field interacting with an assigned electromagnetic field. Other operators, containing explicitly the coordinates, are then introduced, which also commute with the Dirac operatorD = γ π δπ -m and lead therefore to conservation laws for a free spinor field. The validity of these conservation laws in the case of an interacting spinor field is again investigated, with a particular emphasis on the case when the source of interaction consists of an assigned electromagnetic field.
