Abstract Diaphanosoma brachyurum (Cladocera: Sididae) is a common limnetic species in summer-temperate and tropical water bodies. Few studies have investigated the sensitivity of D. brachyurum to toxic chemicals despite this species often being dominant in natural lakes and ponds. We performed acute toxicity tests of three heavy metals, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd), to D. brachyurum. For D. brachyurum, the lethal concentration (LC)50 values of Cu (24-h LC50 = 16.4 μg/L, 48-h LC50 = 10.4 μg/L) and Zn (24-h LC50 = 253.4 μg/L, 48-h LC50 = 174.1 μg/L) were lower than those for D. magna, one of the most used test organisms for toxic chemicals. On the other hand, for D. brachyurum the 24-h LC50 of Cd (166.4 μg/L) was much greater than that for D. magna, and the 48-h LC50 of Cd (69.8 μg/L) was comparable. Our results indicate that D. brachyurum may be more strongly influenced by Zn and Cu than is D. magna. It is likely that the summer plankton community in which Diaphanosoma species is dominant is more sensitive to heavy metals than a community in which Daphnia species are dominant.
