Abstract Tillandsia subg.Pseudalcantarea (Bromeliaceae) includes four species as currently delimited. The phylogenetic relationships of the species in this group are investigated by a cladistic analysis using 16 morphological characters, withVriesea subg.Alcantarea employed as the outgroup.Tillandsia subg.Pseudalcantarea is found to be paraphyletic.Tillandsia grandis andT. paniculata are transferred toTillandsia subg.Tillandsia because they are hypothesized to share a more recent common ancestor withT. utriculata, the type of the genus, than they do with the other two species placed in subg.Pseudalcantarea, i.e.,T. baliophylla andT. viridiflora. These latter two species possibly constitute a basal clade withinTillandsia and are provisionally retained within subg.Pseudalcantarea.
