Abstract. In Pakistan, mangrove forests are found in the Indus delta in Sindh and the coastal areas of Sonmiani, Kalmat and Gawatar bay in Balochistan. Sonmiani is the only place along the coast of Pakistan where three species of mangroves [Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh, Ceriops tagal (Perr.) C.B Robinson and Rhizophora mucronata Lam.] exist naturally. Beside their ecological importance they have a very significant role in the lives of coastal dwellers. People who live along the coast utilize this resource for fuel, construction of houses and fodder. Different techniques were developed to restore the mangrove ecosystem through community participation.
