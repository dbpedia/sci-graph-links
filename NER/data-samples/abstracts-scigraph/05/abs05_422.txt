Abstract Semi-natural grasslands in Europe are insect biodiversity hotspots and important source habitats delivering ecosystem services to adjacent agricultural land by species spillover. However, this spillover might also occur in the opposite direction, affecting the diversity of semi-natural grasslands. This opposite spillover has got little attention in scientific literature even though generalist species penetrating into the grasslands can affect local biotic interactions, community composition and the conservation value of grassland habitats. In this study, we examined spillover effects from two different adjacent habitat types on carabid beetle assemblages in 20 semi-natural calcareous grasslands. The grasslands were either adjacent to a cereal crop field or to a coniferous forest. We found distinct differences in carabid beetle assemblages in calcareous grasslands depending on adjacent habitat type. Species richness and activity density were higher, but the evenness was lower in calcareous grasslands adjacent to crop fields compared with calcareous grasslands adjacent to coniferous forests. Further, we found a strong spillover of carabid beetles from adjacent crop fields after crop harvest, which may result in transiently increased predation pressure and resource competition in calcareous grasslands. Our results highlight that species composition, diversity and presumably ecosystem functions within semi-natural habitats are affected by the type and management of surrounding habitats. This needs to be considered by nature conservation measures, which aim to protect the unique insect communities of semi-natural European grasslands.
