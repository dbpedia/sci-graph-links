Summary The effects of low water supplementation and nutrients on the aboveground biomass production of annual plants was tested in the field by mimicking small rainfall events of 5mm per month and by adding fertilizers to experimental quadrats. Field measurements were made during an extremely dry year, so the potential additional effects of rainfall probably had no important effect on plant responses. Biomass of non-native species was higher in irrigated than in non-irrigated quadrats. No significant responses to irrigation treatments were detected in native species. This lack of response may be due to higher thresholds of watering being required for either germination and/or growth. Because of the low water inputs, fertilizer additions did not promote any biomass response in either native or non-native species. Responses of non-native species to low and frequent pulses of water, which is characteristic of this arid system, may be important for the persistence of these species in this environment.
