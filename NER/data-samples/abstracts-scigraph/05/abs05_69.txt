Abstract We analysed the soil nematode community within three different montados (agricultural, pastoral and forestry uses), focusing on temporal variation. Nematodes were classified into trophic groups (bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores, predators and plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN)) and we calculated the maturity index for free-living taxa (MI), maturity index for plant-parasitic taxa (PPI) and the nematode channel ratio (NCR). Temporal variations were most evident during winter when there was a rise in the abundance of the five functional groups. Concordantly, there was a simultaneous increase of soil moisture and organic matter, due to litter decomposition. Fungivore abundance was highest in the forest and the temporal occurrence and abundance of many PPN genera was largely determined by land use. Land management was responsible for differences in plant community structure and composition, thus plant diversity increased from the agricultural to the forestry use. Because the montado shows great temporal variability in vegetation structure our results of MI, PPI and PPI/MI ratio explain the significant changes in the nutritional status over time, with the highest values recorded in the spring. NCR is a good indicator of energy efficiency in the soil decomposition process. Its lowest values were attained in the forest, where the slow-growing plant species favoured a lower activity of the bacterial energy channel and a prevalence of the fungal-based decomposition energy channel. Nematode composition reflected plant succession, changes in decomposition in the soil food web and temporal variations in the structure of soil.
