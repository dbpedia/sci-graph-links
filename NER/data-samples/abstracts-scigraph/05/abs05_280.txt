Summary Soil animal communities contain a large number of species exhibiting a low degree of trophic specialization. Competition between animal species with similar food requirements is frequently reduced by partitioning habitat space and this ecological principle is demonstrated for woodland mite communities. Microhabitat diversity was determined for the litter (L), fermentation (F) and humus (H) sub-horizons using gelatine embedded soil sections and compared with mite species diversity for the same layers of the soil and litter profile. Cryptostigmata species diversity was correlated with microhabitat diversity (r=0.67, P<0.01) in six woodland soils with a range of humus forms. Intra-habitat relationships were determined for one site on two sampling occasions: in November an exceptionally high correlation was obtained (r=0.91, P<0.001) but samples collected in February showed a lower correlation (r=0.63, P<0.01). Within sub-horizon relationships showed significant correlations for the L (r=0.59, P<0.01) and H sub-horizons (r=0.72, P=0.001). The F sub-horizon data were more variable than the other two sub-horizons but a correlation of 0.60 (P=0.05) was obtained for the intrahabitat study.
