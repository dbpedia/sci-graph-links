Abstract Genetic variation at mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) and D-loop region reveals the evidence of population sub-structuring in Indian populations of highly endangered primitive feather-back fish Chitala chitala. Samples collected through commercial catches from eight riverine populations from different geographical locations of India were analyzed for cyt b region (307 bp) and D-loop region (636–716 bp). The sequences of the both the mitochondrial regions revealed high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity. The patterns of genetic diversity, haplotypes networks clearly indicated two distinct mitochondrial lineages and mismatch distribution strongly suggest a historical influence on the genetic structure of C. chitala populations. The baseline information on genetic variation and the evidence of population sub-structuring generated from this study would be useful for planning effective strategies for conservation and rehabilitation of this highly endangered species.
