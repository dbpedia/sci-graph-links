Abstract In Java and Kalimantan in Indonesia, river water plays important roles in human life; for example, for transportation, and economic activities of the inhabitants. However, industrial, agricultural and domestic water is discarded into rivers directly in many developing countries, including Indonesia, since drainage systems have not been completely constructed. In this study, to evaluate the water quality and to compare those levels of environmental contaminants in developing and developed countries, water quality and contents of endocrine disrupters were measured in a total of 64 water samples (Indonesia; 28 samples and Japan; 36 samples) from 53 sites. The results indicated that, rivers in both capital cities, Jakarta and Tokyo, were contaminated. Water in rivers in Indonesia was not so heavily polluted as in Japan. Pollution in the river water in Indonesia appeared to be caused by the lack of sewerage systems. In addition, the findings on endocrine disrupters indicated that the concentration of alkylphenol in water samples was large enough to affect living organisms.
