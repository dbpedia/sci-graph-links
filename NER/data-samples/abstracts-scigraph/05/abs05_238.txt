AbstractThe density, refractive index, and electrical permittivity of cyclohexylsulfamic acid in 1,4-dioxane solutions were measured at 298.15Â K. The limiting apparent specific volume, refraction, and polarization were calculated from the experimental data. The electrical dipole moment of cyclohexylsulfamic acid was estimated using the Debye, Onsager, and Kirkwood equations. The dipole association of cyclohexylsulfamic acid was treated with the assumption that the dipole moment of dimeric species is zero. The dimerization constant and dipole moment of monomeric species were evaluated. Graphical Abstract
