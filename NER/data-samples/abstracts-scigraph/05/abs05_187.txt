Summary A new species of oligotrophie, methionine-or cysteine-requiring yeast was isolated from ripening fruits of the AmazonianParahancornia amapa tree. This species resemblesCandida sorboxylosa and species ofIssatchenkia but is nonfermentative and forms abundant pseudomycelia. The new species was isolated only fromP. amapa fruits, and not from other fruits or the drosophilid vectors of the yeast community of the deteriorating fruit. The taxon is regarded as indigenous to the amapa fruit or inoculated by vectors other thanDrosophila before ripening. A description of the new speciesCandida amapae is given.
