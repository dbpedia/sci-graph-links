Abstract We present the normal baseline variation in haematology of 59 Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) collected from two high arctic sites in Nunavut, Canada. We found no differences between males and females in any haematological variable, but leukocyte profiles differed between non-breeding and breeding birds and also between breeding birds at different colonies. Breeding birds also had higher thrombocyte counts than non-breeders. Given that the Arctic is experiencing significant environmental changes due to climate warming, reference haematological values from seabirds may prove useful in monitoring the impacts on arctic ecosystems.
