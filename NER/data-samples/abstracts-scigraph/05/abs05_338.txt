Abstract Rates of water loss in dry air at room temperature (21±2°C) have been measured from seven species of forest-dwelling mygalomorph spiders. They range from 0.260% body wt h−1 in the tube-dwelling trapdoor spiderDyarcyops sp. (from the humid coastal regions of eastern Australia) to 0.030% wt h−1 inBrachypelma smithi (from drier environments in Mexico). There is a tendency for rates of transpiration to be related to the humidities of the spiders' normal environments and micro-habitats.
