Abstract The signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852), was recorded in the Slovak-Austrian stretch of the Morava (March) River in the ZÃ¡horie region in August 2006. This is the first confirmed record of a non-indigenous crayfish species of American origin in Slovakia. Most likely, signal crayfish were intentionally released to the river by Austrian fishermen, or invaded from adjacent water bodies in Austria. As this species has a substantial invasive capability and is a potential vector of the crayfish plague pathogen, it represents a threat to the native crayfish species and its spread should be monitored. Its invasion upstream to the territory of the Czech Republic is not unlikely in near future.
