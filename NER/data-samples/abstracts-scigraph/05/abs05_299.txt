Summary To investigate the influence of soil-borne pathogens on the population biology of a grassland species in natural vegetation, soil samples were collected, partly disinfected or sterilized and then planted with Plantago lanceolata. Those on some of the untreated soils showed growth reduction due to a biotic factor in the soil. This growth reduction was not associated with the density of P. lanceolata plants at the sampling sites. It was only visible when differences in abiotic factors — especially nutrient levels —were eliminated. In the natural situation the nutritional status of the soil has a far greater impact than biotic soil factors. Micro-organisms harmful to Plantago roots are considered to be of minor importance in the distribution of the individuals in the P. lanceolata population studied.
