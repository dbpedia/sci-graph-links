Abstract Plant–soil interactions directly affect plant success in terms of establishment, survival, growth and reproduction. Negative plant–soil feedback on such traits may therefore reduce the density and abundance of plants of a given species at a given site. Furthermore, if conspecific feedback varies among population sites, it could help explain geographic variation in plant population size. We tested for among-site variation in conspecific plant–soil feedback in a greenhouse experiment using seeds and soils from 8 natural populations of Lobelia siphilitica hosting 30–330 plants. The first cohort of seeds was grown on soil collected from each native site, while the second cohort was grown on the soil conditioned by the first. Our goal was to distinguish site-specific effects mediated by biotic and/or abiotic soil properties from those inherent in seed sources. Cohort 1 plants grown from seeds produced in small populations performed better in terms of germination, growth, and survival compared to plants produced in large populations. Plant performance decreased substantially between cohorts, indicating strong negative feedback. Most importantly, the strength of negative feedback scaled linearly (i.e., was less negative) with increasing size of the native plant population, particularly for germination and survival, and was better explained by soil- rather than seed-source effects. Even with a small number of sites, our results suggest that the potential for negative plant–soil feedback varies among populations of L. siphilitica, and that small populations were more susceptible to negative feedback. Conspecific plant–soil feedback may contribute to plant population size variation within a species’ native range.
