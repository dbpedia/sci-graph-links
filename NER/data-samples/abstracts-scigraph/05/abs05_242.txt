Summary The LDH isoenzyme pattern in oocytes, ova or fertilized eggs of 16 mammalian species belonging to five different taxonomic orders was demonstrated by micro disc electrophoresis. The results obtained point to the existence of two types of oocytes in mammals: while in species of the orders Rodentia and Lagomorpha only LDH1 (β subunits) is demonstrable, in species of the orders Carnivora and Artiodactly and in man LDH isoenzymes formed of α and β subunits are present in the oocyte. In a number of species, the LDH pattern was also studied in ova and fertilized eggs. No change in the isoenzyme pattern was seen during this developmental period. From this it is concluded that there is no uptake of LDH from the environment and that all LDH activity is due to storage products synthesized during oogenesis.
