Abstract Few studies have dealt so far with the macrophytic communities inhabiting the small Mediterranean rivers in South-East France. In order to fill this gap, it was proposed to assess the effects of natural and anthropic disturbances on the biodiversity in the lowland River Huveaune (South-East France). The Mediterranean climate in this region results in strong seasonal variations in the hydrological regime: there is a long dry period and sudden episodes of flooding occur, which greatly affect the plant community dynamics. The River Huveaune is severely polluted by organic matter. Two stations were set up, one in an upstream reference sector and the other in a downstream polluted sector. The standard sampling area of 100 m2 was divided into plots 4 m2 in size, some of which included part of the river and part of a bank. In addition, plant inventories were drawn up over distances of 50 and 100 m. Seventeen sampling campaigns were carried out from April 2002 to October 2003, resulting in the first systematic list of macrophyte species occurring in small Mediterranean rivers in South-Eastern France. The great variability of the hydrological factors involved leads to considerable spatial and temporal variations in the biodiversity. The upstream station was found to be less severely disturbed and to show a wider range of macrophytes than the downstream station: bryophytes predominate upstream and phanerogams and macroalgae, downstream. The Macrophyte Biological Index for River (IBMR) was tested and found to be a valid means of water quality assessment in small Mediterranean rivers.
