Abstract. It is a widely held view that plantations of exotic tree species in the tropics are harmful to the environment. Arguments are collected here from experience in tropical countries, showing that the canopies of exotic trees can exert protective functions and have a nurse effect for the regeneration of natural forest. This counterbalances the opinion that exotic tree plantations generally are detrimental.
