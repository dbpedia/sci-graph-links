Abstract Nudibranchs,Elysia chlorotica Gould, ranging from 5 mm to 28 mm in length, were identified for the first time at two locations in the Chesapeake Bay. This is a southward extension of its reported former range which was Massachusetts to New Jersey. A brief discussion of ecological data and activity associated with the organisms is presented.
