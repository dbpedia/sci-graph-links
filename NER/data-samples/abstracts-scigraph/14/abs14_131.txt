Abstract With this study, we analyzed two long-term precipitation time series recorded at Alpe Devero and Domodossola (Italian Western Alps) for two periods (1916–2010 and 1872–2010, respectively). The aims of the study were: to create the first precipitation time series covering more than 50 years for Alpe Devero, to extend and update the precipitation time series for Domodossola, to detect changes by means of trend analysis on the precipitation time series. After an accurate analysis of the metadata and the measurements recorded at each station, a trend analysis was performed on both datasets. The results showed a statistically significant decline in winter, summer, and annual precipitation at Alpe Devero and a nonsignificant decrease in seasonal and annual precipitation at Domodossola. Covering more than 90 years, the long-term precipitation time series at Alpe Devero and Domodossola represent unique data sets for this sector of Italian Western Alps. Continuing updating of the data could provide a useful resource for climate change studies in this area and, within a wider perspective, in Alpine regions.
