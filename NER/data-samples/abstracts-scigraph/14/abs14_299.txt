Abstract The alternative and graduated methods for estimation of fast-reversible effects of ethanol are compared. Estimation of the myorelaxing and anticonvulsive effects of ethanol by the alternative method can be used with some limitations for the effector analysis of ethanol pharmacokinetics. It is shown that the effector expectation of pharmacokinetic profile for ethanol based on the minimal effective doses of bicuculline inducing clonic convulsions and tonic extension is comparable to experimentally determined brain contents of14C-ethanol.
