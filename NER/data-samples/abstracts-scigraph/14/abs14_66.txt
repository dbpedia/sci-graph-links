Abstract The aim of this study was to establish population-based canine clinical chemistry reference values for the Hitachi 912 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) with regard to age, sex, breed, housing and intended use. Reference biochemistry values for 22 variables are presented from 308 clinical healthy dogs, 145 females and 163 males, approximately 1 month to 13 years of age and of various breeds. For each variable the data were examined for homogeneity and, when suspected, outliers were excluded using the range test. Non-parametric analysis was used to calculate the conventional central 95% interval. Then the two-sided non-parametric 0.9 confidence interval of each percentile was determined. Finally, the effects of subgrouping were examined using the Kruskalâ€“Wallis test and p <0.05 was considered significant. Significant age influences were found for 20 of the 22 variables, 14 showing clinical relevance. Significant breed effects could be found for 10 of the 22 parameters, including clinically relevant lower total protein concentrations for retrievers, lower lipase activity for sled dogs, lower total bilirubin concentrations for terriers and higher total bilirubin for Molossians. Differences between male and female were present for six of the 22 variables but had no clinical relevance. Housing and intended use influenced some of the values, but these differences were of no clinical significance. We successfully established canine clinical chemistry reference values for the Hitachi 912. The IFCC Recommendations on Reference Values offered a good framework for establishing standardised reference values, and make it possible for several laboratories to share the same values. Our results clearly indicate that subgrouping according to age and breed is necessary to obtain accurate reference values.
