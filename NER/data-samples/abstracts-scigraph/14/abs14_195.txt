Abstract We present a new approach of explaining instantaneous causality in multivariate fMRI time series by a state space model. A given single time series can be divided into two noise-driven processes, a common process shared among multivariate time series and a specific process refining the common process. By assuming that noises are independent, a causality map is drawn using Akaike noise contribution ratio theory. The method is illustrated by an application to fMRI data recorded under visual stimulation.
