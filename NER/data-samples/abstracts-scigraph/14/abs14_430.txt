Abstract A sequential adjustment procedure is proposed for the direct estimation of pointâ€”velocities in deformation analysis networks. At any intermediate stage of the adjustment the up-to-date covariance matrix of those velocities tells the evolving story of the network in terms of solvability and reliability. A pre-zero-epoch covariance matrix is utilized for a smooth and flexible treatment of two characteristic problems of deformation analysis:- high turnover of points in the network- processing variable and generally incomplete observational batches. A small numerical example is presented at the end as an illustration.
