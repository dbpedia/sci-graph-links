Abstract Pollen and spores are biological particles that are ubiquitous to the atmosphere and are pathologically significant, causing plant diseases and inhalant allergies. One of the main objectives of aerobiological surveys is forecasting. Prediction models are required in order to apply aerobiological knowledge to medical or agricultural practice; a necessary condition of these models is not to be chaotic. The existence of chaos is detected through the analysis of a time series. The time series comprises hourly counts of atmospheric pollen grains obtained using a Burkard spore trap from 1987 to 1989 at Mar del Plata. Abraham's method to obtain the correlation dimension was applied. A low and fractal dimension shows chaotic dynamics. The predictability of models for atomspheric pollen forecasting is discussed.
