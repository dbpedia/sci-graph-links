Abstract We develop a method for computing output shadow prices when total cost and input prices are exogenous, using the indirect output distance function of Shephard (1974). We show that indirect distance function shadow price imputations for output prices are the same to a proportional constant as marginal cost imputations. We motivate our results by relating them to the problem of valuing the output of nonprofit institutions, to some measurement issues for noncompetitive industries, and to a problem of imputing sales of the commercial banking industry to consuming sectors of the economy in the national income accounts.
