Abstract Electricity price is an important aspect in a restructured power market. Because of nonlinearity, nonstationary, and volatility of electricity price, it is highly essential to forecast the price on a short-term scale. This paper presents an efficient method based on a hybrid functional link dynamic neural network (DNN) trained by an adaptive robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed method forecasts hourly prices for the day-ahead electricity market. The functional block helps to introduce nonlinearity by expanding the input space to higher-dimensional space through a basis function without using any hidden layer like multilayer perceptron structure. The DNN includes one or more infinite impulse response filters in the forward path providing feedback connections between outputs and inputs. This allows signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. Also to improve the accuracy of the forecast, the noise covariance matrices of the UKF are adapted recursively. The proposed method is tested on PJM electricity market, and the residuals mean absolute error is compared with other forecasting methods, indicating the improved accuracy of the approach and its suitability to produce a real-time forecast. Further, to compare the accuracy of the forecast, an alternative UKF noise covariance optimization is attempted using differential evolution.
