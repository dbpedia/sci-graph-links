Abstract Few studies concerning the nutritional requirements of Deinococcus geothermalis DSM 11300 have been conducted to date. Three defined media compositions have been published for the growth of this strain but they were found to be inadequate to achieve growth without limitation. Furthermore, growth curves, biomass concentration and growth rates were generally not available. Analysis in Principal Components was used in this work to compare and consequently to highlight the main compounds which differ between published chemically defined media. When available, biomass concentration, and/or growth rate were superimposed to the PCA analysis. The formulations of the media were collected from existing literature; media compositions designed for the growth of several strains of Deinococcaceae or Micrococcaceae were included. The results showed that a defined medium adapted from Holland et al. (Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 72:1074–1082, 2006) was the best basal medium and was chosen for further studies. A growth rate of 0.03 h−1 and a final OD600nm of 0.55 were obtained, but the growth was linear. Then, the effects of several medium components on oxygen uptake and biomass production by Deinococcus geothermalis DSM 11300 were studied using a respirometry-based method, to search for the nutritional limitation. The results revealed that the whole yeast extract in the medium with glucose is necessary to obtain a non-limiting growth of Deinococcus geothermalis DSM 11300 at a maximum growth rate of 0.64 h−1 at 45 °C.
