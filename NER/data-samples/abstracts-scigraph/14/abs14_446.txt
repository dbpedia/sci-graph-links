Abstract The Bank of Canada may be one of the most important determinants of health within the reach of government policy. Throughout its last three governorships, the Bank has pursued a staunchly anti-inflationary policy. Near zero percent inflation has helped to maintain unemployment levels above all but one of Canada's partners in the Group of Seven nations. Although debate continues, the bulk of the published literature supports a strong relationship between unemployment and ill health. Unfortunately, recent Governors have promulgated a mandate for the Bank that ignores its original mandate in the Bank of Canada Act, its influence on unemployment, and the human cost of sickness and premature death associated with unemployment. Federal monetary policy must take into account this human cost. Otherwise the myopic focus on a healthy economy in the short-run will compromise the goal of a healthy country in the long-run.
