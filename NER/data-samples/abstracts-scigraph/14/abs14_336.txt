Abstract In this paper, under some fairly general conditions, a first-order Edgeworth expansion for the standardized statistic of Î² in partial linear models is given, then a non-residual type of consistent estimation for the error variance is constructed, and finally an Edgeworth expansion for the corresponding studentized version is presented.
