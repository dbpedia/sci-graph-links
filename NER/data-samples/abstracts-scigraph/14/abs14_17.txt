Abstract A central limit theorem for the realized volatility estimator of the integrated volatility based on a specific random sampling scheme is proved, where prices are sampled with every ‘continued price change’ in bid or ask quotation data. The estimator is shown to be robust to market microstructure noise induced by price discreteness and bid–ask spreads. More general sampling schemes also are treated in case that the price process is a diffusion.
