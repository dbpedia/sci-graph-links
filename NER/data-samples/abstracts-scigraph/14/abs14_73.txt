Abstract A return scaling cross-correlation function of exponential parameter is introduced in the present work, and a stochastic time strength neural network model is developed to predict the return scaling cross-correlations between two real stock market indexes, Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Component Index. In the proposed model, the stochastic time strength function gives a weight for each historical data and makes the model have the effect of random movement. The empirical research is performed in testing the model forecasting effect of long-term cross-correlation relationships by training short-term cross-correlations, and a corresponding comparison analysis is made to the backpropagation neural network model. The empirical results show that the proposed neural network is advantageous in increasing the forecasting precision.
