Summary Some hydrologic, climatologic and artificially generated time series are analyzed for periodic components using a nonharmonic (NH) method of spectral estimation. The NH spectra are compared with those obtained by using the traditional Blackman and Tukey (BT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods and with the relatively recent Maximum Entropy (ME) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods. The NH method appears to be promising.
