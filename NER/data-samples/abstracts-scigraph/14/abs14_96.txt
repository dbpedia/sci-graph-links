Abstract In this era of VLSI circuits, testability is truly a very crucial issue. To generate a test set for a given circuit, choice of an algorithm from a number of existing test generation algorithms to apply is bound to vary from circuit to circuit. In this paper, the Genetic Algorithm is used in order to construct an accurate model for some existing test generation algorithms that are being used everywhere in the world. Some objective quantitative measures are used as an effective tool in making such choice. Such measures are so important to the analysis of algorithms that they become one of the subjects of this work.
