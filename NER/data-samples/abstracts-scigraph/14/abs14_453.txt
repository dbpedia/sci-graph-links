Abstract Trickle-down has been addressed, so far, using income-based measures of inequality and poverty. However concerns over the inequality in access to other dimensions important for quality of life remains. I revisit trickle-down using the Alkire and Foster (J Public Econ 95(7â€“8), 2011) class of measures to estimate multidimensional poverty in India. Using NSS data estimates are presented for the 16 major states and are compared to income-based measures. Adding dimensions in poverty measurement results in the reversal of several income-based conclusions about poverty across regions. The paper also finds that contrary to income-based findings, Muslims are less poor than Hindus under the multidimensional criteria.
