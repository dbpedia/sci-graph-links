Abstract An investigation is performed as to the extent J and Q calculated for successively stationary crack positions can be used to characterize the state at a growing crack in a corresponding geometry. FE models of single-edge notch bend and double-edge cracked panel specimens are used to cover a variation of constraint levels. The stress and strain fields are compared between different specimens at equal J-values and Q-values, respectively. A remeshing technique is used to enhance the efficiency of the analysis. The commercial FE-code ABAQUS is used and substantial crack growth is achieved with less computer time and better accuracy than in conventional FE analysis.
