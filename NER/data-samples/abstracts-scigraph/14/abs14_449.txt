Abstract A method is suggested for the estimation of autonomous and induced effects of cost factors on the rate of inflation. It involves calculating total effects from a national income accounts identity and estimating autonomous effects from a price equation and induced effects as the difference between total and autonomous effects. The significance of induced effects may be tested. Applying the above method to Greek data we find that induced effects are significant in the cases of unit labour costs and the other factors captured by the constant term of the price equation.
