Abstract Uncertain finance has shown great significance in managing financial cases such as stock prices and currency options. Early researchers have put up some currency models to describe the foreign exchange rate. This paper proposes a mean-reverting currency model to describe the foreign change rate in the long term, and derives its European and American option pricing formulas. Besides, it gives some numerical examples to illustrate the formulas.
