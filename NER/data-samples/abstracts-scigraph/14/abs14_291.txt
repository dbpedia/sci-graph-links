Abstract We incorporate endogenous production into Sah's analysis of alternative schemes for distributing a deficit good. The model is interpreted as applying to a socialist economy suffering from repressed inflation. Sah's results are robust to this generalisation provided production is linear. Also, amending Sah's assumptions, we suppose all individuals own equal shares in the means of production. If production is linear, a low-wage worker (particularly defined) prefers goods to be sold at a free-market price to the alternatives of (equal) nonconvertible rationing or a queuing system. Without linearity, the results are less clear-cut.
