Summary Eta cells of the pituitary of Aphanius dispar specimens adapted to sea water are densely packed and have folded nuclei. Unfolding of the nuclei accompanied by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia was observed 24 hours after experimental transfer of specimens into fresh water. In specimens from natural habitats and adapted over long periods to fresh water, the nuclei are rounded and cellular hypertrophy attains maximal values. Dilatation of capillaries in the hypophysis was observed in about one third of the specimens within the first few days after transfer to fresh water. In specimens adapted either to fresh water or to sea water the capillaries were normal. Epsilon cells from seawater specimens have elongated nuclei perpendicular to the basement membrane which separates the rostral neurohypophysis from the adenohypophysis; in freshwater specimens epsilon cell nuclei are rounded.
