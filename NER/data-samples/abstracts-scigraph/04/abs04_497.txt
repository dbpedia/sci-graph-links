Abstract The typologic study of zircon populations from granitic rocks lead to the proposition of a genetic classification with three main divisions: (1) granites of crustal or mainly crustal origin [(sub) autochthonous and aluminous granites)]; (2) granites of crustal+mantle origin, hybrid granites (calc-alkaline and sub-alkaline series granites); (3) granites of mantle or mainly mantle origin (alkaline and tholeiitic series granites). In detail, there are many petrogenetic variants of each of the following granitic rocks: granodiorite, monzogranite and alkaline granite. The variations observed with zircon typology are accompanied petrographically by modifications of associations of other main and accessory minerals, and on the field by the presence or absence of basic microgranular xenoliths, associated microgranites, rhyolites or basic rocks. In the typologic diagram, some endogenous non granitic rocks (i.e. migmatites, tonalites, rhyolites ...) show a logical distribution with regard to different genetic stocks of granitic rocks.
