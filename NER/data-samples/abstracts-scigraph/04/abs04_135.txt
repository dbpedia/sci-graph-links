Abstract It has been demonstrated that Pd2+ ions can be reduced onto Pt surface in the presence of organic materials but only at a very low Clâˆ’ ion activity. Unlike rhenium deposition, Pd deposition may proceed after the formation of an adsorbed Pd monolayer and bulk deposits are formed on the Pt surface.
