Summary Paragneisses form the main part of the Monotonous Group in the SE Moldanubicum (Austria). Two types of paragneisses have been distinguished: cordierite gneisses, which are characteristic of the Monotonous Group, and a cordierite-free variety. A typical feature of the cordierite gneisses is the occurrence of stromatic or nebulitic cordierite migmatites. Three stages of metamorphism have been identified in the paragneisses:1)The early stage is preserved as kyanite relics in cordierite gneisses and kyanitestaurolite relics in garnet-bearing paragneisses. A maximum temperature of 600°C is estimated for this stage.2)The P-T conditions of the metamorphic peak (T-peak) were determined in cordierite gneisses, cordierite migmatites and a garnet-bearing paragneiss at 720±30°C and Pmin=4.4±0.4kbar. Phase relations in the migmatites and compositional zoning of cordierite are consistent with high-temperature decompression. Dehydration melting (Thompson, 1982) took place during this stage and initiated the migmatization of the cordierite gneisses. Deformation of the cordierite migmatites near the tectonic boundary with the overlying Varied Group (“Granulitlamelle”,Fuchs andScharbert, 1979) shows that migmatization is pre- to syntectonic with respect to the emplacement of the Drosendorf Unit (Varied Group).3)Porphyroblasts of post-tectonic white mica crystallized mainly in the cordierite migmatites during the retrograde stage at pressures and temperatures of 3–5kbar and 650–700°C. There is no indication of a genetic relationship between the intrusion of the South Bohemian Pluton and the migmatization in the adjacent cordierite gneisses.
