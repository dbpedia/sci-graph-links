Abstract In the early stage of deep-water exploration, the research about subtle trap prediction is mostly confined to technologies such as seismic attribute, due to which ambiguity and uncertainty in the results can occur. Therefore, in this paper, a new process of identifying deep-water reservoirs is proposed. First, strata slice technology is adopted to guide the analysis of seismic facies and preliminary recognition of the distribution and scale of geologic bodies; then based on the seismic facies analysis, the reservoir is depicted in detail with the application of seismic phase-controlled nonlinear random inversion; and finally, the comprehensive analysis of various features like strata slices, seismic facies, and seismic inversion are used to predict the favorability of the reservoir. The results show that the application of this method not only successfully predicts the distribution of the reservoir but also provides a reliable basis for future well drilling.
