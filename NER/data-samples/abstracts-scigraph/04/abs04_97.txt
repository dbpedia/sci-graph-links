Summary The chemical characteristics of coexisting biotites and hornblendes and host rocks are examined and discussed. The field data indicate that biotite derives from hornblende at decreasing metamorphism. A chemical equilibrium has been reached for Fe2+, Mg and Mn and approached, but not reached, for tetrahedral ions, Fe3+, Alvi and Ti. The disequilibrium is mainly dependent on biotite and is tentatively ascribed to the oxidizing conditions of the environment, at the time of biotite crystallization. The composition of biotite is thus partly related to that of hornblende and partly to the environment, while intracrystalline variations of hornblende are related to the chemical composition of the host rock and to varying metamorphic grade.
