Abstract Daily temperature records including daily minimum, maximum, and average temperature from 190 meteorological stations over China during 1951–2000 are analyzed from two perspectives: (a) long-term persistence in direction of time varies, and (b) standard deviation in direction of amplitude varies. By employing the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), we find all the temperature records are long-term correlated, while the exponent α obtained from DFA varies from different districts of China due to different climate conditions, such as the southwest monsoon, subtropical high, northeast cold vortex, and the Tibetan plateau, etc. After we take the standard deviation into account, a new index χ = α × σ, which has been proposed recently, can be obtained. By further rescaling it as $$ \chi = \overline \chi - {{1} \left/ {5} \right.} \times {\sigma_{{\overline \chi }}} $$, we find an obvious change of χ for these three kinds of time series, from which the whole China can be divided into two groups, which are comparatively consistent with dry/wet distributions in the south–north areas over China.
