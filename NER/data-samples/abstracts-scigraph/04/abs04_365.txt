Abstract The characteristics of seasonal precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were investigated using TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation data (3B43). Sensitive regions of summer precipitation interannual variation anomalies were investigated using EOF (empirical orthogonal function) analysis. Furthermore, the profiles of cloud water content (CWC) and precipitable water in different regions and seasons were analyzed using TRMM-3A12 data observed by the TRMM Microwave Imager. Good agreement was found between hydrometeors and precipitation over the eastern and southeastern TP, where water vapor is adequate, while the water vapor amount is not significant over the western and northern TP. Further analysis showed meridional and zonal anomalies of CWC centers in the ascending branch of the Hadley and Walker Circulation, especially over the south and east of the TP. The interannual variation of hydrometeors over the past decade showed a decrease over the southeastern and northwestern TP, along with a corresponding increase over other regions.
