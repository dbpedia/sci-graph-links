Abstract The solubility of alumina in enstatite was determined in the range of 1100–1500° C and 10–25 kbar. The alumina content in enstatite coexisting with sapphirine and quartz increases with increasing temperature and pressure, while that in enstatite coexisting with sapphirine and sillimanite or with pyrope decreases with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature. Two univariant lines, pyrope = enstatitess + sillimanite + sapphiriness and enstatitess + sillimanite =sapphiriness + quartz were confirmed. The invariant point involving these phases is metastable. The alumina content of orthopyroxene can not be used either as a pressure indicator or as a temperature indicator without taking the mineral assemblage into account.
