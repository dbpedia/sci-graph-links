Abstract The lithostratigraphic nomenclature of the lower Cretaceous strata of Lebanon is completely revised. Four formations are defined in place of the existing complex of informal nomenclature. In ascending order these are the Chouf Sandstone Formation, the Abeih Formation, the Mdairej Limestone Formation and the Hammana Formation. The Hammana Formation is subdivided into a lower Dahr el Beidar Member and an upper Knisseh Member.
