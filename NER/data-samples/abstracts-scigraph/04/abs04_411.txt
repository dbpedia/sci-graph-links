Summary During 1982 â€“ 1991 pollen deposition in the centre of Cracow (southern Poland) was investigated using the gravimetric method. 32 taxa of the 84 identified were taken into consideration, and nearly all of them can be allergenic. The beginning of mass pollen fall was observed in the second decade of March, and the third decade of September saw the completion of the yearly cycle of abundant appearance of pollen in the aeroplankton. Tree pollen dominates quantitatively.
