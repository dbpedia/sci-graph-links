Summary A method of separation and colorimetric determination of trace amounts (10−4–10−5%) of Cu, Al, Fe, Bi, Pb, Mn, Cd, Zn, Co, and M in platinum-rhodium (10%) alloys has been developed. The elements to be determined are retained on a column containing the strongly acidic cation-exchanger Amberlite IR-120, from dilute hydrochloric acid medium (pH 1–1.5), while platinum and rhodium pass through in the form of anionic chloride complexes. The individual metals are eluted and concentrated and then separated by extraction and carrier precipitation. The metals are determined by means of sensitive colorimetrie methods with dithizone (Cu, Bi, Pb, Cd, Zn), eriochromecyanine R (Al), 2-nitroso-1-naphthol (Co),α-furildioxime (Ni), 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (Mn), and thiocyanate (Fe). The error of the determination does not exceed 15%.
