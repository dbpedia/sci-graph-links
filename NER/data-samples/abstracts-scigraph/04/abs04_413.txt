Abstract The problem of the evaporation of groundwater containing a dissolved admixture is studied. It is shown that in the salt precipitation regime the solution is nonunique. At critical parameter values the solutions merge and in a certain region the solution of the problem disappears. The nonexistence of a solution corresponds to clogging of the pore space with precipitated salt.
