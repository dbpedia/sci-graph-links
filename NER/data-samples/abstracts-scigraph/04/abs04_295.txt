Abstract The Towada-a (To-a) Tephra from A.D. 915 allowed reconstruction of the local and regional vegetation at and near Ohse-yachi Mire from pollen samples taken just below the tephra. In earlier studies the tephra was dated from 14C data, stratigraphy at archaeological sites and a historical record. Twelve cores along two perpendicular transects yielded pollen from modern and pre-tephra samples. The modern pollen data were compared with the modern vegetation, and used to interpret the pollen data from A.D. 915. Ericaceae, Drosera, Sanguisorba, other Rosaceae, and Sphagnum were concluded to be local elements. Ohse-yachi Mire was a wet Sphagnum bog in A.D. 915, with Sphagnum dominating the central part of the mire. The present stand of scrub was not yet established, but there was a stand of Pinus pumila scrub. The bog subsequently became drier and changed to the present-day mixed Moliniopsis-Sphagnum bog.
