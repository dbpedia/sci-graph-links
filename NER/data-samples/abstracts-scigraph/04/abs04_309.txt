Summary 1.The water source preference behavior of sockeye fry and fingerlings of 2 different populations was observed in a 2-choice Y-trough with Lake Washington water (lake) and well water (non-lake) as the alternate choices.2.Experiments with fry that had been hatched and reared entirely in either Lake Washington water or well water or had not previously experienced either water source demonstrated that preference behavior was a result of 2 separate factors â€” an apparently innate preference for lake water as compared to nonlake waters (Tables 1 and 2) as proposed by Brannon (1972) and an attraction for the recently experienced water source over foreign waters (Fig. 3).3.The strong lake water preference of fry that had recently experienced Lake Washington water was eliminated by olfactory occlusion (Table 3).4.Water source preference is believed to play an important role in the guidance of sockeye fry migration from their incubation stream to a nurse lake.
