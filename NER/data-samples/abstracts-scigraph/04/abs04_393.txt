Abstract The authors consider the processes of silicate and glass formation in iron-containing glass batches based on technical materials (oxides and carbonates) and using magma rock (metadiabase). The specific features of these processes depending on the chemical composition of glass are identified. It is established that the crystalline phases arising in silicate formation persist in the glass melt in the form of structural groups. The possibility of decreasing the temperature of glaze-frit synthesis in the case of using metadiabase is considered.
