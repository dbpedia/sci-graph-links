Abstract In this study, three isothermal sections of the Nb-Si-V ternary system at 1100, 1200 and 1300 °C were experimentally established by means of back-scattered electron, electron probe microanalysis and x-ray diffraction. The isothermal sections at 1100, 1200 and 1300 °C have similar phase relationships, in which five three-phase regions have been determined. In all three isothermal sections, the (Nb,V)2Si compound has been found for the first time, and the compounds NbSi2 and VSi2 form a complete solid solution phase (Nb,V)Si2.
