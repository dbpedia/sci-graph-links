Abstract The present study investigates the influence of June through November (JJASON) thermal state of the western North Pacific warm pool on surface latent heat flux and their association with tropical cyclone (TC) genesis by using 25 level water temperature data with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF) operational ocean analysis (ORA-S3), the monthly mean fluxes from Objectively Analyzed Air-sea Fluxes (OAFlux) Project, and the tropical cyclone data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). It is found that positive (negative) latent heat flux anomalies over the western North Pacific are associated with warm (cold) state of the warm pool. The analysis suggests that the change in sea-air humidity difference has a direct contribution to surface latent heat flux anomalies over the western Pacific in warm state years of the warm pool. However, the change in surface wind speed is the main cause of surface latent heat flux anomalies over central tropical Pacific. In cold state years, change in the sea-air humidity difference has a direct contribution to surface latent heat flux anomalies over the western Pacific and central and eastern tropical Pacific, and the change in surface wind speed appears not to be a cause of identified surface latent heat flux anomalies. Moreover, the results show that the sea-air humidity difference contributes to tropical cyclone genesis in warm state years, but in cold state years, tropical cyclone genesis occurs mainly in regions of sea-air humidity difference decrease and surface wind speed increase.
