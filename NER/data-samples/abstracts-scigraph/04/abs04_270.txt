Abstract The 2000 km Uralian Paleozoic orogen is situated on the western flank of the Uralo-Mongolian folded belt. It is characterized by an abundant variety of magmatic rocks and related ore deposits. Uralian Paleozoic magmatism is entirely subduction-related. It is proposed that the Uralian orogen represents a cold mobile belt in which the mantle temperature was 200 to 500 °C cooler than in the adjacent areas; a situation which is similar to the modern West Pacific Triangle Zone including Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and southern Asia. During the course of the geological evolution of the Uralian orogen, the nature of the magmatism has changed from basic rocks of indisputable mantle origin (460–390 Ma) to mantle-crust gabbro-granitic complexes (370–315 Ma) followed by pure crustal granite magmatism (290–250 Ma). This order in rock type and age reflects the evolution of Paleozoic magmatic complexes from the beginning of subduction to the final stages of the orogen development.
