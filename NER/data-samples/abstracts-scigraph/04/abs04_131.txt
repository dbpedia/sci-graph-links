Abstract The Huay Sai Royal Development Study Centre, located in southern Thailand, one of the agricultural areas still faces a lack of water, especially in the drought season. The aims of this study were to explain the hydrogeological characteristics of aquifers and evaluate the groundwater potentiality. The results revealed three types of aquifer: unconsolidated floodplain deposits aquifer (Qfd) and the consolidated Permo-Carboniferus metasedimentary (PCms) aquifer and granitic (Gr) aquifer. The main groundwater direction of the Qfd and PCms aquifers flow from the south-western to the north-eastern area. The groundwater potential, as assessed by potential surface analysis (PSA), using the rainfall, recharge, lithology, lineament density, slope, drainage density, depth to groundwater and water quality as thematic layers in a GIS system. Groundwater potentiality classes ranged from very high (in the Rai Mai Pattana area) to very low (in the Sam Praya area). The output groundwater potential map was congruent with the maximum yield data carried out by the Department of Groundwater Resources (DGR). The map declared that the Huay Sai area is commonly of moderate groundwater potentiality, where this category covers an area of 116.6 km2 (56.74% of the study area).
