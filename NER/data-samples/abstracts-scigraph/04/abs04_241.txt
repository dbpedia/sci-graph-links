Abstract In the framework of the IWAS/Água-DF project, this study focuses on changes in mean surface air temperature and accumulated precipitation in Central Brazil over the past 40 years. It has two main objectives: (1) comparison between two climatological periods (2001–2010 and 1971–2000) and (2) trend analysis of climate variables. Time series of meteorological and rain gauge stations from Central Brazil have been organized in a databank, which contains tools for homogeneity tests. From that, 4 temperature and 55 precipitation time series were sufficient homogeneous, while 1 temperature and 5 precipitation time series were identified as inhomogeneous. Reliable spatial distribution was produced using proper interpolation method. Trends and significance levels were calculated by Rapp’s estimator of slope and Mann–Kendall test, respectively. The most important results of the comparisons and trend analysis in the last four decades are: (1) marked increase in annual and seasonal mean surface air temperature, (2) evident decreases of accumulated rainfall in winter and autumn, and (3) apparent increase of precipitation amounts in the rainy season.
