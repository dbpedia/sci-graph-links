Summary Intimate intergrowths of ferrotantalite and ferrotapiolite occur in a pegmatite in Spittal a.d. Drau, Carinthia. They are associated with muscovite, albite, smoky quartz, cassiterite, and microscopic uranmicrolite, zircon and uraninite. An assemblage of secondary uranium minerals is also present, generated by extensive alteration and leaching of the uranmicrolite and zircon. Textures of the ferrotantalite-ferrotapiolite intergrowths suggest considerable recrystallization that obliterated most of their primary features; neither coprecipitation nor exsolution can be recognized with certainty. Despite intersecting tielines indicating disequilibrium, the ferrotantalite and ferrotapiolite compositions show very restricted ranges (Mn/(Mn + Fe) 0.08–0.11, Ta/(Ta + Nb) 0.53–0.57 for ferrotantalite, and 0.01–0.04, 0.84–0.89 for ferrotapiolite, respectively), particularly in comparison with compositions from other localities featuring primary textures. A degree of compositional equilibration could have been attained during recrystallization. This process may also explain the high level of structural order characterizing both minerals; they are considerably disordered in other localities. Extensive deformation typical of pegmatites in the southern Ostalpen in general, and specifically of the Spittal pegmatite, is probably responsible for the recrystallization phenomena in the Ta, Nb, Sn-bearing mineral assemblage.
