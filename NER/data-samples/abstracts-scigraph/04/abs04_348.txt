Abstract The Viséan succession of the Jerada Massif contains a relatively diverse rugose coral fauna, which comprises 12 genera. Only two of these (Siphonodendron and Lithostrotion) are reported to include more than one species. Most taxa show distinctive facies dependencies. Small solitary corals are found in shaly environments of the Oued Es-Sassi Formation. On the northern flank a coral patch reef formed on an oolitic shoal in the Koudiat Es-Senn Formation. Its core mainly consists of Lithostrotion vorticale colonies, whereas in its surroundings literally hundreds of specimens of Siphonophyllia samsonensis occur. Associated with these dominant taxa occur colonial and further large solitary taxa (Palaeosmilia, Dibunophyllum). Tizraia and Pareynia are restricted to microbial-dominated buildup facies. Their presence might be strongly controlled by the development of this buildup type, because further occurrences in Algeria, Morocco, and Belgium are all in the same facies. The coral fauna at Jerada is a typical Late Viséan assemblage for the Western European Province. The Eastern Moroccan Meseta may be an important pathway within the province for the connection between the Central Saharan basins and NW Europe. The biostratigraphic ages of the coral fauna partly contradict ages based on carbonate microfossils; the coral ages are slightly older and typical Brigantian coral taxa are absent.
