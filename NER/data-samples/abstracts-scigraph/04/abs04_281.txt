Summary Diethazine hydrochloride forms an yellowish-green complex with platinum(IV) in sodium acetate-hydrochloric acid buffer containing copper catalyst. The complex has an absorption maximum at 404nm and its molar absorptivity is 1.083×104l mole−1cm−1. The sensitivity is 18 ng/cm2 for logI 0/I=0.001. Beer's law is valid over the concentration range 0.5–12.0 ppm. The composition of the complex as determined by the continuous variations, mole ratio and slope ratio methods is 1∶1 and the apparent stability constant of the complex at pH 2.3 and 27° has the log K value of 5.83. The effects due to pH, reagent concentration, copper concentration, time and diverse ions are reported.
