Abstract The modified matrix method of construction of wavefield on the free surface of an anisotropic medium is proposed. The earthquake source represented by a randomly oriented force or a seismic moment tensor is placed on an arbitrary boundary of a layered anisotropic medium. The theory of the matrix propagator in a homogeneous anisotropic medium by introducing a “wave propagator” is presented. It is shown that the matrix propagator can be represented by a “wave propagator” in each layer for anisotropic layered medium. The matrix propagator P(z, z 0=0) acts on the free surface of the layered medium and generates stress-displacement vector at depth z. The displacement field on the free surface of an anisotropic medium is obtained from the received system of equations considering the radiation condition and that the free surface is stressless. The new method determining source time function in anisotropic medium for three different types of seismic source is validated.
