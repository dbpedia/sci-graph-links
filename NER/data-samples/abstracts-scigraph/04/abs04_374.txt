Abstract In a strike-slip setting, depositional history of marginal and central basins depends on the basin formation and basinal fault movements. The Eumsung Basin contains contrasting basin fills according to marginal settings. The southeastern part of the basin forms sequential development of alluvial/lacustrine systems along transform margin, and the southwestern part constitutes synchronous development of alluvial-to-lacustrine systems in pull-apart margin. Along the basin margins and toward the basin center, both sequential and synchronous developments of the alluvial and lacustrine systems have filled basinal accommodation spaces created by pull-apart opening. The formative processes of the basin were caused by the strike-slip fault movements and the accompanying changes in drainage network along the basin margin. The overall development patterns of the depositional systems conform to the sinistral strike-slip fault activation during the Early Cretaceous.
