Abstract This study presents daily and seasonal variations of PAH concentrations in Erzurum atmosphere in summer season of 2008 and in winter seasons of 2008 and 2009. Sampling location at Erzurum urban center was selected to represent the effects of traffic (University junction). 18 PAH compounds were analyzed by GC–MS. Average total PAH concentration (gas + particulate) of 18 PAH compounds were measured during 2008 winter (431 ngm−3) and summer (103 ngm−3) seasons at the University junction. Daily and seasonal variations of PAH compounds were investigated and compared with other urban centers in the literature. Multiple linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed to determine the impacts of meteorological parameters on measured individual PAH concentrations. Results of the multiple linear regression and ANN models indicated that wind speed, wind direction and intensity of total solar radiation were the most significant factors for the measured concentrations of PAH compounds.
