Abstract Fossil pollen from three Lower Eocene localities was investigated by LM and SEM: The Palaeoceneâ€“Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) section at St Pankraz (Salzburg), three Brixton drill cores covering the PETM and the Early Eocene Climate Optimum locality at Krappfeld. Some pollen taxa found have been affiliated to Laurelia, today a southern hemispheric Atherospermataceae unknown from Europe, to two Annonaceae lineages, such as the African Monodora clade and a probable precursor of the old world Fenerivia/Maasia clades, thus representing two taxa not previously reported from the fossil record. Further two wetland associated Araceae (Limnobiophyllum and Lysichiton) are present as well as various Arecaceae, including not only previously described Salaccinae and Calaminae/Plectocomiinae, but also undocumented Bactridinae, Elaeidinae (both Cocoseae), and Coryphoideae and Arecoideae, although pollen from the latter two subfamilies could not be assigned in more detail.
