Abstract Project Rain (Reversing Acidification In Norway) is a 5-yr international research project aimed at investigating the effect on water and soil chemistry of changing acid deposition to whole catchments. The project comprises 2 parallel large-scale experimental manipulations -- artificial acidification at Sogndal and exclusion of acid rain at Risdalsheia. Treatment at Sogndal commenced April 1984 with the acidification of the snowpack by addition of H2SO4 (SOG2) and a 1:1 mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 (SOG4). Preliminary results indicate rapid and significant response in runoff chemistry to the acid treatment; pH decreased (to as low as 4.1 during snowmelt in 1984); SO4, NO3, and labile Al increased. Response during snowmelt 1985 was modest relative to 1984. At Risdalsheia treatment began in June 1984 with the mounting of the transparent panels on the roofs at KIM catchment (treatment by deacidified rain) and EGIL catchment (control with ambient acid rain). Preliminary data for the first year indicate that most runoff samples from KIM contain much lower NO3 concentrations, about 20 to 30% lower SO4 levels and pH 0.1 to 0.3 units higher than runoff from EGIL catchment. The treatments continue in 1985â€“87. Project RAIN provides experimental evidence bearing on target loading, reversibility of acidification, and the processes linking acid deposition, soil acidification and freshwater acidification.
