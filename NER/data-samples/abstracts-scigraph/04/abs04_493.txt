Abstract The regional distribution of metamorphic mineral assemblages in Mesozoic carbonate rocks of the Western Hohe Tauern allows the mapping of isograds based on the appearance of biotite+calcite and biotite+zoisite+calcite. The latter isograd corresponds approximately to the thermal maximum of the alpidic metamorphism in the central part of this area. An estimate of P, T, X fluid conditions can be obtained from phase relations among muscovite, biotite, chlorite, margarite, tremolite, zoisite, anorthite, quartz, calcite, and dolomite in the system K2O-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O-CO2 which approximates the composition of marls. Calculations based on various experimental and thermodynamic data have been made with emphasis on phase relations pertinent to a group of carbonate rocks with very low Fe and Na contents in non-opaque minerals. Significant and opposite deviations from the phase relations for stochiometric end member mineral compositions are due to the substitutions F-OH and Mg+Si-2Al. Consistency of observed and calculated phase relations is favoured by high F-contents. For the majority of carbonate rocks in the high metamorphic zone, maximum temperatures around 550° C, minimum pressures of 4–6 kb, and relatively low XCO2 values within the stability field of zoisite and of biotite+calcite+quartz are indicated.
