Abstract The whole-rock chemistry of eclogites, partially amphibolitized eclogites, and dyke amphibolites from the metamorphic Kechros complex in the eastern Rhodope Mountains preserves evidence of the geodynamic framework for the origin of their protoliths. Major and trace-element concentrations define two distinct protolith groups for the eclogites. The low-Fe–Ti (LFT) eclogites have low-TiO2 content (<0.67 wt%), negative high field strength element anomalies, and variable enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE). The rare earth element (REE) patterns are characterized by strong light-REE (LREE) enrichment and heavy-REE (HREE) depletion. The high-Fe–Ti (HFT) eclogites have small to moderate LILE enrichment and lack Nb anomalies. The REE patterns of the HFT eclogites are characterized by LREE depletion and relatively flat MREE–HREE patterns. The rock compositions and petrographic features of the LFT eclogites resemble gabbros formed in a continental rift environment with minor to moderate contamination of a mantle-derived mafic magma by continental crust, whereas the HFT eclogites resemble mafic rocks formed in extensional oceanic environments. We interpret the HFT suite to represent a later stage in an evolution from continental rift to open ocean, following the origin of the LFT suite. Dyke amphibolite compositions, except for probable SiO2 loss associated with metamorphic dehydration reactions, appear to represent liquid compositions quenched in conduits through the lower crust. MELTS modeling shows that dyke amphibolite compositions can be related to each other by fractional crystallization under strongly oxidizing conditions at ~0.5 GPa pressure, and all can be derived from a low-degree melt of modified fertile peridotite from around 1.7 GPa. Cumulates crystallized from the parental liquids of the amphibolites under oxidizing conditions may have yielded the protoliths of the HFT suite.
