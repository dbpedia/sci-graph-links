Summary The crystal structure of the mineral vulcanite, CuTe [a = 3.155(1), b = 4.092(1), c = 6.956(1) Å; Z = 2; space group: Pmmn, No. 59] exhibits a pronounced layer structure with Te-Te distances between the CuTe layers of 4.019(1) Å. Within a range up to 4.2 Å the individual Cu atom is [4Te+4Cu+2Cu], the individual Te atom [4Cu+2Te+4Te] coordinated. Crystals of vulcanite suitable for the present structure investigation were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions.
