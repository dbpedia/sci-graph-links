Abstract The Cengio sandstone member of the Tertiary Piedmont Basin in northwestern Italy has a conservatively estimated volume of 2.5 to 3 km3 (length: 6.4 km; width: 4.8 km; thickness: 170 m). It is interpreted as a sandstone-rich submarine fan deposit. The Cengio member consists of eight tabular depositional sandstone lobes that are 5- to 25-m thick. These lobes filled a submarine structural depression and onlap and/or pinch-out against bounding slope mudstones. The stacking of the lobe units was related to synsedimentary tectonism.
