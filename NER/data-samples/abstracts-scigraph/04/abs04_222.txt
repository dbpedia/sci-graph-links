Abstract In the area around Delgo in north-east Sudan a narrow NNE-trending Neoproterozoic belt of low grade volcanosedimentary rocks is fringed by high grade migmatitic basement blocks. The volcanosedimentary sequence is structurally overlain by a rock body of several kilometres length, which is composed of metamorphosed ultramafic and mafic rocks. This sequence is interpreted as an island arc-ophiolite association representing a suture zone. With respect to their degrees of metamorphism and their structural characteristics, the lithological units of the Delgo area are significantly different from the adjacent basement rocks in the east and west. The lithological contacts of the metavolcanic-metasedimentary rocks with the basement rocks are often marked by intermediate-dipping mylonites which are locally overprinted by ductile to brittle-ductile strike-slip faults. The Delgo suture evolved through the subduction-related closure of an oceanic basin and final collision of the island arc with the migmatitic basement blocks on either side of the oceanic basin. Peak metamorphism of deeply buried back-arc basin sequences occurred at around 700 Ma ago. During the collision stage, island arc rocks, passive margin sequences and ophiolitic rocks were thrust to the east and west over the basement blocks, causing limited crustal thickening and a minor isostatic rebound. Lithospheric extension associated with increasing heat flow caused migmatization in the basement between ca. 580 and 540 Ma ago. The development of numerous intermediate-dipping mylonitic shear zones at decreasing temperatures post-dates the migmatization. Lithospheric extension may explain the juxtaposition of rocks which were formed and/or metamorphosed at significantly different crustal levels.
