Abstract Anthelmintic praziquantel (PZQ) and its molecular and crystal lattice structures were studied by means of atomistic calculations based on empirical interatomic potentials and quantum mechanical methods (DFT). This chiral drug presents several crystal polymorphs due to the enantiomers (either R or S) or the racemic crystal, and different molecular conformations. The relative configurations of the carbonyl groups in PZQ define these conformations that produce different polymorphs. The polarity of these conformers is quite different and their relative population can vary in media with different polarity. Crystal structures of PZQ were studied by infrared and Raman spectroscopy and their spectroscopical properties were calculated by quantum mechanical methods, assigning many of their bands, and finding a good agreement with experimental data.
