Abstract A detailed analysis of the selected DFT functionals for the calculations of interaction-induced dipole moment, polarizability and first-order hyperpolarizability has been carried out. The hydrogen-bonded model chains consisting of HF, H2CO and H3N molecules have been chosen as a case study. The calculations of the components of the static electric properties using the diffuse Dunning’s basis set (aug-cc-pVDZ) have been performed employing different types of density functionals (B3LYP, LC-BLYP, PBE0, M06-2X and CAM-B3LYP). Obtained results have been compared with those gained at the CCSD(T) level of theory. The counterpoise correction scheme, namely site-site function counterpoise, has been applied in order to eliminate basis set superposition error. The performed tests allow to conclude that the DFT functionals can provide a useful tool for prediction of the interaction-induced electric properties, however a caution has to be urged to their decomposition to the two- and many-body terms.
