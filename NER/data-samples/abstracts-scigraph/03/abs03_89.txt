Abstract A new polynitro cage compound with the framework of HNIW and a tetrazole unit, i.e., 10-(1-nitro-1, 2, 3, 4-tetraazol-5-yl)) methyl-2, 4, 6, 8, 12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (NTz-HNIW) has been proposed and studied by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics methods. Properties such as IR spectrum, heat of formation, thermodynamic properties, and crystal structure were predicted. The compound belongs to the Pbca space group, with the lattice parameters a = 15.07 Å, b = 12.56 Å, c = 18.34 Å, Z = 8, and ρ = 1.990 g·cm-3. The stability of the compound was evaluated by the bond dissociation energies and results showed that the first step of pyrolysis is the rupture of the N–NO2 bond in the side chain. The detonation properties were estimated by the Kamlet-Jacobs equations based on the calculated crystal density and heat of formation, and the results were 9.240 km·s-1 for detonation velocity and 40.136 GPa for detonation pressure. The designed compound has high thermal stability and good detonation properties and is probably a promising high energy density compound (HEDC).
