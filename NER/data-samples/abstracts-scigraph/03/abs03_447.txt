Abstract VRC01 is one of the most broadly and potently neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies known—it has been shown to neutralize 91 % of the tested primary isolate Env pseudoviruses by recognizing the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. To explore the mechanism of HIV-1 neutralization by VRC01 and thus obtain valuable information for vaccine design, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations for apo-VRC01, apo-gp120, and the gp120–VRC01 complex. For gp120, residue energy decomposition analysis showed that the hotspot residues Asn280, Lys282, Asp368, Ile371, and Asp457 are located in three primary loops, including the CD4-binding loop, loop D, and loop V5. For VRC01, the hotspot residues Trp47, Trp50, Asn58, Arg61, Gln64, Trp100, and Tyr91 mainly come from CDR2 of the heavy chain. By decomposing the binding free energy into different components, intermolecular van der Waals interactions and nonpolar solvation were found to dominate the binding process. Principal component analysis of loops D and V5, which are related to neutralization resistance, indicated that these two areas have a larger conformational space in apo-gp120 compared to bound gp120. A comparison of three representative structures from the cluster analysis of loops D and V5 indicated that changes primarily occur at the tip of loop V5, and are caused by fluctuations in the terminal Glu1 residue of the antibody. This information can be used to guide the design of vaccines and small molecule inhibitors.
