Abstract Using molecular mechanics (MM+), semi-empirical (PM6) and density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP) methods we characterized bismuth nanotubes. In addition, we predicted the bismuth clusters {Bi20(C 5V ), Bi24(C 6v ), Bi28(C 1 ), B32(D 3H ), Bi60(C I )} and calculated their conductor properties.
