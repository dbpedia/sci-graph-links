Abstract The normal bombardment of interlayer Cu13 clusters in graphite by 100, 200, and 400-eV argon ions is examined by means of molecular dynamics simulation employing many-body potentials. The formation frequencies of cluster fragments of different sizes are quantified. The dynamics of the process is studied. The main directions of atom displacements are detected. Changes in the atomic structure of targets are discussed.
