Abstract We study a version of the Schwinger model where fermion and gauge fields are coupled by means of higher derivatives. We show that, regardless of possible existence of ghosts and non-unitarity, the model is completely soluble and the anomalous axial divergence and the mass generated for the photon field are the same as in the usual model. The confinement of the electric charge is also discussed.
