Abstract The results of combined experimental and theoretical investigations of the spectral behavior of anil-type systems are presented. Two species: N-triphenylmethylsalicylidene imine (MS1) and N-salicylidene methylamine (SmA) were studied. The electronic (absorption, emission and excitation) spectra of MS1 at room temperature were investigated in pure isooctane as well as in acetonitrile and methanol solutions by the steady-state experiments. A mechanism of molecular processes in the ground and excited states in different microenvironments is also proposed. It includes formation of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, their role in stabilization of molecular conformations and conformation equilibria. The “solvent assisted” proton transfer reaction and rearrangement were modeled using complexes obtained by attaching methanol molecules to the species studied. The OH-rotamer of SmA was also considered. Infrared and Raman spectra were predicted for MS1 and SmA and compared with the experimental data. An analysis of fundamental vibration frequencies was carried out. Quantum chemical ab initio calculations at the HF/6-31G** level were performed for the species studied and their complexes. Chemical formula of anil-type compound: N-salicylidene methylamine (SmA), N-salicylideneaniline (SA) and N-triphenylmethylsalicylidene imine (MS1).
