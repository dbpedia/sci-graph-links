Abstract First-principle calculations are performed to investigate the interaction between clean black phosphorene and the CrO3 molecule which is known to be a powerful oxidizer and a suspected carcinogen. Van der Waals forces are included in all calculations through empirical corrections. Energetics studies are first done to determine the structural stability. Then charge density, LÃ¶wdin population analysis and electronic states are evaluated. Results show that the CrO3 molecule, with an acceptor electron character, is chemisorbed on the phosphorene surface inducing minimal geometrical distortions, however, after adsorption, a partial charge gradient is produced between the P atoms located at the phosphorene upper and lower planes. Furthermore, variations on the CrO3 concentration causes different interaction strengths. At high concentrations of adsorbed CrO3 molecules, the interaction with the surface becomes stronger due to an increased steric effect between neighboring molecules. Nevertheless, this effect along with the geometrical distortions produced on the phosphorene structure, due to the large number of molecules adsorbed, leads to a decrement on the adsorption energy. It is expected that the reported results may render phosphorene as a promising material for application as a gas sensor.
