Abstract Background: Laparoscopy is increasingly used in conditions complicated by peritonitis. A theoretical concern is that carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum may increase bacteremia. Method: In 60 rats peritonitis was induced by cecostomy. Animals were randomly allocated to pneumoperitoneum (PP) and control groups. Blood cultures and intraabdominal swabs were assessed. A peritonitis severity score (PSS) was computed based on histology from peritoneal biopsy. Results: One hour after cecostomy neither in abdominal swabs nor in blood samples bacteria were reproduced in PP and control groups. Three hours after cecostomy the frequency of positive blood cultures was 80% and 20% in PP and control groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). Six hours after cecostomy the frequency of positive blood cultures was 100% in each group (p > 0.05). One hour after cecostomy the mean peritoneal severity score was significantly higher in the PP group than in the control group, but there was not any significant difference between groups 3 and 6 h after cecostomy. The mean peritoneal severity scores were found to be significantly increased with time when the PP groups compared with each other. Conclusion: In rats, pneumoperitoneum can't cause a more severe peritonitis but it does induce an increase in the rate of bacteremia within the early 6-h period of peritonitis.
