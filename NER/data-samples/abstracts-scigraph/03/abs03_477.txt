Abstract Recently, the grafting of polymer chains onto nanotubes has attracted increasing attention as it can potentially be used to enhance the solubility of nanotubes and in the development of novel nanotube-based devices. In this article, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report the formation of trans-polyacetylene on single-walled carbon-doped boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) through their adsorption of a series of C2H2 molecules. The results show that, rather than through [2 + 2] cycloaddition, an individualmolecule would preferentially attach to a carbon-doped BNNT via “carbon attack” (i.e., a carbon in the C2H2 attacks a site on the BNNT). The adsorption energy gradually decreases with increasing tube diameter. The free radical of the carbon-doped BNNT is almost completely transferred to the carbon atom at the end of the adsorbed C2H2 molecule. When another C2H2 molecule approaches the carbon-doped BNNT, it is most energetically favorable for this C2H2 molecule to be adsorbed at the end of the previously adsorbed C2H2 molecule, and so on with extra C2H2 molecules, leading to the formation of polyacetylene on the nanotube. The spin of the whole system is always localized at the tip of the polyacetylene formed, which initiates the adsorption of the incoming species. The present results imply that carbon-doped BNNT is an effective “metal-free” initiator for the formation of polyacetylene.
