Abstract The effect of a strong electric field generated by molecular dipoles on the ground state electronic structure and the Q and B states as well as the lowest charge transfer (CT) excited state of porphine–2,5-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (PQ) complex has been investigated theoretically. Density functional theory DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with the BH&HLYP hybrid functional have been applied in these calculations. The molecular dipole effect was generated by imposing one or two helical homopeptides consisting of eight α-aminoisobutyric acid residues (Aib8) close to the PQ complex. The molecular dipoles in a close proximity to the PQ complex expose it to an electric field of the order of magnitude of 109 V/m. The presence of the ambient molecular dipoles affects mainly the energy of the lowest CT state and barely the energies of the Q and B states. The molecular dipoles affect the energies of the excited states in a similar way as an external electrostatic field. Hence, the electric field induced by the molecular dipoles of the helical peptides could be used analogously to the external electrostatic field to control electron transfer (ET) in the PQ complex.
