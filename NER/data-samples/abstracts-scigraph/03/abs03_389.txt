Abstract First-principles total-energy calculations were performed to investigate the structural and electronic properties of thymine (T) adsorption on pristine and Al-doped two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN) surfaces. Periodic density functional theory, as developed in the PWscf code of the quantum espresso package, was applied. The pseudopotential theory was used to deal with electron–ion interactions. The generalized gradient approximation was applied to treat the exchange-correlation energies. Van der Waals interactions were incorporated in the calculations. Considering T as an elongated molecule and the interactions through one oxygen atom of the molecule ring, two geometries were explored in pristine and Al-doped systems: in (1) the ring side O interacts with B, and (2) the O at the molecule end interacting with the B. The pristine case yields (4 × 4-a), (5 × 5-b) and (6 × 6-b) as the ground states, , while the doped system shows (4 × 4-a), (5 × 5-a) and (6 × 6-a) as the ground states. Calculations of the adsorption energies indicate chemisorption. Doping enhances the surface reactivity, inducing larger binding energies. The total density of states (DOS) was calculated and interpreted with the aid of the projected DOS. Below the Fermi energy, the DOS graphs indicate that p orbitals make the largest contributions. Above the Fermi level, the DOS is formed mainly by –s and H-s orbitals. The DOS graphs indicate that the structures have non-semiconductor behavior.
