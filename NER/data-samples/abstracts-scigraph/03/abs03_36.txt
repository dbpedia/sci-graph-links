Abstract The first theoretical results of core–valence correlation effects are presented for the infrared wavenumbers and intensities of the BF3 and BCl3 molecules, using (double– and triple–zeta) Dunning core–valence basis sets at the CCSD(T) level. The results are compared with those calculated in the frozen core approximation with standard Dunning basis sets at the same correlation level and with the experimental values. The general conclusion is that the effect of core–valence correlation is, for infrared wavenumbers and intensities, smaller than the effect of adding augmented diffuse functions to the basis set, e.g., cc–pVTZ to aug–cc–pVTZ. Moreover, the trends observed in the data are mainly related to the augmented functions rather than the core–valence functions added to the basis set. The results obtained here confirm previous studies pointing out the large descrepancy between the theoretical and experimental intensities of the stretching mode for BCl3.
