Abstract In this paper, spectral properties and computational performance of a generalized block triangular preconditioner for symmetric saddle point problems are discussed in detail. We will provide estimates for the region containing both the nonreal and the real eigenvalues and generalize the results of Simoncini (Appl Numer Math 49:63–80, 2004) and Cao (Appl Numer Math 57:899–910, 2007). Finally, numerical experiments of the model Stokes problem are reported.
