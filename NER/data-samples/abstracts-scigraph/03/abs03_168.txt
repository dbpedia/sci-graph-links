Abstract: The optimal control (OC) scheme for molecular dynamics is applied to the study of ultrafast bridge mediated electron transfer (ET). Utilizing the methods of dissipative quantum dynamics in combination with the OC approach the guided charge motion in a donor-bridge-acceptor system including a single active vibrational coordinate is studied. The control field drives the optical transition from the electronic ground-state of the ET system into the donor-level and can be used to prepare special electronic and vibrational states. In particular, it is demonstrated that charge localization becomes possible at the acceptor or bridge molecule as well as in the electronic ground-state of the ET system.
