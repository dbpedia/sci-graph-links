Abstract The experimental density dependences of relative fractions of the “liquid-like” and “gas-like” components of supercritical water have been adequately described in terms of the two-component structural dynamic model proposed earlier for interpreting the experimental results on neutron scattering by supercritical water (on the isotherm at 400°C, the density range 0.005 < ρ < 0.32 g/cm3) using the data on the hydrogen connectivity in supercritical water obtained by the molecular dynamics method.
