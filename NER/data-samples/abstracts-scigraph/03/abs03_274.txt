Abstract In this work several molecular properties of symmetrically disubstituted formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde have been studied using a quantum chemistry approach based on density functional theory. Five-membered heteroaromatic rings containing a single group 16 heteroatom were taken into account as the substituents (i.e., furan-2-yl, thiophen-2-yl, selenophen-2-yl, tellurophen-2-yl, and the experimentally as yet unknown polonophen-2-yl). For the resulting ten formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde derivatives, the geometry, energetics, frontier molecular orbitals, dipole moment and polarizability of their molecules were examined in order to establish the effect of ring heteroatom on these properties. Furthermore, these properties were also determined for the molecules in three solvents of low polarity (benzene, chloroform, and dichloromethane) in order to expand our study to include solvent effects. The dipole moment and polarizability of the investigated molecules show regular variations when the ring heteroatom descends through group 16 and the solvent polarity grows. The heteroatom and/or solvent effects on the part of the studied properties are, however, more complex. An attempt is made to rationalize the observed variations in the molecular properties. The conformational behavior of the investigated molecules was also explored and the conformationally weighted values of dipole moment and polarizability are presented.
