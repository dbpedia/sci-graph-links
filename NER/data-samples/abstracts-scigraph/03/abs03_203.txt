Abstract â€‚Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with high acceleration energy cluster impact on a diamond surface are performed in order to investigate the surface erosion process. A CO2 cluster of 960 atoms with different acceleration energy (10, 50 and 100 keV/cluster) impacts on the (1 1 1) surface of diamond that consists of more than one million carbon atoms. A typical transient crater and two or three-layered shockwaves are formed for 50 and 100 keV impacts while only small elastic deformation can be seen for 10 keV. The kinetic energy and the volume of the crater are almost linear functions of the acceleration energy, but the erosion is only enhanced by the 100 keV impact. A strong peak of CO appears in the size distribution of the evaporating clusters in that case.
