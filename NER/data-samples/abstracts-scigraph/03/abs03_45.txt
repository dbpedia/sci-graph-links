Abstract This work explores M. E. Vol'pin's early notion that TiCp2 possesses carbenoid character, and transfers this concept to the related dicarbonyl bis(phosphorus donor)iron fragment. Similarities and differences in electronic and molecular structure of the titanium and iron fragment are elucidated based on density functional calculations. Isolobal analogies to the carbene unit are presented to rationalize the computational results. Experimental verification of analogies between TiCp2 and Fe(CO)2L2 chemistries is given.
