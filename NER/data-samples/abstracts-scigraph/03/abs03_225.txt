Summary A study has been made of the high-temperature reactions taking place in the graphite matrix of a d. c. carbon arc. A special evaporator was used for controlled heating of samples. Volatilisations were investigated spectrographically, and X-ray diffraction was used for detection of any new phases formed. The presence of sodium fluoride or chloride was found to enhance the volatilisation of the elements investigated, but no evidence was found for formation of their fluorides or chlorides.
