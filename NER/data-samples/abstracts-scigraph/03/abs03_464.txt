Abstract Molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to predict thermal and mechanical properties of a family of thermoset polymers. We focus on the effect of cross-linkers on density, glass transition temperature, elastic constants, and strength. The polymers are composed of the epoxy resin DGEBA (EPON825) and a series of cross-linkers with different number of active sites and rigidity 33DDS, 44DDS, APB133, TREN, and TAPA. Our simulations quantify effects of cross-linkers on thermal and mechanical properties.
