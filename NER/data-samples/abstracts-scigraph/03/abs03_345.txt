Abstract Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers. The small molecule ceritinib can overcome drug-resistance mutations that are observed in crizotinib-resistant patients, although the detailed mechanism for this ability of ceritinib remains elusive. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of six systems (including the apo ALK, the wild-type ALK–ceritinib complex, as well as four complexes of ceritinib with the I1171T, L1196M, S1206Y, and G1269A mutants of ALK, respectively) together with the subsequent molecular mechanics–generalized Born/surface area binding free energy calculations were performed to answer this question. Principal component analysis and domain cross-correlation analysis of MD trajectories revealed that ceritinib binding stabilized the conformational dynamics of both the wild-type and the four mutated ALKs as compared to the apo ALK. Moreover, the mutations had subtle effects on the conformation of ALK compared to that of the wild-type ALK. Importantly, binding free energy calculations demonstrated that, compared its effect on the wild-type ALK, ceritinib showed slightly increased potency towards the I1171T, L1196M, S1206Y, and G1269A mutants. Therefore, the binding of ceritinib to the four mutants can overcome crizotinib-resistant mutations. These data provide a structural and energetic explanation of how ceritinib overcomes mutation-induced drug resistance. Graphical AbstractInteractions between ceritinib and wild-type ALK
