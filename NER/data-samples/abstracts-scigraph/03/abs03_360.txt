Abstract The solvation free energy described using the Born equation depends on the solute charge, solute radius, and solvent dielectric constant. However, the dielectric polarization derived from Gaussâ€™s law used in the Born equation differs from that obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, the adjustment of Born radii is insufficient for fitting the solvation free energy to various solute conformations. In order to mimic the dielectric polarization surrounding a solute in molecular dynamics simulations, the water molecule in the first coordination shell is modeled as a physical dipole in a van der Waals sphere, and the intermediate water is treated as a bulk solvent. The electric dipole of the first-shell water is modeled as positive and negative surface charge layers with fixed charge magnitudes, but with variable separation distance as derived from the distributions of hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water dictated by their orientational distribution functions. An equation that describes the solvation free energy of ions using this solvent scheme with a TIP3P water model is derived, and the values of the solvation free energies of ions estimated from this derived equation are found to be similar to those obtained from the experimental data.
