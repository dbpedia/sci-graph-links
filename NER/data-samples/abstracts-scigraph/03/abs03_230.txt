Abstract A technique of approximating expectation values of realistic nuclear Hamiltonian with the antisymmetrised molecular dynamics wave function is investigated. A phenomenological and a semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials are used. Some of the ground-state properties of selected few-nucleon systems are calculated. The results are compared with experimental data.
