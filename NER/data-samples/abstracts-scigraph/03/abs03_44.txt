Abstract The results of X-ray diffraction studies on molecular packing of tert-butyl-, trimethylsilyl-, and trimethylgermylthiophene 1,1-dioxides have been reviewed and analyzed. We also interpret their experimental and calculated UV spectra. Using quantum chemical calculations, we have studied the theoretical aspects of the acetonitrile oxide dipolar [2+3] cycloaddition to 2,5- and 2,4-disubstituted sulfones. The reasons for the regiospecificity of cycloaddition and desilylation have been explained.
