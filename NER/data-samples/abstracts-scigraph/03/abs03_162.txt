Abstract The electronic structure of M6L8L′6 cluster compounds (where M=Mo, Re and L, L′=S, Se, Cl, Br) has been investigated using Tight-Binding band-structure calculations and “solid-like” Extended Huckel method. In spite of the variety of structural features and physical properties of these octahedral cluster compounds (from insulators to superconductors), it has been found that a simple three-band model was convenient to describe the whole of the M6L8L′6 serie.
