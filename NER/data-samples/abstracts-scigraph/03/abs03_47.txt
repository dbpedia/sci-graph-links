Abstract In the paper free bubble oscillations are examined in detail for a broad range of amplitudes. In the case of linear oscillations and of an empty bubble several interesting results are derived analytically. For a general value of the amplitude the equation of motion is solved numerically. Finally, the most important independent and scaling functions are presented.
