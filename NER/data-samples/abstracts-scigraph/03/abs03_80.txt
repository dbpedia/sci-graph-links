Abstract We report calculations of the Gaussian component of the 63Cu nuclear spin-echo decay rate 1/T 2G employing the theory for spin susceptibility as derived within the t-J model starting from carrier-free La2CuO4 and right up to optimally doped superconducting layered copper oxide La2−x Sr x CuO4. The theory reproduces the temperature and doping behavior of the experimental data for 1/T 2G. A quantitative agreement with experimental 1/T 2G data in doped La2−x Sr x CuO4 compounds is obtained with account of both the spin–spin and “fermion”–“fermion” correlations.
