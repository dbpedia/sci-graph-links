Abstract Using molecular dynamical computer simulations (MD) the dynamics of kinetic processes in zeolites will be discussed on a molecular level. Small changes in lattice parameters can cause dramatical changes in the diffusion coefficient. The presence of cations Na+, Ca2+ also strongly influences the diffusion. Changes of the self-diffusivities will be discussed that appear if a vibrating lattice instead of a rigid one is used. Nonequilibrium simulations show the correlation between transport-diffusion and self-diffusion in zeolites.
