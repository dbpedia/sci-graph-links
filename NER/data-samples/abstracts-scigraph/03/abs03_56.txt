Abstract This paper studied the effects of different cooking conditions (methods, temperatures and time) on the retention rate of 4-(methylthio)-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC) in Chinese white radish by using a method of ultrasound extraction coupled with gas chromatography—flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Results showed that the retention rate of MTBITC decreased with increasing cooking time and temperatures. The retention rate of MTBITC declined dramatically after holding for 1 min at 85 or 95 °C. The fitted equations demonstrated that the degradation of MTBITC followed an exponential decay pattern for non-microwave (water bath or steam stove) cooking, while for microwave cooking, the degradation of MTBITC followed approximately a linear decay.
