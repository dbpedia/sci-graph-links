Abstract The objectives of this study were twofold: to determine the specific oxygen consumption rate of mixed sludges by means of a respirometry study, and to investigate the applicability of a developed model to a pilot-scale reactor containing nightsoil and brewery sludges. The results of the study revealed the specific oxygen consumption rates to be 87.7 mg O2/kg VS-hr and 117.7 mg O2/kg VS-hr at temperatures of 25 °C and 35 °C, respectively. Oxygen was found to be consumed at a higher rate in the reactor operated at the higher temperature. The computer simulation for temperature variations in the pilot-scale reactor showed a good relationship between the simulated and the measured temperatures. After three days operation, the highest simulated temperature was 65 °C, whereas the highest measured temperature was 60 °C. In addition, results suggest that the model can provide an accurate air supply rate to indicate economical reactor operation.
