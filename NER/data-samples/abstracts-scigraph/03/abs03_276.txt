Abstract Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) is the key mediator in initiating type I collagen degradation and is associated with rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, a pharmacophore hypothesis was developed based on selective non zinc binding inhibitors of MMP-8. The pharmacophore hypothesis was refined manually and validated by observing structures and the interactions of MMP-8 inhibitors. The refined pharmacophore model was able to discriminate the non-zinc binding inhibitors of MMP-8 with respect to other inhibitors. Hence this study proposes a combined structure- and ligand-based pharmacophore model that is suitable for retrieving the novel inhibitors of MMP-8. The pharmacophore hypothesis AADRH was used as query for retrieving potential compounds from the Zinc database and hits were selected based on the catalytic selective amino acid residues of Arg 222, and Tyr 227. We identified six compounds as potent inhibitors and their selectivity profile were checked against different subtypes of MMPs using the cross-docking method. Molecular dynamics results indicated that ZINC 00673680 forms a stable interaction with the key amino acid residues and avoids the zinc atom with a distance of 5.49 Å. Our computational study might be useful for further development of selective MMP-8 inhibitors.
