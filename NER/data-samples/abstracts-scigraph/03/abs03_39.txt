Abstract Homology modeling of the reductase domain of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which regulates the catalytic activity of eNOS, and molecular dynamics studies focusing especially on the serine residues S615, S633, and S1177 were performed. MD analysis of this structure revealed that S633 is highly flexible and accessible to solvent molecules, while S1177 becomes highly flexible when S633 is phosphorylated. The presence of intramolecular interactions between S1177 among the major serine residues underscores its structural importance to the efficient synthesis of nitric oxide in endothelium. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of phosphomimetic (for phosphorylation) and phosphomutant (for dephosphorylation) eNOSs for use as experimental model systems, the structural dynamics and conformational changes in phosphomimetic (S615D, S633D, S1177D) and phosphomutant (S615A, S633A, S1177A) eNOSs were investigated. Phosphomimetic and phosphomutant eNOSs portrayed S633 as a modulator of S1177, whereas such correlations could not be observed in native and phosphorylated eNOSs. Computational analysis of the docked complex revealed that phosphorylated pS1177 and pS615 have high affinity for Akt (one of the key kinases in the eNOS activation pathway), with a significant number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges observed between these residues and Akt . This work therefore provides evidence of the subtle structural changes that occur within the reductase domain which contribute to the stability–flexibility–activity relationship of eNOS. Such subtle changes are of great importance in the context of regulated nitric oxide release by different phosphorylated forms of eNOS and the need to account for the existence of subtle differences between real proteins and experimental model systems.
