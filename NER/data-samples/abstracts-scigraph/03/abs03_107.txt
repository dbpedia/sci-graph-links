Abstract Molecular dynamics simulations with the Langevin equation using a coarse-grained, bead-spring model were performed to investigate the dynamic properties of nanoscale lubricant films. The simulated spreading profiles of lubricant nanofilms are in qualitative agreement with previous experimental results. The Einstein’s relationship and Green–Kubo formula provide alternative perspectives for describing the diffusive phenomena of lubricant nanofilms. The effects of molecular weights and their distribution, temperature, and film thickness were examined.
