Abstract In this work, the spectroscopic information, stability and aromaticity of the boron-nitrogen azulene and naphthalene molecules are provided by the use of CC2 (geometry optimization, dipole moment, UVâ€“vis spectrum calculations) and DFT (vibrational spectrum and NMR calculations) methodologies. One isomer of the investigated boron-nitrogen naphthalene (boroazanaphthalene) and two isomers of boron-nitrogen azulene, 1,3,4,6,8-pentaaza-2,3a,5,7,8a-pentaboraazulene (BN-azulene) and 2,3a,5,7,8a-pentaaza-1,3,4,6,8- pentaboraazulene (NB-azulene), are stable systems. However, these molecules have different properties, i.e., different stability, dipole moment, and aromaticity based on the NICS approach. BN-naphthalene has a high dipole moment magnitude showing high polar character, while naphthalene is apolar. BN- and NB-azulene are weakly polar, while ordinary azulene is highly polar in character. Also, substitution of C atoms by B and N atoms decreases the aromaticity. In the case of NB-azulene, the seven-membered ring has anti-aromaticity behavior while both rings of BN-azulene exhibit aromaticity. We expect that the new theoretical data provided in this work will be useful in identifying and characterizing experimentally the compounds investigated, and in helping our understanding of the chemistry of boron-nitrogen molecules.
