Abstract This work presents new developments of the moving-domain QM/MM (MoD-QM/MM) method for modeling protein electrostatic potentials. The underlying goal of the method is to map the electronic density of a specific protein configuration into a point-charge distribution. Important modifications of the general strategy of the MoD-QM/MM method involve new partitioning and fitting schemes and the incorporation of dynamic effects via a single-step free energy perturbation approach (FEP). Selection of moderately sized QM domains partitioned between $$C_\alpha $$ and C (from C=O), with incorporation of delocalization of electrons over neighboring domains, results in a marked improvement of the calculated molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). More importantly, we show that the evaluation of the electrostatic potential can be carried out on a dynamic framework by evaluating the free energy difference between a non-polarized MEP and a polarized MEP. A simplified form of the potassium ion channel protein Gramicidin-A from Bacillus brevis is used as the model system for the calculation of MEP.
