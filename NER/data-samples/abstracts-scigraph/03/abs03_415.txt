Abstract To research and estimate the effects of molar ratios on structures, stabilities, mechanical properties, and detonation properties of CL-20/HMX cocrystal explosive, the CL-20/HMX cocrystal explosive models with different molar ratios were established in Materials Studio (MS). The crystal parameters, structures, stabilities, mechanical properties, and some detonation parameters of different cocrystal explosives were obtained and compared. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results illustrate that the molar ratios of CL-20/HMX have a direct influence on the comprehensive performance of cocrystal explosive. The hardness and rigidity of the 1:1 cocrystal explosive was the poorest, while the plastic property and ductibility were the best, thus implying that the explosive has the best mechanical properties. Besides, it has the highest binding energy, so the stability and compatibility is the best. The cocrystal explosive has better detonation performance than HMX. In a word, the 1:1 cocrystal explosive is worth more attention and further research. This paper could offer some theoretical instructions and technological support, which could help in the design of the CL-20 cocrystal explosive.
