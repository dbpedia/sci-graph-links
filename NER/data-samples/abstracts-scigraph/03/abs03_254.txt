Abstract In this article, a theoretical study of 1–5 proton transfers is presented. Two model systems which represent 1–5 proton transfer, 3-hidroxy-2-propenimine and salicyldenaniline have been studied as shown in Fig. 1. For this purpose, a DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G**, reaction force and reaction electronic flux analysis is made. The obtained results indicate that both proton transfers exhibit energetic and electronic differences emphasizing the role of the neighbor ring and the impact of conjugation on electronic properties.
