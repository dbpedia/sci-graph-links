Abstract Self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) is a promising method for hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The acylation reaction of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a promising drug target, was investigated by applying a SCC-DFTB/CHARMM27 scheme. Calculated potential energy barriers resulted in reasonable agreement with experiments for oleamide (OA) and oleoylmethyl ester (OME) substrates, outperforming previous calculations performed at the PM3/CHARMM22 level. Furthermore, the experimental preference of FAAH in hydrolyzing OA faster than OME was adequately reproduced by calculations. All these findings indicate that the SCC-DFTB/CHARMM27 approach can be successfully applied to mechanistic investigations of FAAH-catalyzed reactions.
