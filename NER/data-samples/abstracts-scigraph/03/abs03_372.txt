Abstract The stereochemical activity of the lone pair on PbII complexes is assessed using several theoretical methods, including structural analyses, computations of Fukui functions, natural bond orbitals, electron localization function, investigation of the electron density and of its laplacian. The attention is focused on four octadentate N-carbamoylmethyl-substituted tetraazamacrocycles of various ring sizes ranging from 8 to 14 atoms associated with the PbII cation. The theoretical study illustrates the geometrical constraints imposed by the ring structure which limits the spatial development of the lone pair but without fully preventing it. For a given coordination number, the lone pair activity is strongly correlated to the geometry of the ligand and in particular to the size of the cage that the ligand forms around the PbII cation. Some limitations of the theoretical tools used are also evidenced, among them the necessity to sample around a critical point instead of just analyzing its nature. In the case of the laplacian of the electron density, a visualization method is introduced to moderate the results based only on the nature of a critical point. These limitations should also be related to the difficulty to extend the lone pair concept for the heaviest atoms of the classification.
