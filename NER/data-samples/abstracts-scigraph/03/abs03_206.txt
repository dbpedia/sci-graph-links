Abstract The antisymmetrized molecular dynamics method is used to investigate the two-body electrodisintegration of 4He. Effects of final-state interactions are included via the Glauber multiple scattering approximation. Experimental data for the 4He longitudinal and transverse response functions are well described at high momentum transfer.
