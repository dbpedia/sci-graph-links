Abstract β-Hairpins are the simplest form of β-sheets which, due to the presence of long-range interactions, can be considered as tertiary structures. Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful tool that can unravel whole pathways of protein folding/unfolding at atomic resolution. We have performed several molecular dynamics simulations, to a total of over 250 ns, of a β-hairpin peptide in water using GROMACS. We show that hydrophobic interactions are necessary for initiating the folding of the peptide. Once formed, the peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and disruption of hydrophobic interactions in the folded peptide does not denature the structure. In the absence of hydrophobic interactions, the peptide fails to fold. However, the introduction of a salt-bridge compensates for the loss of hydrophobic interactions to a certain extent. FigureModel of b-hairpin folding: Folding is initiated by hydrophobic interactions (Brown circles). The folded structure, once formed, is stabilized by hydrogen bonds (red lines) and is unaffected by loss of hydrophobic contacts
