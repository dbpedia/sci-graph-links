Abstract In the present research, the experimentally observed regioselectivity in Sonogashira synthesis of 6-(4-nitrobenzyl)-2-phenylthiazolo[3,2-b]1,2,4triazole has been modeled by means of density functional theory (DFT) employed to investigate the structural and thermochemical aspects of this synthesis in the gas and solution phases. Comparison of our calculated structural parameters of the title compound with the available X-ray crystallographical data demonstrate a reliable agreement. Then, the effect of two different solvents, DMF and ethanol, are examined via polarized continuum model calculations, showing a significant decrease in the computed values of the reaction enthalpy and free energy changes compared with the gas phase results. We have also considered two tautomeric structures of the intermediate species that it seems the mode of its intermolecular cyclization has an important role in regioselectivity of the final products. Moreover, all obtained results in the gas and solution phases also confirm that the synthesis of the title compound is thermodynamically more favorable than the other regioisomeric product. We also discuss the thermodynamical feasibility of this reaction at higher temperatures. Finally, we concentrate on the survey of substituent effect by choosing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on the aryl iodide. Our calculated thermochemical data in the gas and solution phases indicate that the use of electron-withdrawing moieties is more favorable thermodynamically than electron-donating ones which has been previously concluded via the experimental elucidations.
