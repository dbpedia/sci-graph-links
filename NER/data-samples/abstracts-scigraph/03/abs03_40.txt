Abstract The Van Vleck method is used with the point-charge model to calculate the spin-lattice relaxation times of the Ce3+ ion in binary nitrates. Normal coordinates are found for the icosahedral XY12 complex containing the paramagnetic ion and its nearest neighborhood. The theoretical transition probabilities for the purely ionic model turn out to be slightly above the experimental results, so covalent effects are important.
