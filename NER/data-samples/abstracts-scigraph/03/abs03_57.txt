We present a theoretical and experimental study of the fluorescent ability of new coumarin sensitizers. Using the INDO method, we have drawn the level diagram for the photophysical processes in the coumarin molecules. We have calculated the rate constants for internal conversion and intersystem crossing and the radiative rate constants. We have determined the experimental and theoretical fluorescence yields of the test compounds.
