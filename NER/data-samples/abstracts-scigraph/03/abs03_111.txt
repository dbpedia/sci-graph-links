Abstract The objective of this research work is to provide a systematic method to perform molecular dynamics simulation or evaluation for adhesion of micro/nano gear train during sliding friction in MEMS. In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations of adhesion problems in micro gear train are proposed. The perfect MEMS gear train model is very complicated by considering the computing time. A simplified model to simulate surface sliding between metals by molecular dynamics (MD) is proposed because the surface property is a dominant factor for the performance of gear systems. Based on analysis of sliding friction and the transmitting characteristics of micro gear train, a model is established by utilizing the Morse potential function. The VerletÂ algorithm is employed to solve atom trajectories. The simulation results show that adhesion tends to occur between two micro gears after certain cycles and such adhesion accounts for the friction force and the temperature increase. The simulation results are in consistence with the experimental results in the literature. The model is meaningful to prolong the lifetime of micro gear train by selecting proper parameters.
