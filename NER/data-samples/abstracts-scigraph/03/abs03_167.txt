Abstract Density functional theory is used to investigate the electronic state of a carbon nano-onion conglobated by endohedral-ing the highly curved C20 fullerene within its parent fullerene C60. The Non-Equilibrium Greenâ€™s Function is later employed to examine the quantum transport when the carbon nano-onion, C20@C60 is stringed to the pair of gold electrodes of (001) plane. The computed results are evaluated and compared with C20 and C60 junctions. The calculated electronic parameters of these molecular junctions are utilized to extrapolate their two electrical parameters: current and conductance. The carbon nano-onion junction assembled from the C20 and C60 molecules displays the combined effect of their molecular junctions when organized separately. Also, the insertion of C20 molecule in the hollow cavity of C60 fullerene leads to the enhancement of its current and conductance in carbon nano-onion junction formed, when compared to the one constructed otherwise.
