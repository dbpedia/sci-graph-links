Abstract The spin-lattice relaxation time of the129Xe nucleus of natural xenon gas dissolved in various isotropic liquids, acetonitrile, benzene, carbon tetrachloride and cyclohexane, was studied as a function of temperature at the magnetic fields of 9.4 and 4.7 T. The utilization of hydrogenated and deuterated benzene and cyclohexane reveals that the intermolecular129Xe-1H dipole-dipole interaction constitutes an important relaxation mechanism in hydrogenated solvents. According to this interpretation the interaction is rather strongly temperature-dependent, and increases with increasing temperature. An important observation of an experimental nature is also noted, namely convective flow present in non-spinning sample tubes at elevated temperatures disturbs inversion-recovery measurements and leads to erroneous and unreliable relaxation time values.
