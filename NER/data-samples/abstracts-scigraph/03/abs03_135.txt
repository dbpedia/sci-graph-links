Abstract A model is proposed for the Lu2SiO5 crystal with cerium impurity, and the defect formation energy, ion relaxation energy, and the defect-induced changes of the Madelung potentials are calculated. The calculations show substitution of the cerium ion for the lutetium ion in the Lu1 position to be energetically preferred.
