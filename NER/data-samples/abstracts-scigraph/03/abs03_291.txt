Abstract We have analyzed the electronic structure and chemical bonding for molecular adducts of the Ag(II)F2 molecule with various aza Lewis bases including ammonia, nitriles, secondary amines, and their derivatives exhibiting various degrees of fluorination. Density functional theory calculations indicate that a progressive shift occurs of the spin density from the Ag center towards the coordinating nitrogen atoms of aza ligands, as the ligation energy increases. Chemistry of Ag(II) might be extended with little effort beyond the known aza connections, to include nitriles, perfluorinated nitriles and perfluorinated amines. FigureProperties of a variety of novel adducts of the AgF2 molecule with two aza bases (L), possible precursors of the AgF2L2 extended solids, were assessed by the DFT calculations
