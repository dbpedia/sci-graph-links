Abstract Using a simple minded and conventional HF and TDHF formalism we study an extended NJL model with explicit chiral symmetry breaking which incorporatesN f =2 andN c =3. We investigate properties of the vacuum state and of hadronic matter. We compute the constituent quark mass, the pion decay constant, the quark condensate and other properties of the σ−π sector of the model. These values essentially agree with the values obtained by sophisticated perturbation theoretical methods. The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner and the Goldberger-Treiman relations which come from PCAC are derived from theS 1 sum rule.
