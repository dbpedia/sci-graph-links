Abstract The ultraviolet spectra of Na2 and K2 molecules have been investigated. These studies were made in absorption in the second order of a 3.4 m Ebert Spectrograph with a reciprocal dispersion of 2.6 Ã…/mm. A number of new bands in the spectra of both the molecules not previously reported have been observed. Computer methods have been used to calculate the term values and to evaluate molecular constants.
