Abstract A modified method for the magnetron deposition of heterostructures on single-crystal substrates that combines a high degree of efficiency and a high production rate is developed. Grown structures are simulated within the density functional theory to determine the most stable atomic positions in the InN/Si and GaN/Si interfaces.
