Abstract Molecular recognition between 4aS/R-galanthamine diastereoisomers (1: 4aS-galanthamine; 2: 4aR-galanthamine) and α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) were studied by use of docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches. The binding energy of constructed 2···α-CD complexes is ~17 kcal mol−1 lower than that of 1···α-CD, implying a stronger binding ability of 2 with α-CD than that of 1. The theoretical modeling result is consistent with our previous CZE result, which demonstrated that α-CD is an efficient chiral additive for separating 1 and 2. The modeling result also indicates that both hydrophobic interaction and H-bond force may work as major factors for molecular recognition between the galanthamine diastereoisomers and α-CD.
