Abstract Ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6–31G* level using the GAUSSIAN94 program package have allowed us to simulate the molecular structures for different conformations of 6-amino-5-formyl-1,3-dimethyluracil-benzoylhydrazone. The contribution of the atomic orbitals of the potential donor atoms to the higher occupied molecular orbitals allows us to propose theoretical arguments to justify the different chelating behavior found for this compound in several metal complexes. Further, the molecular structure of 6-amino-5-formyl-1,3-dimethyluracil-benzoylhydrazone has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic system (space group P21/n) with cell dimensions: a = 12.111(5), b = 5.743(5), c = 22.636(5) Å, β = 98.60(5)°. The structure was solved from 1719 reflections with I>2σ(I). The final R [I>2σ(I)] was 0.0506 for 217 parameters. The azomethine double bond substituents are in the E conformation and the N51 atom is in the cis position with respect to the N6 atom, due to the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond N6-H···N51. The geometrical data are in good agreement with those calculated by means of ab initio methods.
