Abstract The switching propensity and maximum probability of occurrence of the side chain imidazole group in the dipeptide cyclo(Hisâ€“Pro) (CHP) were studied by applying molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory. The atomistic behaviour of CHP with the neurotoxins glutamate (E) and paraquat (Pq) were also explored; E and Pq engage in hydrogen bond formation with the diketopiperazine (DKP) ring of the dipeptide, with which E shows a profound interaction, as confirmed further by NH and CO stretching vibrational frequencies. The effect of CHP was found to be greater on E than on Pq neurotoxin. A ring puckering study indicated a twist boat conformation for the six-membered DKP ring. Molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) mapping was also used to explore the hydrogen bond interactions prevailing between the neurotoxins and the DKP ring. The results of this study reveal that the DKP ring of the dipeptide CHP can be expected to play a significant role in reducing effects such as oxidative stress and cell death caused by neurotoxins.
