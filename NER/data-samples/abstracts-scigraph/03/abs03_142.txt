Abstract Through the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) calculations, theoretical studies of structural parameters, electronic properties, infrared vibration modes, and charge density topologies on the C2H4O∙∙∙HX and C2H5N∙∙∙HX (X = F or O–F) heterocylic hydrogen complexes are presented. The H-bond distances and high energies point out strong contacts and stable interactions in these complexes, and the relationships between the frequency shifts on the H–F and H–O bonds as well as O–F σ-holes with the interaction strength are the benchmarks of this current work. The computations of charge transfer amounts in light of the ChelpG and NBO approaches revealed a separation of charge density on the O–F σ-holes, whose statement is reinforced by the QTAIM descriptors. Despite that O∙∙∙H and N∙∙∙H H-bonds have been characterized as closed-shell interactions, qualitatively the appearance of a partial covalent profile also was unveiled by the QTAIM protocol.
