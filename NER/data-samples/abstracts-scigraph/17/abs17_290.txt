Summary The cross-sectional profiles of isolated veins ofPhysarum polycephalum plasmodia, winded round agar rods, were investigated by analysis of time-lapse films. The whole profile follows the same principal contraction-relaxation rhythm, but slight desynchronization and amplitude differences are found around the contour. As a result, the profile periodically changes its shape in the course of pulsation cycles, its lateral slopes becoming more convex in the expanded state than during contraction. Factors responsible for such geometrical deformations and their bearing for morphometrical studies of the motory activity of plasmodium are discussed.
