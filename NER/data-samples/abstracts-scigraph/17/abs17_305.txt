Abstract This report presents results obtained from studies of the mnemotropic activity of the ergot alkaloid agroclavin. The effects of this substance were studied at concentrations of 1, 10, 25, 50, and 200 Î¼g/kg on the learning and retention of a spatial habit in a Morris water maze. These doses of agroclavin had no effect on the process of formation of the spatial habit, but sharply disturbed retention of the habit. A long-lasting effect of memory trace disturbance was seen over a period of 48 h after dosage. On retraining, animals showed no delayed effects with agroclavin on learning a new spatial habit. The possible mechanisms for the effect of agroclavin on memory are discussed.
