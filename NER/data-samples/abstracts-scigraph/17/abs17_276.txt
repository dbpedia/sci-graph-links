Abstract We find an analytical condition characterising when the probability that a Lévy Process leaves a symmetric interval upwards goes to one as the size of the interval is shrunk to zero. We show that this is also equivalent to the probability that the process is positive at time t going to one as t goes to zero and prove some related sequential results. For each α > 0 we find an analytical condition equivalent to $${X_{T_r} T_r^{-1/\alpha}\stackrel{p}{\longrightarrow} \infty}$$ and $${X_t t^{-1/\alpha}\stackrel {p} {\longrightarrow} \infty}$$ as $${r,t \to 0}$$ where X is a Lévy Process and T r the time it first leaves an interval of radius r
