Abstract In both cross-sectional and longitudinal experiments, 15-day-old domesticated rats were shown to locomote persistently in a maze. Thirty-day olds displayed a within-trial decrement in activity typical of adult patterns of ambulation. These data are consistent with the conclusion that 15-day olds may be behaviorally similar to adults with hippocampal lesions.
