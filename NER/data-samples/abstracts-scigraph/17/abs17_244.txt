Abstract Perpendicular recording has recently been replacing longitudinal recording in hard disk drives (HDDs). With perpendicular recording, however, it has been clarified that a state of DC magnetization is not conducive for read and write operations because it causes a unique flux flaw. In this paper, we investigated servo-write quality and servo performance, and found that the erasing conditions strongly affected the self-servo-write quality, which was especially seen in the reading process.
