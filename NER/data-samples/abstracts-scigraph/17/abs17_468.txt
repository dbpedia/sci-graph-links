Abstract Twenty-four orgasmic and 10 anorgasmic women, ages 21â€“40, provided continuous self-report measures of sexual arousal while viewing explicit videotape segments depicting a variety of sexual activities. They also completed several questionnaires designed to assess sexual attitudes, knowledge, and guilt. As compared to the orgasmic women, the anorgasmic women reported (i) greater discomfort in communicating with a partner regarding only those sexual activities involving direct clitoral stimulation, (ii) more negative attitudes toward masturbation, (iii) greater endorsement of sex myths, and (iv) greater sex guilt. Contrary to expectations, the groups failed to differ significantly on either the frequency of use of any of the sexual activities depicted or on arousal to viewing these activities. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are explored.
