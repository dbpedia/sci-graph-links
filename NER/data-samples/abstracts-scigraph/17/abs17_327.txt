Abstract This paper examines how the educational background influences the performance of managersâ€™ strategies. The research is based on data collected by an experiment with the management game SINTO-Market. This management game puts the players in a competitive situation in the branded food product sector, within which the subjects take over the role of the managers who have to find out the most successful strategy. From experimental research with this management game we will draw some interesting conclusions about human behavior in complex economic decision-making situations. To investigate educational effects the management game SINTO-Market was performed with students of different educational levels 17 times. The results show some significant differences between graduates and undergraduates.
