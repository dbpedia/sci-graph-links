Conclusions 1.In free vibrations in laminated anisotropic shells, a complex strain state appears, with a three-dimensional character.2.If anisotropy is ignored, the calculated value of the natural frequency is considerably overstated; the error increases with increasing number of the waves in the circular direction.3.Calculation of an anisotropic shell on the basis of the orthotropic model may give incorrect representations of the alternation of the lowest modes of vibration, which cannot be tolerated in formulating elastic dynamic models of the objects of investigation.
