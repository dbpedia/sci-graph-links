Abstract Analytical procedures are presented which permit the determination of the Working Levels of the radon and thoron progenies with personal α-dosimeters and α-particle environmental monitors, operating on time integrating principles, from gross α-counts. Experiments have been carried out in an underground uranium mine and in a radon/thoron environmental chamber, specially designed for calibration purposes, to verify theoretical data. In general, and notwithstanding a number of complicating factors, fair to good agreement has been found between theoretical and experimental data. Experimental values have been found to be lower than theoretical values, an observation which is partly ascribed to plate-out of decay products in the instrument's sampling heads.
