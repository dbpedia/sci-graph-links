Abstract We consider the well-known problem of schedulingn independent tasks nonpreemptively onm identical processors with the objective of minimizing the makespan. Coffman, Garey and Johnson described an algorithm MULTIFIT, based on bin-packing, with a worst case performance better than the LPT-algorithm. The bound 1.22 obtained by them was claimed by Friesen in 1984 that it can be improved to 1.2. In this paper we give a simple proof for this bound.
