Abstract Three experiments employing weight-judgment tasks with the method of constant stimuli were conducted to test between incongruity and tension relief hypotheses of humor. In the first two experiments, the difficulty of the initial judgments and the heaviness of the final comparison weight were varied in order to manipulate tension and incongruity, respectively. Incongruity but not tension manipulations affected both facial expressions and ratings of humor. A third experiment varied the subjects' expectations about the heaviness of the final comparison weight, which was assumed to affect incongruity but not tension. The expectancy manipulations affected facial expressions and ratings of humor. The results of all three experiments supported the incongruity hypothesis but not the relief hypothesis of humor.
