Abstract Instructional designers recognize motivation as a key to instruction effectiveness and have a need for information about designing motivating instruction. Keller’s model (in press) and Markova’s model (1986) for the design of motivating instruction with their prescribed strategies are analyzed. The large number of strategy similarities supports the validation of the cross-cultural comparison. Differences suggest the addition of three specific strategies not included in Keller’s model: (a) the use of role-modeling to increase the learner’s expectancy of success, (b) the use of a formal self-evaluation to validate learning and improve the learner’s satisfaction with the instruction, and (c) the use of important problems in the scientific world to increase the relevancy of the lesson. Further support for the use of these additional strategies to motivate learners can be found in the U.S. literature (Martin & Briggs, 1985).
