Abstract We present some new criteria for the oscillation of even order dynamic equation $$\left(a(t)({x^\Delta}^{n-1}(t))^\alpha\right)^\Delta +q(t)(x^\sigma(t))^\lambda = 0$$on an unbounded above time scale $${\mathbb{T}}$$, where α and λ are the ratios of positive odd integers, a and q is a real valued positive rd-continuous functions defined on $${\mathbb{T}}$$.
