Abstract We give elementary proofs of the fact that the Loewner matrices $${[\frac{f(p_i) - f (p_j)}{p_i-p_j}]}$$ corresponding to the function f(t) = t r on (0, ∞) are positive semidefinite, conditionally negative definite, and conditionally positive definite, for r in [0, 1], [1, 2], and [2, 3], respectively. We show that in contrast to the interval (0, ∞) the Loewner matrices corresponding to an operator convex function on (−1, 1) need not be conditionally negative definite.
