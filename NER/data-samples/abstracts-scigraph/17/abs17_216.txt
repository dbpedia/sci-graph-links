Abstract In (Bor in Int. J. Math. Math. Sci. 17:479-482, 1994), Bor has proved the main theorem dealing with |N¯,pn|k summability factors of an infinite series. In the present paper, we have generalized this theorem on the φ−|A,pn|k summability factors under weaker conditions by using an almost increasing sequence instead of a positive non-decreasing sequence.
