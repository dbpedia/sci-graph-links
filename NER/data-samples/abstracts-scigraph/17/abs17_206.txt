Abstract The present study aims to investigate and compare the auditory attention performance of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and normally developing children (NDC) using cognitive evoked potentials (ERPs) in passive conditions. ERPs data showed that children with DCD have less ability to detect small physical differences between acoustic stimuli (no MMN response in DCD children) and have a reduced attentional engagement and stimulus evaluation of salient stimuli (a reduction of P3 amplitude in DCD children). The results of our study suggest that children with DCD do not only suffer from a visuospatial attention deficit as previous studies reported but also have auditory attention deficit.
