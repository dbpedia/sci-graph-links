Summary We examine the medium strong mass splittings for pseudo-scalar mesons, vector mesons and spin-2/3 baryons in the framework of the «fifth interaction» proposed by Ne’eman. In addition to the resonance contributions from the low-lying states, we write an expression for the contribution from f8 Regge exchange in terms of contributions to electromagnetic mass differences from A20 Regge exchange. Assuming that the A20 Regge pole gives the correct contribution to the e.m. mass differences, we estimate the contribution of the f8-meson. In the approximation of neglecting the continuum spectrum, the ratio of tadpole contributions is given by the ratio of coupling constants of the f8-meson with hadrons. The results of the tadpole model are in agreement with the subtraction scheme of Segrè. We also find that in the presence of such anSU 3-symmetry-breaking term, the renormalization of the hadronic weak-strangeness-changing vector current vertex, to second order in such a term, is quadratically divergent.
