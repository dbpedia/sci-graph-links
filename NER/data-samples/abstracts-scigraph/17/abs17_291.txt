Summary Phenothiazine forms a blue-violet colored complex with palladium(II) at a pH value 2.5–3.5. A 16-fold molar concentration of the reagent is necessary for the full development of color intensity. Beer's law is valid over the concentration range 0.2–3.0 ppm. The optimum concentration range evaluated by Ringbom's method is 1.4–2.9 ppm. The sensitivity (for an absorbance value of 0.001) of reaction is 0.015 μg/cm2 and the molar absorptivity is 7.13 × 103 1 mol−1 cm−1 at 600 nm. The effects due to pH, reagent concentration, ethanol concentration, time and diverse ions are reported. The composition of the complex as determined by the continuous variation and mole ratio methods is 1∶1 and the apparent stability constant of the complex at pH 3.0 and 270 has the log K value of 4.5.
