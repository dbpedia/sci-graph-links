Summary The questionableness of geometric models of stimulus similarity has led to the development of an alternative approach by Tversky which makes no dimensional or metric assumptions. Rather, stimuli are described as sets of qualitative stimulus aspects and stimulus similarity as a function of common and non-common aspects. According to Restle's model of stimulus similarity, however, the perception of stimuli of a categorial nature can be organized along dimensions because stimulus aspects form dimensions under certain conditions. The present study supports the empirical validity of this assumption. Further it is suggested that contrary to the present opinion quantitative stimulus characteristics are probably not perceived as dimensions in the sense of the geometric models but only dimensions as described in the Restle model.
