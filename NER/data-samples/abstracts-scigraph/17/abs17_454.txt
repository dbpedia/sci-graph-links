Abstract This paper will discuss the emotional developmental problems displayed by those who are deaf at birth. In order to provide an in-depth understanding of the emotional needs of the prelinguistic infant the distinctive perspectives and concerns of various developmental psychologies will be reviewed. The tremendous need for mental health and social work services for the deaf population and their families has been rarely discussed, therefore, the last stage of this presentation will provide some suggestions for clinical treatment and prevention programs for deaf individuals.
