Abstract. We consider self-avoiding walk and percolation in ℤ d , oriented percolation in ℤ d ×ℤ+, and the contact process in ℤ d , with p D(·) being the coupling function whose range is proportional to L. For percolation, for example, each bond is independently occupied with probability p D(y−x). The above models are known to exhibit a phase transition when the parameter p varies around a model-dependent critical point p c . We investigate the value of p c when d>6 for percolation and d>4 for the other models, and L≫1. We prove in a unified way that p c =1+C(D)+O(L−2 d ), where the universal term 1 is the mean-field critical value, and the model-dependent term C(D)=O(L− d ) is written explicitly in terms of the random walk transition probability D. We also use this result to prove that p c =1+cL− d +O(L− d −1), where c is a model-dependent constant. Our proof is based on the lace expansion for each of these models.
