Abstract A comparison involving cumulative probability distributions of reaction time (RT) has been used to test race models of the redundancy gain observed in certain divided-attention paradigms. It has beenpointed out, however, that the presence of fast guesses wouldinterfera with this test, biasing it to accept race models. The present paper reports simulations carried out to determine the size of the bias introduced by fast guesses. In absolute terms, this bias can be quite large— exceeding 175 msec in some conditions. Simulations indicate that the bias increases with the percentage of fast guesses and with the latency difference between the lower tails of guess and nonguess RT distributions. Discarding and rerunning errors reduces bias somewhat, but a more elaborate “kill-the-twin” procedure reduces it much more.
