Abstract This essay explores the relationship between the motif of inheritance, the concept of art, and the notion of Bildung itself, in Agathon, Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre and Der Nachsommer. In conclusion, and continuing from the main argument, attention is drawn to significant stylistic similarities and differences between Stifter and Kafka, which help to situate the Bildungsroman as a genre.
