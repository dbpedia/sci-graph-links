Summary An extension of the second Noether theorem is proposed, which covers the case of Lagrangians invariant under local transformations of the velocities without any related co-ordinate transformation. A set of true Lagrangian transformations can be associated to such invariances and it is found that the Noether identities imply Lagrangian constraints.
