Abstract During solo calling, pulse periods gradually changed by up to 15 % over several minutes. Pairs of calling males synchronized their pulses. The pulse rate (10–14 Hz) was considerably faster than the rate of synchronized signal units in other insects (0.5–3 Hz). Within each pulse cycle, males made only small adjustments to their pulse period, leading to regular switches of leader and follower roles. Large-scale timing adjustments only occurred in response to large delays. Stimulation with single pulses had no predictable effect on the timing of the male’s next pulse, resulting in a flat phase response curve. When entrained to a stimulus with a faster pulse period, males briefly interrupted calling; they resumed calling largely synchronized with the stimulus. Throughout the stimulus, males made gradual changes to their pulse period, similar to those during pair calling. After the stimulus ended, pulse periods increased over several minutes, but did not return to their pre-stimulus values. Thus social context and intrinsic state of the males influenced pulse period in Neoconocephalus ensiger. These results indicate that N. ensiger males synchronize calls by adjusting their intrinsic pulse period, instead of adjusting the timing of individual pulses, as described in other synchronizing insects.
