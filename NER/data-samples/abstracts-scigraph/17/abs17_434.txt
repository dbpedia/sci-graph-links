Abstract Premarital intervention programs are on the rise in the United States despite the absence of persuasive empirical data that substantiate their effectiveness. In addition to this lack of strong empirical support, many premarital counseling programs fail to articulate any coherent theory of family process or family intervention which serve as conceptual guideposts for formulating program goals and devising program activities. In this article, the authors describe an experimental program that is conceptually grounded in theories of family process and family intervention. The theoretical rationale for each element included in the program is discussed and numerous examples of the program's content and exercises are offered. Finally, the authors discuss a number of issues central to the evaluation of premarital counseling programs.
