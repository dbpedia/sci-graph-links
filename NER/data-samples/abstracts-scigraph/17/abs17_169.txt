Abstract The history of the deme terminology is outlined,John Gilmour's leading role in inventing and publicising it is explained, and its relative failure discussed. The rather different reactions of zoologists and botanists to advocacy of the terminology byGilmour and others are described and some explanation of these differences is attempted. A limited use of “first-order” deme terms, especially gamodeme, topodeme and cytodeme, is advocated as being a reasonable and practical procedure.
