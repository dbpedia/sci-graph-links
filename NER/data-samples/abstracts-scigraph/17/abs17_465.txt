Summary The characteristic signs of decentralization (cortico-hemispheric and nucleo-bulbar) and denervation (pre-and postganglionic) of the human parotid gland are presented. These signs may be used for differential diagnosis. The significance of proserine and atropine as indicators of pre-and postganglionic denervation (proserine-atropine dissociation, atropine paradox) was demonstrated. The author illustrates the dual character of chemoreceptive postsynaptic transmission, namely, the presence of cholinopositive (cholinomimetic) phylogenetically older, and cholinonegative (cholinolytic, inhibitory) phylogenetically younger structures. Various special points of application of proserin, atropine, pilocarpine (acetylcholine) are given (within the range of the pre-and postsynaptic transmission).
