Abstract Although nicotine is a drug of abuse for millions of smokers, it has been difficult to demonstrate clearly the motivational properties of nicotine with rats using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. The first experiment attempted to replicate CPPs reported by other researchers using nicotine doses of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/kg. There was a trend for all three doses to produce aversions, but it was significant only for the 0.8 mg/kg dose. Exposures to the CS alone extinguished aversions, but a “priming” dose (0.2 mg/kg) of nicotine given after extinction produced aversions only in animals exposed to 1.2 mg/kg. Experiment 2 tested whether preexposure to morphine or nicotine would sensitize animals to nicotine's reinforcing effects. In this experiment, rats were exposed to either six nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) or morphine (1.0 mg/kg) dosings prior to preference conditioning. Neither preferences nor aversions were observed in any group following subsequent conditioning with 0.6 mg/kg nicotine. The results suggest that previous observations of preference effects may have been due to specific procedural factors or may have depended on negative reinforcement due to stress reduction.
