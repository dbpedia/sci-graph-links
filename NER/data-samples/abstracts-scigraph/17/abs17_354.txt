Abstract Four D. melanogaster strains characterized by different alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activities were compared for their oviposition site preferences. The comparison was made between different temperatures (15 째C, 20 째C, 25 째C, 30 째C), day and night, replicates, and different concentrations in ethanol (00%, 5%, 10%, 15%) in the medium. All these factors influence behaviour. ADH activities seem to affect the oviposition site preferences as they directly affect ethanol tolerance and the ability to use alcohol as a source of metabolic energy.
