Abstract Evening preference has recently been identified as a risk factor for depression and anxiety. In this study, the relationship between anxiety, morningness–eveningness and sleep habits were examined during adolescence. Adolescents aged 12–16 years (n = 1406; 50.9 % girls) completed the Morningness–Eveningness Scale for Children, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and open questions pertaining to their typical bedtime and rising time during weekdays and weekends. Anxiety was associated with age, eveningness, early risetime and shorter time in bed during weekdays. No significant correlations were found between anxiety, risetime and bedtime on the weekend, time in bed on the weekend and social jetlag. A greater proportion of evening types was found in the high anxiety group. With regard to sex, girls reported higher anxiety levels, an earlier risetime and bedtime during the weekdays, a later risetime on weekend, a greater time in bed during weekend and higher social jetlag.
