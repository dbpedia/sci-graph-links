Abstract Addressing a gap in the trauma recovery literature, the current study seeks to deepen understanding and encourage discussion of intergenerational trauma for Palestinian children living under military occupation. Differing definitions of intergenerational trauma and the plethora of terms used to describe children’s traumatic experiences are explored. A historico-political and social context analysis is applied to understanding the creation and maintenance of intergenerational trauma in the occupied Palestinian territories. The cumulative impact of historical and collective trauma and loss, and daily humiliation on children’s symptoms are analyzed using a developmental trauma framework. Effective healing of intergenerational trauma is then set within cultural beliefs and the formation of identity. Finally, a framework for shaping future research is proposed.
