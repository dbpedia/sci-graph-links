Summary Infusion tests were performed in order to examine cereospinal compensatory ability in two groups of patients with impaired compensation, subjected to shunt implantation. The functioning of the classic differential shunts was compared to the automatically (Orbis-Sigma) functioning shunts. The reference group, with intact compensatory parameters is also presented. The influence of different types of shunts on the intracranial compensation ability was compared. Automatic shunts produce less decrease in the resorption resistance of CSF in the post-shunted examination than the classic differential shunts. Classic differential shunts disturb the mono-exponential character of the pressure-volume relationship in a higher degree than automatic shunts. Shunt functioning models were proposed as well as the method of detection of eventual recovery to the normal resorption reserve. This method can be applied only to patients with automatic shunts.
