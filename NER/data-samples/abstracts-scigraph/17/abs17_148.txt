Abstract Rats were trained either 52 or 92 hr. in an operant discrimination involving two SDs and one SΔ. During extinction, comparisons of the number of responses to individual and to combined stimuli indicated that: (1) SΔ exerts an inhibitory effect when combined with one or both SDs; (2) excitatory control summates; and (3) an amount-of-training effect may have been present.
