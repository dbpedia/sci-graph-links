Abstract We investigate multiplication formulas for Apostol-type polynomials and introduce Î»-multiple alternating sums, which are evaluated by Apostol-type polynomials. We derive some explicit recursive formulas and deduce some interesting special cases that involve the classical Raabe formulas and some earlier results of Carlitz and Howard.
