Abstract The author reviews The Nurture Assumption (1998) by Judith Rich Harris against the background Magic Trees of the Mind (1998) by brain researcher Marion Diamond and science writer Janet Hopson. Harris challenges the widely respected assumption that parents form the characters of their children by offering a new model, group socialization theory, and supporting it by citing a wide variety of research.
