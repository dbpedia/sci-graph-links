Abstract Experiential dance/movement therapy (DMT) emphasizes the receptive mode of consciousness, which cannot be measured directly but appears to correlate with measured hypnotizability (Goodman & Holroyd, 1992). Based on a pilot study performed by the first author, in which second year DMT students scored higher on hypnotizability than first year students, we expected that hypnotizability and a related personality variable, absorption, would increase for DMT trainees over the training year. Fourteen DMT trainees and a comparison group of ten social welfare or psychology trainees were given hypnotizability, absorption and imagery tests at the beginning and end of their first year. Unexpectedly, DMT trainees began with higher levels of absorption and imagery thinking styles than the comparison group. The difference between groups on absorption increased over time, as the DMT group scores increased while the comparison group scores decreased. As predicted, hypnotizability tended to increase for the DMT group (p<.09, 1-tailed test) but not for the comparison group. We discuss both the distinctiveness of DMT trainees and the personality changes attributable to dance movement therapy training.
