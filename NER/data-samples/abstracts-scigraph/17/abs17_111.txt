Abstract Light-front quantization of the conformally gauge-fixed Polyakov D1 brane action in the presence of a constant background scalar axion field C(τ, σ) and an U(1) gauge field A α (τ, σ) is studied. The axion field C and the U(1) gauge field A α , are seen to behave like the Wess–Zumino (WZ) fields and the term involving these fields is seen to behave like a WZ term for this action.
