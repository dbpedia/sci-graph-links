Abstract ObjectiveTo investigate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response to a stressor in adolescents with inattentive type attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms (ADHD-I). MethodSalivary cortisol was measured in threshold inattentive (TI, n = 7), moderately inattentive (MI, n = 13) and no symptom (comparison) (n = 19) groups of healthy, young adolescents, based on symptom counts, prior to and after an induced social/cognitive stressor. ResultsThe TI group displayed a significant decrease in cortisol post stressor whereas both the MI and comparison groups showed an increase in cortisol. ConclusionThe diagnostic threshold of inattentive type ADHD shows HPA axis dysregulation whereas the more mild form does not show dysfunction.
