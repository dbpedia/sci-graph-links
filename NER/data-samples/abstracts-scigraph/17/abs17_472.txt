Summary An inquiry was made into the chief indices of external respiration in man during the action of accelerations (up to 15 g) directed along the dorso-thoracic axis at an angle of 65o to the back of the arrnchair. A definite regularity was established in the changes of the indices studied with various accelerations. Definite stages were noted in the development of individual reactions; this regularity reflected the essence of the general biological laws concerring body adaptation to new environmental conditions.
