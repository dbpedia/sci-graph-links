Abstract This paper describes elicitation by critiquing (EBC) as a cognitive task analysis (CTA) methodology. EBC takes advantage of the ability to analyze anotherâ€™s task performance, a necessary skill for all domains. This technique can be used to help address some barriers to CTA methods such as domain access restrictions, frequency and predictability of observable and self-reported events, and difficulties in recruiting domain experts to participate. The technique enables controlled presentation of problem stimuli in order to obtain repeated measuring of the same task from multiple participants. To investigate this method, our team performed a CTA of inferential analysis using the EBC technique. Specifically, we observed six expert intelligence analysts critiquing a trainee analyzing the Ariane 501 launch failure. A second trainee was critiqued for reference. The method can be combined with other CTA methods to build knowledge about a domain, can be considered as an addition to participatory design methods, and can be varied depending on the domain being investigated.
