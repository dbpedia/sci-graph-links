Summary BACKGROUND: Familial retinal arteriolar tortuosity (fRAT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by marked tortuosity of second- and third-order retinal arteries with normal first-order arteries and venous system. In most reported cases of this rare disease no other vascular malformations or associated systemic diseases have been found. It can be complicated by retinal hemorrhages after minor stress or trauma, but prognosis is usually excellent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To assess function of retinal vessels in this disorder we performed a complete ophthalmological examination including fluorescein and indocyanin green angiography in a patient with fRAT. For static and dynamic retinal vessel analysis we used the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer both in the patient with fRAT and in an age-matched control group of 10 healthy male subjects. RESULTS: Ophthalmologic examination showed an extremely corkscrew-shaped tortuosity of small second- and third-order arterioles on both eyes and a small preretinal hemorrhage in the left eye. In the patient with fRAT, the arteriolar-to-venular ratio was similar to that of the control group and flicker-induced change of vessel diameter did not differ from the controls in both retinal arterioles and venules. CONCLUSIONS: Results from retinal vessel analysis suggest that patients with fRAT have normal endothelial function and regulation of vessel diameter.
