Summary The zonule fibers are composed of numerous fibrils measuring 1–2 μ in diameter. Owing to their course, two different groups of about equal size can be distinguished: The fibers originating from the pars plana go to the anterior aspect of the lens, whereas those coming from the ciliary valleys and the sides of the ciliary processes insert on the posterior aspect of the lens. The number of zonule elements is markedly reduced in the old eye. Fibers inserting on the equator of the lens are found exclusively in the young eye. Polymorphous particles, some of which probably represent free or local cells, are scattered over the entire zonule.
