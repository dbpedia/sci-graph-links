Abstract Considerable evidence indicates that the state of ocular connective tissues and their response in glaucomatous disease affect the degree of glaucoma damage. Both experimental and clinical data suggest that improved diagnostic and prognostic information can be derived from the assessment of the mechanical responsiveness of the sclera and lamina cribrosa to intraocular pressure (IOP). Controlled mutagenesis of the sclera has produced a mouse strain that is relatively resistant to increased IOP. Alteration of the baseline scleral state can be accomplished through either increased cross-linking of fibrillar components or their reduction. The sclera is a dynamic structure, altering its structure and behavior in response to IOP change. The biochemical pathways that control these responses are fertile areas for new glaucoma treatments.
