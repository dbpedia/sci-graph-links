Abstract To explore the effect of high glucose concentration on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) in the cultured rat retinal Müller cells. Rat Müller cells were cultured and RT-PCR and Western-blot analysis were used to measure the levels of VEGF and PEDF in cultured Müller cells at different high glucose concentrations. Under 10, 20, 30 mmol/L high glucose conditions, the levels of VEGF mRNA and protein increased and the levels of PEDF mRNA and protein decreased. These results suggest that the VEGF and PEDF expression in Müller cells are unbalance under high glucose concentration, which contribute to retinal neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy.
