Summary In contrast to the wild-type eye color seen when Drosophila melanogaster ♀♀ heterozygous for mal 1/mal F1 are cultured at 25 C, a mutant eye color is observed in heterozygotes cultured at 29–30 C throughout development. Furthermore, heterozygotes have wild-type eyes upon emergence provided development proceeds at 25 C during either of two critical periods: 1) The third quarter of the 3rd larval instar or 2) an imprecisely defined pupal period beginning less than 12 hours before the visual appearance of brown eye pigment and terminating about the time pigment appears in the wings.
