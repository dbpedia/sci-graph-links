Abstract One-hundred-three patients referred for evaluation of peripheral retinal lesions were reviewed; 56 eyes had peripheral degenerations without breaks, 62 eyes had atrophic holes, and 88 eyes presented retinal tears. Peripheral degenerations of the snail-track and typical lattice-like types occurred with reasonable uniformity throughout the periphery and were seen symmetrically in both eyes. Atrophic retinal holes frequently occurred within these degenerative areas. Peripheral degenerations with or without holes were often seen in young myopes and occurred mostly without giving rise to symptoms. Retinal tears occurred in older, predominantly hyperopic or emmetropic subjects, and usually presented with symptoms of acute entopsiae and/or photopsiae. The tears presented mainly in the upper temporal quadrants and were only associated with lattice degenerations of the ipsi or contralateral eye in one-third of cases. It was concluded that the population suffering from retinal tears only partially overlaps with that presenting with lattice degeneration of the retinal periphery, and that it is questionable if a causal link is present between these two conditions. As a result the raison d'Ãªtre of prophylaxis can be called into question.
