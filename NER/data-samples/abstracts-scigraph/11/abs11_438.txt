Abstract An analysis is made of the results of a double-exposure recording based on superposing the subjective speckle fields of a Gabor hologram with a negative lens located in the plane of the amplitude scatterer. It is shown that when the hologram is reconstructed a lateral-shear interferogram is formed in this plane and on the optic axis if the diffraction field is spatially filtered, and an interference pattern having twice the interferometer sensitivity for a fixed lateral shear is localized in the plane of the hologram.
