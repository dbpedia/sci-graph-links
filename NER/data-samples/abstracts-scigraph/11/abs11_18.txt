Summary The ultrastructure of the compound eyes of 13 amphipod species has been investigated. An amphipod type of compound eye can be characterized by the constellation and consistency of a number of morphological features, most of which are also found in other compound eyes. The amphipod eye falls into four sub-categories (types). The ampeliscid type has a tripartite aberrant lens eye; the lysianassid type has a reduced or no dioptric apparatus and a hypertrophied rhabdom; the hyperid type possesses a large number of ommatidial units with long crystalline cones and dark instead of reflecting accessory pigment; and finally, the gammarid type can be interpreted as a generalized amphipod type. The lysianassid type is adapted to low light intensities and demonstrates convergent development with the compound eyes of other deep-sea crustaceans. The ampeliscid type is more similar to the gammarid type. The type characterization of the amphipod compound eye might well serve as a basis and incentive for functional studies also revealing adaptational mechanisms.
