Abstract We examined biochemically the lysosomal enzyme activities in tear fluids from patients with mild myopia, senile cataract, and Terrien's marginal corneal degeneration. Tear acid phosphatase activities in Terrien's degeneration were almost the same as those in mild myopia and senile cataract, while those ofN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase in Terrien's degeneration were higher. The high activity of tearN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase may be derived from the lacrimal gland and infiltrate histiocytelike cells in Terrien's marginal corneal degeneration.
