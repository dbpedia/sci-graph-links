Abstract: We report a case of Crohn's disease with low serum zinc concentration in a 26-year-old woman. She demonstrated acrodermatitis enteropathica and decreased visual acuity during total parenteral nutrition. Subsequent intravenous zinc supplementation resulted in alleviation of the skin lesions and improvement of visual acuity. This case supports the notion that depressed serum zinc in Crohn's disease may cause clinical manifestations, such as acrodermatitis enteropathica and retinal dysfunction, which may be correctable with zinc supplementation.
