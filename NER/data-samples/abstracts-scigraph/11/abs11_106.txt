Abstract Cystoid macular edema frequently complicates recovery from cataract surgery. Our understanding of this disease would be enhanced by more sensitive and quantitative methods to evaluate it. We performed vitreous fluorophotometry in 66 nondiabetic patients who had recently undergone cataract surgery. Eyes with definite macular edema on fluorescein angiography were ranked according to the severity of the leakage. The rank of the leakage correlated significantly with the vitreous fluorophotometry values (P < 0.01). The mean fluorophotometry result in the eyes with cystoid macular edema was greater than that in the phakic, control group (P < 0.01). However, eyes with minimal or no leakage visible on fluorescein angiography had fluorophotometry values indistinguishable from normal. The quantitative vitreous fluorophotometry results provided an indicator of cystoid macular edema that may prove useful in following this problem and evaluating therapy for it.
