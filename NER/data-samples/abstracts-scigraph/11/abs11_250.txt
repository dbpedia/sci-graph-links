Abstract A 3-year-old crossbred Pakistani doe in its second parturition was submitted to the private clinics in Kerman without a complaint of dystocia. She delivered a normal alive female lamb twin and a monster alive male. The gross examination revealed severity of the facial defects such as atypical cyclopia, involving the one eye with double lens, cornea, iris, and ciliary body.
