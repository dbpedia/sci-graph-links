Summary The retinal efferents of the catfish, Mystus vittatus, were investigated with the use of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. Most retinal fibres extended contralateral to the eye that had received HRP label, while a few fascicles projected to the ipsilateral side without decussation in the optic chiasma. The contralateral fibres projected to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the nucleus opticus dorsolateralis, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, the nucleus geniculatus lateralis, pretectal nuclear complex, and to two layers of the optic tectum, i.e., stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale and stratum griseum centrale. The accessory optic tract arose from the inner area of the optic tract and extended ventromedially to the accessory optic nucleus. The ipsilateral fascicles projected to almost all the above mentioned nuclei, but these projections were comparatively sparse. The ipsilateral retinal projection was restricted to the rostral tectum.
