Abstract Ranibizumab (Lucentis®), an inhibitor of multiple vascular endothelial growth factor A isoforms, is approved for the intravitreal treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In clinical trials in patients with neovascular AMD, monthly or less frequent injections of ranibizumab were effective in the treatment of predominantly classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and minimally classic or occult CNV lesions. Ranibizumab has a well-established safety profile, and is associated with low rates of ocular and systemic serious adverse events. In head-to-head comparisons, the efficacy of monthly bevacizumab was equivalent to monthly ranibizumab at 1 and 2 years, individualized treatment with bevacizumab was equivalent to individualized treatment with ranibizumab at 1 and 2 years, and bimonthly aflibercept was noninferior to monthly ranibizumab at 1 year. These trials were not powered to detect between-treatment differences in safety.
