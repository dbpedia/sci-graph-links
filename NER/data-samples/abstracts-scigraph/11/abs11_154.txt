Summary Members of all orders of reptiles rotate the optic bulb to compensate for changes in pitch of the head. The eye rotates through 20–30° in snakes and turtles, 50° in crocodiles and 60° in rhynochocephalians. The eye fully compensates for changes in pitch of the head over about 1/2 the range of its response. This response is largley mediated by vestibular position reflexes. It is relatively independent of the visual horizon, body proprioceptors and temperature. Rotation of the eye bulb can be related to pupillary shape and to the reported organization of the visual projections to the optic tectum. Regardless of head position, reptiles orient their eyes to keep the horizon under close inspection.
