Summary The sequence of morphological changes in the retinal pigment epithelium during the metamorphic period of the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus L. has been investigated using electron microscopy. At early metamorphic stages (stages I and II), photoreceptors are present in a small zone of the retina. During these stages, the lateral surface of the epithelial cells shows zonulae occludentes and adhaerentes. The degree of cell differentiation varies throughout the retinal pigment epithelium. Cells covering the differentiated photoreceptors in the central retina have phagosomes, whereas pigment granules appear only in the retinal pigment epithelium dorsal to the optic nerve head. Most epithelial cells have myeloid bodies; their morphology is more complex around the optic nerve head. At stage III, when photoreceptors develop over the whole retina, the distribution of cytoplasmic organelles is almost homogeneous in the retinal pigment epithelium. Subsequently, the basal plasma membrane of the epithelial cells becomes progressively folded and their apical processes enlarged. In addition, extensive gap junctions develop between retinal pigment cells. In late metamorphic stages, noticeable growth of myeloid bodies occurs and consequently the retinal pigment epithelium resembles that of the adult. This study also describes, for the first time, the presence of wandering phagocytes in the retinal pigment epithelium of lampreys; their role in melanosome degradation is discussed.
