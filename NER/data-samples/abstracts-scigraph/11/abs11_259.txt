Summary The distribution of adrenergic fibres to the eye and to the ciliary ganglion was studied in pigeons, chicken and ducks with the aid of the sensitive and highly specific fluorescence method of Falck and Hillarp. In some animals the intensity of the fluorescence was increased by treating the animals with Nialamide and 1-DOPA. The cornea contained no adrenergic fibres except at the limbus, where a plexus of adrenergic varicose fibres was seen, partly associated with vessels. In the chamber angle, adrenergic varicose fibres were common in the loose connective tissue covering the canal of Schlemm. The canal of Schlemm was supplied by only few adrenergic fibres, but such fibres appeared along the intrascleral aqueous drainage vessels. In the iris, adrenergic varicose fibres appeared immediately in front of the posterior layer of pigment cells, strongly indicating the presence of a dilator homologous with that seen in mammals. The frontal third of the stroma contained several adrenergic varicose fibres, many of which seemed to lack association with any vessel. Varicose adrenergic fibres were also sparsely seen in the striated muscle of the iris. The ciliary processes contained many adrenergic varicose fibres, at least part of which seemed to be associated with the ciliary epithelium. The striated muscles of the ciliary body contained adrenergic varicose fibres along the vessels only. The retina contained adrenergic varicose fibres in three layers in the inner plexiform layer. Adrenergic ganglion cells of two sizes were detected in the inner nuclear layer. The retinal vessels had no adrenergic nerve fibres. The pecten was also devoid of adrenergic nerve fibres, except along the vessels close to the papilla. The optic nerve contained adrenergic varicose nerve fibres along vessels only. In the ciliary ganglion, varicose adrenergic fibres appeared at the small ganglion cells, often forming baskets of synaptic character.
