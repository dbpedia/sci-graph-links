Abstract PurposeTo evaluate the relationship between corneal and ocular higher order wavefront aberrations (HOAs) and age in young subjects aged 20 years or less. MethodsCorneal and ocular HOAs of the right eyes of 87 normal subjects were measured using videokeratography and the Hartmann–Shack wavefront aberrometer (KR-9000PW; Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The HOAs were calculated using Zernike polynomials up to the sixth order. From the Zernike coefficients, the root mean squares (RMS) of coma and spherical aberration were calculated. ResultsCorneal spherical-like aberrations significantly correlated with age (r = 0.420, p < 0.001); however, coma-like aberrations and total HOAs did not significantly correlate with age. None of the ocular HOAs significantly correlated with age. In addition, a gender-wise comparison of the collected data showed that corneal and ocular HOAs did not significantly correlate with age. ConclusionIn children, the corneal and ocular total HOAs did not vary with age. Compared to the previous reports in adults, we found fewer corneal and ocular HOAs in children.
