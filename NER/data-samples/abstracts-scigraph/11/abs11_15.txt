Summary Two sisters and their brother affected with microcephaly, microphthalmia, chorioretinal degeneration, and optic atrophy were studied. Besides the clinical features derived from the main abnormalities, nanosomy and cutis marmorata were found in the three patients. Both parents and three other sibs were normal. Possible intrauterine non-genetic etiologic factors (X-rays, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus) which can lead to phenocopies were investigated with negative results. Based on these and previous observations, it seems clear that a distinct form of autosomal recessive microcephaly associated with chorioretinal degeneration can be separated from the heterogeneous group of entities which presents microcephaly.
