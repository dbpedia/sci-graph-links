Summary The cell membrane in the distal region of the photoreceptors of Nereis virens is formed into large numbers of tubular microvilli which interdigitate with those of neighbouring photoreceptors. No traces of cilia or basal bodies have been found, but a prominent axial filament with a repeat pattern of 660 Å extends from the upper to the lower parts of the cell. Large numbers of mitochondria are found in the outer segment of the photoreceptors around the bases of the microvilli. As it passes through the pigment layer the photoreceptor is invaded by finger-like intrusions of the pigment cells which serve to prevent light entering the eye from behind. The lens consists of fine filaments or rod-shaped bodies secreted by the pigment cells, which pass to the lens up narrow pillars between the outer segments of the photoreceptors. Attention is drawn to the evolutionary parallel between the shadow reflex of Branchiomma and the “off” responses of the photoreceptors in the distal retina of Pecten, both animals being exceptional within their phyla in having photoreceptors of the ciliary type.
