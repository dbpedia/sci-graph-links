Summary We have used the vitrophage for combined lensectomy and vitrectomy in six eyes with congenital cataracts. No intraoperative complications were encountered. One week after operation four of the six eyes had clear corneas, and all eyes showed a bright red reflex. With follow-up ranging from 18 to 21 months all eyes had clear corneas and a view of the posterior pole consistent with 20/20 vision.
