Summary A method for grading diabetic retinopathy using standard photographs is described. — Five retinopathy components — microaneurysms and haemorrhages, exudates, new vessels, venous irregularities and retinitis proliferans — are treated independently and for each component, four standard photographs allow grading into five grades of severity. The whole set of standard photographs consists of twenty 35 mm Kodachrome transparencies. — During a trial the method gave consistent results, particularly in the hands of observers familiar with the technique.
