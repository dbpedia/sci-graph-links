Summary The retinofugal and retinopetal connections in the upside-down catfish Synodontis nigriventris were studied by use of the horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) techniques, autoradiography, and degeneration-silver methods. An unusual retinal projection to the torus semicircularis as well as projections to the retina from three different sources in the brain are described. After intra-ocular injections of HRP, labeled cells were found in the optic tectum, the dorsomedial optic nucleus and one of the pretectal nuclei. These new findings support the basic hypothesis (i) that neuronal connections are more extensive in primitive brains, and (ii) that the evolutionary development of more complex brains involves the loss of some selected connections.
