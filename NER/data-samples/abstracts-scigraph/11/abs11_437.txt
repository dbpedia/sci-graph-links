Abstract Fluid transport in the isolated rabbit eye lens was assayed gravimetrically, and was found to be, at least partly, an active process involving Na,K-ATPase. Thereby the pressure inside the lens proved to be elevated by 6 mm Hg. The energy required for this process was estimated at (1.5–6)·10−2 J. The movement of fluid in vivo (monitored with fluorescein) proceeds from the anterior to the posterior surface and out into the vitreous body.
