Abstract A 6-year-old, female terrier dog was presented with a history of excessive lacrimation, photophobia, decreased appetite, weight gain, hair loss, lethargy, and mental dullness. Clinical examinations revealed comedones, seborrhea, thickening, and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Conjunctival congestion, hyperemia, and a white central corneal deposit on both eyes were observed during eye examination. Hematological investigations showed hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The Hormone profile revealed low serum levels of total and free thyroxin and an increased serum level of TSH. The appearance of ocular lesion as well as increased levels of blood cholesterol and triglyceride confirmed our diagnosis of corneal lipidosis, and considering the hormonal changes and symptoms, hypothyroidism was considered as the cause of corneal lipidosis. The dog was treated with levothyroxine and atorvastatin.
