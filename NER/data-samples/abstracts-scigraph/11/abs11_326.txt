Summary An ultrastructural study of the 8 day chick embryo retina has been performed using gluteraldehyde and osmium tetroxide fixation. It has been noted that the centrioles of ganglion cells show clavate extensions similar to those seen in the basal bodies of photoreceptors and that these appear to give rise to the neurotubules. The neurotubules thus are shown to originate from the same organelle and have the same morphology as the spindle tubules in the mitotic cell, although the mode of origin is quite different. Some implications of these observations have been discussed.
