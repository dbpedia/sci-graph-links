Summary BackgroundPhakic intraocular lenses (IOLs) are gaining popularity for refractive surgeons, since these IOLs are easy to implant and can correct high ametropia up to 20 D. However, these implants can still lead to reversible and irreversible complications, even years after implantation. Material and methodsThis review gives a short overview about the different kinds of phakic IOLs, the advantages and disadvantages of these lenses and the pre- and post-operative examinations. ResultsMost of the angle-supported phakic IOLs have been abandoned from the market few years after launching. Two anterior chamber IOLs and one posterior chamber IOL—the iris-clip IOL ‘Artisan/Verisyse’ (Ophtec, Netherlands/Abbott, USA), the angle supported IOL ‘Cachet’ (Alcon, USA) and the ‘implantable collamer lens’ (Staar, USA), are commercially available at the moment. ConclusionPhakic IOLs are a good option for the treatment of high myopia, but exact preoperative examination of the patient and consistent post-operative controls including endothelial cell count are mandatory to reduce the risk of long-term complications.
