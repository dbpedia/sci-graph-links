Abstract Three eyes with preretinal macular fibrosis (PMF) were treated with the Q-switched Nd-YAG laser. The PMF was idiopathic in two eyes and associated with a vitreous hemorrhage, due to ocular trauma, in the third eye. The three eyes had in common a partial posterior vitreous detachment with vitreous traction on the macula. The Nd-YAG laser beam was focused on the detached posterior hyaloid in front of the macular region. Some holes were made in this membrane or in the adjacent collapsed vitreous cortex. Treatment increased the visual acuity in the three eyes; the vitreous remained partially detached in the two eyes with idiopathic PMF and detached completely in the eye with the secondary PMF. The disentanglement of the fovelar area was revealed by the unfolded appearance of the retinal vessels on fluoangiography.
