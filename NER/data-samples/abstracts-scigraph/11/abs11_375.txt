Summary The eye ofAplysia contains a circadian oscillator which can be entrained by cycles of white light (Jacklet, 1969b). Photoreceptors sufficient for entrainment of this oscillator reside within the eye itself (Eskin, 1971). We now report that extraocular photoreceptors can also entrain the ocular oscillator. Our evidence is:(1)Although the eye gives only a weak sensory response to red light (Fig. 2), red light cycles will entrain the ocular oscillator in an intactAplysia (Fig. 3).(2)Ocular entrainment by red light cycles, but not by white, requires that the optic nerve be intact (Fig. 4a, b); denervation of the eye allows the ocular oscillator to freerun in red light cycles (Fig. 4c).(3)The procedure of denervation does not prevent ocular entrainment by white light cycles in denervated eyes (Fig. 8). TheAplysia nervous system contains several circadian oscillators and several photoreceptors. Functional integrity of the organism requires that these elements be synchronized with one another. A neural, as opposed to hormonal, link is required for coupling the circadian oscillator in the eye to other neural sources of temporal information.
