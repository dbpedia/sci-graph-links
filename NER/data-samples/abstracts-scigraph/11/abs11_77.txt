Summary Occlusion of one eye and functional hemidecortication by cortical spreading depression (CSD) were used to examine the relative importance of crossed and uncrossed visual projections for pattern discrimination learning in hooded and albino rats. Whereas functionally hemidecorticate albino rats were unable to learn in 200 trials a horizontal-vertical discrimination when using the eye contralateral to the depressed hemisphere, hooded rats needed under similar conditions three times as many trials to criterion (167) than when using opposite eye and hemisphere (59). An engram established in intact animals with both eyes could be retrieved in functionally hemidecorticate rats of both strains even with the eye ipsilateral to the intact hemicortex, but retraining required about twice as many trials as when using the contralateral eye. Retrieval of monocularly acquired engrams was less efficient under similar conditions. Pattern discrimination formed through crossed or uncrossed visual projections during monocular occlusion and contralateral or ipsilateral CSD was completely lateralized, since relearning with naive eye and hemisphere proceeded at the same rate as the original learning. On the contrary, a black-white discrimination trained with the eye contralateral to the depressed hemisphere could be partly retrieved by the untrained eye and hemisphere. It is concluded that the ipsilateral visual projection is more effective in hooded than in albino rats and that it can be more efficiently used for retrieval than for acquisition.
