Summary BACKGROUND: A case report about a patient with refractory uveitis-related cystoid macular edema (CME), that could be treated sucessfully with ranibizumab. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 0,5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab was injected monthly via pars plana, when needed. Need of injection was defined by CME in OCT. RESULTS: After 8 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab CME was resorbed and stayed without recurrence since 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab has the potential to reduce uveitis-related CME and to improve vision.
