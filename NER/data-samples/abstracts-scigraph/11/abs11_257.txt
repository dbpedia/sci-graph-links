Summary Actin, myosin, and laminin have been localized in retinal vessels of normal rats by fluorescence microscopy. Actin was localized with the fluorescent F-actin binding toxin nitrobenzoxadiazole phallacidin (NBD-Ph). Indirect immunofluorescence was used to localize myosin and laminin. In addition, laminin localization was also performed with the Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (PA-HRP) method. NBD-Ph staining gave strong fluorescence in both retinal capillaries and larger vessels. Anti-myosin fluorescence could also be observed in trypsin digests of the retinal vasculature. Strong fluorescence of PA-HRP reaction product could be detected in the walls of vessels exposed to antilaminin antibody. Actin distribution in vessels of the RCS rat with inherited retinal degeneration (retinal dystrophic RCS rat) was also studied. After exposure to NBD-Ph, all capillaries showed fluorescence. However, it was more intense in many of the capillaries in the outer retina, which also appeared morphologically abnormal. Electron microscopy of retinal capillaries fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing 8% tannic acid revealed numerous micro filaments in the pericyte cytoplasm amd some in the basal portion of endothelial cells. In pericytes, these microfilaments are in close association with the endothelial side of the cell. Tangential sections through this region indicate that these filaments may be anchored to the membrane at this site.
