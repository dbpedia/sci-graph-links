Abstract Visual electrophysiology allows non-invasive monitoring of the function of most processing stages along the visual pathway. Here, we consider which of the available methods provides the most information concerning glaucomatous optic nerve disease. The multifocal electroretinogram (ERG), although often employed, is less affected in glaucoma than two direct measurements of retinal ganglion cell function, namely the pattern ERG (PERG) and the photopic negative response (PhNR) of the ERG. For the PERG, longitudinal studies have been reported, suggesting that this method can be used for the early detection of glaucoma; for the PhNR, no longitudinal study is available as yet. The multifocal PERG can spatially resolve ganglion cell function but its glaucomatous reduction is typically panretinal, even with only local field changes and so, its topographic resolution is of no advantage in glaucoma. The multifocal visual evoked potential promises objective perimetry and shows sensitivity and specificity comparable with standard automated perimetry but has not been established as a routine tool to date.
