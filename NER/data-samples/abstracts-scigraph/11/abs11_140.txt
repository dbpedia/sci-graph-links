Abstract 1.The optics of the corneal facet lenses from the dorsal rim area (DRA) and from the dorso-lateral areas (DA) of the compound eye of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus were studied.2.The DRA of the cricket eye contains quite normally shaped facet lenses. The diameter of the facet lens in the DA is 2-fold larger compared to that in the DRA. The radius of curvature of the front surface is distinctly less in the DA facet lenses, as the surface of the facet lenses in the DRA are virtually flat.3.The averaged axial refractive index of the facet lenses of Gryllus bimaculatus, measured by interference microscopy, was 1.496 ± 0.008 (n = 42) in the DRA and 1.469 ± 0.004 (n = 39) in the DA. The geometrical thickness of the lenses was calculated to be 77 ± 3 μm (n = 42) in the DRA and 56 ± 1 μm (n = 39) in the DA.4.Analysis of the diffraction pattern obtained with a point light source revealed distinct focusing properties of both the DRA and the DA facet lenses; striking Airy-like diffraction patterns were obtained in both cases.5.Focal distances measured directly at the backfocal plane were 40 ± 8 μm (n = 84) in the DRA of all the animals studied, and 60–90 μm (n = 62) in DA depending on the animal. Analysis of the diffraction of the point light source yielded very similar focal distances: 40 ± 5 μm (n = 10) in DRA and 81 ± 8 μm (n = 11) in DA. In the DRA, focal distance of the facet lenses was smaller than the cone length, 58 ± 3 μm (n = 9) while in the DA the focal distance matched the effective cone length, 71 ± 5 μm (n = 16).
