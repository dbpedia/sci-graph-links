Summary 1.Properties of the visual system of Aplysia californica were studied by recording optic nerve impulses extracellularly from isolated eyes in constant darkness.2. In vivo entrainment of the circadian rhythm of afferent optic nerve impulses by LD 12âˆ¶12 cycles phase advanced 13 hours was essentially complete after only one exposure of the animal to this light cycle.3.The impulse rhythms of eyes exposed to the phase advanced light cycle in vitro entrained, but in this case 4 to 5 exposures to the advanced light cycle were required before entrainment was complete. The difference in the rates of in vivo and in vitro entrainment obtained whether eyes remained attached to the cerebral ganglion or were cultured in filtered Aplysia blood instead of a modified Eagle's minimal essential medium.4.Eyes maintained in vitro for 9 days expressed circadian impulse rhythms.5.The behavior of the eye is influenced by efferent activity from neuronal elements in the cerebral ganglion. The pattern of afferent optic nerve impulses and the waveform of the afferent impulse rhythm varies depending on whether or not the eye remains attached to the cerebral ganglion.6.Electrical stimulation of either the optic, tentacle, or rhinophore nerves, which emanate from the cerebral ganglion, produces an inhibition of the efferent optic nerve activity. This result indicates that a mechanism exists in Aplysia for the activity of one eye to affect the behavior of the contralateral eye and for other sensory inputs to affect the behavior of the eye as well.
