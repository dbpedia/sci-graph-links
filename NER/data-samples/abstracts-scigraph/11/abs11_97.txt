Summary The poorly developed visual system of the electric catfish was studied with silver-degeneration methods. Retinal projections were entirely contralateral to the hypothalamic optic nucleus, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the dorsomedial optic nucleus, the pretectal nuclei including the cortical nucleus, and the optic tectum. The small size and lack of differentiation of the visual system in the electric catfish suggest a relatively small role for this sensory system in this species.
