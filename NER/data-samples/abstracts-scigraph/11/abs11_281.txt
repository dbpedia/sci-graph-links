Summary Among the different factors which could be responsible for the retinal vascular disturbances in diabetic retinopathy, we have investigated platelet populations, sialic acid content of platelets and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. The following results were obtained: a) there was no modification of platelet population distribution except for population A; b) there was a modification of collagen-induced platelet aggregation; the lag time was increased in diabetics.
