Summary Subsequent to the injection of horseradish peroxidase into the parietal eye of adult Lacerta sicula, the course of the parietal nerve and its projections were determined. The parietal nerve enters the left habenular ganglion where it branches into a medial and a lateral route. Some nerve fibers decussate within the habenular commissure. Whereas this pathway exhibits a striking asymmetry at the level of the habenular ganglia, its projections to the dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the periventricular hypothalamic area, the preoptic hypothalamic and telencephalic regions, and the pretectal area are arranged in a strictly symmetric manner. A possible innervation of tegmental areas could not be proven due to the presence of endogenous peroxidase within these regions. No parietal nerve fibers were observed in the optic tectum. In a few animals investigated, scattered labeled perikarya were located in the periventricular hypothalamic gray indicating a parietopetal innervation in Lacerta sicula. The injection of horseradish peroxidase into one of the lateral eyes revealed terminal areas of the optic nerve within the preoptic region, and the thalamic and pretectal nuclei, displaying partial overlapping with the projections of the parietal nerve to these areas. From the present investigation further evidence is obtained that the pineal complex of lower vertebrates is a component of the photoneuroendocrine system. Particular emphasis is placed upon the nervous connections between the parietal eye and the hypothalamus, described for the first time in the present study.
