Abstract Pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) in response to 8.3 Hz alternating gratings (16.6 rev/sec) of different spatial frequencies were recorded in normal subjects as well as in patients affected by early glaucoma and ocular hypertension. In normal subjects the PERG response is spatially tuned, with a maximum at about 1.5 cycles/deg and attenuation at higher and lower spatial frequencies. In all cases of early glaucoma and in the great majority of cases of ocular hypertension the PERG was reduced, as compared with that of normal subjects, mainly in the medium range of spatial frequencies (at which the PERG has its maximal amplitude).
