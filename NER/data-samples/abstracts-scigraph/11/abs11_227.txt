Abstract  · Background: In pathologic myopia, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) usually occurs in macular region and at the center of the macular staphyloma. CNV has been reported to occur at the borders of an inferior posterior staphyloma in the tilted disc syndrome. We present a case of multiple simultaneous CNVs located at the borders of a myopic macular staphyloma. · Methods: The clinical and angiographic records of a myopic patient who presented several areas of choroidal neovascularization were reviewed. · Results: On fundus examination, four gray lesions surrounded by subretinal hemorrhages and covered by a large serous retinal detachment were observed at the borders of a posterior staphyloma. Fluorescein angiography revealed that these four lesions were CNVs extending from the borders of the staphyloma to the macular region. As measured by B-scan ultrasonography, the staphyloma was 4 mm deep. · Conclusion: This case supports the hypothesis that the borders of staphylomas are sites at risk for the development of CNV in pathologic myopia.
