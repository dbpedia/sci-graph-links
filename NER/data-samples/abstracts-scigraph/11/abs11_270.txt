Abstract AimsTo investigate the short-term effects of intravitreal ranibizumab on retinal vessel functionality in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) by Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA). MethodsPatients presenting with DME were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including optical coherence tomography and dynamic and static vessel analysis, using the DVA before (baseline), 1 week and 1 month after administration of intravitreal ranibizumab. DME subject were compared with diabetic retinopathy (DR) without DME subjects, and with normal non diabetic subjects (controls) matched for age and sex. ResultsA total of 45 eyes of 45 subjects (15 eyes for each group) were included in the analysis. In DME patients, dynamic analysis showed a significant decrease in mean arterial dilation from baseline to 1 week. Mean central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) of DR patients without DME was significantly different from baseline and week 1 of DME eyes. In healthy control subjects, CRAE was significantly different from CRAE at baseline and 1 week on DME patients, but not significantly different from DR patients without DME. ConclusionsUsing DVA in patients with DME, dynamic analysis showed a significant decrease in mean arterial dilation from baseline to 1 week in DME eyes. A significant reduction in arterial vessels could be demonstrated in DME patients compared to DR patients without DME and controls.
