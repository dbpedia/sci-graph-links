Summary Studies of the dorsal ocelli of the wasp Paravespula vulgaris (L.) led to the following results: Under a biconvex corneal lens, 150 μm in thickness, about 600 receptor cells are located. The rhabdomeres of two adjacent cells form a closed plate-like rhabdom (0.5–1.0 μm in thickness, 6 μm in width and 10–25 μm in depth or length). In the lateral ocellus the receptor cells synapse up to 8 ocellar nerve fibers, and in the median ocellus they synapse up to 16 (20–30 μm thick) ocellar nerve fibers. The ocellar synaptic plexus may display three types of synapses between the two types of neurons: (i) Receptor-cell axons are presynaptic to dendrites of the first-order interneurons. (ii) Dendrites of the first-order interneurons are presynaptic to receptor-cell axons. (iii) The subunits of a dendrite of first-order interneurons form synapses with each other.
