Abstract This study aims to report a case of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) misdiagnosed as optic neuritis. The methods include review of the clinical, photographic, angiographic, visual field, infrared imaging, and optical coherence tomography records of a patient with AMN. A 30-year-old female who was initially diagnosed with optic neuritis and at first was treated with systemic corticosteroid because of this misdiagnosis. She was admitted with no decrease in her complaint of central scotoma in both eyes. Her visual acuities were 20/20 and fundoscopy showed reddish brownish pigment changes in the macula of both eyes. Infrared (IR) imaging disclosed bilateral hyporeflective lesions, optical coherence tomography revealed a disrupted inner segmentâ€“outer segment junction of the right eye, and visual field assessment showed central scotomas in both eyes. Three years later, fundus examination of the hyporeflective lesions by IR imaging revealed that the lesions had decreased and were only slightly perceptible. This rare case is presented to focus the attention of clinicians and to emphasize the importance of careful ophthalmic examination and imaging techniques.
