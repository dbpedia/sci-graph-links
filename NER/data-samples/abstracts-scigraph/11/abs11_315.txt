Abstract  · Background:Perfluorocarbon liquids are useful intraoperative tools in complicated vitreoretinal surgery. They are usually removed at the end of the procedure, but small amounts may remain in the eye. Recently, contradictory results have been reported on the damage in association with residual perfluorocarbon liquids in the eye. This study examined the effects of perfluorodecalin on human retinal pigment epithelium and corneal endothelium in vitro. · Methods:Vitality and proliferative capacity of cell cultures were measured after incubation with perfluorodecalin. Vitality of cell cultures were measured using the Life-Dead assay. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring incorporation of 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine into cellular DNA. Furthermore, endothelium of organ-cultured human corneas was examined after incubation with perfluorodecalin by photodocumentation. · Results:Both cell types showed less extinctions in the Life-Dead assay after incubation with perfluorodecalin. After removing perfluorodecalin from the cultures, cells showed the same capacity of proliferation as the control cells. Compared to control corneas, perfluorodecalin induced a decrease in endothelial cell density. In four corneas, endothelial cell necrosis was observed. · Conclusion:Decreasing extinctions in the Life-Dead assay after incubation with perfluorodecalin can be interpreted as showing a decreasing amount of vital cells. Because cell proliferation showed no significant changes the results suggest that perfluorodecalin may not be directly toxic to cells in vitro. It may exert an indirect or mechanical effect on cell function by impeding the normal metabolic exchange between endothelium and medium. Based on these results perfluorodecalin should be completely removed after operation.
