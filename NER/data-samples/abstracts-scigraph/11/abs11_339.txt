Summary. Taurine as well as tauret (retinyliden taurine) levels were measured in locust Locusta migratoria compound eyes. HPLC measurements revealed relatively low taurine levels (1.9 ± 0.16 mM) in dark-adapted eyes. Glutamate, aspartate and glycine levels were 2.0 ± 0.2, 2.7 ± 0.4 and 3.0 ± 0.37 mM, respectively, while GABA was present only in trace amounts. After about 4 h of light adaptation at 1500–2000 lx, amino acid levels in the compound eye were as follows: taurine, 1.8 ± 0.17 mM; glutamate, no change at 2.1 ± 0.2 mM; aspartate sharply increased to 4.7 ± 0.7 mM; glycine slightly decreased to 2.8 ± 0.3 mM; and GABA trace levels. In the compound eye of locust Locusta migratoria, the existence of endogenous tauret in micro-molar range was established. In the dark, levels were several times higher compared with compound eye after light adaptation 1500 lx for 3 h, as estimated by TLC in combination with spectral measurements. Existence of tauret in compound eye is of special interest because in the compound eye, rhodopsin regeneration is based on photoregeneration.
