Abstract PurposeTo describe an unusual fundus abnormality in eyes after trauma and its pathophysiologic basis. MethodsProspective, observational case series of five consecutive male patients who suffered retinal vascular occlusions after ocular contusion. ResultsWe present five cases of retinal vascular occlusions following ocular contusion, found on routine fluorescein angiography in otherwise healthy individuals. ConclusionsDifferent patterns of retinal vascular occlusions can occur in ocular trauma. The pathogenesis of these occlusions may be related to direct damage to the endothelium.
