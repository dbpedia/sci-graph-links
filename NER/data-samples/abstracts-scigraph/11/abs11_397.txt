Abstract The properties of two-voltage driving liquid crystal lens are discussed. One voltage is maintained unchanged and the other one tunes the lens properties. The lens power changes in a wide range. It decreases monotonically with increasing controlling voltage. The focusing function for a camera with the liquid crystal lens is demonstrated.
