Abstract BackgroundThe purpose of this study is to report the clinical features and visual outcome of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) associated with posterior uveitis. This is a retrospective study including the 18 eyes of 18 patients. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and visual field testing were performed in all cases. ResultsDiseases associated with BRAO included active ocular toxoplasmosis in 7 patients, rickettsiosis in 4, Behçet’s uveitis in 2, West Nile virus infection in 1, idiopathic retinal vasculitis in 1, Crohn’s disease in 1, ocular tuberculosis in 1, and idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis syndrome in 1 patient. The mean initial visual acuity was 20/50. BRAO involved the first order retinal artery in 33.3% of the eyes, the second order retinal artery in 33.3%, an arteriole in 27.8%, and a cilioretinal artery in 5.5%. The macula was involved in 44.4% of the eyes and an acute focus of retinitis or retinochoroiditis was associated to BRAO in 55.5%. Repermeabilization of the occluded artery occurred in all patients with permanent scotomas in the corresponding visual field. The mean visual acuity at last visit was 20/32. ConclusionsBRAO, with subsequent visual impairment, may occur in the eyes with posterior uveitis. Physicians should be aware of such vision-threatening complication of infectious and inflammatory eye diseases.
