Abstract BackgroundDrusen are important risk factor for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and have a dynamic nature as they can enlarge, newly form, or disappear over time. There have been few reports on drusen regression or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) development after macular hole surgery. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of both drusen regression and subsequent CNV development within 7Â months of successful macular hole surgery. Case presentationA 73-year-old woman presented with a stage 3 full-thickness macular hole and large, confluent soft macular drusen in the right eye and a neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the fellow eye. Four months after the successful macular hole surgery, significant regression of drusen was seen, especially in the temporal area to the fovea. Three months later, the patient developed CNV and her best-corrected visual acuity decreased to 20/100, despite further regression of macular drusen. ConclusionsMacular hole patients with macular soft drusen need to be carefully followed up after surgery for possible drusen regression and CNV development.
