Abstract Buphenine (nylidrin), a β-adrenergic agonist, is used therapeutically for its vasodilating effect on the peripheral circulation and possibly on the cerebral circulation as well. In spite of its ophthalmic usage in degenerative retinal disease and glaucoma, buphenine's ocular effects and their mechanisms are not sufficiently established. Consquently, we studied the action of 4.5–120 μM buphenine in isolated, arterially perfused cat eyes, and then used light-evoked electrical signals, perfusion flow rates and the diameters of the retinal vessels as parameters for the drug's effect. Our findings showed that buphenine induced a marked, dose-related, reversible increase in the amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, a decrease in the c-wave, but no significant changes in the standing potential and light peak of the DC-ERG. The compound action potential of the optic nerve revealed dose-dependent and reversible changes in configuration. However, the flow of perfusate was not affected by the drug, and the diameter of retinal vessels did not change significantly. Our studies suggest that the interaction of buphenine with retinal adrenergic receptors is not related to the vasculature present but to elements involved in information processing. It is likely that these receptors are linked to neurons, since the β-agonist affected the ERG b-waves as well as the compound action potential of the optic nerve.
