Summary The argentea of thePoecilia reticulata eye is divided into a black-iridescent dorsal and a silvery-iridescent ventral region. An opaque black patch lies on the dorso-ventral meridian passing through the optic nerve. The structure and ultrastructure of the various layers of the argentea and sciera are described. Three types of crystals occurring in the iridophores of the argentea have been found. The possible functional significance of the regional structural differences of argentea and sciera are discussed.
