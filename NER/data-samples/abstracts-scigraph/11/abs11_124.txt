Abstract Glaucoma, a chronic progressive neuropathy and the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, is commonly treated by medication or surgery aimed at lowering intraocular pressure. In view of the limited therapeutic options, the European Glaucoma Society (EGS) sponsored two Think Tank Meetings with the goal of assessing the current status and the overall perspectives for neuroprotective treatment strategies in glaucoma. The results of the meetings are summarized in this EGS White Paper.
