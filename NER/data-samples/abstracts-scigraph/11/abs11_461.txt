Abstract BackgroundThe aim of this study is to report two interesting cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis following topical prostaglandin analogue administration for glaucoma. Two retrospective case studies are presented. FindingsA 40-year-old immunocompetent lady with a history of Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis with secondary glaucoma in the right eye since 2005 was diagnosed to have CMV anterior uveitis by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 2009. She developed a reactivation of anterior uveitis following the addition of latanoprost 0.005% eye drops unknowingly by her local ophthalmologist. The pattern of endothelial deposits seen with this reactivation of uveitis was different from that seen in earlier or in subsequent reactivations. A 46-year-old immunocompetent lady with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma and no history of uveitis presented with anterior uveitis with medium-sized keratic precipitates following administration of travatoprost 0.004% eye drops. In both cases, the CMV antigen was demonstrated in the aqueous by multiplex PCR at the time of reactivation. Both cases required treatment with dexamethasone eye drops, ganciclovir 1% gel and oral valganciclovir for the control of inflammation along with antiglaucoma medications. ConclusionsWe report two immunocompetent cases with the development of CMV-related anterior uveitis following administration with prostaglandin analogues. These cases increase the awareness of CMV anterior uveitis in immunocompetent individuals and the need to use prostaglandin analogues with caution.
