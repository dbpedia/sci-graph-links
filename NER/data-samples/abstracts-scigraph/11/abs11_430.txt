Abstract PurposeTo report the results of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) of extrafoveal predominantly classic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). MethodsIn this retrospective study 20 consecutive patients (20 eyes) undergoing verteporfin PDT for extrafoveal predominantly classic CNV in AMD were examined. Colour photography of the fundus, fluorescein angiography and complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity assessment with ETDRS charts, were performed before treatment and at 3-month intervals thereafter. The primary outcome criterion was the change in visual acuity. The secondary outcome criterion was the extension of the CNV beneath the centre of the fovea during the follow-up period. ResultsMean follow-up time of the patients was 24.2 months (range 12 to 58 months). Visual acuity at baseline varied from 20/200 to 20/20 (mean 20/50±2.3 lines). Final visual acuity ranged from 20/1000 to 20/20 (mean 20/200±5.1 lines) (P<0.001). In 85% (17/20) of the eyes visual acuity worsened. Visual acuity improved in 15% (3/20) of the eyes. During the course of the follow-up period, subfoveal extension of the CNV was detected in 80% (16/20) of the eyes. ConclusionIn 85% of the eyes with extrafoveal predominantly classic CNV secondary to AMD, visual acuity worsened after verteporfin PDT in an average follow-up time of 24 months. Subfoveal CNV was found in 80% of the eyes during follow-up. Even though verteporfin PDT can preserve visual acuity in selected cases, deterioration was seen in the majority of the patients.
