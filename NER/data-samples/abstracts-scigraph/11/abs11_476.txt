Abstract BackgroundThe aim of this study is to exclusively report the microbiological spectrum of lacrimal abscess and the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the organisms. Retrospective interventional study on 112 eyes of 112 patients who presented to the ophthalmic plastic clinic of a tertiary eye care center over a period of 23 years from January 1990 to February 2013 with lacrimal abscess were reviewed for demographic and microbiological profile. The culture results, organisms isolated, and their antibiotic sensitivity were studied. ResultsThe mean age at presentation was 37 years. The female to male ratio was 2:1. There was no significant difference in the laterality between the right and left eyes. Gram-positive organisms were the most commonly isolated accounting for 56.3% (63/112), and the commonest species isolated was Staphylococcus aureus in 25% (28/112) of the patients. Hemophilus influenzae was the commonest gram-negative isolate accounting for 30.2% of all the gram-negative isolates. Of the patients, 10.7% (12/112) showed no organisms on smear as well as sterile cultures. Gram-positive organisms were commonly sensitive to penicillins and vancomycin whereas gram-negative organisms were sensitive to quinolones and aminoglycosides. ConclusionsGram-positive organisms are quite common as compared to gram-negative ones in cases of lacrimal abscess. The results of this study have significant bearing on the treatment of patients with lacrimal abscess.
