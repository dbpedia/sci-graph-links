Summary ObjectiveTo determine the effect and side effects of intravitreal rTPA in eyes with submacular hemorrhage. Method28 eyes with a history of sudden visual loss between 1 day and 4 weeks were included in the study. They received 50μ rTPA and 0.3–0.5cc SF6 intravitreally. Preand postoperatively functional, biomicroscopical, and echographical results were compared. The follow up period was 12 months. ResultsMean visual acuity was 20/376 preoperatively (range LP to 20/25), 12/28 patients (43%) had quantitative function. One week after surgery mean visual acuity improved to 20/325 (LP to 20/25) and only 4/28 patients (14%) showed quantitative function. At the final examination mean visual acuity decreased to 20/428 and the number of eyes with quantitative vision increased to 9/28 (32%). 12 eyes (43%) showed a final functional benefit after the treatment.5 eyes (17.8%) developed a severe recurrent hemorrhage. In 3 of those a correlation to partial or total vitreous separation cannot be excluded. One eye showed an inferior retinal detachment 6 weeks postoperatively potentially induced by a complete vitreous separation. ConclusionThe removal of submacular hemorrhage by intravitreal rTPA is a minimal invasive surgery. The postoperative success rate of 50% visual improvement is statistically significant to preoperative values but the final results are worse than the results immediately after surgery. The effect seems to be temporary especially in cases where the underlying AMD in not treatable.
