Summary The retinofugal projections in the eel were studied by use of the cobalt-filling technique. The optic tract projects contralaterally to the hypothalamic optic nucleus, the anterior periventricular nucleus, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the dorsomedial optic nucleus, four pretectal recipient areas, the optic tectum, and the tegmentum. Small ipsilateral projections were demonstrated in the hypothalamic optic nucleus, the dorsomedial optic nucleus, and the optic tectum.
