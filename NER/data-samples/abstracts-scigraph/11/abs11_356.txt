Summary The kinetics of migration of radiolabeled 8-methoxypsoralen into human cataract lenses were investigated in 12 patients undergoing operation. Lenses were examined from 2.5â€“72 h after intake of 3H-labeled 8-methoxypsoralen by mouth. Demonstrable amounts of activity was only found in two of three lenses studied 24 h after intake. The aqueous humor contained less 8-methoxypsoralen than serum. The results of the study may add support to the opinion that a less rigorous sunglass regimen than that recommended by certain PUVA centers may be justified.
