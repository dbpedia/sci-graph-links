Abstract  Background: The use of a viscoelastic substance facilitates cataract surgery. Healon 5 is a new viscoelastic product with special rheological properties. We evaluated the postoperative effect of Viscoat and Healon5 on intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell counts and laser flare. Methods: Forty-eight eyes of 48 patients undergoing routine phacoemulsification followed by foldable IOL implantation were enrolled. Either Healon5 or Viscoat was used according to a block- randomization scheme. The aspiration technique was standardized. IOP, CCT, endothelial cell counts and laser flare were compared pre- and postoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-sample Wilcoxon test. Data description was based on median and quartiles, while graphic description was performed by non-parametric box plots. Results: Viscoat demonstrated a statistically significant higher IOP than Healon5 at 4 and 8 h postoperatively (P<0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Further, the laser flare values were statistically significantly higher for the Viscoat than for the Healon5 group 8 h postoperatively (P<0.05). Endothelial cell loss did not differ significantly between the two groups (relative change in endothelial cell density after 3 months: –4.3% for the Healon5 group and –6.2% for Viscoat group). Conclusion: There was neither a statistically nor a clinically significant difference in endothelial cell loss after the use of Healon5 or Viscoat in routine cataract surgery. However, the IOP in the early postoperative period was higher in the Viscoat group than in the Healon5 group.
