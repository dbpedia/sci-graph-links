Summary Using the ABC immunohistochemical method, we investigated the distribution of calbindinlike immunoreactive structures in the optic tectum of normal fish, Tinca tinca, and from normal and unilaterally eye-enucleated fish, Cyprinus carpio. In nonoperated individuals of both species the optic tectum contained numerous immunoreactive neurons with strongly positive somata located in the stratum periventriculare and a thick immunolabeled dendritic shaft ascending radially toward the stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale. The retinorecipient layers contained many fibrous immunoreactive structures. Some varicose fibers, isolated or in small bundles, were localized to the stratum album centrale, especially in the dorsal tectal half. Unilateral eye removal produced the disappearance of the immunoreactive fibrous structures located in the retinorecipient layers of the tectum contralateral to the enucleation. The present work shows that calbindinlike immunoreactive substances are localized in specific neural circuits of the fish optic tectum and suggests that the calbindin-like immunoreactive fibers in the retinorecipient strata are of retinal origin.
