Summary The eye of the frilled sea hare,Bursatella leachi plei, expresses a circadian rhythm in the frequency of spontaneously occurring optic nerve impulses. The rhythm will free-run for at least 3 cycles in vitro (Fig. 2) and can be entrained by light cycles provided in vivo (Fig. 4 A). While bothBursatella andAplysia eyes contain circadian pacemakers the two rhythms differ in several respects: (1) the peak impulse frequency forBursatella eyes is only 96/h (±36 SD) compared with 247/h (±61 SD) forAplysia. (2) The ocular waveform of theBursatella rhythm exhibits a steep rise and fall from peak frequencies and lacks the delayed falling phase which creates a ‘shoulder’ on the ocular waveform inAplysia (Fig. 2). (3) The in vitro free-running period of theBursatella ocular rhythm is 21.2 h (±0.6 SD) compared with 24.3 h (±0.9 SD) for theAplysia rhythm (Fig. 2). (4) The steady state phase angle for entrainment differs withBursatella eyes showing a median activity peak at +3 Z.T. compared with a medianAplysia peak at −1 Z.T. (Fig. 4). We also investigated the locomotor rhythm.Bursatella were found to be predominantly diurnal when exposed to L∶D, 12∶12 (Fig. 5A) and to exhibit anticipatory locomotor activity when maintained on L∶D), 9∶15 (Fig. 6). The eyes appear to play a minor role, if any, in timing the locomotor rhythm. EyelessBursatella remained diurnal on L∶D, 9∶15 and most animals continued to exhibit anticipatory behavior (Fig. 6). These results suggest that theBursatella eye plays a less prominent role than theAplysia eye in controlling locomotor behavior.
