Summary PurposeTo determine long-term changes in macular thickness after cataract surgery. MethodsResearch work included 27 patients (27 eyes) who underwent uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation on one eye. Optical coherence tomography was used to obtain data of macular thickness before surgery and for patients who attended scheduled control measurement 1 month (22 patients), 3 months (23 patients), and 6 months (20 patients) after the surgery. ResultsThe greatest increase in average macular thickness was seen 1 month after cataract surgery, statistically significant in all areas except in fovea and superior quarter of macula. Statistically significant decrease in macular thickness was noticed 3 and 6 months after the surgery. Comparison of macular thickness 6 months after cataract surgery and values before surgery showed no statistically significant difference. ConclusionFindings confirmed the reversibility of macular thickness changes 6 months after cataract surgery and its return to preoperative values.
