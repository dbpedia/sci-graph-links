Summary The blood flow in the ciliary body vessels and ocular hydrodynamics were studied, using rheoophthalmography and tonography methods in the experiments with rabbits (17 animals, 172 experiments) and in primary open angle glaucoma (12 patients, 18 eyes) before and after the sympathicomimetic drugs instillation (phethanol, epinephrine). It was found that the hypotensive effect of the mentioned drugs was brought about by the reduction of blood flow in the ciliary body vessels, causing in its turn the reduction of aqueous humor secretion.
