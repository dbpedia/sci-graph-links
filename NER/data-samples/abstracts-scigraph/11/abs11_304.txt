Abstract Retinal arteriovenous malformations (racemose angiomas) are usually described as non-changing congenital vascular anomalies. The authors describe prominent retinal vascular changes that occurred in the fundus of a patient with a complex retinal arteriovenous malformation as part of the Wyburn-Mason syndrome during a follow-up period of 17 years.
