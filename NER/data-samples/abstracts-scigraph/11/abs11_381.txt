Abstract The psychiatric and cognitive condition of a patient with lupus psychosis was evaluated. Using a device that detects the corneal reflection of infrared light, the patterns of eye tracking movements were recorded before the onset of lupus psychosis, after remission, and again 1 year later. Electroencephalographic findings and cerebrospinal fluid levels of both interferon α and interleukin-6 were also obtained longitudinally. Electroencephalographic findings and clinical signs were correlated to the levels of interferon α in cerebrospinal fluid. Analysis of exploratory eye movements revealed marked decreases in the number of eye fixations, mean eye-scanning length and total eye-scanning length. Even though the lupus psychosis resolved and the electroencephalographic findings became normal, the eye movement patterns showed remaining deterioration. It was concluded that analysis of exploratory eye movements in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus may be useful in diagnosing lupus psychosis, and may also present a diagnostic clue to subclinical lupus psychosis.
