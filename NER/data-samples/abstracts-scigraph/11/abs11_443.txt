Abstract Optic nerve (ON) damage especially from papilloedema can be prevented with timely detection. The detailed ocular and radiographic status of 33 unoperated craniosynostosis (CS) was documented prospectively; the ON was also assessed by flash VER and A-scan echography for ON thickness. Fluorescein angiography (FA) was done for all suspected and early papilloedemas. ON involvement diagnosed in 10/33 showed highly significant correlations with multiple suture synostoses (p = 0.004) and exorbitism (p < 0.001). VER latency was increased in all 5 ON atrophies; and also in 1/5 papilloedemas without atrophic changes, urgent surgery in which reversed VER changes, and vision later improved from 6/60 to 6/9. FA was valuable for confirming the clinical diagnosis of the earliest papilloedemas; the FA also returned to normal with immediate therapy along with reversal of the clinical picture. ON echography especially helped in monitoring regression of disc oedema. Ours seems the first report especially in CS where a critical follow-up of all above parameters in 21 operated / 33 could objectively establish the role of each investigation in conjunction with careful clinical monitoring especially of the ON head. Such comprehensive evaluation should help reduce the blindness often seen in such children.
