Abstract Despite advances in ophthalmological care of premature infants, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remains a still unsolved problem for paediatricians as well as ophthalmologists. A survey of the current literature concerning drug therapy and surgical management as related to the different stages of ROP is given. The classification system for ROP according to the International Committee is presented as well as our screening policy in relation to the literature. The effectiveness in preventing severe cases of ROP and the toxicity of vitamin E supplementation in high-risk premature infants is still disputed and no recommendations can be given. Cryotherapy is recommended in symmetric cases of stage 3+ ROP. Nevertheless, quite a number of eyes still progress to more severe stages of ROP. Scleral buckling procedures and vitrectomy may lead to anatomical success in a few cases of retinal detachment, however, the visual outcome of such an operation is usually very poor despite reattachment of the cental retina.
