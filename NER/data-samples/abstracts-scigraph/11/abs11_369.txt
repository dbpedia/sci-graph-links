Abstract The distribution of central axons of receptor cells of the eyes and the locations of neurons sending axons into the optic nerves were studied in the cerebral ganglia of the pulmonate mollusksLymnaea stagnalis andHelix sp. by the method of axonal transport of cobalt chloride injected via the optic nerves. Afferent fibers of these nerves form terminal ramifications (chiefly dorsally) in the middle part of the cerebral ganglion. Some of them pass through the commissure to the symmetrical region of the opposite cerebral ganglion. Neurons innervating the eyes are located in several regions of both cerebral ganglia. InLymnaea they are distributed near the point of entry of the optic nerve, in the region of the commissure, the mesocerebrum, and the posterior part of the ganglion. InHelix these neurons are found in the same regions except in the posterior part of the ganglion. In electrophysiological experiments responses of neurons in these parts of the cerebral ganglion to adequate stimulation of the eye were recorded. Differences in the character of responses and also the presence of neurons indifferent to stimulation of the eye are evidence of the functional heterogeneity of these areas. This suggests that morphologically separate visual centers do not exist in the cerebral ganglion of the Pulmonata. Neurons giving specific responses to stimulation of the eye and evidently belonging to different levels of the visual system (afferent or efferent divisions) are closely connected both with each other and with cells of other functional systems.
