Summary The tips of the eyestalks of three species of strombid gastropods were amputated and the structure of the fully developed eye investigated. The retina contains at least two types of cell: sensory cells bearing long tufts of microvilli with a central cytoplasmic core, and pigment cells with short microvilli. New eyes became visible at the tips of the eyestalk stump 5â€“16 days after amputation. When the regenerated eyes first appear, they consist of hollow balls of cells with a pigment lined cavity; two types of retinal cells are already distinguishable but their microvilli and cilia are small and sparse. The microvillous tufts and sensory cell contents develop quickly and about 14 days after their first appearance, the eye is a fully formed but miniature organ.
