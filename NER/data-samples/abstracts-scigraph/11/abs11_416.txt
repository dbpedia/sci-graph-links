Abstract The locations of NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and TUNEL-immunoreactive neurons in the retina of human fetuses collected during the first to third trimesters of pregnancy were studied. High levels of NADPH-d activity were seen in the inner segments of light-sensitive cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells. The population of NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells included three types of neuron. Type 1 neurons were large and had sparse dendritic fields occupying the inner nuclear and outer retinal layers. Small type 2 neurons were located in the inner retinal layer. Ectopic amacrine cells, type 3, were located in the outer part of the ganglion layer. A high density of NADPH-d-positive neurons was seen in the central part of the retina, surrounding the central fovea and optic disk area. NADPH-d activity increased progressively during ontogenesis and correlated with the appearance of immunoreactive iNOS in neurons. iNOS labeled a subpopulation of amacrine and ganglion cells, which appeared at 20–21 weeks of development and reached a peak of immunoreactivity by the end of the third trimester. TUNEL-immunopositive neuron nuclei with signs of apoptotic destruction were seen at 30–31 weeks of pregnancy. The greatest apoptotic index was seen in the ganglion and amacrine cell populations. These data identify NO as a factor mediating apoptosis of neurons during the critical period of differentiation of interneuronal connections in the human retina.
