Abstract â€‚A square packed array of square-channels with long channel axis aligned radially is a useful structure for condensing grazing incidence flux to a focus. These devices, known as Lobster-eye optics for their similarity to the eyes of the macruran crustaceans, show great promise as the focusing optic in the next generation of X-ray all-sky monitors. At X-ray wavelengths the optimal Lobster-eye structure requires an aspect ratio of channel length to width of greater than 30:1. Following recent success in fabricating a low aspect ratio Lobster-eye structure, we discuss some of the parameters for, and production issues involved in making, a useful Lobster-eye prototype using LIGA. We report on our initial attempts to produce high aspect ratio Lobster-eye optics using the LIGA process with a graphite substrate.
