Summary The terminals of retinal afferents in the tectum of the axolotl have been identified ultrastructurally using techniques of horseradish peroxidase-filling and degeneration. The mitochondria in filled structures show a characteristic electron-lucent matrix. After both eyes have been removed, terminals with light mitochondria disappear from the area known to receive an optic input. In this area the presence of light mitochondria is almost always diagnostic of the retinal origin of a bouton. The synapses are similar to those assumed to be of retinal origin in other vertebrates. Detailed morphometric analysis has been carried out on identified optic synapses in the optic tectum of the axolotl.
