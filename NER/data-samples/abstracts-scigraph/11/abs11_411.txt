Abstract Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new diagnostic technology which allows visualization of a cross-sectional image of the anterior eye and the retina in vivo with a high resolution similar to a histological section by light microscopy. Although the fundus can be examined at the semihistologic level by a biomicroscope, histopathologic study has been difficult because of the rare opportunity for retinal biopsy or enucleation. OCT reveals the intraretinal structure of macular diseases on the histopathologic level. In this article, we review the research on various macular diseases using OCT at Gunma University School of Medicine.
