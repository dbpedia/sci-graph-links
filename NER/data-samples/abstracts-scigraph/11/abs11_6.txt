Abstract PurposeTo classify polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) presenting with both extramacular and macular lesions according to location and clinical manifestations. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of 29 eyes presenting with both extramacular and macular PCV lesions by indocyanine green angiography. The patients were classified according to the location of the extramacular lesions and clinical manifestations. ResultsPCV locations were identified as peripapillary (32.1%), superior (10.7%) or inferior (17.9%) to the optic disc, superior (14.3%) or inferior (7.1%) temporal arcade, temporal to the macula (10.7%), and nasal to the optic disc (7.1%). Clinical manifestations were identified as polyp (10.7%), branching vascular networks (42.9%), pigment epithelial detachment (PED) (17.9%), polyp and branching vascular networks (7.1%), polyp and PED (14.3%), and all three (7.1%). ConclusionsPCV showed extramacular lesions with various clinical manifestations discontinuous from the macular lesions.
