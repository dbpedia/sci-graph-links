Summary The morphology of the compound eye of the noctuid moth Spodoptera exempta was investigated by electron microscopy. This eucone superposition eye is composed of about 8000 ommatidia. Each ommatidium is surrounded by six secondary pigment cells showing pigment movement according to the state of adaptation. It contains four crystalline cone cells forming together a crystalline cone and tract, two primary pigment cells, which encompass the crystalline cone, and usually eight retinula cells. On the basis of their rhabdomeric structure, three types of retinula cells can be distinguished. According to the structure of the rhabdom, two types of ommatidia are found in different regions of the eye. The rhabdom of the lobed type, providing more than 80% of ommatidia, is composed of V-shaped rhabdomeres with fanwise arranged microvilli. The rhabdom of the square type, found in a small area in the dorsal region of the eye, consists of triangular rhabdomeres with parallel microvilli. The functional significance of this difference is discussed.
