Abstract â€‚The eyes of different larval stages of Carinaria lamarcki were examined ultrastructurally. In all larval stages the eyes consist of a cornea, a lens and an everse retina. The photoreceptors in young larvae are exclusively of the ciliary type. In old larvae, however, two types of photoreceptors are present and the retina is composed of two segments: a posterior segment with altered ciliary photoreceptors (=type I sensory cells) and an anterior segment with what are presumably rhabdomeric photoreceptors (=type II sensory cells). The anterior retina is interpreted here as an accelerted character. Furthermore, the arrangement of the pigment granules changes during the long larval development being cup shaped in young larvae versus ribbon shaped in old larvae. The findings allow for the conclusions that: (a) the ciliary photoreceptors are correlated with the long larval period of Heteropoda and that (b) the eyes are altered continuously during the larval cycle.
