Summary PurposeTo present the surgical and functional results of a consecutive series of 33 patients — aged between 2 and 16 years — with complex retinal detachments and PVR treated with vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade. Patients and methods33 children (29 boys and 4 girls) with a mean age of 12 years (2–16 years) underwent complex retinal detachment surgery including p. p. vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade in 35 eyes because of severe trauma in 16 eyes (48.4%), giant retinal tears in 7 (21%), high myopia in 7 (21%), uveitis in 3 (9.9%) eyes, proliferative diabetic retinopathy in one and retrolental fibroplasia in one patient. A mean of 2.6 retinal surgical procedures were performed in each patient. The minimum follow-up was 6 months. ResultsTotal retinal reattachment was achieved in 21 eyes (60%). 6 eyes (17%) showed some residual retinal detachment, either anterior from the buckle or demarcated with laser scars, but with attached central retinas. 8 eyes (23%) were detached due to massive re-proliferation.In the group with secondary repair of severe trauma, 13 out of 16 eyes (81%) were able to be cured, 3(19%) remained uncured. ConclusionsAlthough the investment of time and effort in each single case is much higher in an infant than in an adult, one can obtain useful results in these eyes. Without a doubt, this complex surgery is always indicated in children with bilateral disease. In severe trauma of one eye, where the usefulness of surgery is sometimes questioned, more than 80% can be cured and gain vision. With better anatomic results, efforts to gain better visual rehabilitation and binocularity must be maximised.
