Abstract The aim of this study was to estimate and compare the levels of glycated protein in the lens extracted from patients with cataract of various etiologies. A total of 72 cataract lens were collected. The levels of total proteins, glucose and glycated protein in the lens were studied. Plasma protein and fasting glucose levels were also estimated. The amount of glycation of lens was significantly higher in case of hypermature senile cataract (p<0.01) when compared with other types of cataracts. The levels of lens glucose between the various types of cataracts did not differ significantly. These results indicate that the level of lens glucose alone is not the only determining factor of lens protein glycation.
