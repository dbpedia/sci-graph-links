Summary The levels of melatonin and the activities of two enzymes of the melatonin biosynthetic pathway, serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), were measured throughout the light-dark cycle in the retina of a teleost fish, the pike. HIOMT activity did not display significant variations, whereas NAT activity and melatonin content showed a daily rhythm, high levels occurring during the night. The profiles of the latter two rhythms did not closely match one another and differed from those previously described in the pineal organ of the same species. These results are discussed with respect to a possible paracrine role of retinal melatonin. Melatonin-like immunoreactivity was found in the photoreceptor cell layer and in the MÃ¼ller cells of the inner nuclear layer. The intensity of the melatonin-like immunoreactivity varied throughout the 24 h light-dark cycle, in good correlation with the variations in the melatonin level as measured by radioimmunoassay.
