Summary Electrical responses (ERG) were recorded from the retinal surface of the eye ofNautilus pompilius. Brief light flashes and step changes in intensity were used to explore linear and nonlinear response properties. The linear responses could be fitted well with cascaded exponential decay processes and a time delay. Nonlinear phenomena included a saturating amplitude of response with increased light intensity, and shape changes induced by adaptation and by background illumination.
