Summary The generalogical relationships of photoreceptor cells within the compound eye ofDrosophila have been studied using cell labelling, with either3H-thymidine or recessive mutations, during the third larval stage. It has been found that photoreceptor and secondary pigment cells arise from different precursor cells. Under the present experimental conditions, precursors of receptor cells give rise to about 8 elements which differentiate as R cells of two different groups. One of the cells differentiates as R7 and the remaining as any one of the R1 to R6. The last cells behave initially as equivalent, and can differentiate within the same or within different, but neighbouring, ommatidia. The class of R1 to R6 cell in which each one of these elements differentiates, seems to depend on the time of its origin. The implications of these findings for the formation of the ommatidial pattern are discussed.
