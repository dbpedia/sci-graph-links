Abstract â€‚Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (Picea mariana), red spruce (Picea rubens), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), mugo pine (Pinus mugo), red pine (Pinus resinosa), Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), were inoculated to test the effective host range of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria proxima and the possibility of utilizing pulp waste as a potting medium for containerized seedling production. Laccaria proxima tended to improve the container growth of Japanese black pine and white spruce, and significantly improved that of jack pine, mugo pine, black spruce, red spruce and Douglasfir. The growth of red pine and Japanese larch were only slightly improved with L. proxima. Pulp waste (33% by volume) had negative effects on tree seedling growth, except for Douglasfir (no significant effect). The interactions of Laccaria proxima and pulp waste varied; the hosts were significantly positive (P<0.01) in the case of jack pine and black spruce, but there was no significant effect for the rest. Negative effects were found with Japanese black pine. Use of pulp waste in seedling production of jack pine, black spruce, mugo pine, red spruce and Douglasfir inoculated with L. proxima and of Japanese black pine both with and without L. proxima is feasible, but further research is necessary to determine the optimal percentage of pulp waste that can be utilized in seedling production of tree species and the field performance of these seedlings.
