Abstract Sources of variation in yields (as a fraction of leaf weight) of 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene in the leaf oils of young Petford Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees were studied. The oil yields of leaves up to 5 months of age were significantly affected by physiological changes associated with leaf maturation. The extent of these changes depends on genotype and on external influences such as soil moisture conditions. Prolonged drought stress reduced oil production in young leaves but did not affect greatly the equilibrium reached between synthesis and removal of oils at leaf maturity. Waterlogging prolonged peak oil production. Trends in oil yields with time differed markedly between individual trees. Although genotypic variation was great, there was detectable variation attributable to site, season and year. A relationship between seasonal patterns and climatic factors could not be established. Part of the observed variation in oil yields with time was attributable to variability in leaf maturity. The relative superiority in oil-yielding capacity of certain individuals in each experiment was maintained throughout, despite substantial variation from non-genetic sources. This consistency in ranking is of advantage to tree breeders wishing to make selections amongst plantations of differing age, on different sites and at different times of the year. However, even with careful sampling controls, absolute values will vary substantially and progeny testing will be necessary to further assess the potential of the initial selections.
