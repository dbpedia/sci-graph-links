Abstract The abilities of nine genotypes of Amanita muscaria (L.:Fr) Pers. to utilise a range of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources for growth was examined in axenic liquid cultures. Considerable intraspecific variation was observed in biomass yields on all substrates; however biomass yield was highest on glutamine and/or NH4 + for all genotypes. Yields on aspartic acid, glutamic acid and histidine were generally low relative to NH4 +, while utilisation of arginine and glycine showed marked variation between genotypes. Eight genotypes produced significantly less biomass on bovine serum albumin than on NH4 +, raising questions regarding classification of A. muscaria as a 'protein fungus'.
