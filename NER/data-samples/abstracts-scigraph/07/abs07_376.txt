Abstract Loss of apical dominance is a well-known boron (B) deficiency symptom in trees. Recent field studies indicate that B deficiency may cause irreversible damage in emerging leader buds leading to bushy growth, and changes in developing needles in mature Norway spruce trees. We experimentally studied if timing of B application affects needles and buds of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings with low initial B levels. The treatments were: no B (B0); B supply from the beginning of the simulated summer (B1); starting soon after bud burst (B2) and starting at the occurrence of first needle primordia in new spruce buds (B3). At the end of the experiment, B concentration in B1 was 23 mg kg−1 (pine) or 17 mg kg−1 (spruce) and lower in the later applications. In B0 it was at deficiency limit. In B0, B2 and B3, there were fewer sclerenchyma cells, and cavities occurred in vascular cylinders in pine needles, and in spruce buds there were more tanniferous cells in the primordial shoots compared to B1. Furthermore, in all but B1 there was cell collapse in the bud apex of some spruce seedlings. The experimentally induced changes were the same as earlier reported in B deficient conifers in the field, and indicate, similarly as in the field that adequate B is necessary throughout the growing season for healthy growth, particularly for spruce. The differences between spruce and pines are due, at least partly, to the differences in time frame of needle development and in the differences in development of conducting tissues in the buds.
