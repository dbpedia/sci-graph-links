Abstract The synergistic effect of a number of natural and anthropogenic stress factors is probably responsible for forest decline in Central Europe. The macroscopic indicators of Norway spruce crown status, as well as branch structure transformation, were proposed to reconstruct the retrospective stress response of a tree to stress conditions over a 30-year period. Based on crown defoliation and the proportion of secondary shoots, five categories of tree response to stress factors were introduced: resistant trees (crown defoliation ≤35%, secondary shoots ≤65%); resilient trees (crown defoliation ≤35%, secondary shoots >65%); susceptible moderately transformed trees (crown defoliation >35%, secondary shoots ≤65%); susceptible strongly transformed trees (crown defoliation >35%, 65% < secondary shoots ≤90%); and exhausted trees to the environment (crown defoliation >35%, secondary shoots >90%). These stress response categories are discussed assuming a sink/source relationship on carbohydrate allocation. The relationship between stress response categories and current regenerative processes in the crown, assessed by macroscopic markers on bud development and shoot growth, is outlined. The research has been carried out mainly in three permanent research plots of old autochthonous Norway spruce forest stands in the Krkonoše Mts. (Czech Republic) under different historical stress loads.
