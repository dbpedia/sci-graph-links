Abstract Nucleation is a natural process in which trees scattered in the landscape promote changes in the surrounding environment, which increases the probability of seedling and sapling colonization in a nucleus area. This study aimed to describe forest species community under the crown of Bowdichia virgilioides (Fabaceae) in cerrado sensu stricto, testing two hypotheses: (a) distance: more distant nuclei will have fewer numbers of colonizing species and individuals; (b) crown area: nuclei with larger crown will have more individuals and species. We selected six B. virgilioides nuclei at Estação Ecológica do Panga (EEP) in which we traced two transects (D1 and D2) and calculated crown area by ellipse formula. In the under-crown area, we identified all individuals (regardless of size) of tree forest species and also measured their height and diameter at stem base. We performed a Pearson correlation between crown area and the number of individuals and species, and between distance from nucleus to closest forest edge and density. In the six nuclei, we found 517 individuals of 24 species, distributed in 14 families, with a total density of 2.48 individuals per square meter. Correlation between crown area and the number of individuals was statistically significant (r = 0.80; n = 6; p = 0.05). There was no correlation statistically significant between crown area and number of species (r = 0.29; n = 6; p > 0.05). There was a negative correlation between density of individuals and the distance from nucleus to forest edge (r = −0.79; n = 6; p = 0.05). This study shows that some forest species were capable to colonize the area under the crown of B. vigilioides in cerrado, facilitated by this nucletor specie. This colonization process was influenced by the environmental changes promoted by B virgilioides, nuclei crown size, distance of nuclei from propagule source, and the capability of some forest species to survive in an environment different from forest.
