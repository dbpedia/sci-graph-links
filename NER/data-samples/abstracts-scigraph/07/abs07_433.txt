Abstract â€‚Despite the recognized importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in forest ecosystems, their is little information about their occurrence in natural forest ecosystems of Patagonia. This study investigated root associations in two Austrocedrus forests and the seasonal dynamics of AM of Austrocedrus chilensis. Most of the vascular flora in both forests had arbuscular mycorrhizae (80.5 and 70.5% of species, respectively). The dynamics of mycorrhiza formation and spore number did not differ between these forests but varied with the season. Root colonization was lowest in September at the end of the quarter with the most rain, and spore numbers were highest in September and in December at the beginning of the dry season.
