Summary Annual grass production in ungrazed plots was 2,731 kg ha-1, litter production was 1,619 kg ha-1 and decomposition was 1,789 kg ha-1. In grazed plots the corresponding figures were 3,157 kg ha-1, 1,440 kg ha-1, and 1,475 kg ha-1 respectively; cattle consumed 1,405 kg ha-1. Litter disappearance was greatest in the dry season: 1,226 kg ha-1 (69% of the annual total) disappearing in the 4 months of December to March in the ungrazed plots, largely due to consumption (790 kg ha-1 in December to March) by fungus-growing termites (Macrotermitinae). A positive linear relationship was found between maximum grass biomass and annual rainfall in West Africa.
