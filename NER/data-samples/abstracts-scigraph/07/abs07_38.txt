Abstract Wood and total litter fall were measured in five forests of the Kumaun Himalaya situated along an altitudinal gradient from 329 m to 1850 m. Total annual wood litter fall, which ranged from 93 to 197 g m2, was inversely related with altitude and positively related with forest basal cover. Total litter fall ranged from 405 to 839 g m2 yr1 and was positively related with forest basal cover. Wood litter fall was highest in the rainy season and that of total litter in the summer season. Abscissed litter accounted for a maximum proportion of seasonal wood fall in summer. Monthly non-abscissed wood fall was positively related to the monthly rainfall on each site. The fractions in lower diameter classes (0–5 to 5–10 mm) dominated the annual wood fall in all forests and accounted for 59 to 78% of the total. Fractions in >10 mm size class fall maximally during the rainy months.
