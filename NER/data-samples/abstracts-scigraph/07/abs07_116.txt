Abstract Soil fertility and associated nitrogen (N) status was a key ecosystem attribute, and surveys of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities via epigeous fruiting bodies could provide an effective biotic indicator of forest soil productivity. We explored the utility of aboveground EMF communities in this regard by surveying sporocarps over a 3-year period from contrasting plant associations of southern old-growth boreal forests of British Columbia (Canada). Cumulative richness ranged from 39 to 89 EMF species per plot (0.15Â ha) and followed a skewed parabolic correlation with foliar N concentrations and soil N availability. EMF species composition was consistently distinct in ordinations and strongly correlated to the increasing rates of N mineralization aligned with soil productivity. Approximately 40 EMF species were specialists, as they collectively indicated oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic nutrient regimes, while the remaining species were categorized as broadly tolerant (distributed over 100% of the N gradient), partially intolerant (approximately 70%), or satellites (rare). The functional organization of EMF communities reflected by distribution classes could help define the ecological integrity of forests, which was characterized in this boreal landscape by an average allotment of 20 broadly tolerant, 25 partially intolerant, 15 specialist, and ten satellite species per plot. Epigeous fruiting bodies provided a disparate yet complementary view to the belowground assessment of EMF communities that was valuable in identifying indicators for ecosystem monitoring.
