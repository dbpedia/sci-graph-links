Summary Data from forestry yield tables were used to investigate the population structure of natural stands of Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) in the mid-Atlantic states. The proportion of individuals in three size classes, 1–5 inch dbh, 5–8 inch dbh and > 8 inch dbh was shown to depend on both site age since clearcutting and site quality. Site age and site quality also determined the degree to which cedar populations underwent density dependent mortality (self-thinning). On all sites, the smallest individuals were removed by self-thinning. Analyses of this type allow predictions to be made of forest stand dynamics and further an understanding of population processes in natural communities.
