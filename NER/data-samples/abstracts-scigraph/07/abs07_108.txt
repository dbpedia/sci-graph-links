Summary Seasonal gas exchange and canopy structure were compared among 9-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.), and pitch x loblolly hybrids (Pinus rigida x taeda) growing in an F2 plantation located in Critz, Va., USA. Leaf net photosynthesis, conductance, internal CO2 concentration (ci), water use efficiency (WUE; photosynthesis/conductance), dark respiration and the ratio of net photosynthesis/respiration did not vary among or within the three taxa. Significant differences in volume production, crown length, total crown leaf surface area and the silhouette area of shade shoots among the taxa were observed. The loblolly-South Carolina source had greater volume and crown surface area than the pitch pine, and the hybrid taxa were intermediate between the two. Although the silhouette area ratio of shade foliage varied among taxa, it was not related to volume. A strong relationship between total leaf surface area and volume was observed. Leaf conductance, ci, WUE and leaf water potential were the physiological parameters significantly and positively correlated with volume. This study suggests that the amount of needle surface in the canopy is more important in early stand volume growth than the leaf carbon exchange rate and the degree of needle self-shading in the lower canopy.
