Abstract This research aimed to study the ectomycorrhiza formed by basidiospores attached to the outer surface of Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae) seed collected from a lowland tropical dipterocarp forest. Two groups of seeds were collected: control seeds collected from plastic net hanging 2 m above the ground and forest floor seeds collected on the forest floor. Before planting, 15 seeds from each group were observed for basidiospores attached to the seed. Ten of the 3-week-old S. leprosula seedlings of each group were individually grown in 1.5 kg of sterile zeolite for 8 months in a greenhouse. Pots were fertilized with MMN solution containing half the strength of phosphate. Fungal identity, ectomycorrhizal root tip colonization and anatomy, plant growth, and phosphate uptake were measured. The control seeds did not have basidiospores attached, whereas the forest floor seeds had 2 × 105 basidiospores of Tomentella. Bioassay test results indicate that the seedlings from the control seeds did not form ectomycorrhiza, whereas those seedlings from the forest floor seeds formed 3 morphotypes of ectomycorrhizae. Based on ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 rDNA region analyses, the 3 morphotypes belonged to Tomentella sp. HBT2, Tomentella sp. HBT4, and Scleroderma sp. HBS3. Root colonization percentage was above 70% for all three morphotypes. Root colonization in general increased plant growth and phosphate uptake. This is the first report of Tomentella basidiospores attached on the seed surface as a functional inoculum and of Tomentella ectomycorrhiza from dipterocarps lowland tropical forest.
