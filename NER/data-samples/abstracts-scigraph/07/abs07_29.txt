Abstract Opisthacanthus sp. from Panama resembles tropical forest scorpions from other zoogeographical regions in being comparatively inactive and showing some movement in light. Its circadian rhythm is not clear cut. It has a dirty appearance and a repugnatorial odour, a phenomenon not previously recorded in scorpions.
