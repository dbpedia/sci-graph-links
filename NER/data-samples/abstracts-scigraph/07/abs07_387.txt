Summary Pool sizes of ATP and ADP were analysed in freeze-stopped, lyophilised homogenates of needles from Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.]. Control experiments in which possible changes in adenylate pools during sample acquisition were investigated did not reveal significant differences between needles taken from branches in situ or within a 30-min period after cutting off a branch. In addition, pool sizes of ADP and ATP were not affected by changes in light intensity (between 60 and 1500 Î¼E*-m-2*s-1), which inevitably occur when samples have to be taken from the upper region of older trees. Levels of ATP and ADP showed considerable seasonal changes (May through October) with the highest ratios of ATP/ADP in developing needles. In general, there was a tendency towards increased ratios of ATP/ADP with increasing needle age. This observation was corroborated by analyses of needles from spruce trees of different age and growing under different conditions. Needles from declining trees or from trees specifically fumigated with low concentrations of ozone and sulphur dioxide had significantly increased ratios of ATP/ADP compared to controls. The results are discussed with respect to physiological responses connected with natural senescence and induced ageing.
