Abstract Amounts of nutrients in harvest residues and their contribution to nutrient cycling were quantified following logging of a Eucalyptus globulus plantation in south-western Australia. An estimated 64 t ha–1 of leaf, bark and branch material less than 3 cm in diameter was deposited on the forest floor during harvesting. Leaves contributed about one-third of the residue dry weight but accounted for almost three-quarters of residue-N stores (299 of 428 kg N ha–1) and 36% to 52% of P, K, Ca, and Mg stores. Stores of nutrients in slash were significant in comparison to amounts in surface soil (0–20 cm). Residue-N amounted to 11% of total surface soil N and cations stored in residues were equivalent to 23–114% of surface soil exchangeable cations. Decomposition of the leaf fraction of slash was rapid with more than 90% of dry weight released during the 105-week study. Bark and branch fractions of diameters 0.5, 1 and 2 cm lost 39%, 37%, 32% and 29% of dry weight, respectively, during the same period. Single and double exponential decay models fitted to the data indicated half lives ranging from 20 weeks for leaves and from 3 to 4 years for bark and the branch fractions. During decomposition, K was leached rapidly from all residue fractions, Mg and P were released at similar rates to dry weight, and Ca and N were released more slowly than dry weight. In the 105-week study period, 250 kg ha–1 of N, 20 kg ha–1 of P, 213 kg ha–1 of Ca, 298 kg ha–1 of K, and 63 kg ha–1 of Mg were returned to the soil from decomposing harvest slash. The leaf fraction was the major contributor to nutrient cycling, accounting for almost all of the N and Ca release and from half to three-quarters of the K, Mg and P released. Amounts of nutrients released from residues in the year following logging greatly exceeded quantities likely to be taken up by the newly established tree crop.
