Abstract Two novel and unusual representatives of the yeast genus Candida isolated from fallen trunks of Nothofagus dombeyii (Mirb.) Blume and Drymis winterii Weim., in the last stages of decay, in the evergreen rainy Valdivian forest of southern Chile, are described and illustrated. They clearly differ from all recognized species of Candida to warrant their establishment as two new species of yeasts: Candida santjacobensis and Candida ancudensis.
