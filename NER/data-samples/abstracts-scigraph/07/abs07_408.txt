Summary Distribution and size of 38 capercaillie Tetrao urogallus leks were related to amount and configuration of old forest patches in two south-east Norwegian coniferous forests. The smallest occupied patch was 48 ha containing a solitary displaying cock. All patches larger than 1 km2 contained leks. Number of cocks per lek increased with increasing patch size. Number of leks per patch increased in a step-wise manner with one lek added for each 2.5–3 km2 increase in patch size. In large patches there was one lek per 3–5 km2 old forest, and density of lekking cocks was 2–2.5 per km2. In small patches density of cocks varied considerably. Density of cocks was not related to patch isolation or patch shape. However, among leks surrounded by 50–60% old forest within a 1 km radius, number of cocks increased with increasing old forest fine-graininess. We argue that when old forests cover more than 50%, a fine-grained mosaic may support higher densities of lekking cocks than a coarse-grained mosaic. Conversely, when old forests cover less than 50%, a fine-grained mosaic is unfavourable, because each old forest patch becomes too small and isolated. Finally, we present a predictive model of how old forest fragmentation influences density of leks, number of cocks per lek, and total density of cocks.
