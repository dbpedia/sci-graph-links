Abstract Woody biomass of trees outside forests (TOF) is gaining increasing interest in many countries as it is a renewable energy source that has not been managed for bioenergy production. Our case study describes two independent approaches to assess regional area of TOF as a means for the biomass production potential of TOF within a study region in Germany, the Göttingen district (area: 1,118 km2): (1) a statistical sampling with field inventory data, and (2) an area-wide GIS-mapping approach based on open-access aerial imagery. For our particular study, the differences between the mapping-based approach and the sample-based approach were minor (sampling: 24.37 ha and 16,670 t of dry wood per year with a relative standard error 11.6 % vs. area-wide mapping: 24.35 ha and 16,055 t; standard error not available). Due to a minor difference of only 3.7 % between the two approaches, we conclude that area-wide mapping serves as a sound basis for a quantification of bioenergy potentials from TOF. It also shown that only about 62 % of all TOF objects (74 % of the total annual biomass production) would be directly accessible via the existing road infrastructure (without heavy machinery). In terms of available end-use energy, the regional biomass potential translates to an annual amount of 233 TJ which, in turn, reflects only about 0.9 % of the annual end-use energy demand in the study area. This marginal contribution to the region’s energy supply is due to the fact that TOF covers only around 24 km2 (~2 %) in our study area.
