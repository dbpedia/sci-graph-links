Abstract Our previously published experiments on allelopathic effects of insect frass in Eucalyptus communities (Silander et al. 1983) have been criticized on the grounds that our estimates of annual frass production were exscessive (Ohmart 1985). However, we spanned the entire array of estimates of frass fall available from eucalypt communities, and we demonstrated allelopathic effects at even the lowest levels suggested by Ohmart. We suggest that average values of frass fall per hectare are irrelevant because they ignore both large scale variation among sites in time and space, and small scale variation in patchiness of frass accumulation. At the ecological scales relevant to germinating seeds, frass concentrations in local pockets may be considerably higher than the averages calculated for the entire ground surface.
