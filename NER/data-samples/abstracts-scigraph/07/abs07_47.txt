Summary Two methods of estimating fine root production and turnover are compared for 13 forest ecosystems exhibiting a wide range in form (NH4 + vs. NO3 -) and quantity of available nitrogen. The two methods are by comparison of seasonal maxima and minima in biomess and by nitrogen budgeting. Both methods give similar results for stands with low rates of nitrification. The budgeting method predicts higher fine root turnover and productivity than the max-min method for systems with significant rates of nitrification.
