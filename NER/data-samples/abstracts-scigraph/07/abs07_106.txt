Summary Thirten sample trees of various sizes in a 29-year-old hinoki [Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb, et Zucc.) Endl.] plantation were felled and subjected to the stratified clip technique. Crown profile of foliage area fitted well with the Weibull distribution. The crown profile tended to be more skewed toward the top of crowns in smaller trees than in larger trees. This tendency was reflected in the value of the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution. The shape parameter ranged from 1.73 to 3.23 and gradually increased up to an asymptotic value with an increase of stem diameter at breast height. The scale parameter of the distribution ranged from 1.0 to 4.2 and tended to increase in proportion to stem diameter at breast height. Foliage area of a tree correlated well with stem diameter at breast height through an ordinary allometric equation. Tree height could be approximated fairly well by a generalized allometric equation as a function of stem diameter at breast height. On the basis of the census of stem diameter at breast height, canopy profile could be constructed synthesizing crown profiles of foliage area for individual trees in the stand. Leaf area index was estimated to be 6.6 ha haâˆ’1.
