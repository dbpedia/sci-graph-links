Abstract Patterns in branch permeability with crown depth and permeability at the top of the main stem were analyzed for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees from families selected on the basis of growth rate (fast, slow) and crown size (large, small). Analysis of variance with levels of crown size nested within levels of growth rate was used to test for differences in main stem permeability. Permeability at the top of the stem averaged 2.0×10−12 m2. There were no significant differences in permeability between families selected for fast and slow growth, but permeability was significantly lower for families selected for large crowns than for families selected for small crowns. Branch permeability averaged 0.74×10−12 m2 and decreased significantly with crown depth. Large-crown families had higher overall branch permeability than small-crown families. Average permeability in branches did not differ significantly between fast- and slow-growing families. Large crown-families had significantly larger current leaf area: total leaf area ratios in the lower two-thirds of the crown, and a weak but significant association was found between permeability and current leaf area: total leaf area ratios for a given relative crown depth. Our results suggest that ecotypic and adaptive processes simultaneously affect the overall patterns of stem and branch permeability in loblolly pine families.
