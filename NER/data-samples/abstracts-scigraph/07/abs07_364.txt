Summary In a 35-year-old calcareous beech forest stand five beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) were felled every 2 weeks, and xylem sap was obtained by means of water displacement from the lowest trunk sections, each 100 cm in length. From mid-October 1988 to mid-October 1989 a total of 130 trees were investigated. The seasonal variations of the Ca, Mg, K and Mn contents, as well as those of pH, show four characteristic phases. Additionally, distribution of the mineral contents along the trunk was studied in four trees. The seasonal increase and decrease of xylem sap mineral contents along the trunk is shown for the characteristic phenophases. The Ca, Mg, K, and Mn contents of xylem saps were determined by means of atomicabsorptionspectrophotometry.
