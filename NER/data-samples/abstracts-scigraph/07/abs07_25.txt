Abstract The Ojców National Park, 22 km NNW of Cracow (Kraków), is subjected to the influence of very strong air pollution. Coniferous trees, especially the silver fir Abies alba and the Scots pine Pinus sylvestric suffer seriously under these conditions. The individual tolerance of fir to the stress factors proved to be very differenciated and only to a small degree connected with the height of trees and their position in forest canopy. Some differenciation in fir vitality resulted however from the site conditions and the exposure to winds carrying air pollutants. Floristic changes in the mixed forest Pino-Quercetum during the last 30 years were documented by repeated phytosociological releves. The most significant of these changes is the disappearance of carpet mosses and other acidophilous species of the Vaccinio-Piceetea class. Consequently, most of the forest stands classified before as Pino-Quercetum do not represent this plant association any more. The symptoms of damage, existing also in deciduous forests, indicate that an effective nature protection in the Ojców National Park can be secured only by limitation of air pollution.
