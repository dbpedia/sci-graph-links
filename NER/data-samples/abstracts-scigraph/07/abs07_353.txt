Summary Growth ring sequences in conifers and broadleaved trees show abrupt growth reductions persisting for several years. The frequency and duration of such reductions in almost 10000 trees in forest stands of Central Europe, in particular Switzerland, and in the Front Range, Colorado, USA, is related to species, climate and weather, and geographical unit. The growth reductions in the populations investigated are concentrated in certain periods and, in all species examined, essentially related to periods of drought in the spring and summer months. During the years covered by the study (1850–1985), periods of growth reduction occur in Central Europe, the Front Range, Colorado, and also in the Hudson Valley, New York, at irregular intervals of 6–34 years, and on average every 13–14 years. The growth reduction periods normally do not show synchronism between the three areas investigated. Regionally valid growth periodicities can only be definitely determined through the examination of a very large amount of material comprising a number of species growing in different forest stands and on different sites within a major phytosociological unit. Findings from studies on trees in different climatic areas or on few samples scarcely allow reliable comparisons.
