Abstract Fungi were isolated monthly from collections of first year needles, second year needles, and both surface sterilized and non-sterilized abscised brown needles in the canopy and one-year-old litter on the forest floor. The vertical and phenological distribution of the 8 commonest fungi are reported. After the second growing season in the litterMortierella isabellina, Trichoderma spp., andPenicillium spp. overgrow these fungi on the primary isolation plates using the procedure adopted in this phase of the needle study.
