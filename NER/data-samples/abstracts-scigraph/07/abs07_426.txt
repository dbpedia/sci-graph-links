Abstract The relationships between height increment of Scots pine (PINUS SYLVESTRIS L.), birch (BETULA PUBESCENS Ehrh.) and rowan (SORBUS AUCUPARIA L.) during one growing season to meteorological variables at 580 m above sea level in the northern Pennines were previously examined using orthogonalized regression analysis. The paper describes methods made to improve the efficiency of the models. Values of principal components of the meteorological variables of the current and preceding sets were associated with 76.5, 60.4 and 75.9 percentage of variability respectively, showing an improvement by allowing for lag effects in this way. Efficiency of using values of the original variables, with those of the preceding set, or with curvilinear terms, was generally less. Variation of response during the season was examined and was discussed in terms of plant behaviour.
