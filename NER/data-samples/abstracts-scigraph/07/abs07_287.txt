Abstractâ€‚ The correlation between spiral grain formation and crown asymmetry was investigated in 18 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and 17 Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] trees selected from clones of each species growing in the south of Sweden. The angle between the longitudinal direction of the tracheids in the outermost year ring compared to the longitudinal direction of the stem was measured by scribing lines which followed the direction of the tracheids. The crown asymmetry was measured by taking photographs of the trees followed by a simple picture analysis of the tree. Wind data for the growing seasons of 1997 and 1998 were obtained from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The results showed a significant correlation between the angle of the tracheids compared to the stem longitudinal direction going from a left-handed angle if the trees had a crown projected to the north towards a right-handed angle the more the crown projects to the south.
