Abstract This study was carried out in pioneer and successional forest tree species in a lower montane tropical forest with seasonal rains. We tested whether pioneer species feature high hydraulic conductance allowing them to use water profusely at leaf level. Conversely, forest species may have relatively low hydraulic conductance accompanied with better control over water use. This may lead in turn to pioneer species being at a relatively higher risk of shoot water potential falling below the threshold value at which cavitations occur compared to forest. Specific hydraulic conductance (K s) measured during the wet season was comparable between pioneers and forest species. During drought, K s was significantly reduced, and species of both plant groups responded to this by modifying the relationship between conducting area and leaf area (Huver value), such that leaf specific conductivity (K l) was unaffected. Thus, leaf area seemed to be adjusted to maintain constant hydraulic sufficiency during drought. Pioneer species were more efficient in conducting water to their leaves but had low control over water use compared to forest species. A trade-off between water transport and leaf water use efficiency was suggested. These ecophysiological differences may have an impact on the performance of the species occupying contrasting habitats. Nonetheless, drought-induced embolisms occurred in trees growing in both open and forest habitats. Overall, during drought, adjustment of leaf area occurred in order to maintain a homeostasis of some physiological traits (leaf-specific conductivity and carbon assimilation).
