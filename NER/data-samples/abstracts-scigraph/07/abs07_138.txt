Abstract Reliable and objective estimations of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area index (LAI) are essential for accurate estimates of the canopy carbon gain of trees. The variation in SLA with needle age and position in the crown was investigated for a 73-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in the Belgian Campine region. Allometric equations describing the projected needle area of the entire crown were developed, and used to estimate stand needle area. SLA (cm2 g−1) as significantly influenced by the position in the crown and by needle age (current-year versus 1-year-old needles). SLA increased significantly from the top to the bottom of the crown, and was significantly higher near the interior of the crown as compared to the crown edge. SLA of current-year needles was significantly higher than that of 1-year-old needles. Allometric relationships of projected needle area with different tree characteristics showed that stem diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height and crown depth were reliable predictors of projected needle area at the tree level. The allometric relationships between DBH and projected needle area at the tree level were used to predict stand-level needle area and estimate LAI. The LAI was 1.06 (m2 m−2) for current-year needles and 0.47 for 1-year-old needles, yielding a total stand LAI of 1.53.
