Abstract The percentage of bark and small branches was analysed for the main Belgian hardwood species. 288 homogeneous UF-bonded boards were made on a laboratory scale from the wood, bark and small branches of four wood species and their mixing. The physical and mechanical properties of these boards were determined. The addition of bark and small branches leads to a decrease in the mechanical properties of the boards and an increase in longitudinal swelling. The technological value of whole-tree chips depends on the quality of the particles made from them and on their percentage of bark and small branches.
