Abstract Two novel representatives of the yeast genus Candida, isolated from advanced stages of degradation from fallen trunks of Nothofagus dombeyii (Mirb.) Blume and Laurelia sempervirens Weim., in the evergreen rainy Valdivian forest of southern Chile, are described and illustrated. The strains differ from all accepted Candida species to warrant their establishment as two new species: Candida petrohuensis and Candida rancensis.
