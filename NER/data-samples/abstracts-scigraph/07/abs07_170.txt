Abstract The susceptibility of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sap- and heartwood against the wood decaying brown-rot fungus (Coniophora puteana) was investigated after long-term forest fertilization at three different sites in central Finland. Different wood properties: wood extractives, wood chemistry, and wood anatomy were used to explain sap- and heartwood decay. Scots pine sapwood was more susceptible to decay than its heartwood. In one site, sapwood seemed to be more resistant to wood decay after forest fertilization whereas the susceptibility of heartwood increased. Significant changes in the sapwood chemistry were found between treatment and sites, however, no relationship between wood chemistry and wood decay was observed in the factor analysis. The results of this study show that there was an inconsistent relationship between decay susceptibility and fertilization and the measured physical and chemical attributes of the wood were not consistently correlated with the decay rate.
