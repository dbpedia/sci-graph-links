Abstract Tropical provenances of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. and E. tereticornis Smith were studied, in their natural habitat in Australia and in a 3.75-year-old progeny trial in Zimbabwe, for their potential to produce medicinal-grade essential oils. Substantial interand intra-specific variation in the contents of five prominent monoterpenes, 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene and p-cymene was found. Plantations of E. camaldulensis established in the wet/dry tropics using seed from Petford in northern Queensland offer immediate potential for oil production. Other widely-planted Queensland provenances with oil potential are Gilbert River Bridge E. camaldulensis and, after some genetic improvement, E. tereticonis from Morehead and Kennedy Rivers. Select individual trees at Petford provide oil of enhanced quality, at about double the yield of ‘average’ trees.
