Abstract. On low fluvial terraces of the Caquetá River, Araracuara region, Colombia, tree root systems were examined with regard to their structure, underground stratification and biomass distribution. Excavations of skeleton roots and microscopic observation of terminal fine roots included ten species belonging to the Cecropia, Vismia, Miconia, Goupia, Clathrotropis and Brosimum genera. Roots of particular species varied in the external features of their periderm and structure of freshly cut slash. Coarse skeleton roots differed in the shape and position of the plagiotropic branches and positively geotropic taproots or sinkers. None of the observed species could be identified as a shallow-rooted tree, in spite of the general fine root concentration in the upper soil horizon. In the two seasons of study, the terminal roots displayed prevailingly secondary anatomical structure and did not maintain much primary anatomical tissue in their apices. Neither ectomycorrhizas nor endomycorrhizas were detected in the samples. In a set of regeneration stages the amount of tree roots linearly increased with the age of growth. However, fine roots below 2 mm in diameter shared 80–90% of all roots in the upper 20 cm layer of all sample plots. In an old-growth forest, the total tree root biomass amounted to 39 ton/ha, thus being comparable to the underground biomass observed in similar tropical forests.
