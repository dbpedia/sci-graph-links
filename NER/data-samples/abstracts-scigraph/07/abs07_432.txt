Abstract New information from a survey of truffles carried out in southern part of Poland in September 2007 is presented. The fruit bodies of Tuber aestivum, T. excavatum, T. rufum and one unidentified Tuber sp. were found. The soil chemistry of the five T. aestivum sites was analysed. Our inventory showed that T. aestivum prefers the mixed forest with host-trees such as: Quercus robur, Corylus avellana, Carpinus betulus, Fagus silvaticus and Tilia cordata. Selection of local inocula of T. aestivum for the propagation of truffles production could be an alternative to the Mediterranean truffles orchards in times when demand for the fungi will be increasing. Fruit bodies of truffles are conserved in the collection of biological material in the Forest Research Institute in SÄ™kocin Stary.
