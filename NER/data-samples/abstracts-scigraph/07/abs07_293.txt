Abstract Key message Recovery after partial defoliation and/or debudding treatments was found to be more closely related to the release of latent buds rather than temporal changes in leaf-level respiration and carbon uptake. AbstractDespite the importance of respiration in the overall carbon balance of plants, recovery after defoliation and debudding has been largely related to changes in carbon uptake; the significance of respiration has received much less attention. Growth, biomass and leaf-level carbon balance (both photosynthesis and dark respiration at night) responses of young Eucalyptus globulus potted-saplings to debudding (B), partial defoliation (D) and combined B&D treatments were assessed over a 12-week recovery period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates (A 1500) were asynchronous with night respiration rates (R dark) throughout the course of the experiment; 5 weeks after defoliation, significant increases in A 1500 were accompanied by concomitant increases in R dark in the B&D and B and D treatments. By week 8, while A 1500 returned to control values, R dark had increased, particularly in the B&D treatment. Saplings in the B and D treatments showed full recovery with growth, biomass and leaf area being similar to control saplings by week 12. In contrast, saplings in the B&D treatment appeared unable to compensate for the combined removal of all buds and 35 % leaf area as evidenced by slowed height increments and reductions in total biomass of >30 %. Simple modelling of whole-plant net CO2 uptake showed that saplings in the B&D treatment fixed 20 % less CO2 than the other treatments at week 12, suggesting that recovery following this treatment and the D treatment was dependent on changes in total leaf area development and whole-tree assimilation rather than differences in assimilation or respiration per unit foliage area. Increased biomass allocation to bud in weeks 5 and 8 suggested that the pattern of refoliation after defoliation and debudding was related to changes in tree architecture from the release of latent buds.
