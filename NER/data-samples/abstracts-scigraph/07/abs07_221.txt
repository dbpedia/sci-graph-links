Summary A study beyond the political boundaries in planning strategies for long-term management of the global forest estate is presented. Three alternative forest networks are proposed: (1) the genetic-evolutionary network, based around common evolutionary features, thus delineating similar forest types where conservation and management issues are likely to be compatible; (2) the current ecological and environmental network, based around the role that forests play in the wider ecosystem, including regular and irregular migration pathways, networks to absorb the impact of climate change, water filters etc; (3) the human impact network, based on the history of human involvement in the forest and its implications. The practical policy significance of the various networks is discussed in turn.
