Abstract Mobile could computing (MCC) is the availability of cloud computing services in the mobile ecosystem. MCC integrates the cloud computing into the mobile environment and has been introduced to be a potential technology for mobile devices. Although mobile devices brought us lots of convenience, it is still difficult or impossible to perform some expensive tasks due to the limited resources such as computing abilities, battery lifetime, processing abilities, and storage capacity. Therefore, many researchers focus on designing applications which could run on mobile devices in mobile cloud computing. Among them, secure encrypted image search has attracted considerable interest recently. However, it also suffers from some challenges such as privacy of images, and distance matching over ciphertexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel encryption search scheme for content-based image retrieval using comparable encryption and order-preserving encryption technology. Because of avoiding the usage of the homomorphic encryption, our construction greatly reduces computation overhead on client side and improves the precision of fuzzy search compared with previous solutions.
