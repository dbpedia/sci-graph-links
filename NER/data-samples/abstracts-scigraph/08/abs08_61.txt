Abstract Quadtrees constitute a classical data structure for storing and accessing collections of points in multidimensional space. It is proved that, in any dimension, the cost of a random search in a randomly grown quadtree has logarithmic mean and variance and is asymptotically ditributed as a normal variable. The limit distribution property extends to quadtrees of all dimensions a result only known so far to hold for binary search trees. The analysis is based on a technique of singularity perturbation that appears to be of some generality. For quadtrees, this technique is applied to linear differential equations satisfied by interventing bivariate generating functions
