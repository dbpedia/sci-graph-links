Abstract Recent technology advances have made multimedia on-demand services, such as home entertainment and home-shopping, important to the consumer market. One of the most challenging aspects of this type of service is providing access either instantaneously or within a small and reasonable latency upon request. We consider improvements in the performance of multimedia storage servers through data sharing between requests for popular objects, assuming that the I/O bandwidth is the critical resource in the system. We discuss a novel approach to data sharing, termed adaptive piggybacking, which can be used to reduce the aggregate I/O demand on the multimedia storage server and thus reduce latency for servicing new requests.
