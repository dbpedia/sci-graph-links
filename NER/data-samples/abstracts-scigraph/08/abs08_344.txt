Abstract Truong et al. [7]proved that the weight distribution of a binary quadratic residue code C with length congruent to −1 modulo 8 can be determined by the weight distribution of a certain subcode of C containing only one-eighth of the codewords of C. In this paper, we prove that the same conclusion holds for any binary quadratic residue codes.
