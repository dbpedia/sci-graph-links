Abstract SMS4 is released by the Chinese government as part of theWAPI standard for the wireless networks. At ICICS 2007 and CRYPTO 2015, Lu and Sun et al. constructed some 12-round impossible differentials and 12-round zero correlation linear hulls, respectively. In this paper, it is proved that the distinguishers constructed by Lu and Sun et al. are independent with the details of the non-linear layers though they concentrated on the specific S-boxes. This indicates that for the structure deduced by SMS4, there always exist 12-round impossible differentials and 12-round zero correlation linear hulls.
