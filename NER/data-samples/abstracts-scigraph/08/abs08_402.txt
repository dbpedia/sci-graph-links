Abstract Xue et al. recently proposed an innovative mutual authentication and key agreement scheme for wireless sensor networks based on temporal credential using smart cards. However, in this paper we demonstrate that their scheme is vulnerable to password guessing attacks, node capture attacks and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore we show that their scheme has some inconsistencies which make it less secure and more computationally costly than originally presented.
