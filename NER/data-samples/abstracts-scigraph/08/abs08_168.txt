Abstract In this research paper, a high throughput memory efficient pipelining architecture for Fast Efficient Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) image compression system is explained. The main aim of this paper is to compress and implement the image without any loss of information. So, we are using spatial oriented tree approach in Fast Efficient SPIHT algorithm for compression and Spartan 3 EDK kit for hardware implementation analysis purpose. Integer wavelet transform is used for encoding and decoding process in SPIHT algorithm. Here, we are using pipelining architecture to implement it in FPGA kit because pipeline architecture is more suitable for hardware utility purpose. Generally an image file will occupy more amount of space. In order to reduce the memory size no loss during transmission we are using this approach. By this way we are attained maximum PSNR value, CR and also produced very high accurate image after decompression, when compared with the results of other previous algorithms. In this module, the hardware tools used are dual core processor and FPGA Spartan 3 EDK kit and the software tool windows 8 operating system and the tool kit is MATLAB 7.8.
