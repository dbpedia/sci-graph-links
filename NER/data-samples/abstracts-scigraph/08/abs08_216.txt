Abstract In this paper, a novel secure information exchange scheme has been proposed for MIMO vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) through physical layer approach. In the scheme, a group of On Board Units (OBUs) exchange information with help of one Road Side Unit (RSU). By utilizing the key signal processing technique, i.e., Direction Rotation Alignment technique, the information to be exchanged of the two neighbor OBUs are aligned into a same direction to form summed signal at RSU or external eavesdroppers. With such summed signal, the RSU or the eavesdropper cannot recover the individual information from the OBUs. By regulating the transmission rate for each OBU, the information theoretic security could be achieved. The secrecy sum-rates of the proposed scheme are analyzed following the scheme. Finally, the numerical results are conducted to demonstrate the theoretical analysis.
