Abstract Most of the previously proposed identity-based multiproxy multisignature (IBMPMS) schemes used pairings in their construction. But pairing is regarded as an expensive cryptographic primitive in terms of complexity. The relative computation cost of a pairing is approximately more than ten times of the scalar multiplication over elliptic curve group. So, to reduce running time, we first define a model of a secure MPMS scheme, then propose an IBMPMS scheme without using pairings. We also prove the security of our scheme against chosen message attack in random oracle model. Our schemeâ€™s construction avoids bilinear pairing operations but still provides signature in the ID-based setting and reduces running time heavily. Therefore, proposed scheme is more applicable than previous schemes in terms of computational efficiency for practical applications.
