Abstract Condition proxy re-encryption is a promising security primitive for pervasive data sharing in such settings as cloud-based social networks and collaborations. However, it is challenging to create a secure condition proxy re-encryption scheme that is applicable for circumstances with multiple conditions. Based on secret sharing, Lan et al. proposed a conditional proxy re-encryption scheme that can support “AND” and “OR” gates over multiple conditions, and claimed that the scheme is secure against Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (CCA) in the random oracle model. However, by giving two concrete attacks, we show that their scheme is not CCA secure and even not secure against Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA) under their defined security model. Furthermore, we analyze why the scheme cannot satisfy the security mentioned above.
