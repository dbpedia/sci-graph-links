Abstract This is a literature survey of computational location privacy, meaning computation-based privacy mechanisms that treat location data as geometric information. This definition includes privacy-preserving algorithms like anonymity and obfuscation as well as privacy-breaking algorithms that exploit the geometric nature of the data. The survey omits non-computational techniques like manually inspecting geotagged photos, and it omits techniques like encryption or access control that treat location data as general symbols. The paper reviews studies of peoplesâ€™ attitudes about location privacy, computational threats on leaked location data, and computational countermeasures for mitigating these threats.
