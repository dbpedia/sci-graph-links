Abstract We show that in the worst case, Ω(n d ) sidedness queries are required to determine whether a set ofn points in ℝ d is affinely degenerate, i.e., whether it containsd+1 points on a common hyperplane. This matches known upper bounds. We give a straightforward adversary argument, based on the explicit construction of a point set containing Ω(n d ) “collapsible” simplices, any one of which can be made degenerate without changing the orientation of any other simplex. As an immediate corollary, we have an Ω(n d ) lower bound on the number of sidedness queries required to determine the order type of a set ofn points in ℝ d . Using similar techniques, we also show that Ω(n d+1) in-sphere queries are required to decide the existence of spherical degeneracies in a set ofn points in ℝ d .
