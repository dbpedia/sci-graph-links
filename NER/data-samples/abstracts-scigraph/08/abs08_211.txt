Abstract Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an appealing technology that has attracted lots of research efforts. On-demand routing protocol such as AODV may suffer from frequent topological changes. Due to frequent communication failures, multipath MANET is preferred than single-path MANET in many applications as former is used for achieving robustness and load balancing and improving reliability. Although multipath MANET is attractive solution, there are still some major flaws that prevent commercial growth. Security is one of these main barriers; MANETs are known to be particularly vulnerable to security attack. The paper presents a design of robust and secure framework for multipath MANET. In this paper, we propose not only a robust multipath routing protocol but also an extended security scheme. We discuss security analysis for proposed security scheme. And we also conduct simulation to evaluate such a framework through different performance metrics. Results show that the proposed routing protocol achieves better performance in terms of various metrics than other protocols.
