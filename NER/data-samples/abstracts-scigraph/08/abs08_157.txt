Abstract. Selective encryption provides the ability to strike a balance between security and processing demands, e.g., in mobile clients. Image encoding using wavelets, and especially wavelet packets, can be used for efficient selective encryption. We will show how two such methods work and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in terms of security and speed.
