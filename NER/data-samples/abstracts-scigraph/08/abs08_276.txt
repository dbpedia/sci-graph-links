Abstract Radio frequency identification tag authentication protocols are generally classified as non-full-fledged and full-fledged, according to the resource usage of the tags. The non-full-fledged protocols typically suffer de-synchronization, impersonation and tracking attacks, and usually lack scalability. The full-fledged protocols, supporting cryptographic functions, are designed to overcome these weaknesses. This paper examines several elliptic-curve-cryptography (ECC)-based full-fledged protocols. We found that some still have security and privacy issues, and others generate excessive communication costs between the tag and the back-end server. Motivated by these observations, we construct two novel protocols, PI and PII. PI is designed for secure environments and is suitable for applications, including E-Passport and toll payment in vehicular ad-hoc networks. PII is for hostile environments and can be applied in pseudonymous payment and anti-counterfeiting services. After analysis, we conclude that PII can resist many attacks, outperform previous ECC-based proposals in communication efficiency, and provide mutual authentication function and scalability.
