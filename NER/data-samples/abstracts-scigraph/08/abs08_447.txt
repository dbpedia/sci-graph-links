Abstract Recently, many authentication schemes have been provided which are based on biometrics with password and smart cards. The three-factor schemes can provide high security for remote authentication between a user and a server. In 2015, Lu et al. proposed a three-factor authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography. However, we show that Lu et al’s scheme leaks user’s identity and is vulnerable to impersonation attacks. To enhance the scheme’s security, we propose a new efficient three-factor authentication scheme. Furthermore, we give a formal security proof under BAN logic and random orale model. From comparative results of some recent ones, our scheme is efficient and secure for practical applications.
