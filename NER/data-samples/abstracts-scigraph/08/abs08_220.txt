Abstract Cloud storage enables users to store their data and enjoy high-quality cloud applications based on transaction processing. Normally, the wholesaler has real servers which host products and services from different locations, provide the end-users to simply log on to the network and perform transaction processing. However, the dynamic data update after transaction processing in cloud does not provide an optimal security framework. Besides, the cloud data storage is not focusing on maximizing the security on performing the transactions over cloud servers. In order to overcome such limitations in cloud, a novel framework named conditional source trust attribute encryption with particle swarm-based transaction optimization (CSTAE-PSTO) is proposed. The conditional attributes are encrypted using the conditional source trust attribute encryption technique along with the bilinear mapping transformation function in CSTAE-PSTO framework to improve the security level through unique secured identity number. The PSTO technique on cloud applications optimizes the result with minimal transaction completion time. Experiment is conducted based on factors such as throughput level on transaction, security rate on data layer and transaction completion time. Experimental analysis shows that the CSTAE-PSTO framework is able to improve the security rate on data layer and reduce the transaction completion time when compared to the state-of-the-art works.
