 Abstract. Security of quantum key distribution against sophisticated attacks is among the most important issues in quantum information theory. In this work we prove security against a very important class of attacks called collective attacks (under a compatible noise model) which use quantum memories and gates, and which are directed against the final key. This work was crucial for a full proof of security (against the joint attack) recently obtained by Biham, Boyer, Boykin, Mor, and Roychowdhury [1].
