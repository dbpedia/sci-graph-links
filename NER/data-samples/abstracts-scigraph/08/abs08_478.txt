Abstract We present a small-footprint search protocol designed to facilitate any-type queries for data content and services in large population, high-density wireless sensor networks. Our protocol, termed Trajectory-based Selective Broadcast Query (TSBQ), works in conjunction with time division multiple access- or schedule-based medium access control protocols to reduce per-query energy expenditure. We compare the performance of TSBQ to unicast- and local broadcast-based search algorithms and also determine a critical node density based on the energy expended by nodes to transmit and receive. Minimal energy expenditure is achieved by determining the optimal number of data/service replicates and the number of nodes designated to receive each query transmission. Numerical results indicate that TSBQ significantly reduces the total energy expenditure of a network as compared to unicast and local broadcast-based search protocols.
