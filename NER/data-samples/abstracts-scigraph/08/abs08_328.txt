Abstract Wireless sensor networks are used in many applications in military, ecology, health, and other areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information making the security issue one of the most important aspects to consider in this field. However, most of protocols optimize for the limited capabilities of sensor nodes and the application specific nature of the networks, but they are vulnerable to serious attacks. In this paper, a Secure Energy and Reliability Aware data gathering protocol (SERA) is proposed, which provides energy efficiency and data delivery reliability as well as security. The proposed protocolâ€™s security was confirmed by a formal verification carried out using the AVISPA tool and analysis of the most common network layer attacks such as selective forwarding, sinkhole, Sybil, wormhole, HELLO flood, and acknowledgment spoofing attacks. Additionally, a visual simulation environment was developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol.
