Abstract The arithmetical Cohen-Macaulay property for monomial curves in ℙ K 3 with generic zero $$(t_0^{n_3 } ,t_0^{n_3 - n_1 } t_0^{n_1 } ,t_0^{n_3 - n_2 } t_0^{n_2 } ,t_0^{n_3 } )$$ was shown in [2] to be true forn 3>(n 2−1)(n 2−n 1),n 3>n 2, (n 1,n 2,n 3)=1. Here we establish necessary and sufficient arithmetic conditions in terms ofn 1,n 2,n 3 in order for the indicated curves not to be arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay.
