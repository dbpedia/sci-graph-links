Abstract Many threshold proxy signature schemes are proposed in which the t out of n threshold schemes are deployed; but they still lack the property of security. In this research paper, secret sharing proxy signature could permit the shares of designated signers, called proxy signers, renew their own proxy shares periodically without changing the secret. In particular, our scheme applies the (t, n) threshold proxy signature scheme and allows any t or more then t signers to form a designated group from n proxy signers to sign messages on behalf of the original signer. In the proposed scheme, furthermore, a proxy signer can recover his/her own share from t other proxy shares without revealing any information about other proxy shares. Unless more than t other proxy signers cooperate and collude, the secret share algorithm is always secure. We compare the performance of four schemes: Hwang et al., Wen et al., Geng et al. and Fengying et al. with the performance of a scheme that has been proposed by the authors of this article earlier. In the proposed scheme, both the combiner and the secret share holder can verify the correctness of the information that they are receiving from each other. Therefore, the enhanced threshold proxy signature scheme is secure and efficient against notorious conspiracy attacks.
