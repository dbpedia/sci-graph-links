Abstract. This paper presents a complete system for the secure distribution of a copyrighted MPEG-1/2 video stored on a DVD-ROM disc. A combined selective watermarking and encryption method that operates in the compressed MPEG domain is introduced. Watermarking resistant to a number of attacks is used for copyright protection. The video quality deteriorates significantly due to encryption, thus restraining unauthorized viewers from viewing it. The video can only be viewed using the developed Secure MPEG Player, which performs real-time decryption of the encrypted video. The decryption requires a secret key that is extracted from the DVD-ROM disc in a cryptographically secure manner.
