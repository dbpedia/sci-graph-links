Abstract For realizing the flexible, scalable and fuzzy fine-grained access control, ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme has been widely used in the cloud storage system. However, the access structure of CP-ABE scheme is outsourced to the cloud storage server, resulting in the disclosure of access policy privacy. In addition, there are multiple authorities that coexist and each authority is able to issue attributes independently in the cloud storage system. However, existing CP-ABE schemes cannot be directly applied to data access control for multi-authority cloud storage system, due to the inefficiency for user revocation. In this paper, to cope with these challenges, we propose a decentralized multi-authority CP-ABE access control scheme, which is more practical for supporting the user revocation. In addition, this scheme can protect the data privacy and the access policy privacy with policy hidden in the cloud storage system. Here, the access policy that is realized by employing the linear secret sharing scheme. Finally, the security and performance analyses demonstrate that our scheme has high security in terms of access policy privacy and efficiency in terms of computational cost of user revocation.
