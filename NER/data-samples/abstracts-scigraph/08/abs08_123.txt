Summary Eavesdropping RFID systems can violate privacy. We propose a privacy-friendly RFID system, in which the chip modulates its reply onto a noisy carrier provided by the reader, to protect the back-channel against eavesdropping. This method does not require additional protective devices and resolves some practical weaknesses of previous proposals.
