Abstract Linear codes have been an interesting subject of study for many years. In this paper, for an odd prime p, a class of three-weight linear codes over $$\mathbb {F}_{p}$$ Fp are constructed and the complete weight enumerators of these linear codes are also settled. These codes have applications in authentication codes, association schemes and data storage systems.
