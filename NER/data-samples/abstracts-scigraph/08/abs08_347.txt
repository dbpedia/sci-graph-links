Abstract The Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics (RF4CE) is developed to support the rapid increasing demand of bi-directional communication and remote control functionalities in CE market such as TV, home theater . However, current security model in RF4CE standard has potential weakness that transmission of initial key seeds is operated via unencrypted air interface. In this paper, we propose a secure key agreement protocol that uses pre-shared information between consumer devices and manufacturers and controllers receive the information by communication with manufacturers.
