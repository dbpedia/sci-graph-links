Abstract In this paper, we enhance and investigate the performance of some bandwidth efficient coding schemes with iteratively decodable structure and cycles in their graph representation. In particular, we deal with bit-interleaved coded modulation and transmit diversity, using low-density parity-check and turbo codes as component codes. Simulation results show that the suboptimality of iterative decoding for moderate length codes can be at least partially compensated. Hence they allow us to also measure partially this suboptimality.
