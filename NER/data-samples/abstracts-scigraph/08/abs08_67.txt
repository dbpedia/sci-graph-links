Abstract With the emergence of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, a dataflow description of the decoder part was developed as part of the MPEG-B standard. This dataflow description presented modest framerate results which led us to propose methodologies to improve the performance. In this paper, we introduce architectural improvements by exposing more parallelism using YUV and frame-based parallel decoding. We also present platform optimizations based on the use of SIMD functions and cache efficient FIFOs. Results show an average acceleration factor of 5.8 in the decoding framerate over the reference architecture.
