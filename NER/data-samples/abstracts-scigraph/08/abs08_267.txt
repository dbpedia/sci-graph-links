Abstract In this paper, we investigate a bandpass chaotic waveform communication system in an additive white Gaussian noise channel environment. By making use of the signalspace diagram and maximizing the a posteriori probability, we derive the conditions under which the optimum bit error performance can be achieved. In particular, we make use of a binary communication system to illustrate how the modulator and demodulator should be constructed in order to achieve the best error performance. Finally, the noise performance bound is determined for chaotic digital waveform communications.
