Abstract A construction of codes of length n = q + 1 and minimum Hamming distance 3 over $$GF(q)\!\setminus\!\{0\}$$ is given. Substitution of the derived codes into a concatenation construction yields nonlinear binary single-error correcting codes with better than known parameters. In particular, new binary single-error correcting codes having more codewords than the best previously known in the range n ≤ 512 are obtained for the lengths 64–66, 128–133, 256–262, and 512.
