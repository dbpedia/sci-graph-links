Abstract It has always been a challenging problem to evaluate the security of cloud services. In this paper, we analyze this problem exploiting the loss expectation by illegal attack in a quantitative way. With one of the key cloud services, storage cloud services based on keyâ€“value pairs (SCSKP for short), we quantify the protection ability with the Markov model analysis on the possibilities of various illegal attack. The loss expectation caused by the illegal attack will be calculated based on the analysis and then be used to quantify the resistance ability of SCSKP against such attacks, which serves as a metric to evaluate the security of the cloud service. We provide three series of experiments are exploited to test the expectation of losses. The results show that our method is valid and able to reflect the security situation of the cloud service.
