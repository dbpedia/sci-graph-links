Abstract This paper firstly gives some necessary conditions on one-Gray weight linear codes. And then we use these results to construct several classes of one-Gray weight linear codes over ℤ4+uℤ4(u 2 = u) with type $${16^{{k_1}}}{8^{{k_2}}}{8^{{k_3}}}{4^{{k_4}}}{4^{{k_5}}}{4^{{k_6}}}{2^{{k_7}}}{2^{{k_8}}}$$ 16k18k28k34k44k54k62k72k8 based on a distance-preserving Gray map from (ℤ4 + uℤ4) n to ℤ42n . Secondly, the authors use the similar approach to do works on two-Gray (projective) weight linear codes. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate the construction methods.
