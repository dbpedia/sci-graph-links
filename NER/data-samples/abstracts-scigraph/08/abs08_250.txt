Abstract Web warehouse (WWh) has overcome the geographical dependencies of data warehouse. With the rapid development of WWh, decision makers (humans) and intelligent devices are able to remotely retrieve the information for supporting the effective decision-making process. This paper presents a secure Web service-oriented architecture of the WWh. The proposed architecture provides the better scalability, availability of WWh, and secure analytical service for human and Internet of Things for effective decision making. In addition, the service-oriented architecture of WWh integrates intelligent devices for the process of decision making. The proposed architecture uses XML-based Web services to provide authentication, authorization, and data confidentiality and integrity. Experiments show that the proposed architecture is more reliable, scalable, and secure.
