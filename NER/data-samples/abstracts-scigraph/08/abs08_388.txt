AbstractThis paper proposes security measures for a defined uniform and transparent internet of things middleware, named UIoT. The proposed architecture is deployable and comprises protection measures based on existent technologies for internet security, as well as support for peculiar security needs of the internet of things (IoT). The aim is to provide privacy, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality on data exchange among participant entities in a given IoT scenario yet allowing resource constrained nodes to be part of the network. The main contributions of this work include a brief survey on IoT attack models and possible defenses and proposal of a security model for UIoT, which can be generalized as security measures for other IoT middleware and gateways.
