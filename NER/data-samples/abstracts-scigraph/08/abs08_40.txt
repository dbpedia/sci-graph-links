Abstract Chinese remainder codes are constructed by applying weak block designs and the Chinese remainder theorem of ring theory. The new type of linear codes take the congruence class in the congruence class ring R/I 1 ∩ I 2 ∩ ··· ∩ I n for the information bit, embed R/J i into R/I 1 ∩ I 2 ∩ ··· ∩ I n, and assign the cosets of R/J i as the subring of R/I 1 ∩ I 2 ∩ ··· ∩ I n and the cosets of R/J i in R/I 1 ∩ I 2 ∩ ··· ∩ I n as check lines. Many code classes exist in the Chinese remainder codes that have high code rates. Chinese remainder codes are the essential generalization of Sun Zi codes.
