Abstract In this paper, weights of output set and of input set for finite automata are discussed. For a weakly invertible finite automaton, we prove that for states with minimal output weight, the distribution of input sets is uniform. Then for a kind of compound finite automata, we give weights of output set and of input set explicitly, and a characterization of their input-trees. For finite automaton public key cryptosystems, of which automata in public keys belong to such a kind of compound finite automata, we evaluate search amounts of exhaust search algorithms in average case and in worse case for both encryption and signature, and successful probabilities of stochastic search algorithms for both encryption and signature. In addition, a result on mutual invertibility of finite automata is also given.
