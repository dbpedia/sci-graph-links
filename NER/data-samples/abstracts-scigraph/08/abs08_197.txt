Abstract We propose a systems approach to providing video service that integrates the multiresolution data generated by scalable compression algorithms with the high-bandwidth, high-capacity storage provided by disk arrays. We introduce two layout strategies for storing multiresolution video data on magnetic disk arrays, which vary in the degrees of parallelism and concurrency they use to satisfy requests. Our simulation results show that the storage of multiple video resolutions allows a video file server to satisfy considerably more user requests than a server that stores a single resolution of video data.
