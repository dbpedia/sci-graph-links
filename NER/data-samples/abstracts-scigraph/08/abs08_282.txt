Abstract We consider a cryptographic scenario where some center broadcasts a random binary string to Alice, Bob and Eve over binary symmetric channels with bit error probabilities εA, εB and εE respectively. Alice and Bob share no secret key initially, and their goal is to generate, after public discussion, a common information-theoretically secure key facing an active eavesdropper Eve. Under the condition εA<εE and εB<εE, code authentication (CA) can be used as part of a public discussion protocol to solve this problem. This authentication exploits parts of substrings received by Alice and Bob from the broadcasting center as authenticators to messages transmitted in a public discussion. Unfortunately, it happens to be ineffective because it produces a key of small length. We propose a hybrid authentication (HA) that combines both keyless code authentication and key authentication based on an almost strong universal class of hash functions. We prove a theorem that allows estimation of the performance evaluation of hybrid authentication. The selection algorithm for the main HA parameters, given security and reliability thresholds, is presented in detail.
