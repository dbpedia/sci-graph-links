Abstract In this paper, we analyze steganography as one of the branches in the application of secret and secure communication. Starting with an overview of steganographic methods and techniques of concealing information in various data formats, we then introduce a new system of information transfer within Microsoft Word documents via JPEG images previously processed with a steganographic tool StegApp 1.1.0, developed by the authors. This steganographic tool is based on the transformation of the JPEG image with a domain transformation technique with parameters obtained by the discrete cosine transform. In order to check the level of protection and performance of the StegApp 1.1.0 tool, it is qualitatively compared to the commercial SteganPEG tool, which works and encodes data in JPEG images in a similar way.
