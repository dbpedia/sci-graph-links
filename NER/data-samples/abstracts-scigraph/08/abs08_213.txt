Abstract Smart city improves quality of life for urban residents by using multiple information and communication technologies. As the network infrastructure of smart city, GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) can offer seamless network connection service for mobile subscribers. Whereas, because of the opening characteristics of wireless channel and various attacks, security becomes a vital issue in GLOMONET. Recently, Karuppiah and Saravanan proposed an enhanced user authentication for roaming service in GLOMONET. Unfortunately, their scheme lacks the features of session key update and perfect forward secrecy, and the session key can be revealed by home agent. Besides, their scheme faces clock synchronization problem and efficiency problem. In order to provide secure authentication service, a novel ECC (elliptic curve cryptosystem)- based user authentication scheme for roaming service in smart city is proposed in this manuscript. The security features of the proposed scheme are formally evaluated by using provable security method under random oracle model and also present informal analysis. In addition, comparative analysis is given among our scheme and relevant protocols. The results of comparative analysis illustrate that the proposed protocol provides robust and efficient for roaming service in smart city.
