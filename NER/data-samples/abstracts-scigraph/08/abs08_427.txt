Abstract For a normal distribution, a two-stage procedure has been proposed for constructing a fixed width confidence interval for the mean when the variance is unknown. It has all the properties ofStein's two-stage procedure, and at the same time it is “asymptotically efficient”. We have also discussed the non-normal case as inChow/Robbins [1965].
