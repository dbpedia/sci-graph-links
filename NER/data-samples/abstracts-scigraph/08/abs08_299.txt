Abstract The future 5G wireless is triggered by the higher demand on wireless capacity. With Software Defined Network (SDN), the data layer can be separated from the control layer. The development of relevant studies about Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and cloud computing has the potential of offering a quicker and more reliable network access for growing data traffic. Under such circumstances, Software Defined Mobile Network (SDMN) is presented as a promising solution for meeting the wireless data demands. This paper provides a survey of SDMN and its related security problems. As SDMN integrates cloud computing, SDN, and NFV, and works on improving network functions, performance, flexibility, energy efficiency, and scalability, it is an important component of the next generation telecommunication networks. However, the SDMN concept also raises new security concerns. We explore relevant security threats and their corresponding countermeasures with respect to the data layer, control layer, application layer, and communication protocols. We also adopt the STRIDE method to classify various security threats to better reveal them in the context of SDMN. This survey is concluded with a list of open security challenges in SDMN.
