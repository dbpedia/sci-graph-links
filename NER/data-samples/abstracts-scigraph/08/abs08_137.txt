Abstract Over the past two decades, chaos-based encryption appeared as an original application for nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos to encrypt and decrypt data. In this paper, an implementation of digital image encryption scheme based on the Lorenz chaotic system is proposed. While in the process of generating chaotic key stream, the hash value of the plain image is embedded in the proposed cryptosystem to dynamically alter the initial secret keys to increase the security level. The proposed digital image encryption algorithm is described in detail along with its security analysis and implementation. The experimental results show that the proposed digital image encryption algorithm is efficient and has high security features and is suitable for practical uses across insecure networks.
