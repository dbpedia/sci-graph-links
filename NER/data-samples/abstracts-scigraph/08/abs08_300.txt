Abstract In the framework of Kolmogorovâ€™s algorithmic approach to the substantiation of probability and information theories, the stability property of asymptotic laws of ergodic theory and universal compression schemes under minor violations of algorithmic randomness is studied. Examples of unstable laws are given.
