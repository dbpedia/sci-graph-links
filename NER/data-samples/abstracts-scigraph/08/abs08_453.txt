Abstract As the basis of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor networks have materialized its computation and communication capability into anything in our modern lives. Service composition provides us a promising way to cooperate various sensors to build more powerful IoT applications over sensor networks. However, the limited capability of sensor node poses great challenges not only to trustworthy service composition but also to secure data aggregation. The complex composite structure, computation-intensive evaluation, and massive data transmission become burdens for service composition in sensor networks. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a distributed approach to enable efficient trustworthy service composition with secure data transmission in sensor networks. By analyzing dependency relationships, the rules for computing service trust and data trust are proposed based a multi-level trust model. Then, each target component service can be evaluated independently through a model checker. Moreover, an identity-based aggregate signature is introduced in the composite evaluation to guarantee the secure data transmission among different components. The experimental results show that our approach not only achieves efficient trustworthy service composition with complex invocation structures, but also reduces the costs in the secure data transmission.
