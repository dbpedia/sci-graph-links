Abstract This paper presents a high performance Network Security Processor (NSP) system architecture implementation intended for both Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol acceleration, which are widely employed in Virtual Private Network (VPN) and e-commerce applications. The efficient data transfer skeleton and optimized integration scheme of the parallel crypto engine arrays lead to a Gbps rate NSP, which is programmable with domain specific descriptor-based instructions for Gbps throughput IPSec and SSL applications. The descriptor-based control flow fragments large data packets and distributes them to the parallel crypto engine arrays, which fully utilizes the computation resources and improves the overall system data throughput. A prototyping platform for this NSP design is implemented with Xilinx XC3S5000 based FPGA chip set. Results show that the design gives a peak throughput for the IPSec ESP tunnel mode of 1.851 Gbps with over 1600 full SSL handshakes per second at a clock rate of 150 MHz.
