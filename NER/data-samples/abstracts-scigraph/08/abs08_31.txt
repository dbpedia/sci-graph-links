Abstract In his classical article[3], J. Kiefer introduced the Fibonacci search as a direct optimal method. The optimality was proved under the restriction: the total number of tests is given in advance and fixed. To avoid this restriction, some different concepts of optimality were proposed and some corresponding optimal methods were obtained in [1], [2], [5] and [6]. In particular, the even-block search was treated in [1]. This paper deals with the odd-block search. The main result is Theorem 1.15.
