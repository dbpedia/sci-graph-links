Abstract In this paper the forward error correction (FEC) codes useful for multimedia wireless transmissions are discussed. The class of usable codes are produced by multiple description (packet equivalence during transmission) after an initial hierarchical representation stage (joint source channel coding). The Mojette transform is used to perform the implementation. A fair comparison with other optimal codes (systematic or not) is provided.JPEG2000 images transmission under a wireless link shows possible strategies.
