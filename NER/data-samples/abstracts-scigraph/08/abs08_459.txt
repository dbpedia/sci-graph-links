Abstract Digital watermarking is the process of embedding information into a digital signal in a way that is difficult to remove. In this article a secure quantum watermarking using entanglement swapping is proposed. Here the entanglement swapping is employed to build up a hidden layer of secure message under the conventional first layer of secure information sequence. In this protocol by insuring the security of transmission of the first layer of information sequence the security of the hidden secret messages is also proved to be reliable regardless of whether the hidden channel has been detected or not.
