Abstract. Data for $D^{*\pm}(2010)$ meson electroproduction in the range $10 < Q^2 < 1350 \; {\rm GeV}^2$ has recently been presented by the ZEUS collaboration at HERA. We use these results together with previously published data for $Q^2 > 1 \; {\rm GeV}^2$ to test whether one can distinguish between different theoretical schemes for charm quark electroproduction. We find that up to the largest $Q^2$ measured, it is not possible to make such a differentiation. Then we point out the regions where differences between the various schemes arise.
