Abstract For the applied limitation of the existing threshold decryption schemes based on the (t, n) structure, an identity-based threshold decryption scheme which can be applied on the access structure is proposed through designing a special distribution algorithm of the private key shares. The generation and distribution of private key shares, the encryption, the decryption and the combination are introduced in detail. The validity and security of the scheme are proved and analyzed. Comparisons with the existing schemes show that the proposed scheme is more flexible.
