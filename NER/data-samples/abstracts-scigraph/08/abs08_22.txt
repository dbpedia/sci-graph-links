Abstract It is shown that a compression of two-electron integrals and their indices significantly improves efficiency of the conventional self-consistent field (SCF) algorithm for a solution of the Hartree-Fock equation by decrease the Fock matrix calculation time. The improvement is reached not only due to a reduction of the integral file size, but mainly because data compression reduces or even can eliminate a cache conflict in data transfer from the hard drive to the main computer memory. Thus, the conventional SCF algorithm with the data compression becomes very efficient and permits to carry out large-scale Hartree-Fock calculations. The largest Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed for RNA 433D structure from the PDB data bank with 6080 basis functions formed from 6-31G basis on a workstation with 1 GHz Alpha processor.
