Abstract It was established that the total average amount of vertebrae and rakers in the first branchial arch of the European pike-perch had a tendency to the decrease during the past century. A significant difference was for the first time registered in 7 out of 35 considered craniometrical traits with respect to the length of cranium base of the European pike-perch in the studied regions. Depending on the season, changes in the structures that perform mechanical and secretory functions, as well as in the amount of cambial cells characteristic for the Caspian Sea water area, were observed in the digestive tract.
