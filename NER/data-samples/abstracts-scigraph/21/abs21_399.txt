Abstract Rubidium solution was injected in the sapwood of a Japanese cedar cultivar in the growing period, and its radial movement in stem was traced to investigate the accumulation of alkali metals in the heartwood. Sapwood-injected Rb was detected in outer heartwood at 10 days after the treatment, and continued increasing at 20 days after. Radial movement of Rb toward heartwood was considered to occur soon after the treatment, and to decline at a certain point of the time after Rb injection ceased. However, Rb continued moving in heartwood probably by diffusion even after the cease of Rb injection. In a series of injection experiment, radial movement of injected Rb is not corresponding to the seasonality of both cambial activity and cytological changes of ray parenchyma accompanied with heartwood formation. From the results on Rb’s behavior, we conclude that accumulation of K and other alkali metals in heartwood of Japanese cedar has two steps, active transport from sapwood to outer heartwood via ray, and diffusion in heartwood, and that these processes proceed independently from both cambial activity and cytological changes of ray parenchyma.
