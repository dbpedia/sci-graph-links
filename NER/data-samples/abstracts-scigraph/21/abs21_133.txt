Abstract We analyze the history of acid rain in China over the last three decades in the light of the relationship between China and Japan. China has been aware of the problem of acid rain and has been conducting scientific research since the late 1970s. However, little effort has been put into practical countermeasures. In the early 1990s, acid rain was re-evaluated as an international environmental problem. Meanwhile, Japan became concerned about trans-boundary air pollution from China. What is important is that Japan's concern strongly influences China's acid rain policy. In the context of growing international concern for environmental problems, China has taken remarkable steps to control acid rain. In this respect, dealing with acid rain is an issue of national pride for China.
