Abstract TheB-C system with an arbitrary conformal weight by Friedan, Martinec and Shenker is formulated by using the Beltrami parametrization. The holomorphic factorization will be manifest. We quantize the system in the BRST formalism. It will be shown by an explicit calculation that the Slavnov-Taylor identity is afflicted by the holomorphic anomaly.
