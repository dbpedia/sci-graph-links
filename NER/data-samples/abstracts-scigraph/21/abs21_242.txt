Abstracts The statistical analysis of the seasonal variation of mortality in the 1960's in Japan and the Western countries reveals that the seasonal variation curve has become much flatter in the cold regions (Scandinavia, USA, Canada) and that deaths remain concentrated in winter in the comparatively warm region (Japan and the West Europe). Both types of seasonal variation have undergone chronological changes from decade to decade. In the USA the former seasonal type curve has become so flat that mortality might well be said to have been "deseasonalized", while in the other regions the concentration of deaths in the cold season has been growing more conspicuous in recent years. All this can be ascribed to the differences in the system of room heating.
