Abstract We study the problem of minimizing $${\int_{\Omega} L(x,u(x),Du(x))\,{\rm d}x}$$ over the functions $${u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)}$$ that assume given boundary values $${\phi}$$ on ∂Ω. We assume that L(x, u, Du) = F(Du) + G(x, u) and that F is convex. We prove that if $${\phi}$$ is continuous and Ω is convex, then any minimum u is continuous on the closure of Ω. When Ω is not convex, the result holds true if F(Du) = f(|Du|). Moreover, if $${\phi}$$ is Lipschitz continuous, then u is Hölder continuous.
