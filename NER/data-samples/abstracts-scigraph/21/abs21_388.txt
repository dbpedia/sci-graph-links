Abstract At the end of the seventies. The Argentine authorities decided to explore alternatives for disposing of the high-level radioactive wastes that would eventually be generated by the country's nuclear programme. This programme involves nuclear power reactors that will generate an integrated electrical energy of a fraction of a terawatt year by the end of the century (1). The country's programme also foresees the reprocessing of the spent fuel. The paper describes the basic criteria adopted by the Argentine authorities for the disposal of high-level wastes. On the basis of these criteria. a site in stable, unfractured granite was selected for detailed studies, near Gastre. Province of Chubut, out of about 200 potential sites. This site has been thoroughly investigated and its suitability has been validated. On the other hand, work has progressed on the design of the future repository.
