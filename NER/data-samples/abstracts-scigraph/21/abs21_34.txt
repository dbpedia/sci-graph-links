Abstract S. F. Gray's Natural Arrangement of British Plants (2 vols., November 1821) was for many years deliberately and unjustly neglected by British botanists on account of its idiosyncrasies, anti-Linnaean character, unorthodox nomenclature, narrow generic concepts and contemporary hostility to the supposed authorR. A. Salisbury, but is nevertheless nomenclaturally important, particularly for cryptogamic groups. This paper surveys its history, authorship, date of publication and nomenclature.
