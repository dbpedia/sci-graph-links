Abstract. Nucleon-pole contributions in the $J/\psi\rightarrow N\bar{N}\pi$, $p\bar{p}\eta$, $p\bar{p}\eta^{\prime}$ and $p\bar{p} \omega$ decays are re-studied. Different contributions due to PS-PS and PS-PV couplings in the $\pi$-N interaction and the effects of $NN\pi$ form factors are investigated in the $J/\psi\rightarrow N\bar{N}\pi$ decay channel. It is found that when the ratio of |F0|/|F M | takes a small value, without considering the $NN\pi$ form factor, the difference between PS-PS and PS-PV couplings is negligible. However, when the $NN\pi$ form factor is included, this difference is greatly enlarged. The resultant decay widths are sensitive to the form factors. As a conclusion, the nucleon-pole contribution as a background to the decay width is important in the $J/\psi\rightarrow N\bar{N}\pi$ decay and must be considered. In the $J/\psi\rightarrow N\bar{N}\eta$ and $N\bar{N}\eta'$ decays, its contribution is smaller by 0.1% with respect to the data. In the $J/\psi\rightarrow N\bar{N}\omega$ decay, it provides a rather important contribution without considering form factors. But the contribution is suppressed greatly when adding the off-shell form factors. Comparing these results with data will help us to select a proper form factor for such kind of decay.
