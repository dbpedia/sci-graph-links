Summary Isolated hepatocyte preparations from fed immature American eels,Anguilla rostrata Le Sueur, were used to study gluconeogenic, lipogenic, glycogenic and oxidative rates of radioactively labelled lactate, glycerol, alanine and aspartate. Eel hepatocytes maintain membrane integrity and energy charge during a 2 h incubation period and are considered a viable preparation for studying fish liver metabolism. Incubating eel hepatocytes with 10 mM substrates, the following results were obtained: glycerol, alanine and lactate, in that order, were effective gluconeogenic substrates; these three substrates reduced glucose release from glycogen stores, while aspartate had no such effect; lactate, alanine and aspartate led to high rates of glycerol production, with subsequent incorporation into lipid; incorporation into glycogen was low from all substrates; and, alanine oxidation was seven times higher than that observed with other substrates. When eel hepatocytes were incubated with low or physiological substrate concentrations gluconeogenic rates from lactate were twice those from alanine; rates from aspartate were very low. Glucagon stimulated lactate gluconeogenesis, but not amino acid gluconeogenesis, and had no significant effect on glycogenolysis. Cortisol increased gluconeogenic rates from 1 mM lactate. Thus, in the presence of adequate substrate, eel liver gluconeogenesis is preferentially stimulated relative to glycogenolysis to produce plasma glucose. These data support three important roles for gluconeogenesis: the recycling of muscle lactate, the synthesis of glucose from dietary amino acids to supplement glucose levels, and the production of glycerol for lipogenesis.
