Abstract In many parts of the world, brucellosis has significantly decreased, but it is still a problem in some regions of Turkey. In our laboratory we have isolated 58 Brucella spp. through BACTEC NR 730 and 30 Brucella spp. through BACTEC 9120 systems. 31 of the 58 isolates were detected by BACTEC NR 730 system in 72 hours. The majority of the growth values were between 45â€“65. BACTEC 9120 system detected all the isolates in 84 hours.
