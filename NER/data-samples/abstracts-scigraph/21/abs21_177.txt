Summary Protochlorophyllide in the pea etioplast is photoconverted to chlorophyllide without any accompanying change in the structure of the prolamellar body when phytylation is inhibited by low temperature. At room temperature, phytylation proceeds as transformation of the prolamellar body and the development of plastid lamellae takes place.
