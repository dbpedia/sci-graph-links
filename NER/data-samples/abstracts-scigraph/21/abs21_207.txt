Abstract Between the end of the 17th century and early eighteenth centuries Guarino Guarini and Gian Giacomo Plantery produced a revolution in the way vaulted systems for atria of palaces in Turin were conceived. ‘Star-shaped’ and ‘planterian’ vaults created a new trend that would persist for nearly sixty years. The wide-spread use and variety of planterian vaults has been the focus of a research project that began in 2012. This research, by comparing similar atria and their digital models, has made it possible to work on a multi-variable model aimed to represent the generic surface of any planterian vault whatsoever by using parameters, and consequently to draw the individual cases studied by associating the appropriate values to each parameter.
