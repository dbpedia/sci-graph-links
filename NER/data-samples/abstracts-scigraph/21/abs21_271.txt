Abstract Ethnomethodology’s Program, published in 2002, presents Garfinkel’s most recent statements on ethnomethodology and its central concerns, assumptions and procedures. This article reflects on biographical influences that have shaped Garfinkel’s thinking, differences between this work and his earlier statements of ethnomethodology, the deliberate elusiveness of his writings, the connections between ethnomethodology and classical sociology, and under-appreciated parallels between ethnomethodogy and current critiques of rationalization and modernity.
