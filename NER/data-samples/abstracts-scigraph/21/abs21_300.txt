Summary The investigation of K-feldspar phenocrysts of the Třebíč-Meziřičí Massif revealed the existence of two areas differing in the ordering state of K-feldspars. In the northern area the K-feldspars display disordered monoclinic structures, in the southern, heterogeneous triclinic structures. The distribution of K-feldspar crystals showing different triclinicity degrees suggests the disordered monoclinic structures to be primary. Only in a later period did the structures of some crystals become ordered, but in an amount and to a degree differing from locality to locality. The areas under consideration adjoin along a sharp straight line coinciding with a fault. By movements taking place along this fault two durbachite blocks, each with a different physical-chemical history of consolidation, came into contact.
