Abstract The Itai-Itai disease case is one of four major pollution-related lawsuits occurring in Japan after World War II. This paper, which is based on investigations of the pollution source, the Kamioka mine, considers (1) the history of the disturbances to the environment caused by the Kamioka mine; (2) the Itai-Itai disease suit; (3) the pollution-prevention measures and methods of the Kamioka mine and refinery; (4) the reduction of cadmium pollution in the Jinzu River; and (5) the actual application of the “polluter pays principle”. The authors conclude that the court decision and the agreements between the victims and Mitsui Mining made it possible to control and reduce the damage caused by cadmium pollution and four additional, contributory factors.
