Abstract We analyse the restrictions imposed by supersymmetric Ward identities on the dimension-six condensates in supersymmetric gluodynamics. It is shown that the system of the Ward identities admits a nonzero value for the four-fermion condensate $$\left\langle {\left( {\lambda \sigma _\mu T^a \bar \lambda } \right)^2 } \right\rangle _0 $$ while 〈f abc FμνaFνρbFρμc〉0 must vanish.
