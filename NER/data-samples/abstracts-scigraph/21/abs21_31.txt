Summary The frequency of several immunoglobulin allotypes has been evaluated in a sample of 419 Portuguese subjects. It was found that the percentage of Gm(1) and of Gm(2) are among the highest in Europe, although Portugal is situated in the extreme southwest of Europe. A few cases of dissociation of Gm(1) and Gm(21) were noted and attributed to the probable presence of African admixture.
