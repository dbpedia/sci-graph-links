Summary Glyoxalase polymorphism has been studied in 7296 persons from populations in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Oceania, Iran, and Colombia. The GLO1 frequencies are very low in most of Oceania, including Australia, somewhat higher in Southeast Asia, and intermediate though variable in India. In Iran the GLO1 frequency is similar to that in Europe. The value for the single amerindian group in Colombia is nearly 30%.
