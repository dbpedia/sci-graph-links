Abstract I intend to demonstrate the existence of a global literature that, like all other goods, has been assimilated into a global marketplace, whose anglo-american hegemony ensures the exclusive use of the English language. However, literature from many diverse worlds are contributing to the resistance and opposition to this hegemonic force. These worlds comprise what the French call « diversité culturelle », which refers to both the plurality and diversity of languages as well as of literature and arts, and contrasts with the logic of the global marketplace. I also intend to demonstrate how this situation has been generated by different processes of decolonization from « imperialistic » European literature.
