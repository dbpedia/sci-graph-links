Abstract In this paper, we study the injectivity and graded injectivity of modules. Injective testing sets of semiprime Noetherian rings and FBN rings are Particularly investigated. For commutative Artinian Z-graded rings, we prove that gr-injectivity implies injectivity and hence show that the gr-global dimesion and global dimesion are the same.
