Abstract Mesenteric cyst is relatively rare, and its diagnosis is difficult. We carried out an ultrasound examination on a 6-year-old boy who showed intestinal obstruction. This examination revealed an abdominal mass, and he was diagnosed as mesenteric cyst. Later it was confirmed by operation. The histopathological examination revealed that it was a lymphangioma. A review was also carried out on 288 cases of mesenteric cyst in Japan.
