Abstract In this paper, different Precambrian series of Hesperic Massif have been described, using some data taken from different bibliography and unpublished data by the authors. The relation among them have been discussed and also their problems stated. These Precambrian series are forming the anticlinorium nuclei of hercynian structure. The incomplete understanding of these series, as well as their occurrence in distant and isolated outcrops, give place to doubtful interpretations when traying to establish the stratigraphical sequence and he correlation among the different series. The discussion implied from the global study of these problems permit us, provisionally, to establish a general stratigraphy and a possible correlation among different units. All these series constitue an Upper Precambrian; within it three groups have been differentiated: lower group consisting of basic and ultrabasic complexes; intermediate group with a very important acid volcanism and derivated rocks, and finally upper group where pelitic schists and greywackes prevail.
