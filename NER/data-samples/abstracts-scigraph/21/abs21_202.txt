Summary In this paper the so-called extention of the Azores' anticyclone towards the Balkans and Greece is studied by means of the synoptic evolution of mean charts for m.s.l., thickness, 500 mb and their anomalies. The period under consideration is the twelve years from 1961 through 1972 for the two month interval July-August, which is the main season of the occurrence of the Etesian winds over the eastern Greek seas having their existing in the combination of the Balkans high pressure and the permanent low pressure system over the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The synoptic evolution of the above mentioned charts proved that the mobile anticyclones or the wedges of the Greek area, seemingly form one common system with the Azores' anticyclone but their generating factors are different from these of the Azores' permanent anticyclone which implies that the term “extension” should not be used.
