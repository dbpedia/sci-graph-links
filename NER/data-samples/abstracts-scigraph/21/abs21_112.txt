Abstract Four out of 8 Limousin × Creole (Li × Cr) and 4 out of 8 Creole growing bulls were exposed to full sunshine in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), the others being kept under shade. Sweating rate (measured on the back with capsules filled with a dessicator), rectal temperature and respiratory rhythm were measured between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., as well as climatic environmental data. Rectal temperature of Creole bulls (overall mean: 38.8‡C) remains unaffected by black globe temperature (TG), while, for Li × Cr bulls, it is well related to TG, reaching 39.5‡C when TG=39‡C; at this moment, Li × Cr respiratory rhythm reaches 100 breaths/min, compared with only 70 for Creole animals. The “shade” mean levels of these two parameters for each genotype are consistently the same (38.7‡C and 39 breaths/min). Under full sunshine, mean sweat rate is almost the same for the 2 genotypes; under shelter, the crossbred bulls sweat more than the Creole bulls, both shade means being significantly lower than means in the “sun”. Probably, when shaded, the Li × Cr animals must sweat more to balance a greater heat production, but their maximum sweat ability is not very different than the one of Creole bulls.
