Abstract The history of research into gastrointestinal mucositis (GIM), and how the future directions are informed by the progress made in the study of oral mucositis (OM) are discussed. It is proposed that OM and GIM should both be considered to be elements of alimentary mucositis (AM), which covers mucosal damage through the entire alimentary tract, with regional differences being due to the specialized needs of each area.
