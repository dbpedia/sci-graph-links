Abstract Object of the study are such texts of middle-high-German and old-French literature that bring to notice the perception of beauty and the origin of love by means of the mirror experience: the romance of Cliges by Chretien de Troyes, the old French lai of Narcissus, the Narcissus episode of the romance of the Rose by Guillaume de Lorris, and the mirror song by Heinrich von Morungen (MF XVIII, 145). Here, my inquiry is guided by Ovid’s version of the Narcissus myth and Plato’s theory on the mirror character of reciprocal love. Although medieval versions of the theme tend to depict narcissism as love unrequitted, there are also depictions of fulfilled love, imagined as an encounter with oneself s beautiful image. Narcissism is ambivalent also as a model of self-reflection, since the person may either enjoy his mirrored self or experience himself as unhappy consciousness.
