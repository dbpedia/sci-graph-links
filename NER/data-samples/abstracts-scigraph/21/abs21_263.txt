Abstract history dependent forming limits of sheet metals are computed by examining the role of rate sensitivity of flow stress in forming limits for anisotropic materials. Assuming that necking or nonuniform deformation is caused by initial heterogeneity, the forming limits are computed by considering the flow theory and incorporating an isotropic hardening model for anisotropic materials. Representative results show some of the trends for changing forming limits with different parameters under complex nonproportional loading histories. The computed results agree well with published experimental data for different loading history, anisotropy, and rate sensitivity of sheet materials.
