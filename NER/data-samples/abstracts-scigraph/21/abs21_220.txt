Abstract A 3-year-old female Holstein cow was referred for necropsy examination with the history of inappetence, progressive indigestion, distension of the rumen and death. At necropsy examination, a lobulated grey-white mass (12 × 8 × 5 cm) was found close to the reticulo-omasal orifice. On sectioning, the tumour mass was gelatinous with intervening fibrous septa. Microscopical examination revealed unencapsulated mass composed of various cellular parts and matrices. There were proliferated spindle shaped fibrocytes producing repetitive collagenous fibres. There were also foci of low cellularity containing stellate cells with small and hyperchromatic nuclei arranged in a mucinous ground substance. On the basis of the gross and histopathological findings and histochemical stainings, the tumour was diagnosed as a fibromyxoma. This tumour has not been recorded previously in the reticulo-omasal orifice of a cow.
