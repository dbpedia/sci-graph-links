Abstract We review several Japanese reports regarding pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD), including our previous survey of a totll of 313 patients who had undergone PPPD as of September, 1989 at 82 major medical facilities. PPPD in Japan was initially performed in 1981 in a patient with leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas. Because of extensive growth of the tumor, right hemicolectomy was also performed and the alimentary tract was reconstructed in the new Billroth I procedure. Many reports have since indicated that PPPD yields favorable results. The patient characteristics ranged widely, from benign diseases to malignancies, including cancer of the pancreas. The use ofPPPD is how increasing both in Japan and in the United States and Europe. The operative techniques, reconstruction methods, morbidity, mortality, survival, and pathophysiology of PPPD in Japan are reviewed in comparison with these factors in the Whipple resection.
