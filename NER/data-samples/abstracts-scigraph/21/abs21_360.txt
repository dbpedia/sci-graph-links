Abstract Professor George Feher, born in Bratislava, Slovakia, left his country at the age of 17 in 1941. Since 1946 he has been living in USA. I met him in Jerusalem in September 1995. During one week we would sit together at breakfast time at the Hebrew University guesthouse. This week and many discussions with G. Feher were fascinating for me. Further we continued in our contacts, we exchanged letters, papers, essays. This way an idea to introduce George Feher to his former countrymen was born. Professor Feher as an experienced researcher in physics and biophysics, as a personality who met with William Shockley, Edward Teller and many other famous scientists, and moreover, as a personality collecting scientific humor and jokes, attracted the interest of Slovak scientific community. His life may be an inspiration especially for young people looking for examples of a true scientific career.
