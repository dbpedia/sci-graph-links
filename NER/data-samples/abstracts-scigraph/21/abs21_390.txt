Abstract A favorite book of Julia, age three, wasThe Little Engine That Could. When her teacher asked her if she could eat nicely with the class next door, she replied, “I think I can, I think I can.” As Jenny tramped across a bridge on a bike, she called to her mom, “Hey, mom, trip trap trip trap; I hope there's no ugly troll down there.” One of her favorite bedtime stories at age four was “The Three Billy Goats Gruff.”
