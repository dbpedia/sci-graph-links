Abstract Huge changes are taking place in international diplomacy which have created an opening and a certain appreciation for the contributions that can be made by private citizens to international peacemaking. This article provides a snapshot of diplomatic thinking about Track II/nonofficial diplomacy, from interviews with distinguished American diplomats. As thoughts of two-way collaboration develop, it becomes increasingly important to be clear about the limits and potentially unique contributions of Track II. Open respectful dialogue between Tracks I and II is also necessary to overcome past resentments and to develop mechanisms by which the skills and insights of Track II can be fed into Track I, with greater effectiveness and integrity.
