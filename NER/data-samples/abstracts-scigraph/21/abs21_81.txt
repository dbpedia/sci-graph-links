Abstract Earlier this month the American Physical Society organised a meeting in Washington to discuss international collaboration, and possibly the formation of a world-wide physics council. Before the meeting DÃ©nes Nagy, Secretary General of the Hungarian Physical Society, requested a statement of present concerns from Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, by writing to CEE Physical Societies. The replies formed the basis of a presentation at the meeting in Washington given by Denis Weaire, the President of EPS. Here, Europhysics News publishes the most interesting replies.
