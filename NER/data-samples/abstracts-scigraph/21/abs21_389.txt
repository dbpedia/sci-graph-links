Abstract. A case of necrotizing esophagitis discovered during upper endoscopy is described. An 88-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of multiple episodes of coffee ground emesis and dysphagia over 3 months. Ischemia is proposed as the etiology of necrotizing esophagitis on the basis of the patient's significant cardiac history, her age, and low-flow state.
