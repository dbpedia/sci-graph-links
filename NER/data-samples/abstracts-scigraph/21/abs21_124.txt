Abstract V. Golyshev conjectured that for any smooth polytope P with dim(P)≤5 the roots z∈ℂ of the Ehrhart polynomial for P have real part equal to −1/2. An elementary proof is given, and in each dimension the roots are described explicitly. We also present examples which demonstrate that this result cannot be extended to dimension six.
