Abstract This article proposes the use of limit cycle theory and velocity history as effective tools for analyzing the behavior of members of an organized network. Specifically, the limit cycle and velocity history of firms in the Kansai Yokokai, one of the three major groups of suppliers that constitute Mazdaâ€™s keiretsu, are examined using a new analytical approach. Based on the data obtained, the organizational behavior of the suppliers is subsumed into four categorical patterns, each of which is related to the limit cycle and velocity history. The research implications, as well as the weakness of the limit cycle, are also discussed.
