Abstract The aim of the paper is to describe one-parameter groups of formal power series, that is to find a general form of all homomorphisms $${\Theta_G : G \to \Gamma}$$ ΘG:G→Γ , $${\Theta_G(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} c_k(t)X^k}$$ ΘG(t)=∑k=1∞ck(t)Xk , $${c_1 : G \to \mathbb{K} \setminus\{0\}}$$ c1:G→K\{0} , $${c_k : G \to \mathbb{K}}$$ ck:G→K for k ≥ 2, from a commutative group (G, + ) into the group $${(\Gamma, \circ)}$$ (Γ,∘) of invertible formal power series with coefficients in $${\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}}$$ K∈{R,C} . Considering one-parameter groups of formal power series and one-parameter groups of truncated formal power series, we give explicit formulas for the coefficient functions c k with more details in the case where either c 1 = 1 or c 1 takes infinitely many values. Here we give the results much more simply than they were presented in Jabłoński and Reich (Abh. Math. Sem. Univ. Hamburg 75:179–201, 2005; Result Math 47:61–68, 2005; Publ Math Debrecen 73(1–2):25–47, 2008). Also the case im c 1 = E m (here E m stands for the group of all complex roots of order m of 1), not considered in Jabłoński and Reich (Abh. Math. Sem. Univ. Hamburg 75:179–201, 2005; Result Math 47:61–68, 2005; Publ Math Debrecen 73(1–2):25–47, 2008), will be discussed.
