Abstract A new species of digenean, Echinodollfusia longiuscula n. sp. (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae), is described and illustrated based on specimens collected from the intestine of the white stork Ciconia ciconia (L.) (Aves: Ciconiidae) from eastern Slovakia and dissected soon after its spring arrival from African wintering. The new species differs from the two existing congeners Echinodollfusia stenon (Dollfus, 1950) and Echinodollfusia bulgarica Vassilev (Sofia 6:327–338, 1958) clearly by the oesophagus bearing diverticula, the bipartite seminal vesicle and gonads situated entirely in anterior body half. The new species E. longiuscula n. sp. can also be distinguished by possessing the following combination of features: a slender body of 12.85–21.06-mm long and maximum of 581–855-μm wide; head collar with 43–47 small collar spines, dorsal in double row; oral sucker more than half the size as ventral sucker, small pharynx, oval and in tandem testes situated pre-equatorial, small ovary at the boundary of anterior third of the body and anteriormost extent of the vitelline fields just reaching the level of posterior margin of the ventral sucker. An amended generic diagnosis of little-known Echinodollfusia Skrjabin et Bashkirova (Osnovy Trematodologii 12:51–930, 1956) is also given here.
