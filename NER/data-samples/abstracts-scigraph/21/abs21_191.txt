Abstract It is well known that arthritis can be associated with venereal disease. Nowadays septic arthritis and reactive arthritis (usually classified as Reiter's syndrome) are distinguished. To place current knowledge within its historical context we reviewed the medical literature on sexually acquired arthritis in the nineteenth century and examined the medical records of London teaching hospitals from this period. We used original sources of rheumatological literature at major London libraries, including the Heberden library of the Royal College of Physicians, and visited the archives at three London teaching hospitals to review original case records and examine diagnostic registers. The first clear description of arthritis associated with venereal disease was given by Swediaur (1798/1809) in French. It became relatively common in London from 1820 onwards with 13 cases described in the literature between 1818 and 1836. It accounts for 3% of admissions at University College and St Bartholomew's Hospitals between 1835 and 1839 and also 3% of admissions at the London Hospital from 1895 to 1900. In the 50 years after Swediaur's report, arthritis associated with venereal disease seemed quite common. This may have been related to the industrial revolution or other social diseases. Historical observations suggest its evidence may vary considerably with time.
