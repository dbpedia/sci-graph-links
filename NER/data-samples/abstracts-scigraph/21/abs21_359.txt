Abstract Based on the selenothermsT(z) (= temperature-depth functions) and melting point-depth functionsT m(z) viscosity valuesη(z) are calculated. According to two different creep laws used, two sets of viscosity values are obtained. Viscosities in the outer part of the Moon are found to be larger than those anywhere on Earth. These high values ofη explain the large elasticityQ found in lunar seismograms. Viscosities below about 500 km in depth are so small that, at present, some kind of convection or a flow of matter is possible. Tidegenerated moonquakes at depths of around 1000 km seem to be connected with some viscous process. From considerations of viscosities at the time period of mare filling, some selection of ancient selenotherms may be performed.
