Abstract The present in vitro study shows the efficacy of two antimite products (ByeMite® = phoxim, Mite-Stop® = neem seed extract) against all developing stages of the important red chicken mite Dermanyssus gallinae (obtained at two farms in France and Germany). While permanent contact with the active compound led to an efficacy of 100% in the case of Mite-Stop® on mites in both farms, there was only a 96.2% killing effect of ByeMite® on the mites of the French farm. Even short contacts of only 4 s killed 100% of mites in the case of Mite-Stop® at the French farm and only 84.5% in the German farm. ByeMite®, on the other hand, killed only 27.8% (Germany) and 30% (France) when mites got the chance to escape from the treated grounds to untreated ones. When using only the half doses of both products, Mite-Stop® still reached, after permanent contact, 100% activity on the German farm and 98.2% in France, while ByeMite® killed 93.8% (Germany) and 90.6% (France). Short contact to half doses of course reduced the activity of both products (Mite-Stop® = 59.3% in France, 22.1% in Germany; ByeMite® = 28.8% in France, 18.8% in Germany). With respect to the fumigant activity of the products, the strains of D. gallinae reacted differently. While Mite-Stop® showed a clear fumigant activity in the case of the German mites, this product did not affect the French mites by air distribution, neither did ByeMite® in both cases. Therefore, mites have to come in contact with both products. Against Mite-Stop®, there was apparently no resistance and low doses have high efficacy after even short contacts, which regularly occur in a treated stable, where mites have the chance to leave treated places to untreated hidden spots.
