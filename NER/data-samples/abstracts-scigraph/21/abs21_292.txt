Chemistry and History In this section we present articles by leading scientific historians that chronicle the important events, persons, and publications that make up the rich history of chemical science. The history of chemistry, of course, has taken place against the background of world history, and the articles in this section often make that very clear. Chemists and their research are always influenced by current events. These articles are intended to describe the setting in which important discoveries occurred and to humanize their discoverers. â€”Clifford LeMaster, Editor in Chief
