Abstract We study CP asymmetries in rare B decays within supersymmetry with a U(2)3 flavour symmetry, motivated by the SUSY flavour and CP problems, the hierarchies in the Yukawa couplings and the absence so far of any direct evidence for SUSY. Even in the absence of flavour-blind phases, we find potentially sizable CP violating contributions to b→s decay amplitudes. The effects in the mixing-induced CP asymmetries in B→ϕK S and B→η′K S , angular CP asymmetries in B→K ∗ μ + μ − and the direct CP asymmetry in B→X s γ can be in the region to be probed by LHCb and next generation B factories. At the same time, these effects in B decays are compatible with CP violating contributions to meson mixing, including a non-standard B s mixing phase hinted by current tensions in the CKM fit mostly between $S_{\psi K_{S}}, \epsilon_{K}$ and $\Delta M_{B_{s}}/\Delta M_{B_{d}}$.
