Abstract. We investigate the twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the scalar mesons a0, $ K^{\ast}_{0}$ and f0 within the QCD sum rules. The QCD sum rules are improved by a consistent treatment of the sizable s -quark mass effects within the framework of the background field approach. Adopting the valence quark component $ (\bar{q}_{1} q_{2})$ as the dominant structure of the scalar mesons, our estimation for their masses is close to the measured $ a_{0}(1450)$ , $ K^{\ast}_{0}(1430)$ and $ f_{0}(1710)$ . From the sum rules, we obtain the first two non-zero moments of the twist-3 LCDAs $ \phi^{s,\sigma}_{a_{0}}$ : $ \langle \xi_{s,a_0}^{2(4)}\rangle=0.369\;(0.245)$ and $ \langle \xi_{\sigma,a_{0}}^{2(4)}\rangle=0.203 \;(0.093)$ ; those of the twist-3 LCDAs $ \phi_{K^{\ast}_{0}}^{s,\sigma}$ : $ \langle \xi_{s,K^{\ast}_{0}}^{1(2)}\rangle=0.004\;(0.355)$ and $ \langle \xi_{\sigma,K^{\ast}_{0}}^{1(2)}\rangle =0.018\;(0.207)$ ; and those of the twist-3 LCDAs $ \phi_{f_{0}}^{s,\sigma}$ : $ \langle \xi_{s,f_{0}}^{2(4)}\rangle=0.335\;(0.212)$ and $ \langle \xi_{\sigma,f_{0}}^{2(4)}\rangle=0.196\;(0.088)$ , respectively. As an application of those twist-3 LCDAs, we study the $ B\rightarrow S$ transition form factors by introducing proper chiral currents into the correlator, which is constructed such that the twist-3 LCDAs give dominant contribution and the twist-2 LCDAs make negligible contribution. Our results of the $ B\rightarrow S$ transition form factors at the large recoil region $ q^{2}\simeq 0$ are consistent with those obtained in the literature, which inversely shows the present twist-3 LCDAs are acceptable.
