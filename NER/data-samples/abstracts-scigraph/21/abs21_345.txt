Abstract Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682–1771) is considered the father of neuropathology and one of the most important innovators in the history of medicine. In his “opus magnum” De sedibus et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis (The Seats and causes of diseases investigated by anatomy), he established pathological anatomy as a science by correlating clinical histories with autopsy findings.
