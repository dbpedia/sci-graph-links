Abstract The primary purpose of this research is to improve Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) which is built on cybernetic principles and tools and aims to design adaptive, responsive and goal-seeking organisations possessing all features of viability. Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of VSM, this research proposes to enhance the model by using it in combination with Topp’s Knowledge System Diagnostics (KSD) which tries to uncover an organisation’s rules of formation making possible the creation and maintenance of knowledge within an organisation. It is thought that, equipped with this information, an adaptive application of VSM with KSD might cure unhealthy managerial practice—a lack of employee involvement in decision making and responsibility and authority sharing—observed both in a textile manufacturer and VSM. Methodological implications of this version of multimethodology are discussed, and then research site issues are revealed and recommendations are made.
