Abstract Regional and national development policies play an important role to support local enterprises in Italy. The amount of financial aid may be a key feature for firmsâ€™ employment policies. We study the impact on employment of the amount of financial aid attributed to enterprises located in Piedmont, a region in northern Italy, analysing small-sized firms and medium- or large-sized firms separately. We apply generalized propensity score methods under the unconfoundedness assumption that adjusting for differences in a set of observed pre-treatment variables removes all biases in comparisons by different amounts of financial aid. We find that the estimated effects are increasing with amount of financial aid for both small-sized and medium- or large-sized firms, whereas the marginal effects of additional incentives are decreasing with amount of financial aid for small-sized firms, and have an inverse J-shape for medium- or large-sized firms.
