Abstract In having a group of university students applying Team Syntegrity, an assessment is obtained. In so doing, the methodology is proven to be an excellent means for organising effective co-operative work and for having a group of people making the best possible use of its members' joint capacity. Besides its synergetic effects, Team Syntegrity is easy and straightforward to grasp, learn, and apply. Further, the participants turn out to be very satisfied with the procedures and activities of the methodology. Team Syntegrity is also very robust and it is possible to make modifications according to the actual situation. Team Syntegrity can still be improved and developed, for example, by more intensive use of information technology, and its application area can be considerably enlarged.
