Abstract The aim of this paper is to prove the following extension of the Folkman-Rado-Sanders Finite Union Theorem: For every positive integersr andk there exists a familyL of sets having the following properties:i)ifS 1,S 2, ...,S k + 1 are distinct pariwise disjoint elements ofL then there exists nonemptyI ⊂ {1, 2, ...,k + 1} with ∪ i∈I S i ⋃L ii)ifL =L 1 ⋃...⋃L r is an arbitrary partition then there existsj ≤ r and pairwise disjoint setsS 1,S 2, ...,S k ∈L j , such thatL i∈I S i ∈L j for every nonemptyI ⊂ {1, 2, ...,k}.
