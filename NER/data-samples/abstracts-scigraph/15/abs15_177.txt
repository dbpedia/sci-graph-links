Abstract The performance appraisal is a relevant process to keep and improve the competitiveness of companies in nowadays. In spite of this relevance, the current performance appraisal models are not sufficiently well-defined either designed for the evaluation framework in which they are defined. This paper proposes a performance appraisal model where the assessments are modelled by means of linguistic information provided by different sets of reviewers in order to manage the uncertainty and subjectivity of such assessments. Therefore, the reviewers could express their assessments in different linguistic scales according to their knowledge about the evaluated employees, defining a multi-granular linguistic evaluation framework. Additionally, the proposed model will manage the multi-granular linguistic labels provided by appraisers in order to compute collective assessments about the employees that will be used by the management team to make the final decision about them.
