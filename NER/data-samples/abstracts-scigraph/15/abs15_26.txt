Abstract Trademarks mark new product varieties. Trademarks may become associated with a favorable public recognition and evaluation that sustains the advantages from a horizontally differentiated market position. A favorable public assessment appears more important for firms in service sectors where production exhibits usually more experience characteristics than in manufacturing and for firms with vertically-differentiating product innovation. Using data from the 2011 German innovation survey, we find that for firms in service sectors, the use of trademarks increases the probability that the firmâ€™s products and services are not easily substitutable by rival ones. This product-differentiating effect of trademarks in services is present for firms with new-to-the-market product innovation but not for firms without product innovation. This suggests that trademarks supplement the appropriation of product innovation rents in services. The number of trademarks exhibits a product-differentiating effect for service sector firms with imitative new-to-the-firm product innovation, which suggests differentiation due to proliferating product variants. Regarding firms in manufacturing sectors, trademarks do not show a conclusive product-differentiating effect.
