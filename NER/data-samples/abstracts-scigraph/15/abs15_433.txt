Abstract As an increasing number of corporations, both in Europe and the United States, establish consumer affairs departments, it becomes important to define the role of these new organizational units in the relationship between consumers and business firms. The consumer affairs department provides the consumer with an opportunity to make his voice heard in management decision making, and business firms with an opportunity to develop a better understanding of consumer concerns. This paper aims at laying a first foundation for the understanding of the consumer affairs function within profit-seeking organizations that operate in essentially market-directed economies. Using a communications approach, it is attempted to show that the consumer affairs department can, if properly integrated within the corporate decision making structure, perform a valuable function as a consumer communications channel.
