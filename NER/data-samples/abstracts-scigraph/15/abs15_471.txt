Abstract In this study, we establish how marketing can play a significant role in extracting value from the crucial management construct—employee engagement (EE). To do so, first, we discuss the construct of EE through a detailed review of the relevant literature and the insights gleaned from our interviews with managers from across five continents. Second, we provide a formal definition for EE, develop scales for measuring EE, and then argue how enhancing EE can improve firm performance. After refining the measurement scales, we collect data from two countries and analyze the process of EE by conducting a path analysis and validating the findings from the popular press articles. This research provides guidance to managers on measuring and managing the different factors that drive employee engagement, thereby generating a blueprint for enhancing the firm’s service delivery, customer satisfaction, and resultant firm performance.
