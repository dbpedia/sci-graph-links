Abstract The concept of metrology first appeared in Tunisia towards 1909. At the end of the 1990s, bodies for evaluating conformity of measurement at different levels have been instituted to meet calibration and testing needs of the national industry. These bodies were divided into three categories: Class A where we find mainly the Central Laboratory for Analysis and Testing LCAE and the National Defence Laboratory DEFNAT; these two laboratories are in charge of the technological upgrading of the other bodies of Class B which, in turn, would transfer their knowledge to the industries, the latter constituting Class C. Nowadays, the accreditation of Tunisian laboratories at the international level by recognized reference foreign bodies and participation in the European proficiency network enabled the national laboratories of Tunisia to establish the degree of equivalence between their measurement results and those of other foreign laboratories.
