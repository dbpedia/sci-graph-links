Summary The back titration procedure making use of mercuric nitrate as back titrant for excess EDTA in alkaline media, has been successfully applied for the determination of small amounts of scandium or palladium in the order of 0.045 to 7 or 0.1 to 4mg, respectively. Simple procedures are given for the analysis of binary or ternary mixtures of scandium or palladium with some other metals, yielding results of quite reasonable accuracy.
