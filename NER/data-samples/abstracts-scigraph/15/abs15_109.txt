Abstract This paper presents the fabrication and performance characterization of miniature axial fans that are developed using 2D blade profiles. 12 prototypes, with an outer diameter of 5 mm, having different blade angles and blade profiles were fabricated using UV photolithography with SU-8 as photoresist. Tests were conducted at 3 different speeds to examine the applicability of similarity laws. The results show that cambered profiles generated much higher pressure and flow rate as compared to a flat plate profile. For flat plate profiles, a maximum pressure of 0.55 Pa and a flow rate of 9.9 cm3/s are generated with a blade angle of 42° when the fan is operating at 20,000 rpm. This is much lower than that obtained by cambered profiles where a maximum pressure of 1.15 Pa and a flow rate of 14.6 cm3/s are generated with a blade angle of 60°. The effects of increasing blade number and blade angle have a positive effect on the flow rate delivered and pressure generated but the effects of increasing blade number is more effective in enhancing fan performance. The results also show that dynamic similarity is observed for rotational speeds of 15,000 and 20,000 rpm.
