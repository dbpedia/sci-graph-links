Abstract A reacquisition is an interesting case in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) research, because it may constitute the second of two contradictory events, the first being the initial divestiture. The current understanding of reacquisitions is limited, even though research has shown them to be relevant. This study examines 14Â cases of reacquisitions to determine their motivations and their influence on the firms involved. We identify four different clusters of reacquisitions, each with different motivations and implications for the participating firms, indicating the importance of fine-grained analyses when evaluating these events. This study contributes to research on reacquisitions, the interrelation between transactions, and corporate venturing.
