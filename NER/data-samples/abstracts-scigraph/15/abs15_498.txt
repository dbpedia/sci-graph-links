Abstract This paper examines the economic role of small business in Japan in the classic model of subcontracting vis-Ã -vis the novel model of networking. The Japanese economy can be characterized by an extensive system of subcontracting. There is an intensively elaborated point of focus on this Japanese approach to the technological and managerial aspects of subcontracting outside of Japan. Small and medium sized enterprises and big enterprises, in their endeavour to be effective and efficient, determine the characteristics of this system of industrial production. The characteristics of the subcontracting system in Japan are undergoing structural changes. The requirements concerning an accelerating technological expertise and marketing know-how of subcontracting firms will be adduced as a motive for the rapid industrial restructuring.
