Abstract Studies of heritage at all levels of education can help foster understanding of other peoples and cultures and of the environmental issues facing us all. Used judicially, such studies have a highly positive role to play in educating people everywhere to contribute to making the world a sustainable and just environment for future generations. They provide examples or case studies, in the pedagogical sense used by educationalists, that illustrate many valuable points that are central to a sound values education contributing to ensuring that the public, and hopefully the political elite, are engaged in a push for such a just and sustainable future. Individual examples of heritage sites, and especially of World Heritage properties, contain valuable lessons of great pedagogical value.
