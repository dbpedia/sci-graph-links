The exterior design of existing preschool environments is evaluated in the context of contemporary writings by architects focusing on creating designs that nurture children’s emotions. Sense of place research is discussed in relation to young children’s experiences. Findings reveal that the majority of sites included in the study incorporated many physical design elements that create a sense of place for children in preschool environments, including small-scale structures, windows, landscaping, natural wall materials, and thresholds. Recommendations for administrators and directors planning and designing a new or remodeled preschool environment include incorporating features that reflect home-like environments with windows, thresholds, and landscaping.
