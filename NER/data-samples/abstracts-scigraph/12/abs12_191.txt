Abstract Only limited documentation of non-allergenic, especially toxic reactions after inhalation of microfungal spores in water damaged buildings exists. Recently attention has been drawn to the mycotoxins as causal compounds, as some the dominating genera found in buildings are well known mycotoxin producers.Penicillium chrysogenum and A. ustus do not seem to produce any known mycotoxins when growing on building materials, whereasP. brevicompactum produces mycophenolic acid, someP. polonicum produces verrucosidin and verrucofortine,A. versicolor produces sterigmatocystins,A. niger produces nigragillin, orlandin, naphtho-γ-pyrones and tetracyclic compounds, someA. ochraceus produces ochratoxin A,Alternaria spp. produce alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether,Chaetomium globosum produce chaetoglobosins, and finally 30–40% ofStachybotrys chartarum isolates from buildings produce macrocyclic trichothecenes and a number of other biologically active compounds.
