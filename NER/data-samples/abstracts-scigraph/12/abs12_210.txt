Abstract The conservation and enhancement of our cultural heritage (CH) require an exhaustive study in terms of position, shape, colour, geometry and also of the historical and artistic features. Survey methods have polished data acquisition techniques in line with technological progress. Todayâ€™s electronic and IT technologies, that are the tools of modern Geomatics, allow the effective survey and representation of 3D objects in different scales: from architectural structures to sculptures and also archaeological findings. All these respond perfectly to all the shades that our rich and versatile heritage present. This report does not really aim at explaining analytically the methods of Geomatics. Its main aim is to reflect on the relation between Geomatics and CH, not only highlighting their meaning but also and above all, their roots in the history of survey.
