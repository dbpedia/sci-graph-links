Abstract The development of automation in construction has been restricted by the variety of construction materials used, variable circumstances, and difficulties in the quantitative management of the construction process. Curtain wall, however, can be considered a relatively standard material compared to other construction materials. In this study, we analyze the current process of curtain wall installation and investigate the potential of an automated system combining a commercial excavator and a 3-DOF manipulator. This automated system has the adaptations necessary to work with any type of commercialized excavator. Therefore, workers need to transfer only the 3-DOF manipulator portion of the system when they move to other construction sites. This paper investigates experimental trials involving the proposed system at construction sites to determine its performance, working time, and efficiency. Results from this study were analyzed and further research options outlined.
