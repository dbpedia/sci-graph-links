Abstract We first remark that Kac–Moody groups enable us to produce hyperbolic buildings – automatically endowed with nonuniform lattices. The main result then deals with groups whose buildings are trees or two-dimensional hyperbolic. It is a factorization theorem for abstract isomorphisms. It shows the existence of nonisomorphic Kac–Moody groups with the same associated isomorphism class of buildings.
