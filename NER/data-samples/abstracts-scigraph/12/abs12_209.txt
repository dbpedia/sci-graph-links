Abstract Occupants of buildings typically operate devices such as windows, shades, luminaires, radiators, and fans to bring about desirable indoor environmental conditions. These control actions can have a significant impact on buildings’ performance (energy use, indoor climate). A better understanding of control-oriented user behavior can not only facilitate more accurate predictions of buildings’ performance, but also support the effective operation of buildings’ service systems. This paper describes a study of control-oriented user behavior (as related to systems for lighting and shading) in three office buildings in Austria. The results specifically shed light on the relationships between control actions and environmental conditions inside and outside buildings.
