Abstract Various novel notions such as model design and autoprescriptive sets are introduced to extend our conceptualization of life systems as multibody symbiotic architectural modules. Also, a new paradigm of culatural anthropology called a “multimodal framework” (MMF), introduced by G. Samuel, is incorporated in our architecture. Modal design is used to design complex architectures, and autopresciptive sets can be utilized to progress the modal design processes.
