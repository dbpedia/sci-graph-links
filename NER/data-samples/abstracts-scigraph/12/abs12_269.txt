Abstract Airborne endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in filter samples collected in three different swine confinement buildings was determined by using the Limulus amebocyte lysate test and by applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH-FAs). The amounts of LPS as shown by GC-MS were 30–50 times larger than the amounts detected by the Limulus test. GC-MS revealed that 21% of the LPS collected on cellulose acetate filters and 26% on polycarbonate filters remained on the filters after buffer extraction. Better correlation with the Limulus test and the 3-OH-FA measurements was achieved when considering the sum of 3-OH C12:0 and 3-OH C14:0 rather than the sum of all of the detected 3-OH-FAs (i.e. those with 12–18-carbon chains), indicating that the bioactivity of the LPS was dependent upon the relative distribution of the 3-OH-FAs. Linear regression analysis between air concentrations of dust and endotoxin/LPS gaveR 2values that varied from 0.407 to 0.739. The air concentrations of LPS were lower in the uninsulated swine house (a green house with an alternative housing system) than in the two insulated buildings (conventional housing systems; one designed as a climate chamber, i.e. climatic parameters could be controlled), whereas the opposite was found for the concentrations of LPS in airborne dust from the three buildings. The numbers of viable bacteria and fungi were highest in the uninsulated swine house. Moreover the relative distribution of 3-OH-FAs in that building differed from the distribution in the insulated buildings, which reflects differences in the microflora, probably mainly due to differences between the housing systems and the design of the buildings.
