Abstract In this paper some examples of the development of communities of microorganisms and plants on historic buildings and monuments are shown. When the building stones differ from the surrounding natural substrata, an increase in the biological diversity of the area is produced. In some cases, monuments can come to constitute a true refuge for a few species when the natural habitat is threatened. It is suggested that biological diversity, when it does not represent a threat for the cultural heritage, should be considered worthy of preservation.
