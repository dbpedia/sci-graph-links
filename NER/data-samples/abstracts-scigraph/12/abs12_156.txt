Abstract This study proposes an optimal building design aid system that integrates computer aided design (CAD), building environmental simulation tools and an optimization algorithm, based on the concept of building information modeling (BIM). BIM is a process of generating and managing data during a building’s life cycle. It can be used to demonstrate the entire building’s life cycle, including its construction and operation. Because the design of a build may vary from an abstract shape to precise details, the building’s database should vary accordingly. To store, manage and utilize the building’s data efficiently, we suggest an evolving database structure for our design aid system. A case study verifies that the system can acquire data from CAD, run a number of simulations and generate Pareto solutions automatically during several design stages.
