Abstract This article describes some general features of public transport provision in the urban areas of Japan (especially the large urban areas), and some specific features of an integrated transport system currently being developed in one such area. Although there are a number of important differences between Japan and the United Kingdom — such as the degree of urbanisation, level of car ownership, the responsibilities of government organisations and the existence of private railways in Japan — there are many similarities in the role that public transport plays and the factors which influence the efficiency of public transport. The success or otherwise of the developments in urban public transport systems in Japan would seem to have important implications for the design of transport systems in the similarly dense and compact conurbations of the United Kingdom and other European countries.
