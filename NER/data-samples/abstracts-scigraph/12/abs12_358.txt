Abstract This paper proposes a probability-based methodology for designing fire-safe buildings for property and lives. It is suggested that the performance of passive safety measures, taken in total and including building design and active devices such as sprinklers, should be assessed in terms of probable area damage and fatality rate per fire. Acceptable levels specified for area damage and fatality rate will provide design values for means of escape facilities, fire resistance and size of compartments, and other passive measures. Subject to these levels, the building's design can be altered, depending on active fire protection measures.
