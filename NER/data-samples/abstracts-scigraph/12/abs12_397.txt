Abstract Deterioration of stones is a complex problem and one of the main concern for people working in the field of conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. One important point in cultural heritage is to obtain information about the damage in a non-invasive way. By this paper, we propose a new non-invasive tool that permits evaluation of the thickness of $$\hbox {CaSO}_4{\cdot }2\hbox {H}_2\hbox {O}$$ CaSO4Â·2H2O (gypsum) grown (sulfation) on marble stones, using a mathematical model on data detected by pulsed infrared thermography.
