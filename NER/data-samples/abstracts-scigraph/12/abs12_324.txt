Abstract Improving the control strategy of an heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can result in substantial energy saving. In this paper, we formulate the whole HVAC system to a bi-level optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption of the HVAC system and maximize the satisfaction of indoor human comfort. The hierarchical evolutionary algorithm with preliminary feasibility conditions and crude energy index is proposed to find the good-quality control strategy of the HVAC system. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method and show the performance of the obtained control strategy.
