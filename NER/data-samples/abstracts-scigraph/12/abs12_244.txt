Abstract. Micrometer-size beam dimension allows samples a few micrometers in size to be analysed and the phase composition of different areas to be mapped. Moreover, it is possible to investigate objects with complex geometry. In this paper we discuss the opportunities offered by X-ray fluorescence and diffraction together with Raman techniques for historical studies when micrometer-size beams are used.
