Abstract C. Wright Mills repeatedly assumed two main roles throughout his life: those of designer and craftsman. Indeed, design and craftsmanship influenced, substantively and stylistically, most everything he did. Mills’s implementation of these two qualities extended to a number of areas including writing books and building houses, but also to motorcycle mechanics, photography, and carpentry. After consideration of Mills’s biography and philosophy in the context of design, style, and craftsmanship, two talks that he delivered in Aspen and Toronto, in 1958 and 1959 respectively, are examined. In both cases he addressed his remarks, specifically, to engineers, city planners, artists, and architects. Mills’s handwritten notes and various excerpts as well as published sources are consulted to show that Mills—through his biographical exemplification as designer and craftsman, as well as through his writings on power and the cultural apparatus—has had a decisive influence on the sociological study of design and designers; indeed, on designers themselves and on our understanding of design culture. But more than that, I contend that just as sociology and sociologists have wholly embraced Mills’s notion of the sociological imagination, so too must they fully espouse and embody his ideals and practices on design and craftsmanship. It is in this way that the discipline and its practitioners can strive for the standard of excellence that Mills set for himself and for his work.
