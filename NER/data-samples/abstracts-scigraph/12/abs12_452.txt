Summary In previous papers (Ishay, 1973; 1975; 1976) it was reported thatVespa orientalis workers are capable of building a comb in the absence of a queen. The present paper investigates further the comb building behaviour of queenless workers, arranged in groups of various sizes (2, 12–17, 44–50 workers), and of single isolated workers. Increasing group size was found to have an adverse effect on the amount and nature of the comb construction. The building abilities of various workers varied considerably. When isolated singly, only few workers built correctly, some built incorrectly and many failed to build altogether. Workers isolated immediately after emergence showed a greater tendency to build than workers isolated 3 or 4 days after emergence.
