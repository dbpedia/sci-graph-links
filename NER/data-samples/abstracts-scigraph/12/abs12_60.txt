Abstract The paper describes the principles of creating network models of transport systems in the geoinformation environment. A new original network model of the public transport system for the city of Moscow is developed by the authors. A system of factors and indicators that characterizes the level of provision of the population with public transport is given, as well as methods for their calculation. Models of different factors of provision of the population with public transport in Moscow are presented. Different ways of using the indicators of transport accessibility and their calculation algorithms to assess the quality of the urban environment and optimize the placement of commercial and transport infrastructure are offered.
