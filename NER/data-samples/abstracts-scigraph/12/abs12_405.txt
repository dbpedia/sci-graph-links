Summary The effort of building-up areas of minor agricultural value tends to use slopes susceptible to sliding. The stability of a slope should be increased by drainage, by stabilizing berms, etc., and the buildings should be founded as deep as possible. When the slope is formed of clay soils its angle of dip should not be greater than 8 degrees. The importance of this question induced the authors to report on a case of a building-up of a slope dipping 10 degrees, formed by clay and situated in the boundary area between the Bohemian Massif and the Carpathians. The items of statical character, e.g. the horizontal forces acting on piles can be evaluated using the finite element method.
