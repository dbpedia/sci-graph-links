Abstract Using the data on the Berlin public transport network, the present study extends previous observations of fractality within public transport routes by showing that also the distribution of inter-station distances along routes displays non-trivial power law behaviour. This indicates that the routes may in part also be described as Lévy-flights. The latter property may result from the fact that the routes are planned to be adapted to the fluctuating demand densities throughout the served area. We also relate this to optimization properties of Lévy flights.
