Abstract In this paper we show that a convex subcomplex of a spherical building of type E 6, E 7 or E 8 is a subbuilding or the automorphisms of the subcomplex fix a a point on it. Together with previous results of Mühlherr–Tits, and Leeb and the author, this completes the proof of Tits’ Center Conjecture for spherical buildings without factors of type H 4, in particular, for thick spherical buildings.
