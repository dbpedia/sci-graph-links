Abstract Outdoor latrines have been recorded in North Carolina from a variety of historic sites. Though the function remains the same, their location, architecture, and subsequent contents evidence considerable variation. This paper presents the survey results of archaeologically-recorded privy pits, their contents, and their cultural interpretation. Also included in this study is information gathered from statewide architectural surveys of sites with extant privy buildings. To augment the archaeological and architectural data sets, historical information is abstracted from early State Board of Health records and other public documents. A summary of architectural attributes from the privies reflects the change in structure and sanitation of these buildings against an historical backdrop. The convergence of these privy attributes is offered as a guide to future archaeological investigations and historical preservation projects through use of predictability models.
