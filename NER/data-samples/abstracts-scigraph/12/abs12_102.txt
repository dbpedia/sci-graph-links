Abstract This paper considers the water transport/urban development interface against the background of factors involved in urban transport systems and in the context of the broad field of transport geography. A typology is introduced to distinguish between land-based and water-based forms of transport, and between inter- and intra-urban systems. The paper also reports on responses to four propositions concerning transport and cities on water made to transport specialists in a variety of locations around the world.
