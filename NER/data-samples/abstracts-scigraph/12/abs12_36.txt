Abstract Using a variety of data sources, decentralisation of population and employment in four Dutch urban areas (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) over the last 20 years, is analysed. It is found that suburbanisation, plus an ever growing car share, has increased the number of external journeys related to the metropolitan cities enormously. With the use of the 1982 National Travel Survey, current travel patterns in and around the metropolitan cities are studied: the importance of external trips for urban transport planning shows clearly. They account for about half the number of city related car trips, and for nearly three quarters of the total vehicle kilometres of travel within the city.
