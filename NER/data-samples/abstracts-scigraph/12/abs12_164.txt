Abstract A parametric boundary equation is established for the principal period-2 bulb in the cubic Mandelbrot set. Using its geometry, an efficient escape-time algorithm which reduces the construction time for the period-2 bulbs in the cubic Mandelbrot set is introduced and the implementation graphic results display the fascinating fractal beauty
