The problem of an interface tunnel crack and an interface tunnel rigid inclusion perfectly coupled with a piecewise homogeneous anisotropic space is reduced to a system of six singular integral equations. To solve this system, we proposed an efficient numerical-analytic method. The mutual influence of the crack and the inclusion is investigated. In particular, we establish the dependences of the generalized stress intensity factors at the tips of the crack and the inclusion on the relative distance between them.
