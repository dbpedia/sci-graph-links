Abstract The aim of this paper is to give a geometric approach to Tits' “amalgam method” to construct buildings and to initiate a study of hyperbolic buildings, i.e. whose types are reflexion systems of the real hyperbolic space. We construct lots of examples and study their cohomology at infinity. We construct CAT(−1) polyhedral complexes having big discrete parabolic groups of isometries.
