Abstract For architects in partitioned Poland, the early twentieth century was a time of hope for independence and of a search for building forms intended to preserve or recreate the mythologized Polish landscape and townscape of the past. A dworek, or small manor house, became one of the most popular models for designers of all building types, including synagogues. Those synagogues designed and built by Henryk Stifelman, an active member of the Warsaw Jewish Community and an assimilationist, were the best proof of a continuity of the general local architectural tradition. Other examples can also be found of synagogues in the dworek style, designed by non-Jewish architects in the 1920s for small towns in central and eastern Poland.
