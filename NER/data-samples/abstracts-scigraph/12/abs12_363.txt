Abstract Following earlier work of Tits [8], this paper deals with the structure of buildings which are not necessarily thick; that is, possessing panels (faces of codimension 1) which are contained in two chambers, only. To every building Δ, there is canonically associated a thick building $$\bar \Delta $$ whose Weyl group W( $$\bar \Delta $$ ) can be considered as a reflection subgroup of the Weyl group W(Δ) of Δ. One can reconstruct Δ from $$\bar \Delta $$ together with the embedding W( $$\bar \Delta $$ ) ↪ W(Δ). Conversely, if $$\bar \Delta $$ is any thick building and W any reflection group containing W( $$\bar \Delta $$ ) as a reflection subgroup, there exists a weak building Δ with Weyl group W and associated thick building $$\bar \Delta $$ .
