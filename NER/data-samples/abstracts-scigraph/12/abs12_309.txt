Abstract This article aims to explore some geometrical schemes that can be supposed to underlie the design of the mausoleum of Sheikh Zāhed-e Gīlāni, a monument dating back to fifteen century in northern Iran. The investigation shows that there are intricate geometrical relations among the elements composing the façade of the monument. An isosceles triangle and a regular octagon inscribed in a square, together with some other related lines, form the geometrical master diagram that determines the design of its façade. The findings of this research are compatible with the opinion that geometry played a decisive role in the Timurid/Turkmen style of architectural design.
