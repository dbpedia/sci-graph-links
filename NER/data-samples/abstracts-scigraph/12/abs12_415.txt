Abstract Applying new information technologies to Cultural Heritage enables us to discover the unexplored characteristics of visual and aural attributes of historic buildings. In this article a new technology to measure acoustic 3D Impulse Responses in historic interiors is described and applied to the sixth-century church of San Vitale at Ravenna, Italy. The virtual reconstruction of this important UNESCO World Heritage Site revealed otherwise obscured yet intentional details of its architectural design. The results of measuring the internal spatial parameters are used to recreate San Vitaleâ€™s historical components and to re-sound original music of the little known Ravennate rite.
