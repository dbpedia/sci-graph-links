Abstract The Teruel Province (Spain) is known for its rich palaeontological heritage, including outstanding dinosaur sites from the Jurassicâ€“Cretaceous transition interval. A GIS-based management project was designed and utilised to represent and manage the detailed spatial data and associated databases of such sites. Systematic evaluation of the heritage value of sites is based on the estimation of factors such as scientific and socio-cultural values and of the risk of deterioration of all the proposed sites, both of dinosaur bone and dinosaur footprint sites. With the project in process, it is now possible to have an objective base from which to evaluate and make decisions on palaeontological heritage management, from both a basic and an applied standpoint, relative to territorial development.
