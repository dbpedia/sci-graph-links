Abstract Digital subtraction angiography has been accepted as an invaluable clinical tool over the past decade; however, film-screen-based angiography is still performed routinely when high-resolution or large field-of-view angiograms are needed. A technique is presented whereby two films from an angiographic sequence are digitized using a high-resolution laser digitizer, and the digitized images are aligned, subtracted, and displayed using the computer. To accommodate for some types of patient motion, an image warping algorithm is presented and discussed in detail. The warping algorithm is piecewise linear, using triangular regions for warping, resulting in a global nonlinear transform across triangle elements. An algorithm describing optimal triangle selection also is discussed. The results show that subtraction images of excellent quality can be produced by the proposed technique, and suggest that, in some settings, digitized subtraction films may be preferred over conventional film subtraction.
