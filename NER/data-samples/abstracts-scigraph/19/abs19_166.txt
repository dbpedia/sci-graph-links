Abstract Based on the concepts of RoboMusic and modular playware, we developed a system composed of modular playware devices which allow any user to perform music in a simple, interactive manner. The key features exploited in the modular playware approach are modularity, flexibility, construction, immediate feedback to stimulate engagement, creative exploration of play activities, and in some cases activity design by end-users (e.g., DJs). We exemplify the approach with the development of 11 rock genres and 6 pop music pieces for modular I-BLOCKS, which are exhibited and in daily use at the Rock Me exhibition, and have been used at several international music events in Japan and the USA. A key finding is that professional music design is essential for the development of primitives in a musical behavior-based system, and this professional esthetics is necessary to engage the users in the activity of assembling and coordinating these “professional” musical primitives. This article describes, explores, and discusses this concept.
