Abstract Interactions of pairs of parallel Néel walls are investigated by means of Ritz's method calculations. In the case of the symmetric, thin-film mode of Néel walls, unwinding walls show an attractive and winding walls a repulsive interaction for all distances. The functional dependence of the interaction on the distance of the walls is strongly correlated with the wall profiles of the isolated walls with their characteristic extended tails. For the asymmetric Néel wall mode which occurs in thicker films, an additional repulsive interaction of the magnetization vortices in the wall core is found. This leads for unwinding walls to stable configurations of double walls with separations between two and three times the film thickness.
