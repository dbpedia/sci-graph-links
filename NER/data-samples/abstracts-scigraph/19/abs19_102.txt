Abstract In this paper, we report the design and fabrication of a novel micromachined electro-magnetically driven tuning fork type gyroscope with bar structure proof masses working at atmospheric pressure. The applied angular rate is sensed by detecting the differential change of capacitance between the bar structure electrodes and the fixed electrodes on the glass substrate. Instead of common squeeze-film damping, slide-film damping in the gap between proof masses and glass substrate plays a dominant role, which enables it to achieve high Q-factors and thus eliminate vacuum packaging. The measured Q-factors for driving and sensing modes are 965 and 716, respectively. The sensor obtained a sensitivity of 6 mV/Â°/s and a non-linearity of less than 0.5%.
