Abstract Psychodramatic movement therapy describes the use of psychodramatic theory and action in a dance/movement therapy session. Psychodramatic movement therapy takes thoughts and feelings released through movement and structures them into directed and focused dramatic action. Through this dramatic action, thoughts and feelings are externalized and clarified in such a way as to add structure and content to previously inhibited and often confusing emotional material. The theoretical framework for psychodramatic movement therapy is presented with a case example to illustrate the clinical application.
