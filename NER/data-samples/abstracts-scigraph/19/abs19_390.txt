Abstract The conductivity of discontinuous Ar-irradiated gold films is studied in the temperature range 0.5-55 K. It is found that near the percolation threshold (on the insulating side of metal-insulator transition) the film shows the evidence for one-dimensional hopping conduction. The fluctuations of hopping conduction are observed. It is shown that such behavior of the film can be determined by a single linking chain. The presence of narrow insulating bridges in such chain is responsible for both the one-dimensional behavior of hopping conduction in the whole two-dimensional system and the observed fluctuations of conductivity. These fluctuations can be attributed to unusual manifestation of the effects of incoherent mesoscopics.
