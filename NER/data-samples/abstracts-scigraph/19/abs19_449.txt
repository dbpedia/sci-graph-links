Abstract The Belitsin equation cannot be used for calculation of the breaking load of twisted PP film fibres of different linear density as a function of the twist value because of the large difference from the real breaking load. New coefficients of the change in the breaking load as a function of the twist value and twist coefficient for corrugated PP film fibres with a linear density of 55, 115, and 230 tex are derived using a single-factor experiment design; it can be used to calculate the breaking load with a minimum error. A universal coefficient for the change in the breaking load as a function of the twist value and linear density is obtained for 55-230 tex PP film fibres, and the difference between the real and theoretical breaking load does not exceed 4% as a result of using it.
