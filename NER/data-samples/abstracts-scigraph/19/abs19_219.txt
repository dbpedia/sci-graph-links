Abstract The purpose of the present paper is to show the interactive design process for the ubiquitous middleware platform on the personal area network (PAN). The middleware platform is composed of a distributed system that supports sensors and actuators on PAN. Generally, in the case of middleware for ubiquitous computing, the structure is formulated by a simple design pattern in a shared program language. On the other hand, new media art or commercial game contents have specified methodologies such as extreme programming for these developments, and so it is difficult to share information among these products. In the present paper, we propose a new design process for the ubiquitous environment on the PAN to adapt different software methodologies and construct an interactive product of new media art using the proposed method. The design process consists of the artist's proposal for media artwork, the engineer's analysis, simulation, and testing. Each cycle is considered as an individual project, and interactive products such as middleware services are provided to the artist after the project is finished. We implemented interactive audio-visual prototype by the design process.
