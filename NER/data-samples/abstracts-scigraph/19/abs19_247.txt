Abstract We have performed simulations of the ghost image phenomenon induced by a contrast enhancement film used for plasma display panels (PDPs). An optical imaging system was designed in order to investigate the ghost image qualitatively and quantitatively. We report on and discuss the effects of the material parameters and film orientation on the relative illuminance of the ghost image for a conventional louver-type contrast enhancement film adopting a trapezoidal black-stripe structure. The ghost image phenomenon is strongly affected by the film orientation relative to the PDP module and the difference between the refractive index of the ultraviolet curable urethane acrylate layer and that of the black stripes. We show that when the top side of the black stripes faces the PDP module and the refractive index difference is small, the ghost image phenomenon is weakened.
