Abstract The therapeutic movement relationship (TMR) is central to the work of dance/movement therapists; yet, a definition of this core concept remains absent. This phenomenological study explored the meaning and essence of the TMR, as experienced by eight co-researchers who are board certified dance/movement therapists, in order to arrive at a definition. Data analysis of semi-structured interviews resulted in five textural themes that describe the essence of the TMR: (a) fundamental, foundational, and integral, (b) powerful, dimensional, and full, (c) shared presence and connection through movement, (d) creative collaboration, and (e) evidence of the TMR. In addition, three structural themes emerged that describe how the TMR is experienced: (a) presence, (b) space and time, and (c) creativity. These themes informed the creation of a definition of the TMR, which can support the teaching, learning, practice, supervision, and research of this critical component of dance/movement therapy.
