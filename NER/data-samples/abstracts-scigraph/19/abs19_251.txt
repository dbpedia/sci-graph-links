Abstract We study the relaxation of photoresponses in self-polarized Pb(Zr0.25, Ti0.75)O3 film structures with a semitransparent NiCr top electrode under focused laser illumination with a wavelength of 0.63 Î¼m and a power of about 40 mW. Dependences of the relaxation times of the photoresponses on the field directed both along the self-polarization vector and opposite to it are experimentally obtained. The dependences are found to be qualitatively different. We assume that in the structure under study, a screening charge occurs due to the capturing of photoinduced carriers in deep traps localized in the contact region.
