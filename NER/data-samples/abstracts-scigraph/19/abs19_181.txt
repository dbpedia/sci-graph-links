Abstract Musical accompaniment (of different styles and intensities) of the solution of mathematical logical tasks influenced the time required for their solution. Classical music 35 and 65 dB and rock music 65 and 85 dB in terms of loudness decreased the time of the solution. Louder classical music (85 dB) did not have this effect. Solution of tasks without musical accompaniment led to an increase in coherent values, especially in β1, β2, and γ the frequency bands in the EEG of the occipital cortex. The intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences of frontal EEG increased and EEG asymmetry (in the number of Coh connections in the left and right hemispheres) arose during the solution of the tasks accompanied by music. Classical music (35 and 65 dB) caused left-side asymmetry in the EEG. The use of more powerful classical or rock music led to a prevalence of the number of Coh connections in the right hemisphere.
