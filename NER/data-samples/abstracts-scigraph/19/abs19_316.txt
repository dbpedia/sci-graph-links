Abstract This qualitative research study explores the ways in which dance/movement therapy (DMT) and equine facilitated psychotherapy (EFP) can be combined to produce an integrated, creative, and effective psychotherapeutic approach. Interview methodology was used to collect qualitative data from current psychotherapeutic practitioners with experience in both disciplines. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and organized into 16 themes nested within 5 categories. The results showed a natural therapeutic fit between DMT and EFP, including the innate ability of horses to co-facilitate body-centered, movement-oriented, therapeutic processes. The results also suggested that combining DMT and EFP can increase therapeutic possibilities, including levels of client and therapist embodiment and creative expression, opportunities for contact and touch, and the depth and breadth of the therapeutic relationship. Finally, the results described some of the tools and techniques currently being used in DMTâ€“EFP sessions and highlighted factors necessary to be successful in this endeavor. This study is intended to provide a foundation for further research and writing about combining DMT and EFP.
