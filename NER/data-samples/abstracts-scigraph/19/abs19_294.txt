Abstract We consider holographic superconductors in a rotating black string spacetime. In view of the mandatory introduction of the $$A_\varphi $$ Aφ component of the vector potential we are left with three equations to be solved. Their solutions show that the rotation parameter $$a$$ a influences the critical temperature $$T_\mathrm{c}$$ Tc and the conductivity $$\sigma $$ σ in a simple but non-trivial way.
