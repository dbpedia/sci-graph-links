Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Nd:YAG laser irradiation on the dentin radiographic image. Previous studies have shown that Nd:YAG laser irradiation is capable of promoting morphological and chemical changes of the dentin surface, indicating the possibility of an alteration of its radiographic image. Dentin of 2-mm-thick mid-coronal sections from 68 extracted posterior teeth was irradiated for 30 s by a Nd:YAG laser (λ=1,064 nm) on one half of its surface area. The other half was left as a control. The irradiation parameters were: 80 mJ/pulse, 0.8 W, 10 Hz, with a 320-μm flexible quartz optic fiber in contact mode. The 68 samples were radiographed with a 70-kV X-ray setup. The focus–film distance was established as 30 cm and there was no distance between the object and the film. The X-ray exposure time was set as 0.16 s and the radiographic film used was an F-speed dental film. The obtained radiographic images were submitted to a densitometric analysis. The images analyzed showed that there were statistically significant differences between the density of the irradiated dentin images and the non-irradiated dentin images. The image density data showed that the irradiated dentin radiographic images were 6.36% more radiopaque than the non-irradiated dentin images. The Nd:YAG laser irradiation of dentin is able to alter its radiographic image, producing more radiopaque images of the irradiated dentin.
