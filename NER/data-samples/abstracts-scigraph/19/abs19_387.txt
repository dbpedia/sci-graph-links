Abstract The problem of electromagnetic reflection at an oblique angle of incidence in a system consisting of an isotropic ambient, a magnetic film and a thick magnetic substrate is studied. The magnetizations in both the film and substrate are assumed normal to the plane of incidence (transverse geometry). The results are expressed in terms of the reflection matrix. The solution includes the conditions for guided wave propagation in the system. As a special case of the general formulae the reflection matrix in a system consisting of a uniaxial film and a uniaxial substrate optical axes of which are oriented normal to the plane of incidence are obtained.
