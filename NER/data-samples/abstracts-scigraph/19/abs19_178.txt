Abstract Asymptotic formulas are derived for one- and two-particle distribution functions in a liquid wedge-shaped film. These formulas are valid at fairly large distances from the solid walls that confine the film. Along with the dependence on distances to solid walls, these formulas also determine the dependence on the opening angle of the wedge-shaped pore. In the limit of a straight angle, formulas are transformed into asymptotic formulas for the plane surface layer; in the limit of small angles, they are transformed into corresponding formulas for the plane film.
