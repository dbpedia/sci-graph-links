Abstract Building on the results of Chapman et al. (Z Angew Math Phys 47:410–431, 1996) on the behavior of minimizers in the Ginzburg–Landau thin-film model, we show that the vortices in the three-dimensional superconducting thin films are located in the cylinders whose cross sections coincide with the disks that contain the vortices in the two-dimensional model. To arrive at this conclusion, we prove that the three-dimensional minimizers converge to the two-dimensional counterparts in H 1 and in C α . We also give examples of regimes in which the vortex structure of the two-dimensional minimizers is well understood. Our results, in particular, provide insight into the behavior of the three-dimensional vortices in these regimes.
