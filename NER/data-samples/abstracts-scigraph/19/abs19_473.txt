Abstract Measuring data of the surface resistance Rs(T) temperature dependence of YBa2Cu3O7-δ epitaxial films on sapphire substrates are reported. The films were prepared by impulse laser ablation technique. Surface impedance measuring was made in 65 GHz frequency range. We shown that Rs(T) are in accordance with epitaxial film considering the existence of spatial inhomogeneities as normal spherical domains. The analysis of YBa2Cu3O7-δ film contamination was made by a laser mass-spectrometry technique. It was shown that normal spherical domains of YBa2Cu3O7-δ films include oxidizer cooper compounds filling cluster voids and film edges. The measuring was made for a set of samples, which have a different history (technology regimes, critical parameters and geometry).
