Abstract Music is one of the most profound and enjoyable of human activities, yet much about it remains shrouded in mystery. Perhaps it is the combination of centrality and elusiveness that attracts an ever-growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists, neurologists, technologists, and musicians. This paper discusses two distinct but related areas — education and health — where we believe that new tools, concepts, and content can have a significant impact. Since 2001, our approach has been to bring together sophisticated and attractive new music, participatory musical activities that stimulate the creative imagination without requiring years of training, and innovative concepts about pedagogy and healing, to lay the foundations for a new field of 'active music'.
