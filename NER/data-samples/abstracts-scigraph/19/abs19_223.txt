Abstract In this contribution, a theoretical modeling of the latex film formation is presented and compared to experimental results: water vapor permeability and latex film capacitance are studied as a function of acrylic acid content in poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate) latex films. It has been shown that both water uptake and water vapor permeability are mainly affected by film morphology which in turn is defined by intercolloidal interaction and drying rate.
