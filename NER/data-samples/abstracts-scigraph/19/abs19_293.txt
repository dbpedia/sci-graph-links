Abstract This case report describes a new plain film X-ray finding for a paraesophageal hernia. A plain film of the chest containing a new finding for a paraesophageal hernia was later confirmed by barium study. This new finding was a horizontal fold traversing the air-filled diaphragmatic hernia sac, with the fold representing the opposed sides of the stomach's lesser curvature. Recognition of this finding can hasten the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening type of hiatal hernia.
