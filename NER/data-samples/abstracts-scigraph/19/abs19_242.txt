Abstract Using both spreading techniques — mixed spreading and separate spreading- and, simultaneously, film pressure and film potential measurements, the mixing behavior of the following five binary systems was investigated and compared: 1) system 1,2-dilauroyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/cholesterol; 2) system 1,2-dimyristoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/cholesterol; 3) system 1,2-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine/cholesterol; 4) system Na-eicosyl sulphate/hexadecanol; 5) system phosphatidic acid/1,2-dimyristoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. Analyzing the time and concentration dependence of the π/a isotherms and Δv/a isotherms (πs = film pressure, Δv s potential,a=average area per molecule in mixed films in the monolayers) of the binary monolayers it can be concluded that the components of the binary systems 1–4 are complete miscible in the monolayers. On the other hand the components of the system 5 are probably partially miscible only.
