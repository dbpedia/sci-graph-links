Abstract. AC impedance measurements of thin 100-nm polyaniline films electrosynthesized in various acidic electrolyte solutions known to support different film morphologies are reported. By carefully defining experimental parameters obtained data could be satisfactorily explained invoking a simple equivalent circuit assuming a double layer capacity assigned to the polymer/solution interface, a pseudocapacity related to the internal redox capacity of the film, a film and a solution resistance and could be related to film morphologies. The data can be related to structural/morphological features of PANI films in close agreement with generally accepted changes of PANI films as a function of the degree of oxidation and type of anion present during electropolymerization.
