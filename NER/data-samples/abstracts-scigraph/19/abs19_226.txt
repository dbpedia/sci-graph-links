Abstract The effect of the inner structure of domain walls on the time-independent parameters of an isolated stripe domain in a thin ferromagnetic film is studied. The adopted variant of the perturbation theory makes it possible to account, within a unified approach, for the contributions of the magnetostatic and exchange interactions.
