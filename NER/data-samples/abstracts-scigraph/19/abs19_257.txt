Abstract Visual cryptography can be used as a method of sharing a secret image through several encrypted images. Conventional visual cryptography can display only monochrome images. We have developed a high-chroma color visual encryption technique using the interference color of high-order retarder films. The encrypted films are composed of a polarizing film and retarder films. The retarder films exhibit interference color when they are sandwiched between two polarizing films. We propose a stacking technique for displaying high-chroma interference color images. A prototype visual cryptography device using high-chroma interference color is developed.
