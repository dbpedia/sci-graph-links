Abstract Torsional oscillator experiments with the submonolayer superfluid4He film on the porous glass have been performed in a rotating cryostat. A new additional dissipation peak was observed under the rotation. This peak can be interpreted as a result of the crossover from 2D to 3D nature of the superfluid state and formation of 3D-type vortices in thin4He film on porous substrate.
