Summary 1.Three anomalies were disclosed in the electroreduction of chromic acid in the presence of sulfuric acid: a) the electroreduction of hexavalent chromium to the trivalent state proceeds at a rapid rate at low potentials, and is retarded sharply at higher potentials; b) stirring the electrolyte sharply reduces the cathodic polarization at low potentials, and is without effect at high potentials; and c) with increase in the electrode potential in a definite interval of potentials, the polarizing current does not increase, but instead decreases.2.The theory was expressed that the anomalies, observed in the electrodeposition of chromium, are linked with the creation of a film on the electrode surface. Since the creation of a film is observed only in the presence of sulfuric acid, then this indicates that sulfuric acid, in the region of potentials used for the electrodeposition of chromium facilitates not destruction of the film, as is usually assumed, but instead its formation.
