Abstract The purpose of this article is to explore the possibilities of art and design in the context of space development. The focus is the effects of arts on feelings, how to enjoy arts as a creator (Ono expressed together with “Art for psychological support”, the paper presented at European Space Agency (ESA), Tools for psychological support during exploration missions to Mars and Moon, Noordwijk, The Netherlands, 2007), supporting the idea of Joseph Beuys that “every human being is an artist” (Art into society, society into art. First published in English in Caroline Tisdall, ICA, London, p 48, 1973). Expression with arts is helpful to find our real selves. When humans create arts, their inner feelings will appear. Art therapy works in this way (Ono in Expressive arts therapy—drawing, clay, music, drama, and dance, Seishinshobo, Japan, 2005). Artistic expressions effect positively the human well-being. This work hypotheses that also in outer space artistic expression will be able to improve astronauts’ quality of life. The topics approached in this article are: (1) Space Art; (2) Psychology and Space Art; (3) Lunar Zen Garden Habitat; (4) Astronaut´s Art.
