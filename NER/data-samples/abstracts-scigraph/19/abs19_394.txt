Abstract We introduce an all thin film dc resistive SQUID (dc RSQUID) that works from 4.2K down to the mK range. It consists of conventional Nb/A1O/Nb tunnel junctions and an integrated Ag film resistor. With a special planar design for the resistor we achieve the necassary low value of resistance of some 10−5Ω. The resistor remains normal conducting in the whole temperature range investigated, despite the proximity effect. The characteristic parameters of the RSQUID show negligible tmeperature dependence. An integrated RSQUID could revive noise thermometry in the mK range because of its higher signal to noise ratio and the advantages of simple read out electronics and easy handling compared to the bulk devices used up till now.
