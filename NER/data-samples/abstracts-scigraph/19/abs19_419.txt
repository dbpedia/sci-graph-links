Abstract Microwave resonance relations for a {111} garnet film have been derived including the uniaxial as well as the first and second order cubic anisotropy contributions. Special attention has been given to the in-plane resonance condition. For this case the calculation has been made up to second order inK 1/MH andK 2/MH taking into account the influence of a nonideal in-plane configuration of the film.
