Abstract Phonon transport in two-dimensional silicon film is investigated and frequency dependent Boltzmann transport equation is solved numerically using discrete ordinate method. The transient effects of phonon transport in the film are incorporated in the analysis. The influence of film size on phonon transport is examined through equivalent equilibrium temperature in the film. It is found that increasing film thickness enhances phonon scattering and dispersion in the film while increasing equivalent equilibrium temperature. The rate of equivalent equilibrium temperature increase is high in the early heating period ($$\hbox {t} \le 50\,\hbox {ps}$$ tâ‰¤50ps ) and the rate of temperature increase becomes gradual in the film as the heating period progresses.
