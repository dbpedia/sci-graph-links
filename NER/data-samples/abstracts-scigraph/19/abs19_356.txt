Abstract Although cotherapy is a modality widely used in the training and practice of dance/movement therapists, there is little literature on cotherapy in dance/movement therapy. Through the use of a questionnaire, this author conducted an exploratory, descriptive study on the general use of coleading in the dance/movement therapy modality and the opinions of dance/movement therapists on this usage. The questionnaire was sent out to 300 dance/movement therapists at the second level of registry (ADTR) nationwide. This study found dance/movement therapists trained partly by coleading reported a higher perceived success rate in cotherapy relationships than those who were not. Also found, the perceived success rate of the cotherapy relationship is higher in dance/movement therapy groups than in other listed psychotherapy groups.
