Abstract A “square” binding alignment pattern, with relatively higher energy barrier but four fully aligned orientations at four off-set angles of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, has been analyzed by introducing a concept of the overlap ratio, compared to a “rectangular” one. Both the “square-pattern” micro-chips and the substrate with the “square-pattern” binding sites were fabricated using one-mask micromachining process, and the self-alignment in situ observation under three different off-set orientation angles of 35°, 46°, and 90° was demonstrated using a high-speed video camera. Sequential images reveal a slow translational motion in the early stage followed by a faster rotational alignment. A novel technique has been further proposed for the conductivity evaluation by using three kinds of SAM films, i.e., C12, C18, and Terphenyl. The preliminary measurements indicate that, using the proposed novel structure, the Terphenyl film is believed to be desirable as a conductive SAM film for self-alignment of micro-chips.
