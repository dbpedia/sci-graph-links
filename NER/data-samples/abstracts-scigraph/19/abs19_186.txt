Models are proposed for the thinning of an interphase film in petroleum emulsion separation processes, taking account of the Marangoni effect and the asphaltene content. The thickness of the adsorption layer on the surface of a drop is estimated. The computational and experimental data on the time dependencies of the interphase film thickness are compared.
