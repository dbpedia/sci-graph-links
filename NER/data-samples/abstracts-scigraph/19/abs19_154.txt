Abstract Nickel samples at temperatures of 300–1000°C have been irradiated simultaneously with 10-to 30-keV C+ ions and 1-to 5-keV electrons. The release of implanted carbon atoms on the surface of a sample with the formation of a transparent carbon film with the prevailing sp 3 hybridization has been observed. The thickness of the film is several tens of nanometers. The formation of films is attributed to the acceleration of the formation of carbon structures in samples irradiated by accelerated electrons.
