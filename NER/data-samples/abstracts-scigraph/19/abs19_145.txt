Abstract A phenomenological model is proposed of the piezoresistive effect in polysilicon films, taking account of film symmetry. The model employs the elastoresistance and the piezoresistance tensor. Average piezoresistance coefficients are calculated. They are found to agree well with previously reported experimental values for high doping levels.
