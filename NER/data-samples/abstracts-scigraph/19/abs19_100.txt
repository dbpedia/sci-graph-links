Abstract  Mask-making process by laser direct-write has been broadly applied in the microelectronics and the PC board industries. In this paper, we report the thick-film lithography of laser write mainly for the X-ray mask in the LIGA application. Several schemes of multiple writing are successfully demonstrated in terms of the sidewall straightness and free from intensity fluctuation of laser light. Present study adopts the applications of the positive resist of AZ P4620 prepared with a thickness of 30 μm, anti-reflection coating of AZ BARLi II on the substrate, and intensity filler to achieve smooth and straight sidewalls.
