Abstract In this paper we describe the SAME networked platform for context-aware, experience-centric mobile music applications, and we present an implementation of the SAME active music listening paradigm: the Mobile Conductor. It allows the user to express herself in conducting a virtual ensemble playing a MIDI piece of music by means of her mobile phone. The mobile phone detects the userâ€™s hand movement and molds the music performance style by modulating its speed, volume, and intonation.
