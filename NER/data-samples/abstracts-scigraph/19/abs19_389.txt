Abstract A simple three-channel film transport system of a scanning and measuring table is described. Automatic frame stopping is provided by means of an analogue signal derived from the shape of the Brenner mark. The rate of film travel in the three channels during high-speed rewinding is regulated to equal values in order to maintain the correlation of corresponding frames. The films move on air cushions over the frame gates and after stopping they are press-suction fixed.
