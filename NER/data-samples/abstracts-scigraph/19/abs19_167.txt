Abstract â€‚The procurement, interpretation, and value of postmortem cultures is reviewed from the microbiologist's perspective. A brief description of the various procurement techniques is included and the factors involved in the contamination of specimens discussed. The interpretation of culture results is discussed by comparing postmortem specimens to routine laboratory samples such as blood cultures and sputum. The value of performing these cultures is discussed relevant to the individual postmortem examination and the research capabilities of the facility.
