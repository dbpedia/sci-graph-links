Conclusions A quick-method of determining the moisture content of hydrocellulose film has been developed, which makes it possible to carry out measurements in 10–15 min, with a meansquared error of ±0.4% (absolute). A method has been suggested for calculating corrections for moisture exchange of a specimen with the surrounding medium during the time of withdrawing it; it offers the possibility of determining moisture content of the film in a roll. A system for stabilizing the moisture content of film has been included in the composition of the automatic control system for cellophane manufacture at the Kiev “Khimvolokno” PO.
