Conclusions Using the molecular-field approximation a form of the Landau-Ginsburg equation supplemented by boundary conditions for the case of disordered dilute ferromagnetic thin film has been derived.The spatial and temperature dependences of the magnetization below the ordering temperature of pure and dilute ferromagnetic rhin film bave been obtained. It bas been shown that the magnetization in both cases decreases near surfaces of the film on the distance approximately equal to the correlation length. When the correlation length is bigger than the thickness of the film, the magnetization changes clearly across the whole film. For temperatures very close to the Curie temperature our results are consistent with those obtained by Kokowska et al. [1] and Wojtczak [4], where the iteration procedure was applied to Valenta equations. Spatial and temperature dependence of the magnetization of pure and disordered semi-infinite ferromagnet bave been obtained in the limit when the thickness of the film tends to infinity. The magnetization below the ordering temperature in the case of pure and disordered dilute three-dimensional ferromagnet has also been considered. The magnetization of the disordered dilute ferromagnetic media is smaller than the magnetization of pure ferromagnetic media.
