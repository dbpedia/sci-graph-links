Abstract. Microfilm photography allows documentation of naevi in a map-like fashion. The localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem, as one can scan the film. Comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day-light. Magnification up to 48 times is possible. Detection of early changes of the naevi, during the horizontal growth phase, should increase the 5-year survival rate.
