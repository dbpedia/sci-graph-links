Abstract The article is devoted to elaboration of the model of scattering polarization film like dual brightness enhancement film (DBEF). This model is used for computer design of backlighting system of liquid crystal display (LCD) where light polarization is important. The model elaboration required development of measurement methods and reconstruction of the parameters for the film polarization, development of the accurate computer model of the polarized light scattering on thin surface. The results of design of LCD backlight with polarization film are presented in the article as well. So it was demonstrated that design of backlight devices with DBEF is possible with help of elaborated software.
