Abstract The nonlinear behavior of an unbalanced rotor supported in a fluid film bearing is analyzed. A simplified two dimensional model is adopted which uses the long-bearing approximation with a Ï€-film to account for cavitation. This model has been thoroughly studied by Myers [1] in the balanced case, where it is shown that the whirl instability is the result of a Hopf bifurcation. The implications of imbalance are studied in this paper. This leads to the study of a periodically perturbed Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that the dynamics in this situation can, especially under certain nonlinear resonance conditions, have an extremely complicated dependence on the system parameters and the rotor speed. Complete bifurcation diagrams are presented for a particular rotor model which demonstrate this dependence.
