Abstract Dancers frequently present with hip pain. The etiology of this pathology has not been clearly identified from an anatomical perspective. Structural variations including hip dysplasia and dynamic variables from the foot to the pelvis will be discussed. Understanding the etiology as a structural entity, neuromuscular entity or a combination of the two, allows for a successful rehabilitative process and a successful return to dance. This article describes the possible correlation between hip dysplasia and hip pain in the dancer, the relationship of dance postures to the kinematic chain and outlines possible treatment strategies for management.
