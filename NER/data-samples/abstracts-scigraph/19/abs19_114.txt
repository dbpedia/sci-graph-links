Abstract The electrochromic behavior of an all-solid thin-film electrochromic device consisting of layers ITO/NiO/ZrO2/WO3/ITO using the physical vapor deposition method has been studied as a function of the thickness of ZrO2 electrolyte. The ZrO2 thin-film thickness is varied from 2,000–5,000 Å. The transmittance modulation and memory effect improved with increase in the thickness of ZrO2 electrolyte. The device having 5,000 Å ZrO2 thickness shows good transmittance modulation (56 %) in the wavelength range of 450–1,000 nm with open-circuit memory effect of 170 min.
