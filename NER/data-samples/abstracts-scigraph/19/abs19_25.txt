Abstract This paper describes Hyper Media News (HMNews), a system for the automated aggregation and consumption of information streams from digital television and the Internet. TV newscasts are automatically segmented, annotated and indexed. Such information is then integrated with those available from Internet blogs, newspapers and press agencies. The end result is a set of innovative information services that supplies retrieval, recommendation and browsing of multi-modal news items across different production paradigms, ranging from traditional professional media, e.g. television and press, to new user-centric media platforms such as social networking sites, internet forums and blogs.
