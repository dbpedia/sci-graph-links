Abstract. We study the flow of a liquid down an inclined channel with a sinusoidal bottom profile. We show how wavy bottom variations, which are long compared with the film thickness or the amplitude, modify the flow with respect to that down a flat inclined channel. We consider different perturbation analyses. Their results are compared with experimental data on the velocity profiles and on the film thickness. We discuss the effect of waviness, inclination angle, film thickness, and Reynolds number.
