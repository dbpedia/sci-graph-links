Abstract In this paper, a summary of the most relevant failure mechanisms of thin-film vacuum microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) packages and existing testing techniques will be presented. Then, based on analytical models for thin-film vacuum MEMS packages (volume in the order of 10E−11 l), a feasibility study on options for thin-film vacuum MEMS package testing will be presented. This feasibility study leads to new insights and suggestions for future thin-film vacuum MEMS package testing.
