Abstract A thin viscous liquid film flow is developed over a stretching sheet under different non-linear stretching velocities in presence of uniform transverse magnetic field. Evolution equation for the film thickness is derived using long-wave approximation of thin liquid film and is solved numerically by using the Newtonâ€“Kantorovich method. It is observed that all types of stretching produces film thinning, but non-monotonic stretching produces faster thinning at small distance from the origin. Effect of the transverse magnetic field is to slow down the film thinning process. Observed flow behavior is explained physically.
