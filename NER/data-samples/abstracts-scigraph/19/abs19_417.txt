Abstract We present simulations of vortex dynamics in amorphous two-dimensional thin film superconductors, using a new exact method to evaluate long range interactions between vortices. We find that the onset of vortex motion is dominated by filamentary channels of flow. There are multiple patterns of filamentary flow which are stable in a wide range of bias current. As a consequence, there are multiple steps in the differential resistance, each step corresponding to a different pattern of filamentary flow. This results in a strong history dependence of the depinning current and current voltage characteristics. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments on amorphous Mo77Ge23 thin films.
