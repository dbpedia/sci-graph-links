Abstract We have investigated stress effects on yellow exciton states in a Cu2O thin film sandwiched by MgO plates by measuring wavelength modulated (WM) absorption spectra and their thermal variations. In the WM absorption spectra, dispersive spectral structures owing to 2P~4P states in the yellow excitons are clearly resolved in the thin film sample. A stress due to the lattice mismatch between Cu2O and MgO provides a large red shift of the band gap in the green excitonic system. However, in the yellow excitonic transitions, it is found that a red-shift of the 2P excitonic state is much smaller than that in the green excitonic system. This result suggests that a shallow potential minimum for the yellow excitons is built up in the Cu2O thin film sandwiched by MgO plates.
