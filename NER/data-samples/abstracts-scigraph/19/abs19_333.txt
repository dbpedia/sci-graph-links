Abstract Because of the interaction between film and substrate, the film buckling stress can vary significantly, depending on the delamination geometry, the film and substrate mechanical properties. The Mexican hat effect indicates such interaction. An analytical method is presented, and related dimensional analysis shows that a single dimensionless parameter can effectively evaluate the effect.
