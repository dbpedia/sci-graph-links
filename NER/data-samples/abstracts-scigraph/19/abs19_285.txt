Summary Studies in Costa Rica on two ornithophilous flowers, Justicia aurea (Acanthaceae) and Columnea glabra (Gesneriaceae) showed a constancy of nectar solute concentrations that was attributed to microclimatic protection by the tubular corolla and to copious nectar secretion, helped by waterproofing by a lipid film on the nectar surface in Justicia and by preferential compass orientation of the flowers of Columnea. Most of the corollas in the patch of Justicia had been pierced by nectar-robbers. A consequence of this damage, together with local microclimate effects, was flower-to-flower variation in the amount and accessibility of nectar and in the nature and concentration of its minor components, notably amino acids. McDade and Kinsman's (1980) finding that nectar secretion could be suppressed by repeated sampling or by nectar-robbing was confirmed.
