Summary The profile of the film and its dependence on temperature, both below and above the Î»-point, are studied on the basis of the results reached in papers I and II of the present series. The conclusions appear to be in fair agreement with experiment. The thermodynamic condition for film formation under the action of Van der Waals forces, is also discussed and found to be fulfilled.
