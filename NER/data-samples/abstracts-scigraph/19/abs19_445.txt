Abstract By reducing the Klein-Gordon equation near the event horizon with a new tortoise coordinate transformation, we calculate the Hawking temperature of the arbitrarily accelerating Kinnersley black hole. The temperature is a little different from what we have when we select the usual tortoise coordinate transformation. Then by means of the thin film model, we obtain the Bekenstein Hawking entropy of the Kinnersley black hole, which is proportional to the area of its event horizon with the same cut-off relation as the static case.
