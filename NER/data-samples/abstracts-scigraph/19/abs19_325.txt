Abstract Sixty-six chronic psychiatric clients were interviewed to examine attitudes toward dance therapy. Responses were categorized under eight healing processes postulated by Schmais (1985), and three processes suggested by client responses. Eight of these (Rhythm, Cohesion, Vitalization, Synchrony, Expression, Exercise, Music and Relaxation) were depicted in segments on a videotape. Clients were shown the tape and asked to rank order which segments they liked the most, second most and least. Vitalization was the most liked healing process, Exercise the second and Music last. The authors concluded that clients are aware of healing processes have attitudes toward those processes, and can rank the processes in order of preference.
