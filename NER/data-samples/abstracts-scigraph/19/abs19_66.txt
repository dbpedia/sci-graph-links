Abstract The article expounds the principles of the action of the superhigh-pressure press described in [1]. Its action reduces to the concentric pressing of pointed parts which, with compression, form a solid sphere with a high pressure at the center. Self-hardening of the parts of the press with compression plays an important role in achieving the effect.
