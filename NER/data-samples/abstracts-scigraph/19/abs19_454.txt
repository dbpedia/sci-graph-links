Abstract This article explores nonrepresentational, multidimensional lucid dreaming and its parallel imagery in modern art paintings. Developed from a series of successive qualitative experiments on art and lucid dreaming, the study brings together phenomenological and narrative approaches to reveal a relationship between imagery in a particular lucid dream experience (Hyperspace Lucidity) and a particular type of modern art painting (Lucid Art). This article attempts to open new dialogues for investigation of the interconnection between the dreaming mind and art.
