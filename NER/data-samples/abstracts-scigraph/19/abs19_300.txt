Abstract Elements of a standard definition of psychotherapy are used to support the argument that the creative arts therapies should not be characterized as adjunctive therapies, or discredited as not being “real therapies.” Two concepts widely acknowledged as important in the application of the creative arts therapies are discussed: first, that the nonverbal media employed by creative arts therapists tap emotional rather than cognitive processes and evoke responses more directly and immediately than traditional verbal therapies, and, second, that creative arts therapies are reality-based and provide a more immediate and real link to a patient's experience than something he can portray only verbally.
