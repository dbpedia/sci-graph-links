Abstract Aspects of the perturbation method are presented and implemented on the analytic function of the complex variable for the propagation of nonlinear electromagnetic surface guided by a thin film. The behavior of nonlinear TE waves guided by asymmetrical dielectric thin film, bounded by a generalizes nonlinear substrate with a permittivity of the form ɛ ∼ | E |δ is analyzed. The complex roots, which correspond to the propagation and attenuation coefficient are obtained and discussed.
