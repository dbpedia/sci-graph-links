Abstract This article presents a framework for understanding the process of news gathering as a negotiation between reporters and the people and institutions they cover. News gathering is shaped by constant tension between the “deal” - getting the story - and the relationship among those concerned. Competing actors and multiple levels exacerbate the reporter's dilemma, a variant of the classic negotiator's dilemma. Using case material from published accounts of news gathering, this article points to practical implications for all involved parties in negotiating with the media.
