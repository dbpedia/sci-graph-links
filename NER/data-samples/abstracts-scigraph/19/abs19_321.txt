Abstract Since its inception in 1966, the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) has worked to develop standards of professional training. The initiation of a registry procedure was the organizationâ€™s first attempt to identify and set forth standards for clinical training. This task was often difficult due to three important factors: (1) the lack of in-depth training opportunities during the early years of the association; (2) the desire and motivation of the ADTA to establish a professional identity; and (3) the lack of a clearly defined body of knowledge. The emergence of graduate programs in dance therapy has positively affected the quality of training, lent credibility to the profession, and facilitated the discovery and exploration of a body of knowledge. This paper traces the historical development of dance therapy training in the ADTA.
