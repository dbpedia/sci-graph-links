Abstract. Neutron-reflectometry data is collected in momentum space. The real-space information is extracted by fitting a model for the structure of a thin-film sample. We have attempted a Monte Carlo technique to extract the structure of the thin film. In this technique we change the structural parameters of the thin film by simulated annealing based on the Metropolis algorithm.
