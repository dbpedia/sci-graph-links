Abstract This work reports on preparation, characterization, and antibacterial activity of graphene oxide (GO) decorated with biogenic silver nanoparticles (Bio-AgNPs) produced by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. This nanocomposite (Bio-GOAg) was prepared by an ex situ process through the physical mixture of a GO dispersion with the previously prepared Bio-AgNPs. The adsorption of the Bio-AgNPs onto the GO sheets was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The average size of the Bio-AgNPs anchored onto the GO surface was found to be 3.5 nm. The antibacterial activity of the Bio-GOAg nanocomposite against Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms was investigated and a very promising result was found for the Gram-negative strains. In addition, the Bio-GOAg nanocomposite displayed a very strong biocidal activity against the Salmonella typhimurium strain at a concentration of 2.0 μg/mL. The antibiofilm activity toward S. typhimurium adhered on stainless steel surfaces was also investigated. The results showed 100 % inhibition of the adhered cells after exposure to the Bio-GOAg nanocomposite for 1 h.
