Abstract The carbon nanotube embodies a unique combination of properties which make it potentially an extraordinary field emission electron source. These properties include small tip radii (and small source size), high electrical conductivity, high melting point, and resistance to electromigration under an applied electric field. Here, carbon nanotube electron point sources are shown to be remarkably stable, with high brightness, low energy spread, and low noise. These are favorable attributes of an electron source to be used in an electron-optical system. By combining wafer-scale carbon nanotube growth technology with microfabrication techniques, it is possible to mass produce high-performance emitter arrays that can deliver high current beams at high frequencies.
