Abstract. We have performed the optical and photoelectron spectroscopic studies of alkyl-passivated Si nanoparticles synthesized by a solution route. The alkyl-passivated Si nanoparticle with mean diameter less than about 2Â nm exhibits a strong ultraviolet-blue photoluminescence. Furthermore, we have directly investigated their electronic structures in the vicinity of Fermi level by means of valence-band photoemission measurements using synchrotron radiation. From these results, the detailed optical properties and electronic structures of alkyl-passivated Si nanoparticles are discussed.
