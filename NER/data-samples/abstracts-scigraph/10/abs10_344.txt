Abstract In this study, dynamics of nanoparticles penetrating and accumulating in biotissue (healthy skin) was investigated in vivo by the noninvasive method of optical coherence tomography (OCT). Gold nanoshells and titanium dioxide nanoparticles were studied. The processes of the nanoparticles penetration and accumulation in biotissue are accompanied by the changes in optical properties of skin which affect the OCT images. The continuous OCT monitoring of the process of the nanoparticles penetration into skin showed that these changes appeared in 30 min after application of nanoparticles on the surface; the time of accumulation of maximal nanoparticles concentration in skin was observed in period of 1.5–3 h after application. Numerical processing of the OCT signal exhibited the increase in contrast between upper and lower parts of dermis and contrast decay of the hair follicle border during 60–150 min. The transmission electron microscopy technique confirmed accumulation of the both types of nanoparticles in biotissue. The novelty of this study is presentation of OCT ability to in vivo monitor dynamics of nanoparticles penetration and their re-distribution within living tissues.
