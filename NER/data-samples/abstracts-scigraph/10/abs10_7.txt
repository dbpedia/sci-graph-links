Abstract Colloidal silver nanoparticles were obtained by chemical reduction of silver nitrate in water with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a stabilizer. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by their UV-vis absorption spectra and transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images. The UV-vis absorption spectra showed that NaBH4 served not only as a reducing agent but also as a stabilizer, which protects the aggregation of silver nanoparticles. The TEM images showed that the particles were dispersed better with increasing the NaBH4 concentration.
