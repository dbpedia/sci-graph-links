Abstract â€‚A method for fabricating a microstructure with a high aspect ratio has been developed. It uses a combination of fluorinated polyimide and silicone-based positive photoresist, which reduces the number of process steps and the turn-around time. This fabrication method is applicable to optical micromachines and IC probes.
