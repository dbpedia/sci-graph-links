Abstract. Single-color femtosecond pump-probe experiments were performed to investigate the time dependence of laser-induced ultrafast desorption and deformation processes of silver nanoparticles in glass. After laser excitation at wavelengths close to the surface plasmon resonance, transient extinction changes were found to exhibit dynamics on quite different time scales ranging from sub-picoseconds to some hundred ps. The slowest observed decay component is identified as characteristic for the deformation/desorption processes. Possible mechanisms for these processes are discussed.
