Abstract Nanostructured platinum-gold (Pt–Au) hybrid film modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated by electro-deposition method in the presence of 2 × 10−4 mol l−1 l-cysteine. To examine the surface morphological analysis, the (Pt–Au) hybrid film were electrochemically deposited on transparent semiconductor indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) studies. From the SEM analysis, it was observed that the deposited nanoplatinum (250–400 nm) was formed as a cauliflower-shaped structure with the gold nanoparticles (30–90 nm). The concentration variation of additive l-cysteine results in the formation of cauliflower-shaped platinum nanoparticles. Further, the Pt–Au hybrid film modified GCE could be used for the detection of catecholamine neurotransmitters epinephrine (EP), norepinephrine (NEP) individually and in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) in pH 7 phosphate-buffered solutions (PBS). Furthermore, the proposed Pt–Au hybrid film could be applied for the detection of epinephrine in injection solution and ascorbic acid from commercially available vitamin C tablets.
