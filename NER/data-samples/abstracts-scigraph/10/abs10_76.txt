Abstract Green nanoparticle synthesis has been achieved using environmentally acceptable plant extract and eco-friendly reducing and capping agents. The present study was based on assessments of the antiparasitic activities to determine the efficacies of synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Mimosa pudica Gaertn (Mimosaceae) against the larvae of malaria vector, Anopheles subpictus Grassi, filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus Canestrini (Acari: Ixodidae). Parasite larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous extract of M. pudica and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. AgNPs were rapidly synthesized using the leaf extract of M. pudica and the formation of nanoparticles was observed within 6 h. The results recorded from UV–vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy support the biosynthesis and characterization of AgNPs. The maximum efficacy was observed in synthesized AgNPs against the larvae of A. subpictus, C. quinquefasciatus, and R. microplus (LC50 = 13.90, 11.73, and 8.98 mg/L, r 2 = 0.411, 0.286, and 0.479), respectively. This is the first report on antiparasitic activity of the plant extract and synthesized AgNPs.
