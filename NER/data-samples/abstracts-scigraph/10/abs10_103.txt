Abstract We present a high resolution transmission electron microscopy study of carbon soot particles produced in arc-discharge experiments. This technique allows direct visualization of the atomic structures of the clusters. Tubular and concentric-shelled graphitic structures are produced on the surface of contact between the electrodes. Strong electron bombardment of the carbon soot generates as a final result, concentric-shelled, graphitic particles, exhibiting a remarkable spherical shape.
