Abstract The thermal decomposition of Fe x (CO) y precursors for the synthesis of nanoparticles of iron carbides and their superstructures with sizes ranging from 2.8 to 15.1Â nm is developed using imidazolium-based ionic liquids as solvents, stabilizers, and carbon source. A study of the influence of some synthesis parameters such as the heating temperature, nature, and concentration of the iron carbonyl precursor and chain length of the N-alkyl substituent on the imidazolium ring on the size and organization of the iron carbide nanoparticles is presented. These iron carbides nano-objects were characterized by infra-red spectroscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and magnetic analyses.
