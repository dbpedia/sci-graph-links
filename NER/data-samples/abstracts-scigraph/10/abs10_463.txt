Synthesis of silicon nanoparticles of various sizes from 3 to 9 nm in diameter was accomplished via a low temperature solution route. These nanoparticles are prepared via reduction of SiCl4 with Na naphthalide in dimethoxyethane and capped with octasiloxane. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution (HR) TEM, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, UV–vis, photoluminescence, and their quantum yields were determined. TEM micrographs show that the nanoparticles are well dispersed and SAED and lattice fringes are consistent with diamond structured silicon. X-ray powder diffraction provides no diffraction peaks. UV–vis and photoluminescence show characteristic shifts corresponding to size, consistent with quantum confinement. The smallest sized nanoparticles show the largest quantum yield, consistent with an indirect bandgap nanoparticles.
