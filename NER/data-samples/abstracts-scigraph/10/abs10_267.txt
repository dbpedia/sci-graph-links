Abstract This article presents a concise review of preparation methods for transparent nanostructured films, with an emphasis on their current applications in transmission-localized surface plasmon resonance (T-LSPR) sensing. One of the first methods used for the fabrication of transparent nanostructured metal films is a direct vacuum evaporation of thin gold films. Self-induced formations of small gold islands result in transparent nanostructured gold arrays. The most well-established method is a nanosphere lithography developed by Van Duyne. Nanotriangular island arrays with controlled size and optical properties can be fabricated by this protocol. A different nanolithography method known as focused ion beam milling is reported and used for the fabrication of nanohole arrays. Simple assembly of solution-phase synthesized nanoparticles has also been utilized for the preparation of nanoparticle arrays capable of T-LSPR sensing. Lastly, this article also describes a new preparation strategy, in which self-assembly/thermolysis of nanoparticle multilayers is employed to obtain transparent nanoisland architectures on glass substrates.
