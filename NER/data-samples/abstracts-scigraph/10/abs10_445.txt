Abstract K. Bezdek and T. Odor proved the following statement in [1]: If a covering ofE 3 is a lattice packing of the convex compact bodyK with packing lattice Λ (K is a Λ-parallelotopes) then there exists such a 2-dimensional sublattice Λ′ of Λ which is covered by the set ∪(K+z∣z ∈ Λ′). (K ∪L(Λ′) is a Λ′-parallelotopes). We prove that the statement is not true in the case of the dimensionsn=6, 7, 8.
