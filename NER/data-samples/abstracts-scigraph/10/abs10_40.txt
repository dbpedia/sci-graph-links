Abstract. We have investigated the spectral density of shot noise for the system of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two single-wall carbon nanotube terminals irradiated with a microwave field on the QD. The terminal features are involved in the shot noise through modifying the self-energy of QD. The contributions of carbon nanotube terminals to the shot noise exhibit obvious behaviors. The novel side peaks are associated with the photon absorption and emission procedure accompanying the suppression of shot noise. The shot noise in balanced absorption belongs to sub-Poissonian, and it is symmetric with respect to the gate voltage. The differential shot noise displays intimate relation with the nature of carbon nanotubes and the applied microwave field. It exhibits asymmetric behavior for the unbalanced absorption case versus gate voltage. The Fano factor of the system exhibits the deviation of shot noise from the Schottky formula, and the structures of terminals obviously contribute to it. The super-Poissonian and sub-Poissonian shot noise can be achieved in the unbalanced absorption in different regime of source-drain bias.
