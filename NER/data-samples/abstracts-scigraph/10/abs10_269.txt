Abstract Sulfonated graphene nanosheet/gold nanoparticle (SGN/Au) hybrid was synthesized by electrostatic self-assembly of anionic SGN and positively charged gold nanoparticles. Due to the well-dispersivity of SGN in aqueous solution and its adequate negative charge, Au nanoparticles were assembled uniformly on graphene surface with high distribution. With the advantages of both graphene and Au nanoparticles, SGN/Au hybrid showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards O2 reduction. Furthermore, it provided a conductive and favorable microenvironment for the glucose oxidase (GOD) immobilization and thus promoted its direct electron transfer at the glassy carbon electrode. Based on the consumption of O2 caused by glucose at the interface of GOD electrode modified with SGN/Au hybrid, the modified electrode displayed satisfactory analytical performance, including high sensitivity (14.55 μA mM−1 cm−2), low detection limit (0.2 mM), an acceptable linear range from 2 to 16 mM, and also the prevention from the interference of some species. These results indicated that the prepared SGN/Au hybrid is a promising candidate material for high-performance glucose biosensor.
