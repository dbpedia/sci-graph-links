Abstract Gold nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using Semecarpus anacardium leaf extracts in water and the green biomass. Extract prepared at ambient condition by crushing the leaves in deionized water is identified as ‘green extract’, and that by boiling the leaf pieces as ‘boiled extract’. The mass remaining after separating the ‘green extract’ is identified as ‘green biomass’. These components triggered rapid reduction of Au(III) to Au (0) in HAuCl4 solution indicating the natural ability of the leaves of S. anacardium to synthesize NPs in ambient conditions. Green extract produced more NPs compared to the boiled extract suggesting denaturization of some of the useful factors due to boiling. NPs were quantified using UV and ICP-AES analysis. These were characterized using Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. TEM images of the particles formed with green extract, boiled extract and green biomass showed that the particles were of different shapes and sizes.
