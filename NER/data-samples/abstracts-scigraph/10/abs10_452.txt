Abstract In this paper, a novel design of plasmonic solar cell is investigated and analysed using 3D finite difference time domain method. The suggested design has a cylindrical metallic nanoparticles with hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as an active material. The aim of our work is to get maximum absorption of thin film solar cell by scattering the light from metal nanoparticles. Therefore, the effects of the structure geometrical parameters on the absorption are investigated. The numerical results show that 35Â % absorption improvement is achieved over the conventional thin film solar cell without metallic nanoparticles.
