Abstract Manipulation of nanoparticles is easier when they are appropriately functionalized with adequate chemical groups. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes were functionalized with different chemical groups and the influence of functionalization on their stability in different solutions and the impact on elastomeric polyurethane composites were studied. It was observed that the functionalization yielded in all cases nanotubes with approximately the same dimensions (diameter: ∼8–40 nm; length: ∼1–25 μm) and 24–29 wt% of organic tallow per mass of nanotube. The chemical behaviour of nanotubes in solutions was highly dependent on functionality. The impact on mechanical properties was function of the chemical nature of the nanotube functional groups and moderately followed the expected tendency according to their solubility in solvents.
