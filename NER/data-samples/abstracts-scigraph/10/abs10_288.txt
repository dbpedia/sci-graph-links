Abstract The CoCr2O4 nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of chromium and cobalt oleates in a mixture of solvents (water and ethanol or pentanol) at various temperatures. The samples were further annealed at the temperatures from 300 to 500 °C. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements. The particle size, ranging from 4.4 to 11.5 nm, was determined from the TEM and PXRD methods. The tendency of particles to form the aggregates with the increasing annealing temperature has been observed. The magnetic measurements revealed that the typical features of the CoCr2O4 long-range magnetic order are suppressed in the nanoparticles.
