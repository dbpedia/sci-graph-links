Abstract.  Quantitative analysis of particles less than 10 nm in diameter requires a focused electron beam to isolate individual particles for X-ray emission spectrometry. Effects such as phase separation among particles and surface segregation within particles can only be determined by this technique. This analysis can be made quantitative with minimal use of the usual correction factors provided the small particles are supported on ceramic materials about the same thickness as the particles themselves. Two alloy nanoparticle systems are examined here: Pt-Rh and Pt-Re. In each case the catalytic properties resulting from various processing procedures have been correlated with the microstructure within and among individual particles.
