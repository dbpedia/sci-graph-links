Abstract Near infrared (NIR) light induced photothermal effect for Fe3O4 nanoparticles, contained in Pluronic F127 micelles, has been studied and it exhibits high photothermal converting efficiency. Heat is found to be rapidly generated in micelles containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles by NIR laser irradiation. Upon irradiation at 808 nm light and with mass concentration of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in 4 g/L, the micelle temperature increase is higher than 34°C for 10min irradiation. The maximum temperature of micelles containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles in 4 g/L reaches 62°C.
