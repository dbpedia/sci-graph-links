Abstract. We synthesized polyynes by laser ablation of diamond nanoparticles (about 5 nm in diameter) and graphite particles with two different sizes (about 5 nm and 10 μm) suspended in liquid ethanol. It was found that the ablation of diamond nanoparticles results in larger amounts of long polyynes compared to the ablation of graphite particles. It was also found that the chain length distribution of polyynes produced from diamond nanoparticles is dependent on the laser irradiation time and the fraction of long polyynes is higher when the irradiation time is shorter. These results allow us to conclude that the direct evaporation of carbon atoms from pristine diamond nanoparticles at the initial stage of laser irradiation results in the larger amounts of long polyynes.
