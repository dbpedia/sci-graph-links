Abstract Monolayers of FePt nanoparticles were synthesized on SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating method. The effects of spin-coating conditions on surface morphology of FePt system was studied with FE-SEM. A high temperature annealing on the FePt monolayer films resulted in phase transition from fcc into fct (L10 phase), while preventing nanoparticles from sintering. Furthermore, L10 FePt nanoparticles with an average size of 15 nm are coated on SiO2/Si surface. Uniform nanoparticle monolayer was obtained by optimizing the experiment parameters such as spin time and controlling hexane evaporation rate.
