Abstract Nanoscale Cocore–Ptshell particles were successfully synthesized based on a successive reduction strategy. The as-prepared core–shell nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, and electrochemical methods. It was found that the catalytic reactivity of Cocore–Ptshell/C catalysts toward oxygen reduction was enhanced. It is believed that the prepared Cocore–Ptshell/C nanoparticles could be promising for cathode catalysis in proton exchange membrane fuel cells with much reduced Pt content, but significantly increased catalytic activity.
