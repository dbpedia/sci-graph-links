Abstract In this study, the correlation between magnetic, structure, and electronic properties of Ag@Fe3O4 hetero nanostructures are presented. These nanostructures were prepared using a two-step new chemical approach. Three different nanoparticle systems with different Ag concentrations have been prepared and characterized using high resolution transmission electron microscopy, dc magnetization (magnetization and coercive field as a function of temperature), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, and magnetic circular dichroism studies (XMCD). From the correlation between XMCD and dc magnetic measurements (Verwey transition) the presence of non-stoichiometric magnetite in Ag@Fe3O4 nanoparticle systems was confirmed. From the spin and orbital contribution to the total magnetic moment, we conclude that the sample with less Ag seeds particle concentration presents a non-quenched orbital contribution. These phenomena were analyzed based on the actual models and correlated with dc magnetic properties. From these, we conclude that the enhancement on the orbital contribution increases the spin orbital interaction, also increasing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy reflected on the dc magnetic properties.
