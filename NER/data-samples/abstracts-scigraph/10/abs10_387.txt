Abstract The possibility of integration of graphene films applying the Langmuir-Schaefer method to the structure of the working channel of the organic memristor is investigated. The variation in electrical characteristics of memristor structures in the presence of graphenes in the working channel of the element is analyzed. New effects such as an increased working voltage range and the S-like shape of current-voltage characteristics are found, which is most probably associated with the charge accumulation in the region of graphene sheets.
