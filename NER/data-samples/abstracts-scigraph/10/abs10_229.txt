Abstract Cu2S nanoparticles were electrosynthesized by cyclic voltammetry between 0.10 and 1.50 V in the presence of polyvinylalcohol as stabilizer. The structure and nature of the resulting Cu2S poly (vinyl alcohol) composite were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results show that electrochemically synthesized Cu2S nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed and well separated from one another with a mean diameter of about 12 nm.
