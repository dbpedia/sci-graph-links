Abstract Superlattice of silver nanoparticles was prepared using a liquid–liquid two-phase method with hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) as reducing agent. The ordered of silver nanoparticles were formed on carbon films coated on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) copper grids by evaporating a drop of silver colloid. The scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer analyses, X-ray diffraction, and fluorescence spectrometer were used to characterize the superlattice. The formation process of the silver nanoparticles was investigated by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy and TEM. The TEM images show directly the results with obvious structure of superlattice. In addition, the UV–visible spectra of the silver nanoparticles colloidal phase obtained finally showed that the system is monodisperse.
