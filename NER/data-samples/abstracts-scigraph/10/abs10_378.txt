Abstract Chitosan and its water-soluble N,N,N-trimethyl derivative were attached to cellulose fibers in the form of nanoparticle dispersions. The attachment of the chitosan nanoparticles to the fiber surface was studied by evaluation of the quantity of chitosan amino groups using a conventional spectrophotometric method supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The desorption kinetics of the chitosan nanoparticles from the fiber surface was also examined indirectly by the spectrophotometric method. Additionally, a model drug was incorporated into the optimal chitosan nanoparticles for subsequent attachment to fibers to create a potential fibrous drug delivery system aimed at gynecological use, i.e., tampons as antimicrobial agents themselves or as drug reservoirs.
