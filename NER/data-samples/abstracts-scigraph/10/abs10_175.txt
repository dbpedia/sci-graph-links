Abstract We report on a highly sensitive and selective electrochemiluminescence (ECL) based method for the determination of pentachlorophenol (PCP). It is based on a new hybrid material composed of CdS quantum dots (QDs), graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and uses peroxodisulfate as the coreactant. The use of this system results in a nearly 18-fold increase in ECL intensity. On interaction between PCP and the QDs, a decrease in ECL intensity is observed at PCP in a concentration as low as 1.0 pM and over a wide linear range (from 1.0 pM to 1.0 nM). The method is hardly affected by other chlorophenols and nitrophenols, and the electrode can be recycled. Figureá…Ÿ
