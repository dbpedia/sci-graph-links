Abstract Si-based nanomaterials are some new photoelctronic and informational materials developed rapidly in recent years, and they have potential applications in the light emitting devices, e. g. Si light emitting diode, Si laser and integrated Si-based photoelectronics. Among them are nanoscale porous silicon (ps), Si nanocrystalline embedded SiO2 (SiOx, x < 2.0) matrices, Si nanoquantum dot and Si/SiO2 superlattice, etc. At present, there are various indications that if these materials can achieve efficient and stable luminescence, which are photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL), it is possible for them to lead to a new informational revolution in the early days of the 21st century. In this article, we will mainly review the progress of study on Si-based nanomaterials in the past ten years. The involved contents are the fabricated methods, structural characterizations and light emitting properties. Finally, we predicate the developed tendency of this field in the following ten years.
