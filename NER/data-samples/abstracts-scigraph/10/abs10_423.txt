Abstract A study on anti-bactericidal filter is carried out using electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibres by incorporating different weight percentages of silver (Ag) nanoparticles. Dimethylformamide (DMF) plays dual role, as solvent for PAN and as reducing agent for the formation of Ag nanoparticles, and the Ag nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Visible Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Then, PAN solutions with Ag nanoparticles were electrospun to produce nanofibres. Areal density of nonwoven substrate, electrospinning time, and Ag% were taken as independent variables to design the experiment for the preparation of filter. Box-Behnken method has been used to derive the experimental plan and the filters were prepared according to the plan. Later, the developed filters were studied for bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) as well as the anti-bactericidal activity against two commonly studied grampositive S. aureus and gram-negative E. coli bacteria. From the study, the developed Ag nanoparticle incorporated PAN electrospun nanofibre filters possess 99 % BFE with good anti-bactericidal activity, which enhances the potential application in protective mask.
