AbstractIn this study graphene oxide was functionalized by divinylsulfone and allyl acetoacetate conducting a simple route. This novel functionalized graphene oxide [graphene oxide grafted with allyl acetoacetate (GO-GAA)] was characterized by X-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analyses. Thereafter the adsorption property of GO-GAA for Cd2+ ion removal from aqueous media was investigated. The effect of several factors such as pH and temperature on the Cd2+ adsorption was also studied. It was found that the adsorption isotherm follows the Langmuir–Freundlich model and the maximum adsorption capacity was 71 mg/g for GO-GAA toward Cd2+ at 20 °C at pH 7. The fast adsorption kinetics which takes less than 2 min was following the pseudo-first-order model. The synthesized nanoadsorbent also showed a good reusability, even after ten cycles of adsorption–desorption using HNO3 as regenerating agent. Furthermore applicability of synthesized nanoadsorbent for Cd2+ removal from industrial wastewater and well water samples inoculated with cadmium was investigated and over 82 % efficiency was observed.
