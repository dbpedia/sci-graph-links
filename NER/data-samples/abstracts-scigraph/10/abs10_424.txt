Abstract We have demonstrated a facile and efficient strategy for the fabrication of soluble reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGO) and the preparation of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticle-RGO composites using a modified one-step hydrothermal method. It was found that graphene oxide could be easily reduced under solvothermal conditions with ascorbic acid as reductant, with concomitant growth of TiO2 particles on the RGO surface. The TiO2-RGO composite has been thoroughly characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Microscopy techniques (scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy) have been employed to probe the morphological characteristics as well as to investigate the exfoliation of RGO sheets. The TiO2-RGO composite exhibited excellent photocatalysis of hydrogen evolution.
