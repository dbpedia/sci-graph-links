Abstract Carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles that contained phosphorus (P–Pt/C) were synthesized by the reduction of Pt ions in an aqueous solution via irradiation with a high-energy electron beam; this synthesis technique is referred to as the electron beam irradiation reduction method (EBIRM). To decrease the size of the Pt nanoparticles supported on the carbon particles, sodium phosphinate (NaPH2O2) was added as a phosphorus precursor to the precursor solution that contained Pt ions. The P–Pt/C samples were observed using a transmission electron microscope. The average particle size of the Pt nanoparticles decreased as the NaPH2O2 concentration in the precursor solution increased. The average particle size was in the range 0.9–3.4 nm. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt were estimated using cyclic voltammetry. In contrast to the average particle size, the ECSAs increased as the NaPH2O2 concentration was increased. The decrease in the size of the Pt nanoparticles using NaPH2O2 effectively increased the ECSA. This result indicated that the EBIRM combined with the use of NaPH2O2 to decrease the particle size is a useful and simple tool for the preparation of Pt nanoparticle catalysts with a high specific activity.
