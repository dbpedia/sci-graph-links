Abstract Si1âˆ’x Ge x heterostructures have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy, with nominal compositions of 10 and 15 at %. Analytical electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and ion channeling have been used in order to determine film thickness, Ge molar fraction and tetragonal distortion. The actual Ge concentrations were found to be smaller than the nominal ones. For all the SiGe films a coherent growth was found, with a small deviation from the perfect tetragonal distortion. The good agreement found between the results obtained by each analytical technique demonstrate that these methods of characterization are powerful tools for the control of the epitaxial layer parameters.
