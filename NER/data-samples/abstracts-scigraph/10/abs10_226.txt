Abstract We report on an “off-on” type of fluorescent assay for silver(I) ion determination that is based on the use of silver-specific DNA, gold nanoparticles, and Rhodamine B (RhoB). The random coil cytosine-rich silver-specific DNA undergoes structural transformation on capturing Ag(I), and this results in a change in the aggregation status of the gold nanoparticles and simultaneously affects the fluorescence intensity of RhoB that was added to the solution. The fluorescence intensity of RhoB is related to the concentration of Ag(I) in the 2.73 to 1500 ppb range, and the detection limit is 2.73 ppb. The method was applied to the determination of Ag(I) in (spiked) water samples. Conceivably, it also may be applied to fluorescence imaging silver ions and, by using other ion-specific DNAs, to detect other metal ions.
