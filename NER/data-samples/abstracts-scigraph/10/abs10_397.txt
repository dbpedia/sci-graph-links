Abstract Photo-responsive drug release systems are promising for drug delivery applications due to many benefits compared to conventional chemotherapy such as targeted, controlled release of a drug and reduced toxicity to healthy tissues. In this work, we report synthesis of the nanocomposite system based on carrier TiO2 nanoparticles and potential anticancer ruthenium complex, with light controllable release properties. Nanocomposite system showed biological activity and induced the generation of free radicals, which are implied in the efficient cell killing. The drug release tests demonstrated sustained release of the transition metal complex from the surface implying the potency for the controlled drug delivery system. Taking into account photoactivity of the Ru-complex, in the next step we have investigated the influence of green light on the rate of the complex release, and the results showed dependence of the Ru-complex release from the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles on the applied laser energy. Therefore, these characteristics make this nanocomposite system promising for the photo-responsive chemotherapy.
