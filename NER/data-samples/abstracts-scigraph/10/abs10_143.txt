Abstract We report on the first successful miniaturization of sandwich immunoassay into an extended nanospace channel for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein. A fused silica microchip with a nanochannel flanked by two microchannels, to facilitate liquid handling, was constructed using photo- and electron beam lithography, ICP and thermal bonding. Reagents could be selectively introduced into the nanochannel and the flow be stopped by using a pressure controller that alternatively opened and closed inlet and outlet ports. The construction and handling of the nano-in-microchip device for immunoassay is described.
