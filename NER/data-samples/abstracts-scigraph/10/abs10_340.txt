Abstract Therapeutic use of nano-silver is claimed to have reduced side effects and enhanced curative activity as compared to its ionic counterpart (silver ions). The present work aims to screen microbes for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), to formulate the nano-silver-based Carbopol gel and evaluating its wound healing efficacy on rat model. The goal was to develop the topical formulation based on bio-nano-silver to control the infection and healing the wounds with higher efficacy. Procedure involved the use of Saccharomyces boulardii for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles in the size range of 3–10 nm and these nanoparticles were used for the preparation of Carbopol-based nano-silver gel. Highly stable Carbopol nanogel was developed with good rheological properties. The burn wound healing potential of this nano-silver gel was evaluated on SD rats via visual observation, transepidermal water loss and histology of skin. Excellent wound healing was observed with AgNPs. Biologically synthesized AgNPs-based nano-silver gel showed superior wound healing efficacy as compared to marketed formulations and silver ions.
