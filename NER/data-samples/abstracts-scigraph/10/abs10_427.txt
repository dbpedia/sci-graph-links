Abstract Solar cells of the third generation (after the bulk and thin-film ones that are mainly based on inorganic semiconductors, mostly of silicon) use the leading technologies of the 21st century, including nanotechnologies based on nanomaterials, mainly based on nano-structured or ultrafine inorganic semiconductors, graphene, fullerenes, as well as polymers and low-molecular-weight organic semiconductors. This paper compares the results of an analysis of publications on solar cells, mainly nanostructured and nanoscale cells, that are reflected in the RZh Fizika VINITI RAN and included in the Web of Science database.
