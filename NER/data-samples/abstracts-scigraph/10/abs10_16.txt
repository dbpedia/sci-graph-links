Abstract Quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) is an upcoming nano-technology for its high speed and low power operation in the field of nano-science and nano-electronics. As QCA overcomes the drawbacks of CMOS technology, it has appreciable applications in quantum computation. There are thousands of designs of different logical circuits using QCA but there is no hazard free design of the logical circuits in the field of QCA. In a circuit, hazards always produce an unpredictable output which can be avoided. In this paper, both hazardous and hazard-free asynchronous sequential circuits are considered and compared in terms of kink energy. It is shown that hazard free asynchronous circuit performs better in terms of kink energy in the field of QCA.
