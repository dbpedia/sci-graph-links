Abstract Comparative integral assessment of the biological characteristics of the water samples of ice-covered Antarctic Lake Untersee was carried out using a new nanobiotechnological approach based on registration of biogenic nanoparticles of reduced silver Ag0. Formation of reduced silver nanoparticles occurred in all samples containing aboriginal microorganisms, while nanoparticles were not formed in the samples from which bacterial cells were removed. Size distribution of biogenic silver nanoparticles varied in the samples from five water horizons. The method proposed provides for rapid detection of live microbiological objects in the samples by detection of formation of biogenic nanoparticles of reduced silver. The method was termed OBNG (Observation of Biogenic Nanoparticles Growth).
