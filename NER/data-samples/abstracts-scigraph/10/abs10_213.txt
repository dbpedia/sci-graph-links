Abstract The polymerization of four fullerenes C28 in the cavity of closed single-walled carbon nanotube C740 was investigated. It was shown that the formation of the oligomer of four C28 fullerenes is observed at the pressure of 37.73Â GPa, which is created by means of the charged fullerene C60. Fullerene C60 moves under the influence of an external electric field.
