Abstract Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles were synthesized using precipitation method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was used to determine the structure of Co3O4 nanoparticles. The presence of Co3O4 nanoparticles was confirmed by the FTIR spectrum. The fact about the surface morphology of Co3O4 nanoparticles was revealed by scanning electron microscopic analysis. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the particle size of the Co3O4 nanoparticles. The absorption spectrum made it possible to analyze the optical properties of Co3O4 nanoparticles. This work contributes to the study of dielectric properties such as the dielectric loss and the dielectric constant of Co3O4 nanoparticles, at varied frequencies and temperatures. The magnetic properties of the Co3O4 nanoparticles were also investigated.
