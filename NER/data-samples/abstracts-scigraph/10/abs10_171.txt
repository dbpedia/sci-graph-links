Abstract Nanoscale Pt3Ni/functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) catalysts, successfully synthesized by anchoring nickel–platinum alloy nanoparticles on FMWCNTs, are presented in this paper. Compared with conventional commercial Pt/C catalysts, the preliminary results revealed that the Pt3Ni/FMWCNTs catalysts demonstrated not only higher specific activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but also outstanding stability. The enhancement in the stability of the Pt3Ni/FMWCNTs catalysts is believed to be due to the anchor effects in Pt3Ni alloy structure, the stronger interaction between Pt3Ni alloy nanoparticles and FMWCNTs, and the “π sites” anchoring centers for metal nanoparticles from CNTs with high graphite.
