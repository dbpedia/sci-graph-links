AbstractA redox luminescence switch was prepared by doping hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with CePO4:Tb. The resulting multifunctional material exhibits good biocompatibility, biological affinity, and potential drug-carrying capability. The luminescent hydroxyapatite nanoparticles may find important applications in biomedical diagnostics, drug delivery, and biological sensors. Graphical abstractThis work demonstrated a biocompatible redox luminescence switch based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. The as-synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles have a large surface area and exhibit high biological affinity. This study will be quite relevant for developing a new system that may be applied in studying enzyme or protein activities based on fluorescent nanoparticles.
