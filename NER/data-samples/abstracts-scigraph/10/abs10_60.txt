Abstract We report on the synthesis of SnO2 and CuO nanowires and their application as gas sensing components. The fabrication of SnO2 and CuO single nanowire devices by optical and electron beam lithography is described, and sensing performance to the toxic gas carbon monoxide is demonstrated. We briefly present the development of CMOS fabricated micro-hotplates as platforms for gas sensors and show our approach for nanowire implementation. Finally, we demonstrate a fully CMOS integrated CuO multi nanowire device and present our roadmap for a fully integrated multi-parameter smart sensor device which could be implemented as safety feature in smart phones.
