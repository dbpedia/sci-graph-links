Abstract A spatial cylindrical model on nano-bearing constructed by double-walled carbon nano-tube (DWCNT) is established. Two motion equations are advanced to characterize the eccentric and deflective mode of the nano-bearing, respectively. On the basis of these equations, the coaxial stability of the nano-bearing under two axis-deviation perturbations is investigated. A characteristic parameter 位* governing the coaxial stability of the nano-bearing is determined. The influences of the angular velocity, interlayer spacing and axial length of the nano-bearing on the characteristic parameter 位* are analyzed and discussed in detail. It is found that when the angular velocity or interlayer spacing is smaller than a certain critical value, the parameter 位* keeps negative, and the coaxial stability of the nano-bearing is maintained. However, the axial length has very insignificant influence on 位*. In addition, for the two non-coaxial modes, the eccentric mode occurs more easily than the deflective one. The results of this paper provide a further insight into the coaxial stability of nano-bearing via the spatial model.
