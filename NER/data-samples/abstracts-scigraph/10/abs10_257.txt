Abstract Pd and bimetallic PdRu nanoparticles supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon prepared by the microwave-assisted polyol process are examined as electrocatalysts for the electrooxidation of formic acid. The catalysts are characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Pd and PdRu nanoparticles with sizes of <10 nm display the characteristic diffraction peaks of a Pd face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure. It is found that the addition of Ru to Pd/C can decrease the lattice parameter of Pd (fcc) crystal. The electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts are evaluated in sulfuric acid solution containing 1 M formic acid using linear sweeping voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The results show that Pd5Ru1/C displays the best electrocatalytic performance among all catalysts for formic acid electrooxidation.
