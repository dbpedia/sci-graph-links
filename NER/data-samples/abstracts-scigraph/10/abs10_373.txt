Abstract We study a fourth-order elliptic equation in a domain with a curvilinear cut. There are unilateral constraints for the solution on the cut. Considering rather general sufficiently smooth perturbations of the domain, we study the asymptotics of the energy functional. We deduce a formula for the derivative of the energy functional with respect to the perturbation parameter of the domain.
