Abstract A thermodynamic analysis of phase transformations of nanoparticles under hydrostatic pressure has revealed important differences between phase transformations under isothermal or adiabatic conditions. This presuppositionless analysis fully explains a hysteresis with respect to the phase fraction and the pressure observed experimentally. It is important to mention that the results of this analysis may be transferred to the role of any external volumetric field acting on phase transforming nanoparticles. Typical examples are phase transformations of ferromagnetic intermetallics subjected to the influence of magnetic fields.
