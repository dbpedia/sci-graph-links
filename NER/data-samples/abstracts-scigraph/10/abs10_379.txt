Abstract Ultrashort laser pulses offer new jump in information and communication technology. Especially semiconductor laser based ultrafast photonic devices and systems are promising. We review our new approaches for femtosecond pulse generation, and thin film technology for broad band semiconductor optical amplifiers.
