Abstract We report on a nanoparticle-based fluorescent sensing scheme for urea. It is based on the finding that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) display pH-sensitive green fluorescence if photoexcited at 460 nm. Fluorescence is gradually quenched due to an increase in the local pH value as a result of the hydrolysis of urea as catalyzed by urease. The effect was used to quantify urea in the 0.1–100 mM concentration range, with a limit of detection of 0.01 mM. The method was successfully applied to the determination of urea in human serum samples. The method is simple, effective, and therefore holds promise as a platform for sensing urea in blood. Graphical AbstractThe pH-sensitive fluorescence of graphene quantum dots was used in a detection scheme for urea that exploits the increase in pH as a result of urease-catalyzed hydrolysis.
