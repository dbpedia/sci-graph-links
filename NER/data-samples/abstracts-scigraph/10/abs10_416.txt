Abstract A novel method of coating tin oxide particles with silver by an electroless plating process has been developed to produce silver-tin oxide electrical contact materials. A powder metallurgy process has been developed to consolidate the electroless plated silver- tin oxide composite powders. The effect of the various plating conditions on the morphology of the composite powder was studied using the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the scanning electron microscope (SEM). An optical microscope and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) were used to characterize the structure of the sintered silver-tin oxide compact. Ductility and hardness were measured to ensure that the mechanical properties are adequate, and electrical conductivity was also measured.
