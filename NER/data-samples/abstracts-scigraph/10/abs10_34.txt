Abstract A novel strategy to fabricate a hydrogen peroxide sensor based on Ag nanoparticles electrodeposited on chitosan-graphene oxide nanocomposites/cysteamine-modified gold (Au) electrode was reported. The chitosan-graphene oxide nanocomposites were first assembled on a cysteamine-modified Au electrode to produce chitosan-graphene oxide/cysteamine/Au electrode. Then Ag nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the modified Au electrode and formed Ag nanoparticles/chitosan-graphene oxide/cysteamine/Au electrode. The chitosan-graphene oxide nanocomposites and the electrodeposited Ag nanoparticles were characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed the Ag nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the chitosan-graphene oxide/cysteamine/Au electrode. The cyclic voltammagrams and amperometric method were used to evaluate electrocatalytic properties of the Ag nanoparticles/chitosan-graphene oxide/cysteamine/Au electrode. The results showed that the modified electrode displayed good electrocatalytic activity to the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with a detection limit of 0.7 μM hydrogen peroxide based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The sensor has good reproducibility, wide linear range, and long-term stability.
