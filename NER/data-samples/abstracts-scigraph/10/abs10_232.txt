Abstract Development of suitable supports has been proven as an important preparation process for high active catalysts of fuel cell. In this work, a carbon material was prepared by pyrolyzing cocoons with ferric chloride as activator, and then Pt nanoparticles (ca. 50Â wt.%) were deposited on its surface. The characteristics of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy showed that the face-centered cubic structured Pt nanoparticles with nano-sized crystals interconnected each other via grain boundaries were formed on the surface of pyrolyzed cocoons. Afterwards, electrochemical results demonstrate that the nanostructured Pt supported on this support exhibits higher catalytic activity and CO tolerance than Pt nanoparticles supported on Vulcan carbon for methanol oxidation reaction.
