Summary The measurements of nitric oxide density were made by the photoionization method at 30–90km in several rocket flights near Volgograd. TheseNO densities are well within the range of other measurements below 60km, but become rather high above 70km. The upper mesosphericNO densities estimated by two different methods from ionospheric data in Central Europe (50 °N) are rather high, as well. The appropriateNO densities in the upper mesosphere still seem to be an open question.
