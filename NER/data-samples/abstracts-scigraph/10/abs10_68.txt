Abstract Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-polyimide (PI) nanocomposite was prepared with different MWCNT concentrations and characterized for their piezoresistive response. The morphology and mechanical behavior of the nanocomposite was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and force–displacement spectroscopy respectively. The surface conductivity of the nanocomposite was determined by atomic force microscopy in current mode. Studies reveal that this nanocomposite will be useful for strain-sensing element in micro electro mechanical system (MEMS)/nano electro mechanical system (NEMS) based piezoresistive pressure sensor applications. The study shows that the nanocomposite with 2 % MWCNT content is a unique piezoresistive sensing element for MEMS/NEMS pressure sensor.
