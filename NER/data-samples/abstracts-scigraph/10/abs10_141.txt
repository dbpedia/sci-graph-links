Abstract For a given one-dimensional fixed boundary Γ in ℝ3 and a given constant c<0 we consider any one-dimensional free boundary F in ℝ3 subject to the conditions that the length of F is equal to c, that Γ and F form a closed boundary, and that the minimal surface S of dimension two being bounded by Γ and F minimizes the area among all comparison surfaces $$\tilde S$$ being bounded by Γ and some $$\tilde F$$ with length equal to c. This variational problem is known as the thread problem for minimal surfaces and stems from soap film experiments, in which the fixed boundary parts are pieces of wires and the free boundary parts are threads. The new result of this article will be that F has no singular points in ℝ3∖Γ, provided the admissible surfaces and boundary parts are supposed to be rectifiable flat chains modulo two.
