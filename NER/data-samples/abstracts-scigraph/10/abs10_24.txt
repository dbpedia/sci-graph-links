Abstract A significant shift of the surface plasmon resonance absorption spectrum of gold nanoparticles was obtained by the oxidation of the nanoparticle surface via pulsed excimer laser irradiation. The high UV-light absorption of gold nanoparticles chemically produced by citrate reduction led to the important surface oxidation up to 26%. As a result of laser irradiation, the gold/gold oxide core-shell nanoparticles with little variation of the nanoparticle size were produced. After only 5 min of laser irradiation, a 12-nm blue shift in surface plasmon resonance was obtained. The possible mechanisms governing the modification in surface plasmon resonance by laser irradiation of gold nanoparticles were discussed.
