Abstract When electron states in carbon nanotubes are characterized by two-dimensional wave vectors with the components K 1 and K 2 along the nanotube circumference and cylindrical axis, respectively, then two such vectors symmetric about a M-point in the reciprocal space of graphene are shown to be related by the time-reversal operation. To each carbon nanotube there correspond five relevant M-points with the following coordinates: K 1(1) = N/2R, K 2(1)= 0; K 1(2) = M/2R, K 2(2)= −π/T; K 1(3)= (2N −M)/2R, K 2(3)= π/T; K 1(4)= (M + N)/2R, K 2(4)= -π/T, and K 1(5)= (N − M)/2R, K 2(5)= π/T, where M and N are the integers relating the chiral, C h , symmetry, R, and translational, T, vectors of the nanotube by N R = C h + M T, T = |T|, and R is the nanotube radius. The states at the edges of the one-dimensional Brillouin zone, which are symmetric about the M-points with K 2 = ±π/T, are shown to be degenerate due to the time-reversal symmetry.
