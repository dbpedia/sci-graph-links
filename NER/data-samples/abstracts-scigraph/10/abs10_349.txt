Abstract A new preparation method for CuInS2 and CuInSe2 nanoparticles synthesis is described without using any organic solvent. Heating Cu, In, and S/Se precursors dissolved in water for 30 min in a microwave oven in the presence of mercapto-acetic acid leads to monodispersed chalcopyrite nanoparticles. No precipitation of these nanoparticles is observed after several months at room temperature. These new materials have been thoroughly characterized to confirm their compositions, sizes, and structure without any filtration. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed particle sizes below 5 nm. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) confirmed the chemical composition of these samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed a chalcopyrite-type structure with crystallite size of about 2 nm. No difference has been observed between batch and continuous synthesis processes. Cu x InS2 and Cu x InSe2 nanoparticles, with x < 1, have been also synthesized and identified. Simulation using a commercial software confirmed the difference between copper poor (Cu x InS2) and copper rich (CuInS2) chalcopyrite structures. Conventional spray deposition techniques have been used to form relatively thin films on solid substrates.
