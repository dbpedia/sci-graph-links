Abstract Functional capabilities of the scanning electrical-conductivity microscopy (SECM) in determining the electrical conductivity of nano-sized elements, studying the nanostructure of conductive coating materials, and evaluating the conductivity of nano-objects are described. The applicability of the SECM to finding imperfections in the multilevel metallization of integrated circuits with a nano-sized topology is demonstrated.
