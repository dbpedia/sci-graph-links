Abstract Structural, electrical, and optical properties of SnS nanoparticles and films deposited by ultrasound-assisted chemical bath were studied. The SnS was synthesized using tin chloride and thioacetamide as a tin and sulfur source, respectively. The obtained powder and films were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, particle size distribution analysis, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The synthesized SnS was crystalline in nature with an orthorhombic structure. To study the solar cell performance, the titanium dioxide photoanode was deposited on to the fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass (FTO) substrate. Further, the SnS was deposited on especially fabricated titanium dioxide film and the cell was made by using platinum-coated FTO as a counter electrode and a drop of polysulfide as an electrolyte.
