Abstract In this research, large amplitude free vibrations of a sandwich beam with stiff core and carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced face sheets are analysed. The distribution of CNTs across the thickness of the face sheets may be uniform or functionally graded. The equivalent single- layer theory of Timoshenko is used to construct the Hamiltonian of the beam under the von Kármán type of geometrical nonlinearity assumptions. A uniform temperature field through the beam is also included in the formulation. The Ritz method with polynomial basis functions is used to discrete the equations of motion and establish the matrix representation of the governing equations. A nonlinear eigenvalue problem is obtained and solved using a standard continuation procedure. After validating the developed solution method and formulation, parametric studies are conducted to examine the influences of thermal environment, core thickness-to-face sheet thickness ratio, boundary conditions, amplitude of vibrations, CNTs volume fraction and their distribution pattern. It is concluded that an increase in the volume fraction of CNTs results in higher fundamental frequency and decreases the nonlinear-to-linear frequency ratio.
