Abstract The incorporation of the curcumin into poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) nanospheres by the nanoprecipitation technique, the characterization of the nanoparticles and the schistosomicidal activity of the curcumin-loaded into PLGA nanospheres were reported. The incorporation process occurred with high efficiency and the images of field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed the production of spherically shaped particles. According to the dynamic light scattering measurements, the particles are nanometric and monodisperse. The curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (50 and 100 μM) caused the death of all worms and a separation between 50% and 100% of Schistosoma mansoni couples at concentrations from 30 μM. Moreover, the curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles also decreased the motor activity and caused partial alterations in the tegument of adult worms. This study marks the first time that schistosomicidal activity has been reported for curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles.
