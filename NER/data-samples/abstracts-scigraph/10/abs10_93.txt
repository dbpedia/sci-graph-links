Abstract It is suggested that highly polar molecules tend to aggregate into microclusters of various configurations. For neat liquids at high densities such clustering might account for the strong orientational correlations which have been observed in numerical simulations. Three examples are given to illustrate the far infrared spectroscopic properties of such microclusters: the fundamental modes of libration of linear “dimer” and “trimer”, and an adiabatic rotational mode in a seven dipoles cluster. In the latter example the rotational motions are concerted so that no potential barrier exist along a complete rotational cycle; consequently the corresponding absorption should extend over the thermal free rotation spectral region. Such an absorption has been recently observed by F.I.R. spectroscopy in liquid methyl chloride.
