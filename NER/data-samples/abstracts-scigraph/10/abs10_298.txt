Abstract Fabrication of multifunctional nanocomposites that are simultaneously magnetic, stable, and biocompatible is critical for their application in bioanalysis but remains a challenge. In this study, Fe3O4@C–Au nanocomposites were prepared by a rapid microwave-hydrothermal procedure followed by the layer-by-layer assembly for this intention. The morphologies, composition, phase structures, and magnetic properties of the nanocomposites were well-characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and superconducting quantum interference device. The nanocomposites have the sizes of about 200 nm in diameter. They integrate the advantages of the satisfactory stability of carbon shell, the good biocompatibility and conductivity of Au nanoparticles as well as the excellent magnetic properties of Fe3O4 core. Furthermore, a novel biosensor based on the multifunctional nanocomposites was fabricated after the immobilization of hemoglobin and the direct electrochemistry was studied. The proposed biosensor exhibits wide linear range, high sensitivity, good reproducibility, and stability. The presented multifunctional nanocomposites provide an alternative and effective matrix for the direct electrochemistry of proteins and might have potential applications in biosensing and drug delivery.
