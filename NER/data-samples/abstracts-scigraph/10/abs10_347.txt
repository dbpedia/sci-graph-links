Summary We study the title nonlinear problem for a rubberlike material by using the domain perturbation method. The perturbation is deviation from unity of the ratio of the minor to the major axes of the ellipse. For the body containing an ellipsoidal void, two different loadings are considered; one in which the void surface is taken to be traction free and a uniform compressive load is applied at infinity, and the other in which a uniform pressure is applied to the void surface and null tractions at infinity. For the case of a rigid inclusion, uniform normal tensile tractions are applied at infinity. It is shown that a slight deviation from the circular shape of the cavity or the inclusion has a noticeable effect on the maximum stresses induced in the nonlinear elastic body.
