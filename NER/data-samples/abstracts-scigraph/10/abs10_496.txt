Abstract. We investigate the effect of the laser field on the polarization fluctuation of excitons in graphene ribbons. In order to calculate the fluctuation, we develop a bosonization method to deal with the electron-hole system. Our results show that the polarization fluctuation may be controlled by adjusting the strength and frequency of the laser field. The insulating armchair graphene ribbons may be divided into two types according to the width-dependences of the excitonic polarization fluctuation.
