Abstract EIS (electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor) sensors based on the functionalization of uncoated gold nanoparticles supported on a Si/SiO2 structure are presented. Oxygen plasma etching at moderate power (<200 W) provides a convenient and efficient way to remove organic capping agents from the gold nanoparticles without significant damage. Higher power intensities destroy the linkage between the SiO2 and the gold nanoparticles, and some of the gold nanoparticles are removed from the surface. The flat-band potential shift, i.e. the pH dependence of the gold-coated EIS sensors is similar (33 mV/pH) to the uncoated EIS pH-sensor. Lead, penicillin and glucose sensors were prepared by immobilization of β-cyclodextrin, penicillinase and glucose oxidase by various immobilization techniques.
