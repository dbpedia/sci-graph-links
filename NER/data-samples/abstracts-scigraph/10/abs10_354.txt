Conclusions 1.High pressure slows down the transformation of austenite.2.The structure of bainite and pearlite obtained under high pressure is no different from that of ordinary bainite and pearlite obtained at atmospheric pressure.3.Pearlite obtained under pressure has larger distances between platelets than pearlite obtained at the same temperature under atmospheric pressure.4.The pearlitic region broadens under pressure, extending to lower temperatures than under atmospheric pressure, which is probably due to suppression of the bainitic transformation under high pressure. Low-temperature pearlite obtained under pressure is very fine; the cementite platelets are broken up.5.The variation of the mechanical properties of pearlite obtained under pressure conform with the changes in its structure â€” coarse pearlite has a low ductility, the strength and ductility increase with decreasing distance between platelets of pearlite.
