Abstract Morphology of synthetic imogolite nanotubes formed in droplet evaporation was investigated by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The nanotubes form a dense entangled network at higher concentrations, while at lower concentrations the nanotubes are liable to form oriented bundles. Under enthanol atmosphere, individual dispersion of nanotubes was observed for the first time, which reveals the length polydispersity of synthetic imogolite nanotubes.
