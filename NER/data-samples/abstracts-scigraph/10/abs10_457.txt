Abstract The ionized gas in NGC 1313 was studied by spectrophotometric means. The radial behaviour of theI(HÎ±)/I(6584),I(6717)/I(6731),N(Nii)/N(Hii), andN(Nii)/N(Sii) ratios and the deduced electron densities are discussed. The abundance ratiosN(N)/N(H) andN(N)/N(S) for the nucleus and two emission regions were also derived and compared with previous data.
