Abstract Hexagonal mesostructured films containing silver ions were obtained by sol–gel method. Brij 58 was used to produce channels into the film, which house these ions. The films were exposure to UV radiation to produced silver metallic nanoparticles. The presence of the metallic nanoparticles was determined by infrared spectroscopy and optical absorption. Besides, these nanoparticles and core–shell structures of silver–silver oxide nanoparticles were identified by high-resolution transmission electronic microscopy. From these measurements, the obtained size range for silver nanoparticles was 6.1 nm. The absorption spectrum located at 440 nm was modelled and well fitted with the Gans theory considering refractive index higher than the one coming from host matrix. This index is explained because the silver oxide shell modifies the local surrounding medium of the metallic nanoparticles.
