Abstract The traditional phase field method adopts periodic boundary conditions and thus can only be applied to a continuous medium. In this manuscript, an extended phase field model is developed to simulate the polarization switching in a finite ferroelectric body with free surfaces. The void region outside the ferroelectric body was modeled as an elastic body having the same elastic stiffness as the ferroelectrics as well as properly distributed eigenstrain which functions to satisfy the traction-free boundary condition. Based on this scheme, periodic boundary conditions can be applied to the discrete system including a finite ferroelectric body and the voids outside. The elastically inhomogeneous system can be solved easily. This model has high calculation efficiency and can be conveniently applied to finite ferroelectric bodies with arbitrary boundaries. Finally, the domain pattern formation in a ferroelectric nano-particle is simulated. The obtained polarization pattern and stress field are illustrated.
