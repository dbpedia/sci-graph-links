Abstract Composite materials were synthesized by encapsulating Au and Ag nanoparticles in an agar gel matrix. These metallic nano-particles were found to be separately stored, so their optical, catalytic, and antibacterial properties were retained both in the composite gel and a composite membrane. The composite gels were stable under hard external conditions. Based on this, a sensor for the detection of Hg2+ was developed using the Au nanoparticle/agar composite gel. Antibacterial materials were achieved using the Ag nanoparticle/agar composite gel and composite membrane. These two Ag nanoparticle-based materials showed good antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
