Abstract A nanocomposite consisting of coral-like gold nanostructures on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was synthesized with the assistance of dimethylbiguanide (DMBG). It was then fabricated on a glassy carbon electrode, coating with cysteamine in order to enable the immobilization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as a model enzyme whose activity of hydrolyzing the substrate of acetylthiocholine is inhibited by the pesticide triazophos. The biosensor has response to acetylthiocholine in the 0.3 ~ 300 μM concentration range at 0.65 V (vs. SCE). The inhibition of the enzyme by triazophos can be determined in concentrations of up to 210 ppb, with a detection limit of 0.35 ppb of triazophos (S/N = 3). The biosensor is highly reproducible and acceptably stable. Graphical AbstractCoral-like gold nanostructures supported on reduced graphene oxide were synthesized with the assistance of dimethylbiguanide to fabricate an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor, which exhibited high reproducibility and good stability, providing a good platform for the detection of organophosphorus pesticides.
