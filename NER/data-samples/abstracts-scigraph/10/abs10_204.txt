Abstract Two new adsorbents were synthesized by covalently grafting 2,3-Bis(2-formylphenoxy)-propan-1-ol (BH) onto the surface of silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles and silica gel by a conventional method and a vice-versa method. The morphology and properties of the adsorbents were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM, VSM, TGA, UV-Vis, Optical microscope and DLS. The materials are shown to be effective adsorbents for the selective extraction of the ions of Au(III), Pd(II) and Ag(I) from aqueous mixed metal ions solution also containing Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and Pb(II). Syringe and batch techniques are compared. The ions can be desorbed with 0.5 M HCl and quantified by FAAS. The maximum adsorption capacity of the MN-Si-NH2-BH and Si-NH2-BH were determined to be 257, 197 mg·g−1 for Au(III), 311, 191 mg·g−1 for Ag(I) and 301, 222 mg·g−1 for Pd(II), respectively. The detection limits (for n = 15 and at an S/N ratio of 2 blank standard deviations) are 0.12, 0.28, and 0.17 μg·L−1 for Au(III), Pd(II) and Ag(I), respectively. Graphical AbstractSynthesis of two new adsorbents, silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles and silica gel modified with 2,3-Bis(2-formylphenoxy)-propan-1-ol with normal and vice-versa methods. The prepared magnetic and non-magnetic adsorbents were applied to selective extraction of noble metal ions including Au(III), Pd(II) and Ag(I) ions from aqueous solutions using syringe and batch techniques.
