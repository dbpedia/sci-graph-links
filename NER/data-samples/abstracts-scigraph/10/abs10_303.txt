Abstract We report on the research of the stability of partitioned (bamboo-like) carbon nanotubes with different diameters. The stability of the partitioned carbon nanotubes of the smallest diameter were determined by the tight-binding method. For the prediction of the destruction regions of the bamboo-like nanotubes atomic framework subjected to strain the new original method of the calculation of the local stress of atomic network was developed. Using this method it was shown that partitioned carbon nanotubes with a diameter of 2.02Â nm are stable. These partitioned carbon nanotubes with chirality (15,15) are the most stable partitioned carbon nanotubes with the smallest diameter.
