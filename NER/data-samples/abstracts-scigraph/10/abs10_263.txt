Abstract The nanostructure of self-ordered porous anodic TiO2 nanotubes (PATNTs) has extraordinary influence on their physical and chemical properties. For this reason, extensive attention has been paid on pulse anodization to regulate the nanostructure of PATNT. However, the relationships between the nanostructures and current curves still remain unclear. Based on the traditional potentiostatic and pulse anodizations, five different modes (i.e., potentiostatic, pulse, triangle wave, decrease, and increase step by step) of applied voltage and their influences on the nanostructures of PATNT have been investigated in detail. The growing rates of the nanotubes anodized under five different modes were compared for the first time. The results show that the growing rate of pulse voltage anodization is the fastest, reaching 116.4 nm min−1. The slowest is triangle wave voltage anodization, only 59.3 nm min−1. When the applied voltage decreases step-by-step, branched nanotubes can be formed in the bottom of PATNT. Yet, when the applied voltage increases step-by-step, triple-layer nanotubes with different diameters are formed, and the forming mechanism of this special nanostructure is discussed. The present results may be helpful to understand the mechanism of PATNT and facilitate the assembling diverse nanostructures for extensive applications in photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells, and biomedical devices.
