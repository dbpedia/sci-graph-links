Abstract In this paper, the surface plasmon resonance-enhanced optical absorption in thin silicon solar cells through aluminum sphere nanoparticles (NPs) was investigated. The effect of particle size and the distance between particles on absorption enhancement is studied using a finite-difference time-domain technique. The results showed that an enhancement of 40Â % in absorption could be achieved by integrating the aluminum particles on thin silicon solar cells with the proper combination of NP parameters compared to those without aluminum particles. The work is useful for the further theoretical study and design for the plasmonic thin-film solar cell.
