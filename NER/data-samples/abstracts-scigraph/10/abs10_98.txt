Abstract. The dielectric function of yttrium in the range between 0.2 μm and 2 μm is composed of a harmonic oscillator contribution due to a discrete interband transition and the contribution of free electrons. Hence, it is possible to discuss surface plasmon polaritons as well as other electronic resonances in the optical extinction spectra of yttrium nanoparticles. For the latter, we discuss the broadening of the resonance caused by the aggregation of particles. When particles are lumped into aggregates, the color of the particle system also changes. Aggregation also affects the surface plasmon resonance in yttrium nanoparticles in a way comparable to silver or gold nanoparticle aggregates. Comparison is made with the first experimental results on yttriumnanoparticles, showing that aggregation is the dominant effect for the broad resonance in the measured extinction spectra.
