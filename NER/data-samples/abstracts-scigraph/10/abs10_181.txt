Abstract In this study, we investigate the axisymmetric deformation of a geometrically imperfect circular graphene sheet subjected to a uniform radial load using nonlocal elasticity theory. Due to the imperfection of the graphene sheet, an inhomogeneous version of Besselâ€™s equation is derived as a nonlocal governing equation of the system. Closed-form expressions are obtained to predict the deformations of the graphene sheet as functions of the radius, small-scale coefficient, initial imperfection, and bending rigidity of the graphene sheet. Furthermore, relations are proposed to determine critical radial loads. The present model indicates that it is necessary to include the effect of an initial imperfection as well as the small-scale effect.
