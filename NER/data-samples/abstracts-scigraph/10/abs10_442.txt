Abstract A method is described for measuring specific transient resistances of ohmic contacts to thin semiconductor layers by experimentally taking into account the spreading resistance. Studies are performed by this method on the way in which the specific transient resistances of AuGe-Ni and Au-Ni contacts to n-type gallium phosphide depend on the brazing temperature.
