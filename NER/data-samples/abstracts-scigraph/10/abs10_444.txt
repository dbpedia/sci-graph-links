It is shown that a charged Brownian nanoparticle (or an electron) similar to a two-level atom can generate spontaneous and induced radiation upon switching on an external field. The diffusion mechanism of charging nanoparticles is examined. The radiation process is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon, which can be used in synthetic biology, medicine, and other fields of science and engineering.
