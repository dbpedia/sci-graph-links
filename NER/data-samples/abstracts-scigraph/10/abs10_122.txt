Abstract Degenerative changes of saphenous vein grafts in four preparation media (heparinized whole blood at room temperature and 4°C, and heparinized normal saline at same temperatures) were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and fibrinolytic autography. Following 60–90 min. storage in heparinized normal saline at room temperature, marked morphological changes were present in the media, accompanied by swellingof the endothelial cells, however the tunica media and adventitia were well preserved even after 120 minutes in all of the four preparation media. The decrease in fibrinolytic activity was comparable to the observed morphological changes. In heparinized whole blood at 4°C, degenerative changes were slow and mostly of a slight nature.
