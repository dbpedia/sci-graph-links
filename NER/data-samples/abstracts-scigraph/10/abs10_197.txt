Abstract This study uses the atomic-scale finite element method to analyze the mechanical response of armchair and zigzag nanoporous graphene (NPG) membranes with varying porosity, pore number, graphene size, and applied loading levels. The present result is in agreement with that of a previous study regarding the normalized Young’s modulus of the NPG membranes. According to our analysis, Young’s modulus ratio of the armchair membrane to the zigzag NPG membrane decreases with an increase in porosity. However, the effect of the pore number on the Young’s modulus ratio slightly increases with porosity. In addition, the size of graphene has a more evident effect on the shear modulus ratio of the armchair membrane to the zigzag NPG membrane than on Young’s modulus ratio.
