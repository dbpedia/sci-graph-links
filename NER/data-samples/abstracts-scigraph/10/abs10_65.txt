Abstract This paper reports the fabrication of nanoscale mechanical relays using a nanoimprint technology, called contact-transfer and mask-embedded lithography. This cost effective method facilitates the fabrication of nanoscale metallic source electrodes in one easy step. For the design and simulation of relays, we developed a purpose-built system to measure the resonant frequency of TiN nano-structures to determine the mechanical properties of nanoscale thin films. The results presented a Young’s modulus of approximately 600 GPa and residual stress low enough to be disregarded in the proposed process. Finally, we succeeded in fabricating three-terminal nano-relays of various lengths, the operation of which was demonstrated by measuring the I–V curve of each device. Measured pull-in voltages were compared with those of the simulation results.
