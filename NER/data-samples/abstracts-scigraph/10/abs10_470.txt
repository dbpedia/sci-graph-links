Abstract Transmission electron microscopy is utilized to study the gels formed from aqueous solutions of L-cysteine and silver nitrate on a nanolevel structure in the presence of various anions. It is established that the anionâ€™s charge and geometrical size have an existential effect on the structure and mechanical properties of the spatial gel-network.
