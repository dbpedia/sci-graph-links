Abstract A strong negative correlation has been found between the growth rate of young rice seedlings as well as the coefficient of variation affecting it and the P indices of the chemical test of Piccardi. The correlation coefficients exceed 0.9 with a probability of null hypothesis which is extremely low. The biological effects appear to be due to electromagnetic radiations accompanying the solar eruptions, whereas the chemical test appears to be influenced by the subsequent corpuscular emission.
