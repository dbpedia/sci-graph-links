Abstract We developed the theory of Coulomb drag current induced in a one-dimensional nanowire by the ballistic nonohmic current in a nearby parallel nanowire under the ballistic transport regime. As in the ohmic case, we predict sharp oscillations of the drag current as a function of gate voltage or chemical potential of electrons. We also study the dependence of drag current on the voltage V across the driving wire. For relatively large values of V, the drag current is proportional to V 2.
