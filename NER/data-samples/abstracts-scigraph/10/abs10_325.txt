Abstract The actual methods of detection and identification of manufactured nanoparticles in both simple and complex multi-component matrix for assessing biological effects and safety of nanotechnology products have been reviewed. The detection of priority species of biologically active nanoparticles, which include fullerenes, singleand multi-walled carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles of silver, gold, titanium oxide, aluminum, cerium, zinc and silicon, has been given a special attention. The requirements for sample preparation have been discussed. The results of the successful application for the detection of manufactured nanoparticles in biosamples with methods of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, size exclusion chromatography, field-flow fractionation, electrophoretic, light scattering, spectrophotometry, fluorescent spectroscopy, X-ray and other spectrometry, mass spectrometry, “particle counters”, immunochemistry have been reviewed. The possibilities and limitations of different techniques, and their complementarity have been analyzed.
