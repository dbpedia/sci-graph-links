Abstract This paper presents a theoretical model showing the effect of impact ionization on the efficiency of a solar cell. An electric field is applied to a silicon solar cell, inducing ionization of charge carriers. Based on the detailed balance limit calculation, the results show an increase in efficiency with the increase of the electric field in the scale on which carrierâ€™s multiplication is observed.
