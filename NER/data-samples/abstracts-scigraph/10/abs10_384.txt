Abstract In this study, the optical generation rate and surface recombination velocity (SRV) of the emitter layer of a thin-film silicon solar cell, which depend on the depth, width, and number of nano-holes on the cell’s surface, were simulated and investigated. The trade-off between the optical generation rate and SRV was examined in terms of short-circuit current density (J sc ), open-circuit voltage (V oc ), and conversion efficiency (η) using a two-step simulation. The simulated results indicated that a thin-film solar cell with a proper nano-hole structure on the emitter layer can be used to achieve much higher J sc and η performances.
