Abstract Letf be aC r diffeomorphism,r≥2, of a two dimensional manifoldM 2, and let Λ be a horseshoe off (i.e. a transitive and isolated hyperbolic set with topological dimension zero). We prove that there exist aC r neighborhoodU off and a neighbourhoodU of Λ such that forg∈U, the Hausdorff dimension of ∩ n g n (U) is aC r−1 function ofg.
