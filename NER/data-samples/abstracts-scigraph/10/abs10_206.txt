Abstract Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) were deposited on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) by in-situ thermal decomposition of gold acetate under solvent and reducing agent free conditions to obtain a nanohybrid of AuNP-MWCNT. A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was then modified with the nanohybrid and used for amperometric determination of hydrazine. The modified GCE showed an improved electrocatalytic effect towards hydrazine oxidation at a working potential of about 0.30 V (vs Ag|AgCl,KClsat). The calibration plot for hydrazine is linear in two concentration ranges, viz. from 0.1–100 μM and 0.2–1 mM. The respective sensitivities are 4.98 and 4.00 μA μM−1cm−2, and the limit of detection (at S/N = 3) is about 30 nM. Graphical abstractSchematic presentation of the electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrazine using a glassy carbon electrode modified with gold nanoparticle-decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes at the potential of 0.303 V vs. Ag|AgCl, KClsat. This modified electrode shows high sensitivity and low detection limit by hydrodynamic amperometry.
