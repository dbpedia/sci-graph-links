Abstract Fragmentation to neutral atoms has been observed in the laser photolysis of phenylsilane, C6H5SiH3. A tunable dye laser (UV region) was used both to photolyze the molecule and to probe the resulting fragments. Atomic silicon and carbon lines (two photon resonances) are prominent in the multiphoton dissociation/ionization spectrum of phenylsilane.
