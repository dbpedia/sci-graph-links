Summary The effects of the two neutron final state interaction in the reaction Σ−+d→(Λ0 or Σ0)+n+n are calculated using the impulse approximation with the assumption ofS-wave absorption and even relative parity between hyperons. Comparing the results with those neglecting all final state interactions, one finds that the Σ0 production can be enhanced by a factor ∼6 while the Λ0 production is increased by only ∼10%. The most recent experimental results on the branching ratio of the two hyperon-productions can now be fit with a less extreme assumption about the spin dependence of the transition matrix for the reaction Σ−+p→Σ0+n, although an appreciable amount of spin dependence is still required. The effect of the dineutron final state interaction on the Λ0 momentum spectrum is calculated as a function of the spin dependence of the Λ0 production process. The present experimental data, however, are not sufficient to determine this spin dependence.
