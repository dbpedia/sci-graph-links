Abstract A new method is proposed to implement an optical S-R flip-flop by polarization encoded light signal, necessary optical nonlinear material and half-wave plate. In this system the real time speed of operation can be achieved, and at the time of transmission the average power of a byte remains constant. This polarization encoded flip-flop can act as a memory cell.
