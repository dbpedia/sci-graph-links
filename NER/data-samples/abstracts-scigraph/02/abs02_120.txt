Abstract. The usual text book one-particle Green's function possesses a self-energy that is known to be an optical potential for elastic scattering. The introduction of an optical potential reduces the complex many-body scattering problem into a tractable one-body problem. In this work the definition of the Green's functions is extended. The defined inelastic functions are shown to possess self-energies that can be expressed in closed form in terms of the target states. It is proven that these self-energies are optical potentials for inelastic scattering. The properties of these potentials and working equations for the scattering wave functions are discussed.
