Abstract The improved phonon confinement model developed previously [11] is applied for definition of germanium nanocrystal sizes from the analysis of its Raman scattering spectra. The calculations based on the model allow determining the sizes of germanium nanocrystals more precisely from the analysis of their Raman spectra. In some cases, the comparative analysis of Raman data and electron microscopy data is carried out, and good agreement is observed.
