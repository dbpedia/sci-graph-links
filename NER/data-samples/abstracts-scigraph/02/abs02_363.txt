Abstract At solar maximum, the large-scale structure of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) reflects the complexity of the Sun's coronal magnetic fields. The corona is characterised by mostly closed magnetic structures and short-lived, small coronal holes. The axis of the Sun's dipole field is close to the solar equator; there are also important contributions from the higher order terms. This complex and variable coronal magnetic configuration leads to a much increased variability in the HMF on all time scales, at all latitudes. The transition from solar minimum to solar maximum conditions, as reflected in the HMF, is described, as observed by Ulysses during its passage to high southern heliolatitudes. The magnetic signatures associated with the interaction regions generated by short-lived fast solar wind streams are presented, together with the highly disordered period in mid-1999 when there was a considerable reorganisation in coronal structures. The magnetic sector structure at high heliolatitudes shows, from mid-1999, a recognisable two-sector structure, corresponding to a highly inclined Heliospheric Current Sheet. A preliminary investigation of the radial component of the magnetic field indicates that it remains, on average, constant as a function of heliolatitude. Intervals of highly Alfv√©nic fluctuations in the rarefaction regions trailing the interaction regions have been, even if intermittently, identified even close to solar maximum.
