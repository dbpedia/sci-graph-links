Abstract Tumors originating in the parapharyngeal space are rare and are fascinating to the surgeon in view of the anatomical complexity of the area, varied histological type of tumors encountered and the impressive size which some of these tumors attain before becoming clinically evident. We report a rare case of schwannoma arising from the cervical sympathetic chain presenting as a mass in the parapharyngeal space.
