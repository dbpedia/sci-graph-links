Abstract The equivalence principle is necessary for the validity of Newtonian mechanics, since only in this case can one consider an isolated system, neglecting the attraction of distant bodies. The possibility of verifying the equivalence principle by observations of the structure of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe is discussed. It is pointed out that the existence of horizons with “valve” properties -a one-way exchange of information—contradicts the equivalence principle.
