Abstract The “mixing distance” introduced by E. Ruch and A. Mead defining a partial order of probability distributions is used for the discussion of the stability of steady states in nonlinear thermodynamics. A stability criterion for finite deviations is formulated, including the approach to the steady state in the sense of decreasing mixing distance as “mixing confluence”. As examples, chemically reacting systems of different types are discussed.
