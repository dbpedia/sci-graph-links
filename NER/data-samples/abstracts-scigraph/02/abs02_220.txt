Abstract A method for real-time processing of phase fluctuations of a laser beam is described. A beat photocurrent whose phase undergoes random fluctuations is generated by two laser beams at different frequencies, propagating through a turbulent atmosphere. The phase fluctuation component of the beat can be recovered in real-time over a wide range of phase angle, not restricted within 2Ï€, by a specially designed circuit. Probability density functions, autocorrelation functions, and variances of the phase fluctuations are displayed in real-time as most basic quantities of the fluctuations.
