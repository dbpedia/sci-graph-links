Summary The neutron scattering by238U nucleus in the energy range (0.05รท15) MeV has been analysed in terms of a rotational-optical model. A linear dependence by target deformation has been assumed for the interaction potential. For the dipole and quadrupole strengths diffuse edge optical potentials have been adopted. With a reasonable choice of the free parameters a good fit of the experimental data has been obtained in the energy range considered.
