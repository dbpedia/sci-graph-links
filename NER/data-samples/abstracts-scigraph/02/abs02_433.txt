Conclusion The space observatory whose major systems are outlined in the present paper is being designed to ensure astrophysical explorations in the field of γ-ray astronomy during the course of one year. The observatory is supposed to travel along a circular orbit up to 400 km in altitude, inclined at 51.6°. Investigations to be accomplished in the observatory will enable us to make substantial progress in gaining a deeper insight into a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena.
