Abstract Liquid crystal devices as a medium for holograms storage have been investigated. Long term memory effects in LC cells have been observed. Experiments proved that certain combination of insulating alignment layers has a major influence on the long term memory effect. Optimal liquid crystal cell construction allows us to achieve sufficient diffraction efficiency to record holographic patterns and to develop a re-writable holographic medium. The configuration of PVK and polyimide layers in LC cell construction with specific LC mixture was tested. The method of permanent and re-writable recording of optical data (holographic pattern) onto LC cells was achieved. However, the method of erasing recorded data was realized but mechanisms of this phenomenon are not clearly understood yet.
