Abstract Spontaneous biloma is an uncommon entity. We report a case of subcapsular biloma in an elderly patient with a nonobstructed biliary channel, without prior history of surgery, instrumentation, or trauma. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging are described. We believe that this is the first reported case of spontaneous subcapsular biloma of idiopathic origin.
