Abstract The discovery of neutron rich isotopes of the lightest elements on the neutron drip line exhibiting a halo structure has opened up new vistas in research activities. The novel structural features associated with the halo phenomena have been the subject for extensive theoretical and experimental investigations in recent times. In this talk, I propose to present a broad overview of the recent developments in this field, bringing out the striking features which show that a large number oflight nuclei near the neutron drip line are characterized by a clear separation between a ‘normal’ core nucleus and a loosely bound low density veil of neutrons. Specifically, the two neutron halos offer a natural premises, from a theoretical standpoint, to employ three body techniques for studying their detailed structural properties. A considerable part of the talk will be devoted to report and highlight the results on a number of light halo nuclei such as 11Li, 11Be, 19B and 22C on which we have been carrying out investigations employing a simple but realistic three body model. These three body systems which have been termed as ‘Borromean’ (i.e while three body systems are bound, the corresponding binary subsystems on the other hand are unbound) are characterized by large spacial extension and very low separation energy of the neutron. They are, therefore, ideally suited for exploring the possibility of the existence of Efimov states in two neutron halo nuclei. We have recently carried out the three body analyses to predict the possibility of the occurrence of such states on which experimental work at various laboratories is underway.
