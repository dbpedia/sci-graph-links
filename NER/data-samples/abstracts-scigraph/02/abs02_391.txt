Abstract A large set of coronal mass ejections CMEs (6621) has been selected to study their dynamics seen with the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) field of view (LFOV). These events were selected based on having at least six height-time measurements so that their dynamic properties, in the LFOV, can be evaluated with reasonable accuracy. Height-time measurements (in the SOHO/LASCO catalog) were used to determine the velocities and accelerations of individual CMEs at successive distances from the Sun. Linear and quadratic functions were fitted to these data points. On the basis of the best fits to the velocity data points, we were able to classify CMEs into four groups. The types of CMEs do not only have different dynamic behaviors but also different masses, widths, velocities, and accelerations. We also show that these groups of events are initiated by different onset mechanisms. The results of our study allow us to present a consistent classification of CMEs based on their dynamics.
