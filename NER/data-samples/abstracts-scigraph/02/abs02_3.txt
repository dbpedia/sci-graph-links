Abstract The microchemistry of interfaces and corresponding interlayers in different fibre-reinforced ceramic and glass composite systems has been investigated by using a dedicated scanning transmission electron microscope demonstrating the potential applicabilities of such an instrument to this large field of materials science. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy were used to determine the materials composition on a nanometre scale. Besides analyses performed in the spot mode of the electron probe the distributions of the elements present in the interface region were measured as line profiles across the relevant interface structure by X-ray spectroscopy with a lateral resolution of about 5 nm, even for the detection of a light element as carbon. Moreover, in the composite systems under investigation the two-dimensional element distribution was also attained by energy-filtered imaging. In addition, first results of energy loss near edge structure analyses are presented indicating variations of the chemical bonding of silicon at the interface in a Nicalon fibre/Duran glass composite.
