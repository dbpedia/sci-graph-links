Summary Ovaries ofC. erythrocephala synthesize large amounts of poly(A)+ and poly(A)− RNA during early and middle stages of oogenesis as shown by labelling with3H-uridine in vivo. After incubation for 1 h, a striking difference in the electrophoretic pattern of newly synthesized labelled poly(A)+ RNA and the poly(A)+ RNA present in sufficient amounts for optical density measurements (steady state poly(A)+ RNA) was observed. During early and mid-oogenesis, in the poly(A)− RNA fraction, ≧4S predominantly mature rRNA, 5S RNA and tRNA were labelled. These fractions were no longer synthesized during late oogenesis, whereas poly(A)+ RNA was labelled continously During oogenesis stage specific differences in the size distribution of newly synthesized and steady state poly(A)+ RNA were not obvious. However, different sizes of labelled poly(A)+ RNA species were detected in 0–2h old preblastoderm embryos, after injection of3H-uridine into females either 3–4 days (stage 3–4 of oogenesis) or 24 h before oviposition (stage 5–6 of oogenesis). This difference in RNA synthesis was related to the presence of active nurse cell nuclei. The poly(A)+ RNA fraction represents about 2–3% of the total RNA in both ovaries and freshly laid eggs as judged by measurements of optical density and radioactivity bound to oligo(dT). The length of poly(A)-segments in ovarian poly(A)+ RNA varied from about 30 to 200 nucleotides.
