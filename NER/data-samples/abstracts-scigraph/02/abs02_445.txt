Abstract Quantum renormalization group scheme provides a microscopic understanding of holography through a general mapping between the beta functions of underlying quantum field theories and the holographic actions in the bulk. We show that the Einstein gravity emerges as a holographic description upto two derivative order for a matrix field theory which has no other operator with finite scaling dimension except for the energymomentum tensor. We also point out that holographic actions for general large N matrix field theories respect the inversion symmetry along the radial direction in the bulk if the beta functions of single-trace operators are gradient flows with respect to the target space metric set by the beta functions of double-trace operators.
