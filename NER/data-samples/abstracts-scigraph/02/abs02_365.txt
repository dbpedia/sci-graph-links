Abstract On the basis of a study concerning the optical transparency of atmospheric mists, an analysis is made of the relation between the attenuation by aerosols and the relative air humidity under autumn conditions (radiation wavelengths within the 0.56–12.0 Μ range). It is shown that the attenuation coefficient changes nonmonotonically as the humidity increases from 40 to 100%. Hypothetical mechanisms of interaction between aerosol particles and water vapor are suggested which would explain this trend.
