Abstract A dimensionless equation is derived for determining the energy dissipation between the screw rib and the sleeve of an extruder for a Newtonian model extrudate. The parameter ranges, within which the pressure at the exit from the screw and some geometrical parameters do not affect the dissipation, are indicated.
