Abstract From QCD sum rules the model-independent estimates of widths of radiative decaysJ/ψ→Pγ,Sγ and ϒ→Pγ,Sγ are obtained with 0(αS) accuracy, whereP (S) is a light pseudoscalar (scalar) particle of the axion (Higgs boson) type. Deviation of QCD predictions from the Wilczek nonrelativistic formula for these widths turned out to be inessential.
