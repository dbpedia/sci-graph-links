Abstract We have analyzed backward meson production inπ + p reactions at 20GeV/c, which were measured in the CERN Ω spectrometer triggered by a fast proton (p f ), in experiment WA56. Production via baryon exchange of quasi-two-body final statesΔ ++ (1232)ρ 0 (770),Δ ++ (1232)f 2 (1270), andΔ ++ (1232)ρ 30 (1690) is clearly identified. The density matrix elements of meson resonances and ofΔ ++ (1232) are analyzed. We have observed also the reactionsπ + p→Δ ++ (1232)π 0 andπ + p→Δ ++ (1232)ω in thep f π + π 0 andp f π + π + π − π 0 final states.
