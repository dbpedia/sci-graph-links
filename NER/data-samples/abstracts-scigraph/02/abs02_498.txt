Abstract In this paper we present photoionization cross sections of the Cu and Al dimers and tetramers. The local spin density method is applied to calculate the electronic structure and the ground state potential. The cross sections are calculated using the continuum multiple scattering method, and a basic analysis of the photoionization process is given within the independent particle picture.
