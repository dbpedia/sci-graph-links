Abstract A sample of 8000 interactions of 250 GeV/c Ï€+ andK + mesons on Al and Au nuclei, is used to search for intermittency effects by calculating the normalized factorial moments of order two to four. No significant effect is observed in the higher moments. Two-body rapidity correlations and Bose-Einstein correlations in these interactions are presented.
