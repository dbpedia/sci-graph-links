Abstract The next list of spectral data on blue stellar objects (BSOs) is presented. 58 FBS objects in a zone with a central declination δ = + 35° were observed with the 2.6-m telescope at the Byurakan Observatory during 1990–1991. In addition, 3 objects were observed (3 CCD spectra were obtained) with the BAO 2.6-m and OHP 1.93-m telescopes in 1997–2000 using modern instrumentation. 9 white dwarfs, 47 hot subdwarfs, and 2 HBB stars have been discovered. Spectra of the 10 most interesting objects are given.
