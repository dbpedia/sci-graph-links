Abstract This paper is the first to report on the quantitative evaluation of panoramic holointerferograms. In the experiment a collinear pair of panoramic annular lenses and an ion laser are used to illuminate and observe the inner walls of a circular pipe. A holographic image is obtained in the shape of an annulus showing the entire surround of the lenses. To produce the holointerferogram, a carrier is introduced by translating the pipe axially, and a line load is applied parallel to the system axis. The interference pattern of the carrier and deformation is then recorded with a CCD. This pattern is linearized by applying a two-dimensional mapping to correct the distortions introduced by the panoramic optical system and then the linearized pattern is analyzed in the usual way (phase mapping, carrier subtraction, phase unwrapping). The experimental results are excellent and demonstrate the unique value of panoramic annular lenses in making precision deformation mappings of the interior surface of pipes or cylinders.
