Abstract Pneumocystis carinii has generally been distinguished in three developmental stages, namely, trophozoite, precyst and cyst. The fine structure of the pellicle — the plasma membrane and the outer layer existing outside this plasma membrane — of each stage was studied by freeze-fracture technique. By this technique,P. carinii was cleaved through the cytoplasm or through the hydrophobic region of the plasma membrane, and the cross-fractured face of the outer layer was revealed on the replicas. The outer layer, which is electron-dense in the thin section, consisted of numerous fine granules about 15 nm in diameter in freeze-fracture images, whereas the electron-lucent middle layer which appeared in the precyst and cyst was less granular. Measurement of the intramembranous particles (IMP) also was carried out. The number of IMP per square micrometer of the plasma membrane of the trophozoite was 1,512±125 on the P face and 417±44 on the E face. In the precyst, the IMP density decreased, and 1,037±56 on the P face and 262±22 on the E face. In the cyst, it further decreased, and 875±59 and 150±20 respectively. It is generally assumed that the density of IMP is related to the physiological activity of the cell membrane, so that the present results obtained inP. carinii suggest that the trophozoite is the most active stage, and that metabolic activity of the pellicle gradually decreases with the progress of development to the precyst then to the cyst.
