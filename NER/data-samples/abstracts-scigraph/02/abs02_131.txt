Abstract The two cycles of Rilke's late work are evidently different but in Rilke's eyes they belong closely together. The essay is an attempt to determine the points these two cycles have in common. The universe of the Neue Gedichte was perfectly close, in the Requiem cycle he aims to open the universe. While the early created form was closed, individual and self-transcendent, after the turn, the created form is open, being ajusted to plural, out-standing and principally unreachable aims. In the law this adjustement the three late forms of Rilke's late poetry, the Elegien, the Sonette and the poems which do not belong to a cycle, coincide. Rilke followed his turn consequently, he even invented an own (a) grammatical case which we name lativus absolutus; this case penetrates the entire late work. Rilke also elaboretad a real theorem and this theorem is strikingly close to Klee's theoretical discussion.
