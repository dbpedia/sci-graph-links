Abstract In this review, current state of knowledge of high resolution observations at decameter wavelengths of the quiet Sun, the slowly varying component (SVC), type I to V bursts and noise storms is summarized. These observations have been interpreted to yield important physical parameters of the solar corona and the dynamical processes around 2R ⊙ from the photosphere where transition from closed to open field lines takes places and the solar wind builds up. The decametric noise bursts have been classified into (i) ‘BF’ type bursts which show variation of intensity with frequency and time and (ii) decametric type III bursts. The angular sizes of noise storm sources taking into account refraction and scattering effects are discussed. An attempt has been made to give phenomenology of all the known varieties of decametric bursts in this review. Available polarization information of decametric continuum and bursts has been summarized. Recent simultaneous satellite and ground-based observations of decametric solar bursts show that their intensities are deeply modulated by scintillations in the Earth's ionosphere. Salient features of various models and theories of the metric and decametric noise storms proposed so far are examined and a more satisfactory model is suggested which explains the ‘BF’ type bursts as well as conventional noise storm bursts at decametric wavelengths invoking induced scattering process for 1 → t conversion. Some suggestions for further solar decametric studies from the ground-based and satellite-borne experiments have been made.
