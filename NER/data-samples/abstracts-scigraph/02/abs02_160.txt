Summary A general optimal method for the measurement of viscoelastic constants of nematic liquid crystals by light scattering is given. It is shown that, under suitable scattering conditions, several causes of error, like the multiple-scattering effect, the light scattering by crystal defects and the necessity of changing the liquid-crystal alignment in some type of measurements can be removed. The theory allows us to relate the experimental results obtained in such optimal conditions with all the viscoelastic constants characterizing the nematic liquid crystal. Some experimental results are given which show the validity of the theory. They also extend the range of spectral power density measurements of the scattered light down to very low frequency (0.1 Hz) by the use of an oblique-incidence scattering geometry.
