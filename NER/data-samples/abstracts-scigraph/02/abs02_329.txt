Abstract We calculate the inclusive momentum distribution of particles produced in a hadron-nucleus (hA) collision. The exchange of colour between the projectile and target nucleons leads to the formation of colour strings which are assumed to fragment like strings formed in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering. Making a few basic hypotheses we consistently and parameterfree describe the projectile fragmentation region in collisions of the typehA→h′X withh=p, π+ andh′=p, π+, π− at 100 GeV incident energy.
