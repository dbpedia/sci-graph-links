Summary The interaction of large cluster ions with a plasma target is calculated. The calculation includes the charge state evolution of the ion fragments, the disintegration dynamics, the effect of plasma screening and the effect of interference between neighbouring ions on the energy loss. An enhancement factor of 20 in the energy deposition is calculated in the case of a C60 molecule at 200 keV/atom in a hydrogen plasma.
