Abstract The energy distribution function of hot heavy and light holes, the degree of population inversion and of the accumulation of light holes are determined from an investigation of near infrared light absorption in crossed magnetic and electric fields. Analysis of the data shows that inversion of the population is caused not only by accumulation of light holes, but also by weaker heating of light holes compared with heavy holes and drift in momentum space. The numeral value and spectral dependence of the FIR gain, are determined. The distribution function and optical gain are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the values calculated by the Monte Carlo method. The power of the far-infrared laser is estimated.
