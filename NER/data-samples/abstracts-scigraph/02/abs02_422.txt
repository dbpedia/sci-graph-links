Abstract The pulse rates of natural atmospherics, recorded at the frequencies of 10 and 27 kHz respectively, were correlated with the measured diffusion times (TD) of ions in gelatin films. It was found that the difference ΔS of the atmospherics pulse rates at 10 and 27 kHz correlates well with the variations of the TD-values. The correlation coefficient is 0.75 (ΔS/TD) in each case. It is evident that the natural electromagnetic radiation is able to change the chemical structure of the gelatin resulting in the observed variations of diffusion times of ions.
