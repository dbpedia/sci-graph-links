Abstract The Faddeev equations are used to calculate the ground state as well as a few ortho- and para-excited states of e−e+e−, H−, He, Li+ and Be++ atoms. The Coulomb potential is represented in a separable form using the appropriate Coulombic Sturmians for both the attractive and repulsive interactions. Up to 36 Sturmians are employed in each interaction leading to the solution of a maximum of 56 coupled one-variable integral equations. Results are compared with data or predictions from variational calculations.
