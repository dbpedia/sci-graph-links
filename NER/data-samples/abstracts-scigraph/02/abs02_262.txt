Summary It is shown that the present day velocity distribution of the Milky Way Galaxy amplifies the magnetic field in the galactic arms by stretching the existing lines of force in such a way as to produce magnetic mirrors in the regions between 4 and 10 kps radius. The strength of the mirrors is increasing with time so that, effectively, a mirror of given strength seems to be moving out along the arm. It is suggested that these mirrors, fixed at constant radius but effectively moving, are important in production of cosmic rays, and it is shown that the appropriate constants relating to the mirrors are compatible with a Fermi accelerator mechanism of first order dependence on effective mirror velocity. The energy for this process is derived from differential rotation energy of which there is an adequate supply.
