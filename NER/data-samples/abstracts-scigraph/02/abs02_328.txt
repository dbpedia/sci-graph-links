Summary By using the shell model for the nucleons and considering an harmonic-oscillator potential with hard core, we have calculated the magnetic form factor of6Li by taking only the contribution of the exterior nucleons to4He core into consideration. We use the linear combination of the radial wave functions, one is regular and the other is irregular atr=0. We obtain the magnetic form factor6Li in good agreement with the experimental values.
