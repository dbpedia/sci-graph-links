Summary The puzzle of scalar mesons is studied by considering the gluon effects on the masses of mesons and the mixing of scalar nonet with a glueball. The f0(1300) mass is raised to âˆ¼1300 MeV by the gluon effects while retaining itsN-like character. The f0(975) may be a 0++ glueball which mixes with the f0(1300) appreciably.
