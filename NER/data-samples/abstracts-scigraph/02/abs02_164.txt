Abstract This paper considers the question concerning the applicability of the well-known theory of positive column contraction of a direct current discharge to a high-frequency discharge in nitrogen at reduced pressures. Measurements of the electron energy distribution function and other parameters of the plasma are carried out by probe methods along the radius of a high-frequency discharge. Comparison is made between the experimental and theoretical results.
