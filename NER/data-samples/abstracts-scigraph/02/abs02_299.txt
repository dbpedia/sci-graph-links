Abstract Coronal abundance variations arise from and affect solar atmospheric processes such as coronal heating and structural dynamics. Lenz (1999) presented initial results of a numerical theoretical study of abundances and ion heating rates in static, steady-state coronal loops. We present here a closer investigation of two fundamental aspects of the physics of coronal abundances, relating modeling parameters to observables: (1) the effect of varying the abundances on the electron temperature and (2) the effect of varying the ion heating rate on abundances.
