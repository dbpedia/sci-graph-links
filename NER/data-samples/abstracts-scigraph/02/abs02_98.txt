Abstract The results of experimental study of the light beam self-action in a nematic liquid crystal placed in a dc electric field are presented, and a theory of this effect is developed. This self-action of a light beam is shown to cause a hyperbolic umbilic caustic. The intensity distribution and caustics calculated in the far diffraction zone of the light beam agree well with the experimental data.
