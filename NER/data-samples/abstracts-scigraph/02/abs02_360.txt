Summary The famous sum rule due to Hartree-Fock is used to produce an extremely simple approximation for evaluating the nuclear single-particle energy eigenvalues with the experimental total binding energies as the only input data. Comparison of the predicted spectra (for 4 ≤A ≤90) with experiment and literature results provides support for the method and associated philosophy.
