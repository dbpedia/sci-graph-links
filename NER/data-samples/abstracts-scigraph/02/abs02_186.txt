Summary The Doppler-broadened annihilation radiations from annihilation events in several metals have been investigated using a highresolution Ge(Li) detector with 1.87 keV (f.w.h.m.) for the86Sr nuclear gamma-ray. When metals are grouped according to the periodic table the plot of Î±X 2 vs. the Fermi energy gives a straight line as expected from the simple model of Alfanoet al., including the IV A group metals. The widthX appears to depend more on the momentum distribution than on the Fermi energy alone. From the observed systematics, estimates for the effective-mass ratio of the electron have been made for Pb and B to be 0.03 and 3.45 respectively.
