Abstract The minimal spanning tree (MST) method was used to explore the statistical properties of field objects near distant radio galaxies (0.3 ≤ z ≤ 1.2) on SDSS images. The average diagrams of MST branch lengths were found to differ statistically for field objects near radio galaxies with z < 0.7 and z > 0.7, although zones of the subsample considered show no signs of clustering down to the SDSS limiting magnitude at a significance level greater than 5σ.
