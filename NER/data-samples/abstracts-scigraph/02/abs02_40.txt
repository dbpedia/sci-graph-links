Abstract This study is devoted to the simulation of the influence of the subglottic region (trachea, bronchi, and lungs) on the acoustic characteristics of the vocal tract in frequency-time articulatory synthesizers. The proposed model is reduced to the calculation of the short-term Fourier spectrum of the vocal source, taking into account the interaction of the transfer function of the vocal tract and subglottic cavities in the frequency domain, and synthesis of the vocal signal using the method of overlapping and summing. The scheme is tested with the use of the results of measurement of the vocal tract dynamics involving magnetic resonance tomography for a number of acoustic patterns of American English.
