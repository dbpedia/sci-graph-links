Abstract Results of VRI photometry of two components of the gravitationally lensed quasar UM 673 in 2003â€“2005 are presented. The observational data were obtained on the 1.5-m telescope of the Maidanak observatory. During the monitoring of the system, considerable brightness variations in components A and B with amplitudes of about 0.2 m were recorded, demonstrating variability of the quasar. The increase in the brightness of the components was accompanied by reddening of their V-R color indices. Analysis of the brightness and color variations of the components shows no variations related to microlensing.
