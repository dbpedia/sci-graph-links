Abstract We consider the ratio $$\frac{{\Delta Q}}{{\Delta \varepsilon }}$$ of the charge and energy fraction carried by particles in the angular interval ΔΩ with respect to the jet axis, where we assume a recursive scheme for the hadron cascade. A measurement of this ratio inep andvp collisions determines the quark chargeQ q at any angle ΔΩ and ine + e −-annihilations alsoQ q4 can be obtained. In hadron hadron collisions this ratio discriminates in a very direct way between different production models. We consider the “stopping quark” model, the “two dual sheet” model, and finally a leading cluster model. More data on $$\frac{{\Delta Q}}{{\Delta \varepsilon }}$$ would be desirable at higher energies in particular for meson beams.
