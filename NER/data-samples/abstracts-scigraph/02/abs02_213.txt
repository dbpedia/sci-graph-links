Abstract In this talk, I will discuss the intrinsic differences between a compact multiquark state and a normal hadron or a hadronic molecule. Using the coalescence model, I will then show that these intrinsic differences lead to appreciable differences in the yields of these particles from a heavy ion collision depending on their assumed internal structure.
