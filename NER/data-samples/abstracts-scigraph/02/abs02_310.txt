Abstract The analysis of the data on the production of Λ hyperons and π- in4He−Li,12C−C,12C−Ne and16O−Ne at 4.5 A GeV/c and12C−C collisions at 4.2 A GeV/c are presented. Kinematical features of Λ's are shown to depend on the collision centrality in contrast to the stable behaviour of the pion characteristics. The correlation between the characteristics of Λ's and accompanying pions is observed. The effects seem to be incompatible with the intranuclear cascade approach. The data suggest the formation of a fully stopped and thermalized hot source in central nucleus-nucleus collisions, in which Λ hyperons are produced.
