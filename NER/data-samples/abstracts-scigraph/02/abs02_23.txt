Abstract AC flow response of submonolayer superfluid4He films formed on porous glass with 1 Î¼m pore diameter has been studied over more than three decades of the oscillation amplitude or the AC velocity VAC, using a high Q-value torsional oscillator. As the oscillation amplitude increases a clear crossover has been observed, from linear regime where the height and the shape of the dissipation peak at Tc does not depend on the drive level, to nonlinear regime where energy dissipation peak changes the height in proportion to VAC 2 at the characteristic velocity of the order of 0.1cm/sec. At much higher VAC, deviation from VAC 2 dependence as well as rapid change of the peak shape have been observed.
