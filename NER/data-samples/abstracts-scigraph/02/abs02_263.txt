Abstract SOHO/MDI magnetograms have been used to analyze the longitude distribution of the squared solar magnetic field 〈B 2〉 in the activity cycle no. 23. The energy of the magnetic field (〈B 2〉) is shown to change with longitude. However, these variations hardly fit the concept of active longitudes. In the epochs of high solar activity, one can readily see a relationship between longitude variations of the medium-strong ((|B| > 50 G or |B| > 100 G) and relatively weak (|B| ≤ 50 G or |B| ≤ 100 G) fields at all latitudes. In other periods, this relationship is revealed mainly at the latitudes not higher than 30°. The background fields (|B| ≤ 25 G) also display longitude variations, which are, however, not related to those of the strong fields. This makes us think that the fields of solar activity are rather inclusions to the general field than the source of the latter.
