Abstract.  The structure of floral nectaries of Crataegus coccinea and C. crus-galli was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. The radial length of the floral nectary, measured from longitudinal sections of flowers, was 30% larger in C. crus-galli than in C. coccinea. For both Crataegus species the glandular tissue thickness was similar – approx. 400 μm. Also, the number of stomata per mm2 of nectary surface in C. crus-galli was much higher (by 43%) than for C. coccinea. Stomata were situated in deep hollows. For both taxa the period of nectar secretion was 4 days. The mean quantity of total sugar in nectar per 10 flowers of C. crus-galli and C. coccinea was 3.87 mg and 0.33 mg, respectively.
