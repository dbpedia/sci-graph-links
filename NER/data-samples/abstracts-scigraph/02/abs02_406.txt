Abstract The thermal excitation functions are calculated for several HI, OI, NI, Ci, XeI, and XeII lines for H2, O2, N2, CO2, and Xe plasmas, respectively, produced in closed systems, and the HI, NI, and OI lines for freely developing H2, N2, and O2 plasma. It is shown that the behavior of the thermal excitation functions is strongly influenced by the plasma-development conditions.
