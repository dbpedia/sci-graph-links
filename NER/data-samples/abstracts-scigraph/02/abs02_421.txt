Abstract The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission launched successfully on February 17, 1996 aboard a Delta II-7925. NEAR will be the first mission to orbit an asteroid and will make the first comprehensive scientific measurements of an asteroid's surface composition, geology, physical properties, and internal structure. It will orbit the unusually large near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros for about one year, at a minimum altitude of about 15 km from the surface. NEAR will also make the first reconnaissance of a C-type asteroid during its flyby of the unusual main belt asteroid 253 Mathilde. The NEAR instrument payload is: a multispectral imager (MSI), a near infrared spectrometer (NIS), an X-ray/gamma ray spectrometer (XRS/GRS), a magnetometer (MAG), and a laser rangefinder (NLR), while a radio science investigation (RS) uses the coherent X-band transponder. NEAR will improve our understanding of planetary formation processes in the early solar system and clarify the relationships between asteroids and meteorites. The Mathilde flyby will occur on June 27, 1997, and the Eros rendezvous will take place during February 1999 through February 2000.
