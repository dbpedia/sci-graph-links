Abstract We investigate the M1.8 solar flare of 20 October 2002. The flare was accompanied by quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) of both thermal and nonthermal hard X-ray emissions (HXR) observed by RHESSI in the 3 – 50 keV energy range. Analysis of the HXR time profiles in different energy channels made with the Lomb periodogram has indicated two statistically significant time periods of about 16 and 36 s. The 36 s QPP were observed only in the nonthermal HXR emission in the impulsive phase of the flare. The 16 s QPP were found in thermal and nonthermal HXR emission both in the impulsive and in the decay phases of the flare. Imaging analysis of the flare region, the determined time periods of the QPP, and the estimated physical parameters of the flare loops allowed us to interpret the observed QPP in terms of MHD oscillations excited in two spatially separated, but interacting systems of flaring loops.
