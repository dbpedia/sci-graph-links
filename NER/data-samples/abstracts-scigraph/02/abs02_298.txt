Abstract Solar p modes are one of the dominant types of coherent signals in Doppler velocity in the solar photosphere, with periods showing a power peak at five minutes. The propagation (or leakage) of these p-mode signals into the higher solar atmosphere is one of the key drivers of oscillatory motions in the higher solar chromosphere and corona. This paper examines numerically the direct propagation of acoustic waves driven harmonically at the photosphere, into the nonmagnetic solar atmosphere. Erd√©lyi et al. (Astron. Astrophys. 467, 1299, 2007) investigated the acoustic response to a single point-source driver. In the follow-up work here we generalise this previous study to more structured, coherent, photospheric drivers mimicking solar global oscillations. When our atmosphere is driven with a pair of point drivers separated in space, reflection at the transition region causes cavity oscillations in the lower chromosphere, and amplification and cavity resonance of waves at the transition region generate strong surface oscillations. When driven with a widely horizontally coherent velocity signal, cavity modes are caused in the chromosphere, surface waves occur at the transition region, and fine structures are generated extending from a dynamic transition region into the lower corona, even in the absence of a magnetic field.
