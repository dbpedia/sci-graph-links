Abstract. Based on hydrodynamic numerical simulations and diffusive shock acceleration model, we calculated the ratio of cosmic ray (CR) to thermal energy. We found that the CR fraction can be less than ~0.1 in the intracluster medium, while it would be of order unity in the warm-hot intergalactic medium.
