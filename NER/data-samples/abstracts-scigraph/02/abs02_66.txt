Abstract. A fresh and critical look has been given to the long-time behaviour of the quantum diffusion problem and a marginally more accurate solution has been obtained as compared to the one reported in the recent literature. Attempt has also been made to bring out a few interesting generic features of this problem which may have important bearing on real systems in the quantum domain.
