Abstract The influence of red and far-red irradiation on the transport of H+ and 86Rb+ through the plasmalemma was studied using parenchymal protoplasts isolated from Vicia faba leaves. The results indicate that red light stimulates H+ secretion and the uptake of 86Rb+. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that far-red irradiation acts antagonistically with respect to red light in both these processes.
