Abstract Flower-like ZnS structures have been prepared by solvothermal method with the assistance of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). The effects of different experimental conditions on the morphology of ZnS structure have been investigated. The performances of ZnS structures have been analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), room temperature photoluminescence (PL), and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The XRD patterns indicate that the prepared ZnS structures are highly crystallized, which are of hexagonal phase. The SEM images indicate that the main role of CTAB is to assemble the ZnS flakes together to form the flower-like structures, and the reaction time affects the morphology of ZnS. The growth mechanism for the formation of flower-like ZnS structure is also described. The absorption and emission bands gradually shift towards longer wavelength due to the transformation of flower-like ZnS nanoflowers from ZnS flakes.
