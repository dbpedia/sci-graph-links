Abstract We investigate temporal and spatial correlations in solar flares of hard X-rays (HXR) and decimetric continuum emissions, ejecta, and CMEs. The focus is on three M-class flares, supported by observations from other flares. The main conclusions of our observations are that (1) major hard X-ray flares are often associated with ejecta seen in soft X-rays or EUV. (2) Those ejecta seem to start before HXR or related decimetric radio continua (DCIM emission). (3) DCIM occurring nearly simultaneously with the first HXR peak are located very close to the HXR source. Later in the flare, DCIM generally becomes stronger, drifts to lower frequency and occurs far from the HXR source. Thus the positions at high frequency are generally closer to the HXR source. DCIM emission consists of pulses that drift in frequency. The very high and sometimes positive drift rate suggests spatially extended sources or type III like beams in an inhomogeneous source. Movies of selected flares used in this study can be found on the CD-ROM accompanying this volume.
