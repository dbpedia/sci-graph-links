Abstract The CLAS collaboration and the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration reported the differential cross section data for K*0 photoproduction, and found that the t-channel K exchange dominates the production amplitudes at small scattering angles. The measurement of forward-angle parity spin asymmetry for the γ p → K*0Σ+ reaction, where the theoretical calculations show an unambiguous signal, would establish the role of the κ(800). The γ p → K*0Σ+ reaction, where the Σ+ was identified through missing mass, on a liquid hydrogen target was measured at the LEPS detector in the energy from threshold to 3.0 GeV by using a linearly polarized photon beam at SPring-8. Decay angular distributions in the rest frame of the K + π − system were fit to extract spin-density matrix elements of the K*0 decay.
