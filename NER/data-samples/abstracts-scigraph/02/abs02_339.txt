Summary In this work we use the recently proposed large-N limit of chiral perturbation theory at the leading order and in the chiral limit, to fit the pion scattering. We compute the effective action for pions in this approximation which is non-local. From this action we are able to fit theI=J=0 low-energy pion scattering data and to study the properties of the skyrmion which is shown to be unstable in this approximation.
