Abstract We compute the energy, DE, dissipated due to viscous friction over a time period,t e, equal to the rotation decay time of a differentially rotating visco-polytropic model. We then study the relation between DE and Î”T, i.e., the difference in the rotational kinetic energies at the beginning and at the end of this period. Such a study results in the description of an efficient differential-rotation-setup mechanism.
