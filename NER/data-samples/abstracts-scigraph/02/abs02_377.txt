Abstract The fundamental parameter characterizing the disperse systems is the size distribution function of particles. The problem of experimental determination of this parameter remains unsolved as yet. The spectroscopy of dynamic light.scattering, which is widely used for the analysis of disperse systems, leads to determination of only the mean particle size. Existing analytical approaches are associated with considerable use of a priori information on the desired solution. A version of the histogram method is proposed for derivation of the distribution function from the Fredholm equation, on the basis of approximating the function by a set of step distributions; a nonlinear adaptive division of the coordinate grid is introduced here.
