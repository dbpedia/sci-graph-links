Summary The fluorescence intensity of a sodium vapour excited by a multimode dye-laser is observed as a function of the applied magnetic field: a resonant decrease of the fluorescence occurs when the frequency difference between two laser modes coincides with the frequency of an hyperfine transition of the ground state. An experimental proof is reported which evidences the coherent nature of the phenomenon.
