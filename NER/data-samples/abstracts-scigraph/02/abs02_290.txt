Abstract A BRST transformation incorporating general coordinate, Lorentz and Weyl transformations is defined. The variation of the effective action for fermions moving in an external gravitational field is calculated using an extended BRST analysis. InD=2 dimensions the Schwinger terms appearing in the equal time commutators of energy momentum tensors are related to the gravitational and Weyl anomalies for a massless spin 0 and a massless spin 1/2 model, respectively.
