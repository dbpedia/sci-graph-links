Abstract The effects of light, pH and organic carbon sources were investigated on hydrogen production by algae. An optical fiber was examined as an internal light source. The optical fiber rendered prolonged lag time and total time of hydrogen production. The optimal pH to produce hydrogen for Chlorella sp. was 8.0. Glucose, fructose, sucrose and malt extract were compared as organic carbon sources. The optimal dose of each carbon source was 5 g/L for maximum hydrogen yield. Sucrose produced the largest hydrogen volume (1,315 ml/L), while the highest production rate (24 ml/L/h) was observed in the presence of fructose.
