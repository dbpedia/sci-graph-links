Abstract The Kleinâ€“Gordon equation under equal scalar and vector potentials is solved for the Tietz potential in D-dimensions by using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The spectrum of the system is numerically calculated and the oscillator strength is determined and discussed in terms of parameters of the system.
