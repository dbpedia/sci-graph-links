Abstract A quantum field theory model that contains interacting non-Abelian gauge fields, scalar fields, and spinor fields is considered in a curved space-time with torsion. The cone-loop counterterms are found. It is shown that the multiplicative renormalization condition requires a nonminimal coupling of the matter with the gravitational field.
