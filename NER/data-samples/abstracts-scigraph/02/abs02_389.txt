Abstract Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the Sun at 91 and 400 cm wavelength have been used to investigate the radio signatures of EUV heating events and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) detected by SOHO and TRACE. Our 91 cm observations show the onset of Type I noise storm emission about an hour after an EUV ejection event was detected by EIT and TRACE. The EUV event also coincided with the estimated start time of a CME detected by the LASCO C2 coronagraph, suggesting an association between the production of nonthermal particles and evolving plasma-magnetic field structures at different heights in the corona. On another day, our VLA 400 cm observations reveal weak, impulsive microbursts that occurred sporadically throughout the middle corona. These low-brightness-temperature (T b=0.7–22×106 K) events may be weak Type III bursts produced by beams of nonthermal electrons which excite plasma emission at a height where the local plasma frequency or its first harmonic equals the observing frequency of 74 MHz. For one microburst, the emission was contained in two sources separated by ∼0.7 R 0, indicating that the electron beams had access to widely-divergent magnetic field lines originating at a common site of particle acceleration. Another 400 cm microburst occurred in an arc-like source lying at the edge of EUV loops that appeared to open outward into the corona, possibly signaling the start of a CME. In most instances the 400 cm microbursts were not accompanied by detectable EUV activity, suggesting that particles that produce the microbursts were independently accelerated in the middle corona, perhaps as the result of some quasi-continuous, large-scale process of energy release.
