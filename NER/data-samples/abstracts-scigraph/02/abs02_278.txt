Abstract This paper gives a review of the results of optical observations of solar flares. Observations carried out in the HÎ± line, flare spectra, and the methods of analysing the flare spectra are briefly discussed. Great attention is paid to the continuous emission of flares in the optical spectral region. In the last section, optical aspects of proton flares are summarized.
