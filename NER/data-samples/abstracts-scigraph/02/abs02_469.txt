Abstract Theoretical investigations were carried out on the gas-phase reactions of CF3C(O)OCH2CH3, ethyl trifluoroacetate (ETFA) with Cl atoms by means of modern density functional theory methods. The optimized geometries, frequencies and minimum energy path were obtained with the hybrid density functional model MPWB1K using the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. The single point energy calculations were refined further using the G2(MP2) method. Two conformers relatively close in energy were identified for ETFA; both are likely to be important in the temperature range of our study. The existence of transition states on the corresponding potential energy surface was ascertained by performing intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. The rate constant at 298 K calculated theoretically using canonical transition state theory was found to be in good agreement with experimentally measured values. Our calculations suggest that H abstraction from the –CH2 group is kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than abstraction from the –CH3 group. The atmospheric lifetime of ETFA with Cl atoms was determined to be 1.98 years. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first determination of the rate coefficients for the gas-phase reaction of chlorine atoms in ETFA.
