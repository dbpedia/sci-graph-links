Abstract We present a study of the ferromagnetic spin chain with both first- and second-neighbor interactions. We obtain the condition for the appearance and stability of bright and dark solitons for arbitrary wave number in the Brillouin zone. The influence of the second-neighbor interaction and the anisotropy on the soliton properties is considered. The scattering of dark solitons from point defects in the discrete spin chain is investigated numerically.
