Abstract It is shown that solar flares and magnetospheric substorms must primarily be caused by a dynamo process, rather than magnetic reconnection â€“ a spontaneous, explosive annihilation of magnetic energy stored prior to the onset. Magnetic energy in the vicinity of solar flares and in the magnetotail shows often an increase at their onset, not a decrease. It is unfortunate that many observed features of solar flares and substorms have tacitly been ascribed to unproven (3-D) characteristics of the neutral line for a long time. In the future, it is necessary to study carefully their driving process and examine how the driven magnetic field system evolves, leading to solar flares and substorms.
