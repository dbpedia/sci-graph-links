Summary Using the shell model wave functions, we have calculated magnetic moments of medium-weight and heavy hypernuclei, and obtained the Schmidt diagrams of $${\mathcal{N}}^{ \pm 1} \Lambda $$ Λ systems ( $$({\mathcal{N}} = n and p)$$ and p). With the use of the first-order perturbation theory, we have also estimated the configuration mixing effects on magnetic moments of these $${\mathcal{N}}^{ \pm 1} \Lambda $$ Λ hypernuclei. We show that the hyperon-induced configuration mixing effects are small and the nucleon-induced configuration mixing effects are large in many cases.
