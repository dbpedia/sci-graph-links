Abstract We have studied transverse momentum distributions for exclusiveρ 0 muoproduction on protons and heavier nuclei at 2<Q 2<25 GeV2. TheQ 2 dependence of the slopes of thep t 2 andt′ distributions is discussed. The influence of the non-exclusive background is investigated. Thep t 2-slope for exclusive events is 4.3±0.6±0.7 GeV−2 at largeQ 2. Thep t 2 spectra are much softer than inclusivep t 2 spectra of leading hadrons produced in deep inelastic scattering.
