Abstract High-time-resolution observations of an unusual event of 1991 November 17, 07:04 UT at 2.5 and 2.85 GHz are presented. The event demonstrates sophisticated tine time structure including sudden reductions and quasi-periodic pulsations about various ‘zero’ levels. It is shown that the sudden reductions (≈30–100 ms) can be produced with upward-injected > 100 keV electron beams filling the loss-cone. In such a case the acceleration is proceeding in a dense plasma layer with number densityn > 2.5 × 1010 cm−3. The shortest time scale of the fragmented injection isт injmin ≈ 30 ms. Several different pulsating regimes arising due to the wave-particle and wave-wave interactions are considered. A theoretical mechanism with the nonlinear oscillations of Langmuir waves at the different steady-state levels provides the best agreement with the observed pulsations. The reduced steady-state level of the second train of pulsations is connected with the long (quasi-continuous) injection of electrons filling the loss-cone, which reduced the wave energy level. Physical parameters of the radio source were obtained. On the other hand, ECM nonlinear pulsations seem to be responsible for the radio pulsations observed in dMe stars.
