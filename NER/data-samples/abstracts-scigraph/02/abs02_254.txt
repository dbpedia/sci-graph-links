Abstract The role of leaky waves in the coronal loop oscillations observed by TRACE is not yet clearly understood. In this work, the excitation of fast waves in solar coronal loops modelled as dense plasma cylindrical tubes in a uniform straight magnetic field is investigated. We study the trapped and especially leaky modes (whose energy escapes from the tube) that result from an initial disturbance by solving the time-dependent problem numerically. We find that the stationary state of the tube motion is given by the trapped normal modes. By contrast, the transient behaviour between the initial and the stationary phase is dominated by wave leakage. The so-called trig leaky modes are clearly identified since the transient behaviour shows periods and damping times that are in agreement with the values calculated from the normal-mode analysis. Consequently, these radiating modes have physical significance. However, we have not found any evidence for the excitation of other types of modes, such as the principal leaky kink mode.
