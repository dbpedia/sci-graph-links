Abstract A dynamical coupled channel model for electron and neutrino induced meson production reactions is developed. The model is an extension of our previous reaction model to describe reactions at finite $$Q^2$$ Q2 . The electromagnetic transition form factors of the first $$(3/2^+,3/2)$$ (3/2+,3/2) and $$(3/2^-,1/2)$$ (3/2-,1/2) resonances extracted from partial wave amplitude are discussed.
