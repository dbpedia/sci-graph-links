Abstract We report on the characterization of in-plane and out-of-plane modes of vibration for various piezoelectric, aluminium nitride-actuated, square microplates with optimized excitation electrodes. We combined electrical and optical techniques to fully characterize the modes of vibration in different media, with special attention to the modes with the highest quality factor in liquid. An electronic speckle pattern interferometry technique was used for a full 3D detection of the movement of the microplates, allowing a precise identification of the modal shape, even under liquid immersion. The electrical characterization was carried out with an impedance analyser. Quality factors as high as 15,000 were obtained in vacuum, for an in-plane mode at 3.93 MHz, and as high as 144 in isopropanol, for a high order out-of-plane mode at 3.63 MHz.
