Abstract The TaI line 6356.14 Å, up to now classified as the transition 5d 36s 2 a 4 P 5/2−5d 36s(a 5 F)6p z 4 F 72/0, is a blend with a second transition, which is related to the additional levels 5d 4(b 3 G)6s a 4 G 9/2−39641.24 cm−1 J=7/2°. Using laser excitation with optogalvanic and laser-induced fluorescence detection, the hyperfine constants of the four levels involved and the distance of the center wavelengths of the two fine structure transitions could be determined.
