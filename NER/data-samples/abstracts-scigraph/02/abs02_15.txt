Abstract Resonances of Schr√∂dinger operators are closely related to the poles of certain meromorphic extension of the resolvent. In this paper, we study the resonances in Stark effect, generated by negative eigenvalues. We give precise location for the resonances and prove in particular that the widths of resonances are exponentially small and can be measured by some Agmon's distance.
