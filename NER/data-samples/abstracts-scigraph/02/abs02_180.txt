Abstract An estimate is made of the maximum number of resonant particles interacting with a transverse plane electromagnetic wave. This estimate is based on the distribution function, in terms of integrals characterizing the motion of particles in a wave. The values found here for proton fluxes accelerated by an amplitude-modulated wave in the solar corona agree with those measured during sporadic radioemission bursts.
