Abstract The Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) is a satellite-borne spectrometer aboard the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) that measures solar irradiance between 200 and 2700 nm. This instrument employs a FÃ¨ry prism as a dispersing element, an electrical substitution radiometer (ESR) as the primary detector, and four additional photodiode detectors for spectral scanning. Assembling unit level calibrations of critical components and expressing the sensitivity in terms of interrelated measurement equations supplies the instrument's radiant response. The calibration and analysis of the spectrometer's dispersive and transmissive properties, light aperture metrology, and detector characteristics provide the basis for these measurement equations. The values of critical calibration parameters, such as prism and detector response degradation, are re-measured throughout the mission to correct the ground-based calibration.
