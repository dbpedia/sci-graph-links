Abstract For the $$d(\vec e,e'\vec p)$$ reaction dependences of the proton polarization on the deuteron electromagnetic current and on the final-state interaction are studied. The possibility of separation of the structure functions contributing to this observable is discussed. Polarizations of protons in $$d(\vec e,e'\vec p)$$ are calculated for the kinematics of a proposed measurement in the MIT-Bates research program.
