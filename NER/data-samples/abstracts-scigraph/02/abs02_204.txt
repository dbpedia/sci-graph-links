Abstract The current situation with the cosmological model and fundamental constants is briefly reviewed. Here, we concentrate on evolutionary effects of large-scale structure formation, in particular, the relationship with the quasar distribution and dynamics is discussed. We argue that groups of bright quasars with few or more than dozen of members within regions ≤l LS∼(100–150)h −1 Mpc found atz<2 may belong to concentrations of young rich clusters of galaxies, and thus be distant Great Attractors like the local GA or the Shapley concentration. These early large-scale galactic structures (i) provide a natural way to ‘bias’ the distribution of Abell clusters, and (ii) suggest that the spectrum of primordial density perturbations is nearly flat on scales encompassing both the cluster and GAs,l=πk −1ε(10,100)h −1 Mpc: Δ k 2 ∼k 3 P(k) ∼k γ, γ=1−0.4+0.6, whereP(k) is the power spectrum of density perturbations.
