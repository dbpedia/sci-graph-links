Abstract The distributions of the positive polarization degree maximum P max and, for the first time, of its phase angle αmax were mapped (for wavelengths γeff = 461 nm and 669 nm) on the basis of polarimetric CCD observations of the eastern hemisphere of the Moon. The distributions of the spectropolarimetric index for the positive polarization degree maximum CP max=P max(669 nm)/P max(461 nm) and of the “color” of the maximum polarization angle Cαmax=αmax (669 nm)/ αmax (461 nm) were mapped as well. It has been found that (i) the dependences of αmax on the logarithm of albedo and on the logarithm of P maxare linearly correlated to a large degree; (ii) the parameters αmax and P maxdepend on wavelength only due to albedo variations; (iii) there are two branches in the “spectropolarimetric index CPmax-albedo” correlation diagram: mare regions show anti-correlation, and highlands, correlation. The maps obtained in this study can be useful both for developing remote sensing methods for the Moon and other atmosphereless bodies and for testing models of positive polarization of the light reflected by regolith-like surfaces.
