Abstract We discuss an adiabatic phase transition between a nebular ring and a protoplanet, taking into account the gravitational corrections to the perfect gas entropy. We compare the results of this model with those found in a previous paper from different assumptions, and we try a qualitative comparison with the structure of the real solar system, using the data for the four giant planets. We discuss the relevance of some primordial phenomena in the formation process of these planets such as a mass depletion within the asteroidal belt, a mass loss from the external regions of the nebula and a decrease of Neptune's orbital radius due to ejection of cometary material. The first and the second process seem to be significantly supported by the results of the phase transition model.
