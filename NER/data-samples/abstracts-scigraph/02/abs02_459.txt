Abstract We investigate the double ionization of helium under an intense laser pulse. This process is known to be one of the prototypical manifestation of electron–electron correlation. In this work, we present a numerical study on the influence of Pauli’s exclusion principle in the double ionization. We make a comparative analysis of two almost degenerated states with different character with respect to the exchange symmetry. We show that there exists a significant difference in the double ionization of parahelium and orthohelium. The symmetric character of the spatial electronic wavefunction affects strongly double ionization. It is found that the double ionization is partially suppressed in the orthohelium case. The mechanisms relevant for this suppression are discussed.
