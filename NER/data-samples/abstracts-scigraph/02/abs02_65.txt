Summary The diastereomericmono- andbis-Ï‰-appended (R)-menthyl hypericin derivatives were studied by means of absorption spectroscopy, circular dichroism measurements, application of the C2 rule, and semiempirical calculations. This allowed us to assign the absolute configuration (P) to the inherently chiral phenanthroperylene quinone chromophore of hypericin, thebay-hypericinate ion, and the 1,6-dioxo-tautomer displaying a negativeCotton effect of their long wavelength absorption band. From these results and according to the positive chiroptical sign of their long wavelength bands, the absolute configuration (M) could be assigned to the stentorin chromophore in the native pigments.
