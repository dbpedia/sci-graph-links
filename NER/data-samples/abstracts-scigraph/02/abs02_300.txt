Summary The depth of the imaginary part of the optical potential in nuclear matter is calculated for incident Λ particles having laboratory energies less than 80 MeV with an assumed real well 35 MeV deep. This imaginary depth exceeds that for incident neutrons for low energies, being several times as large at zero energy. For the intermediate and higher energies considered, the depth for Λ’s is estimated to be less than that for neutrons. Surface absorption in finite nuclei is expected to be relatively less important for incident Λ’s than for incident nucleons.
