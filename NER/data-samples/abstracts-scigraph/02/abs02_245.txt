Summary It is observed that the isomorphism between the PoincarÃ© subgroup in the L.C. (light-cone) co-ordinates and the two-dimensional Galilean group can be trivially extended to higher dimensions. The case of five dimension is explicitly shown, and the generalization to any finite dimensionn (> 2) is immediate.
