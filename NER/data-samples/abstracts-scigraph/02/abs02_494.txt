Abstract In order to predict the total magnetic field in the air gap of three-phase machines analytically, the following factors have to be taken into account: the winding spatial harmonics which are excited by the winding via the mean air gap permeance as well as the parametric spatial harmonic components of the air gap field which are excited by the variation of the air gap permeance. This applies particularly to salient pole synchronous machines which have considerably higher variations of the air gap permeance than induction machines due to their pole gap. Based on the FEM calculation results which are presented in Misir et al. (e&i, Elektrotech. Inf.tech., 132(1): 33â€“38, 2015), this paper provides an analytical approach for calculating both the contribution of a salient pole rotor to the total air gap permeance of salient pole synchronous machines and the total air gap permeance of salient pole synchronous machines without the need of finite element analysis.
