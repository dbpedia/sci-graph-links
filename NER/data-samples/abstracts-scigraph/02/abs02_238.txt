Abstract Seaton's relation, which forms the basis of the quantum defect method, is generalized to the relativistic case. A connection is established between the quantum defects of discrete levels and the phase shift of the continuum wave function for the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations. The possibility of applying these relations, in particular to the study of mesoatoms, is discussed.
