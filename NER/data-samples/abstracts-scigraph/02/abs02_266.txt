Abstract Ultra-high-energy gamma-rays have been detected from the Active Galactic Nucleus 1ES 1426+428 with a high significance level (8σ) in observations with the GT-48 Cerenkov telescope in 2002–2010. Four-day flare activity was detected in 2009, as has been confirmed by observations by the Fermi LAT space telescope at 1–300 GeV. The growth in TeV activity just before 2008 detected with the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory GT-48 telescope is consistent with the increased activity at energies >350 GeV indicated by data from the Whipple observatory Cerenkov detectors. It is proposed that the presence of more substantial variations at ultra-high gamma-ray energies compared to lower energies is related to more efficient particle acceleration in the jets of Active Galactic Nuclei associated with the generation of hard gamma-rays.
