Summary The coupling impedance between a particle beam and a surrounding lossy vacuum chamber with elliptic cross-section is usually evaluated using expressions derived for circular geometry, considering an equivalent radius equal to the minor radius of the ellipse. The approximation may lead to unrealistic results expecially when considering transverse oscillations of the beam parallel to the ellipse major axis. In this paper we present a method for the exact evaluation of both longitudinal and transverse impedances without any restrictions on the beam position and oscillation directions.
