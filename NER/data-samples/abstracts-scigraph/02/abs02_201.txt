Summary The nuclear picture of the Brueckner theory is used to calculate the neutron emission following slow muon capture in heavy nuclei. The results are compared with recent measurements carried out at Berkeley on neutron emission multiplicities. Good agreement is obtained for the high multiplicities (â©¾2), although the calculated average neutron emission is still 20% lower than the experimental findings. The mass number dependence of the emission is satisfactorily accounted for. Finally, direct emission and possible improvements are discussed.
