Abstract In the experiment withe + e −-beams performed at the VEPP-4 storage ring with the MD-1 detector we have measuredB μμ, the branching ratio for the decay of Υ(1S) state intoμ + μ −. We obtainedB μμ=(2.12+0.20+0.10)%. It is shown that the continuum and resonance interference should be taken into account. For the first time the upper limits on the branching ratio for the decaysΥ→π + π −,K + K −,p $$\bar p$$ have been measured: Br(Υ→π + π −)<5·10−4, Br(Υ→K + K −)<5·10−4, Br(Υ→p $$\bar p$$ <9·10−4 (90% CL).
