Abstract In this paper, we study the exclusion problem concerning the classes of involutive bounded lattices, logics, and quantum logics (i.e., orthomodular lattices). We also obtain that a logic is a quantum logic if and only if it is a paraconsistent logic. Moreover, we give some considerations on an open question to find sufficient conditions for the existence of an orthomodular orthocomplementation on lattices. Furthermore, we revisit the Dedekindâ€“MacNeille completion of involutive bounded posets and correct a widely cited error in quantum logics.
