Abstract An effect of the preliminary transformation of experimental data of relative two-wave X-ray reflectometry on the accuracy of determining parameters of multilayer structures is described. The efficiency of applying the CUDA technology to the computer processing of results is investigated. An efficient implementation of calculations in modeling the relative two-wave X-ray reflectometry using CUDA is proposed.
