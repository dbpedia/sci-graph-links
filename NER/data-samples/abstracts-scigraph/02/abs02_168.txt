Abstract The recent observations of solar flares, made with a Lyot filter and a spectrograph in HÎ±, HeD3, higher Balmer lines, metallic lines, and continuum, are discussed. It is important to study the energy supply of non thermal particle/ conduction/ irradiation into the lower atmosphere from the optical observations with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Simultaneous observations from ground-based observatories and instruments on board satellites are necessary for understanding flare plasma of low and high energy.
