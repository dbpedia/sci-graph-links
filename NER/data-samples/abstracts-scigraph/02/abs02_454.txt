Abstract On 14 July 2000, the LASCO coronagraphs showed a very fast halo coronal mass ejection in association with the radio bursts seen shortly after 10:00 UT. Radio imaging observations by the Nançay radioheliograph (NRH) of these bursts showed a very complex event that can be regarded as global: the sources encompassed all the visible range in longitude and a huge span in latitude. Another interesting feature of the radio event is its recurrent nature: after the most intense phase shortly after 10:00 UT, two other strong outbursts are detected, one at about 12:50 UT and another at about 13:48 UT. All of these sub-events showed similar development and likely evidence for CMEs. The launch of a CME in association with the 14:00 UT sub-event is inferred from WIND/WAVES, with interplanetary type II signatures in the hectometric wavelength range at that time. These later events were not detected by LASCO due to energetic particles hitting the CCD. During the Bastille Day event, energetic particle observations measured in situ by ACE/EPAM are dominated by energetic electrons. Changes in anisotropy and energy spectrum of the ∼38–350 keV electrons suggest a good correlation with the coronal radio observations. In addition to the three main radio events and particle observations, the NRH data reveal moving features in the southern hemisphere. These moving features, located at about 45 deg south and with an angular extent of about 45 deg, are illuminated by non-thermal electrons and are seen at distances up to 2.5 solar radii from the Sun center. More generally, we interpret the global and recurrent coronal activity, revealed by the radio data, as responsible for populating the interplanetary medium with energetic electrons.
