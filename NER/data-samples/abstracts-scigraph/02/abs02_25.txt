Abstract In a previous study a permanent isolated vortex like the Great Red Spot of Jupiter was obtained as a statistical equilibrium for the classical quasigeostrophic model of atmospheric motion on rapidly rotating planets. We provide here a theoretical basis for this work and relate it to a previous model of the spot (Rossby soliton).
