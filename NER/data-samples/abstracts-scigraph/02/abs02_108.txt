Abstract. Excitation functions of the natNi($\alpha$ α ,x)62,63,65Zn, natNi($\alpha$ α ,x)56,57Ni and natNi($\alpha$ α ,x)56,57,58m+gCo reactions were measured from the respective thresholds to 44MeV using the stacked-foil activation technique. The tests for the beam characterization are described. The radioactivity was measured using HPGe $\gamma$ γ -ray detectors. Theoretical calculations on $\alpha$ α -particles-induced reactions on natNi were performed using the nuclear model code TALYS-1.8. A few results are new, the others strengthen the database. Our experimental data were compared with results of nuclear model calculations and described the reaction mechanism.
