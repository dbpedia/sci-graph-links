Abstract A relation is determined between the physical quantities in the Kerr-Newman priming solution and the Kerr-Newman-Ernst solution transformed by using the Harrison solution. It is shown that this latter possesses a nonsingular horizon of events. The values obtained for the 4-potential of the electromagnetic field of the transformed solution is in a linear approximation in the magnetic field intensity.
