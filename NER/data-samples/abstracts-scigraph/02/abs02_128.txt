Abstract The exclusive reactionpp→ppπ+ π− has been studied using the SFM spectrometer at ISR energies of $$\sqrt s = 24$$ and 63 GeV. The cross section in the double pomeron exchange region defined by |x p |>0.9, |y π |<1 is 28±6, 23(+13, −6) and 29(+29, −10)μb, respectively. The ππ mass spectrum is dominated by an 1/m ππ2 part, as expected for pomeron pomeron scattering. In addition, thef(1, 270) resonance is clearly distinguished. There are no further resonance signals, which could be assigned to glueball candidates expected in the 1,000 MeV region. Compared to photon photon scattering, the ratio of continuum tof-resonance production cross sections is significantly larger in pomeron pomeron scattering.
