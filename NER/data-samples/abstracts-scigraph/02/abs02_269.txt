Abstract We have observed correlations in the transverse momentum of pion pairs with like and unlike charge produced in 8.25 GeV/cK − p→K − pπ+π+π−π− interaction. We found that a Bose-Einstein interference effect accounts partially for these correlations. Evidence is presented indicating that the correlations observed in the above reaction can be described by the reflections from the occurence of physical resonances.
