Summary The two-component pomeron in the total cross-section is investigated by decomposing the overlap function into several ingredients in reference to the quark line diagrams. The ratio of the second component of the pomeron in the KN to πN total cross-section is found to be 1/2. The first and second components are estimated from the πN and KN total-cross-section data at FNAL energies; the first one increases slowly, while the second one decreases slowly with energy. Data on pp give a value essentially equal to 3/2, the Levin-Frankfurt rule, as the ratio of the first component in N N to KN, and nearly 7/2 as the ratio of the second one in N N to KN. Predictions on hyperon- and antihyperon-nucleon total cross-sections are given at FNAL energies. The total cross-section of the pp scattering is calculated and compared with experimental data in the ISR energy region. The case in which the first component increases as lnp L and the second one decreases to a finite value as the energy increases brings the best fit to the existing data.
