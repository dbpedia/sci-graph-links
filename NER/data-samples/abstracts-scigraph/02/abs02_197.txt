Abstract The decay of several active regions which emerged early in cycle 22 has been studied using daily magnetograms and synoptic plots obtained at the Vacuum Telescope at the National Solar Observatory, Kitt Peak. The observed patterns are compared with simulations using the flux transport equation and some discrepancies are noted. For one region it is shown that, by including the emergence of a non-random pattern of small magnetic bipoles during the decay, the correspondence between the observed and simulated patterns may be improved.
