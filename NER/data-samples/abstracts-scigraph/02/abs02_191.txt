Summary It is shown that the contribution of neutral pion intermediate states is as much important as electron-positron pair states for low energy photon-photon scattering. For unpolarized scattering the interference between two intermediate states is shown to vanish and the contribution of neutral pion states to the differential cross section is shown to have a sharp maximum with 1.15 · 10−26 cm2/sr at a total energy of photons corresponding to the pion mass. The forward and right-angle cross sections for two intermediate states are compared.
