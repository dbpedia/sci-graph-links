Abstract We presented a phenomenological mode that attributes the precession of perihelion of planets to the relativistic correction. This modifies Newtonâ€™s equation by adding an inversely cube term with distance. The total energy of the new system is found to be the same as the Newtonian one. Moreover, we have deduced the deflection of light formula from Rutherford scattering. The relativistic term can be accounted for quantum correction of the gravitational potential and/or self energy of objects.
