Abstract Ælfric's Grammar, a work that scholars have seen as tangential to his main concerns, is an essential part of his collection of English-language religious texts. Ælfric's prefaces often express his concern that writing in English does not ensure that his readers will properly interpret his texts. In order to give readers the tools they need to analyze English texts, Ælfric writes the Grammar, a work that not only teaches Latin grammar, but also applies grammar to the English language. By making explicit the concept that English is a language, a collection of signs, Ælfric teaches his readers that reading English texts requires analytical skills. Ælfric then shows his readers how the tools of the Latin grammarians can be used to understand English as well. In essence, Ælfric takes the medieval commonplace that the study of grammar is necessary for the understanding of Latin texts and expands it, showing how grammar is necessary for the understanding of English language texts as well.
