Abstract The Deligne-Simpson problem in the multiplicative version is formulated as follows: give necessary and sufficient conditions for the choice of the conjugacy classes C j ∈ GL(n, $$\mathbb{C}$$ ), so that there exist irreducible (p + 1)-tuples of matrices M j ∈ C j satisfying the equality M 1 . . . M p+1 = I. We solve the problem for generic eigenvalues in the case where all the numbers ∑j,m(σ) of Jordan blocks of a given matrix M j with a given eigenvalue σ and of a given size m (taken over all j, σ, and m) are divisible by d > 1. Generic eigenvalues are defined by explicit algebraic inequalities of the form a ≠ 0. For such eigenvalues there exist no reducible (p + 1)-tuples. The matrices M j are interpreted as monodromy operators of regular linear systems on the Riemann sphere.
