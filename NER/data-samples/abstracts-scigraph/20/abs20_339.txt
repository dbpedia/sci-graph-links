Abstract Some cases and reactions in binary isobaric phase diagram presenting variation of temperature and composition have no names; we propose to attribute names for some cases and reaction that we identified. The names of the invariant reactions are issued from Greek language as eutectic but concerning the curves of separation between domains, they have a Latin origin. We have respected these choices.
