Abstract After more than 60 years, the ‘Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Psychologie en haar Grensgebieden’ has undergone a change of identity. First of all, the Journal has changed its name into the ‘Netherlands Journal of Psychology’. Secondly, from now on the Journal will only publish papers that are written in English. Finally, the cover of the Journal has had a redesign.
