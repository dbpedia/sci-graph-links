Abstract This paper discusses the design of the EuroWordNet database, in which semantic databases like WordNet1.5 for several languages are combined via a so-called inter-lingual-index. In this database, language-independent data is shared whilst language-specific properties are maintained. A special interface has been developed to compare the semantic configurations across languages and to track down differences.
