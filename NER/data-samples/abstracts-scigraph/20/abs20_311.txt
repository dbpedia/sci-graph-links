Abstract Pseudopycnadena tendu sp. nov. is described from the balistid Pseudobalistes fuscus from the waters off New Caledonia. It differs from the only other member of the genus P. fischthali Saad-Fares et Maillard, 1986, in its broad cirrus-sac, with the wide field of large gland-cells, its less nearly circular body shape, its dorsal excretory pore, its shorter post-testicular region, its relatively larger ventral sucker and its smaller eggs. The genus is re-defined to take these distinctions into account. Other opecoelid species reported from New Caledonia are Allopodocotyle epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1942) from Epinephelus cyanopodus, E. fasciatus and E. merra, Cainocreadium epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1934) from E. coeruleopunctatus, E. fasciatus and Variola louti, Hamacreadium mutabile (Linton, 1910) from Lutjanus fulviflamma and L. kasmira, Helicometra epinepheli Yamaguti, 1934 from E. fasciatus and E. merra, Orthodena tropica Durio et Manter, 1968 from Lethrinus lentjan, Pacificreadium serrani (Nagaty et Abdel-Aal, 1962) from Plectropomus leopardus and Pseudoplagioporus interruptus Durio et Manter, 1968 from Lethrinus rubrioperculatus.
