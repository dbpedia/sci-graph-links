Summary A within-subject, cross-linguistic (L1 and L2) design was used to study poetry readings in two experiments. The primacy of the poetic line as determiner of temporal unitization is challenged. The relatively greater importance of punctuation in this regard is demonstrated. Personal style, language fluency, artistic skill, and characteristics of the respective poems, not characteristics of the specific languages (German, English, and French), are responsible for on- and off-time organization and patterns of emphasis.
