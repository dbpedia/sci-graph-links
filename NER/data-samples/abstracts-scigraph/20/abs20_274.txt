Summary Children growing up with more than one first language present us with a unique opportunity for raising questions about language acquisition which we could hardly answer on the basis of monolingual data alone. In our contribution we will take a close look at developmental asynchronies, i.e. cases where one of the child’s languages develops faster than the other. On the basis of a longitudinal study involving English and German as first languages, we will show what asynchronies can teach us about the relative complexity of a child’s two input languages. In addition, we will identify clever learner strategies (language mixing, the employment of cross-linguistic placeholders, discourse borrowing) that provide us with interesting insights into bilingual children’s metalinguistic awareness of gaps in one of their linguistic systems.
