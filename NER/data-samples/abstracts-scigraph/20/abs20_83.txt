Abstract In this paper we introduce the Kurdish BLARK (Basic Language Resource Kit). The original BLARK has not considered multi-dialect characteristics and generally has targeted reasonably well-resourced languages. To consider these two features, we extended BLARK and applied the proposed extension to Kurdish. Kurdish language not only faces a paucity in resources, but also embraces several dialects within a complex linguistic context. This paper presents the Kurdish BLARK and shows that from Natural language processing and computational linguistics perspectives the revised BLARK provides a more applicable view of languages with similar characteristics to Kurdish.
