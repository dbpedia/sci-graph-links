Abstract The paper considers the interrelation of culture, worldview and language. The cultural differences are acknowledged from the philosophic point of view and determine/are determined by the worldview. The worldview differences predispose the Russian and English national characters and are reflected in the languages: lexis, grammar and speech practices. Vocabulary as the most vulnerable aspect of language registers the changes first. On the basis of the authorâ€™s classification of new vocabulary concepts some changes in the Russian worldview and language are treated as a result of the English culture and language influence.
