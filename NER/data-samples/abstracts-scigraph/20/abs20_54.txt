Conclusions We have formalized the semantics of languages for programming with data types such as compound objects. The semantics was specified for an abstract language. The language was obtained by selecting from the languages L2 and L2B [2, 3] constructs that are most characteristic and most fully reflect the structure of these languages. The semantics is defined by associating with language constructs lambda terms and taking into account the possibility of applying this definition to the simulation of program operation and to the study of algorithm properties in the language of lambda calculus. The method of program operation simulation is the same as in [8].
