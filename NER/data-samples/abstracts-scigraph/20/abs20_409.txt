Abstract A regular component is either autodense or anti-autodense. Characterizations of a regular component being a pure autodense language and being a pure autodense code are obtained. A relationship between intercodes and anti-autodense languages is that for an intercode L of index m, L n is an anti-autodense language for every n > m.
