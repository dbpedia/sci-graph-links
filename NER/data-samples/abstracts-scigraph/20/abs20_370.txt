Abstract Most natural language terms-such as verbs, nouns, conjunctions, prepositions-have a context-dependent meaning. The dependence of the meaning on the context changes with languages. This variability accounts for many errors made by students while learning a foreign language. ALICE is an interactive system which relies on a pragmatic representation of conceptual differences of linguistic terms in several languages (currently, subordinate conjunctions in English, French and Italian) and offers diagnostic and remedial strategies for mistakes made by a student in translating from or into any of the available languages. Although the paradigm of ALICE has a general applicability and is currently used as a framework for knowledge in other domains, in the description of our work we have concentrated on the linguistics subject matter that we have extensively worked on.
