Abstract This paper analyses the policies proposed by three international organisations to eliminate the use of sexist language. This research compares the main guidelines and recommendations presented at supranational level by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union to avoid the use of sexist language. It then evaluates the success of these policies via an analysis of texts. The use of sexist language within official documentation allows us to assess the success of language and gender policies and the extent to which recommendations have been implemented. Results of this research suggest that while significant attempts have been made to eliminate the use of sexist language in these three organisations, the implementation of the language and gender policies is sporadic at best.
