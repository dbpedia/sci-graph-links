Abstract A maching language program for the 6502 KIM-1 microcomputer to produce a pulsed output for modulating a signal generator is described. The pattern of modulation is easily controlled to produce chirps, trills, and pauses as components of artificial insect songs. In the laboratory, increased locomotory activity of male and female field crickets (Teleogryllus commodus) is induced by an artificial calling song. In the field, crickets of both sexes are attracted to pitfall traps from which the song is broadcast.
