Abstract The purpose of this paper is to introduce some new Bonferroni mean operators under interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic environment. First, a class of new operational laws of interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic are proposed. Then, we put forward some new interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Bonferroni mean (IV2TLBM) operators. Moreover, properties and special cases of new aggregation operators are investigated. The main characteristic of the IV2TLBM is that the interrelationship among the input arguments and the closed operations are taken into account. Finally, an approach to multiple attributes group decision making is presented, and a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed method.
