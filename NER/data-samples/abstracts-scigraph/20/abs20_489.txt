Abstract Academic language is critical for English learners (ELs) to succeed in the science classroom. This study analyzed the instructional practices centered around academic language taking place in eight, fifth-grade classrooms during a grant-funded project. Observational data collected through a classroom observation instrument were analyzed to describe and compare the instructional practices occurring in treatment and control classrooms when teachers and students used academic language. Our findings show both treatment and control classrooms using academic language during the course of the intervention study, but the instruction looked markedly different in each setting. These differences provide valuable insight for practitioners and researchers concerned with the academic language development of ELs in science classrooms.
