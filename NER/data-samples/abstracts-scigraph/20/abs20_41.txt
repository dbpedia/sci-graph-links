Abstract The calling song of the field cricket, Teleogryllus taiwanemma, is usually considered to consist of sequences of separate chirps. However, sometimes it comprises a phrase of several chirps in a row, with one long chirp (chirp) and a few short chirps (trills). In this study, I compared the phrase containing only chirps with that containing both chirps and trills by analyzing male songs and conducting playback experiments of male songs to females. The song analyses showed significant differences between chirps and trills for all song parameters except bandwidth. To test whether female preference differed with respect to the two phrases, I performed two-speaker playback experiments. When the same numbers of phrases were presented per unit time, females preferred the song with trills to that without trills. This result may reflect female preference for songs with greater sound density. In subsequent playback experiments, I equalized the total sound duration per unit time (duty cycle) in songs with and without trills. The numbers of females that preferred songs with and without trills did not differ significantly. This suggests that trills can attract females like chirps do, even though the two sounds have different components.
