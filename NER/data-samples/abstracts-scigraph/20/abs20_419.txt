Abstract For a graph $$G=(V,E)$$ G=(V,E) , a Roman dominating function $$f:V\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$$ f:V→{0,1,2} has the property that every vertex $$v\in V$$ v∈V with $$f(v)=0$$ f(v)=0 has a neighbor $$u$$ u with $$f(u)=2$$ f(u)=2 . The weight of a Roman dominating function $$f$$ f is the sum $$f(V)=\sum \nolimits _{v\in V}f(v)$$ f(V)=∑v∈Vf(v) , and the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function on $$G$$ G is the Roman domination number of $$G$$ G . In this paper, we define the Roman independence number, the upper Roman domination number and the upper and lower Roman irredundance numbers, and then develop a Roman domination chain parallel to the well-known domination chain. We also develop sharpness, strictness and bounds for the Roman domination chain inequalities.
