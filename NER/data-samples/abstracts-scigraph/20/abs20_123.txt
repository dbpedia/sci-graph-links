Abstract Linguistic diversity in Switzerland, which is generally regarded as a successful case of language management, is currently being challenged. One of the most significant reasons for this is the growing importance of English. While national languages were traditionally taught as the first foreign language and English as the second foreign language throughout Switzerland, English has gained in importance, leading, in some cantons, to its earlier introduction, or/and more hours of English in the curriculum. This paper reviews these issues, taking the historical roots and institutional aspects of Swiss multilingualism into account. Current developments in language education are analysed not just as pedagogical, put as political and policy responses to the major challenges confronting the longstanding principles of diversity management in Switzerland.
