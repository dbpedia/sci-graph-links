Abstract At a time when cooperation between Europe and the Arab World is getting more and more concrete, this article highlights the reciprocal influences between languages and legal culture both North and South of the Mediterranean for the redaction of a common discourse. Europe conceives and produces numerous pieces of legislation that have a significant impact on both Maghreb and Mashriq. It is thus necessary to look back at a few seminal studies on European legal discourse to focus on the various types of corpus used, as well as how they are perceived abroad. This state of play underlines the linguistic and cultural interactions that will be faced by language studies in Europe in the fields of terminology, semantics and pragmatics.
