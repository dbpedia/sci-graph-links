Abstract Primary lymphoma of the liver is an extremely rare entity; only eight cases have been reported in the literature. We treated a 34-year-old man with primary hepatic lymphoma by right hepatic lobectomy, including right hemicolectomy and nephrectomy. The histological diagnosis was a small cell diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Details of this case plus that of others in the literature are described in this report.
