Abstract Recently excavated roman amphorae were submitted to instrumental neutron activation analysis for the determination of Ca, Sc, Cr, Fe, Co, Sb, Ba, La, Ce, Eu, Yb, Lu, Hf and Th. Data reduction was carried out by identifying first the elements useful for discrimination purposes and then by submitting the data to cluster analysis. Amphorae are parted in two groups which are related to different provenance areas.
