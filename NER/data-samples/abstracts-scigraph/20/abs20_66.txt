Abstract Two years into the new millennium,there is still a considerable mismatch betweenthe aspirations of the official Englishcurriculum in Australia (in both compulsory andpost-compulsory schooling) and the curriculumenacted in secondary English classrooms by anaging teaching profession, in four criticalareas of teacher experience: teachers' use ofmultimodal texts; their metalinguisticknowledge; their understanding of criticalsocio-cultural practice; and their confidencewith integrating Information and CommunicationTechnologies (ICT) into their learning andteaching. The current generation of pre-servicesecondary English teachers in Australia arethose who are ``in-between'' in each of thesefour areas. In their one year Diploma ofEducation program at the University ofMelbourne, a cohort of such pre-service Englishteachers are using a CD ROM (``BuildingUnderstandings in Literacy and Teaching'' â€“``BUILT'') to develop understandings aboutlanguage, text and ICTs as integratedpedagogical resources. Using innovative andauthentic multi-media, BUILT was designed tooffer a social semiotic account of language andan account of texts as multi-modal socialproducts. BUILT models active, engaging,reflective pedagogy and provides noviceteachers with opportunities to rehearse theforms of ICT they could be integrating in theirclassroom teaching as they learn about languageand literacy themselves. Working with such amulti-media resource, these novice teachers aresupported in accommodating both new theoreticalperspectives and new modes of learning with ICTthat have the potential to transform the shapeof English teaching in the 21st century.
