Abstract The paper presents the language policy (arabisation) pursued in Algeria since independence in 1962. The first section of the paper focuses on the recent changes in government language policy (return to Arabic–French bilingualism in schools) and reactions to them following the recommendations made by the National Commission for the Reform of the Educational System in March 2001. The second part gives a historical background to post-independent language-in-education planning. The third section looks at the unplanned developments resulting from the hegemonic nature of linguistic arabisation. The fourth section explores secondary school students’ attitudinal reactions towards Algeria’s linguistic pluralism. Finally, the paper argues that the Algerian leadership’s refusal to recognise linguistic pluralism considered beneficial by the majority of the population represents one of the major obstacles to the nation-building process.
