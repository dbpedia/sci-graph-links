Abstract Second Life (SL) has been gaining increased attention in Education since it was launched in 2003. Language educators explored SL mainly as a virtual learning environment where learners can interact with native speakers (e.g., Hislope, 2008; Wang, Song, Xia, & Yan, 2009). Although most studies concluded positively about using SL for language learning and teaching, none of them have solved or avoided the practical issues associated with SL. These practical issues made SLbased language learning conceptually applicable but difficult to conduct. The purpose of this study was to use SL to assist language learning without the cost of tackling SL-related problems. In this study, students from an English-as-foreign-language (EFL) class in China were assigned to develop a Chinese version of the Second Life manual by translating English materials from various media. The findings of this study indicated that SL served appropriately both as a language learning task and a motivation factor.
