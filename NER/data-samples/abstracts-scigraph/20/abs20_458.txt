Abstract This paper examines the opinions of Malawian legislators with respect to the efficacy of introducing local languages into the Malawi National Assembly. Using data collected through questionnaires, structured and non-structured interviews, participant observation, and document analysis, the paper argues for the need to introduce Chichewa, the national lingua franca, into the Malawi National Assembly as an alternative language to aid those legislators who are not sufficiently competent in English, the only language currently used in parliament. By promoting the use of indigenous languages in such formal domains as the legislature, the study will significantly contribute to the promotion of democracy in Malawi; it will widen the democratic base of society and ensure wider participation in national politics.
