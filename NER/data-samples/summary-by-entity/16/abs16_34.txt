Abstract This paper brings a social science perspective (from the ethnicity and diversity literature) to bear on a process that is regarded by many as essentially a technical one: the safe insertion of military unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the (inter)national European airspace. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain a more adequate scientific socio-technological understanding of the topic, so as to strengthen issue dialogue and discussion. Indeed, studying the “integration” of these UASs (as this process is often referred to) through the lens of acculturation literature revealed some socio-technological processes that have been little noticed but which seem to underlie and inform this debate. For example, some voices seem to be favoured over others, a well-known phenomenon in the ethnicity and diversity literature. Safety, it could even be argued, is in this debate the pivot point around which social and other dynamics revolve. Belief and power may thus be more important factors here—“masked” of course—than technical aspects of safety. The results of this study are important not only for the military since the incorporation of military UAS occurs, partially at least, in civilian airspace. Civil actors thus formed a substantial subset of those interviewed here.
