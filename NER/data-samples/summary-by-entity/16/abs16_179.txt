Abstract AimOur aim is to compare how residents from two social housing neighbourhoods of Porto City, one rehabilitated and one non-rehabilitated, perceived their living conditions, health and quality of life. Subjects and methodsA cross-sectional study was conducted, selecting residents from two social housing neighbourhoods of Porto City, one rehabilitated and another one non-rehabilitated. The information was collected through quantitative (a structured questionnaire; n = 82) and qualitative face-to-face interviews administered by trained interviewers (n = 16). ResultsNo significant differences were found between populations from both neighbourhoods regarding social, behavioural and health characteristics. The major differences among neighbourhoods were found on variables such as satisfaction with house, the need of rehabilitation work, and the absence of mould and dampness in the house (p < 0.001) as well as pollution (p < 0.05). Qualitative data showed that residents from the rehabilitated houses were pleased not to have been moved to another location and were very satisfied with the rehabilitation work, which in their perception contributed to the residents’ wellbeing. Nominal and ordinal variables were described using proportions and compared using the chi-square test. Quantitative continuous variables were presented as a median (percentile 25 to percentile 75) and they were compared via the Mann-Whitney test. ConclusionPublic economic and financing resources should be redirected to social housing rehabilitation that, although in the short term does not have a direct impact on health savings for the occupants, is an important dimension of the residents’ sense of wellbeing and satisfaction.
