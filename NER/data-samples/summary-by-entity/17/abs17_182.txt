Abstract Evidence suggests that diagnostic error plays a major role in America’s suboptimal patient care. Evidence also suggests that generalizable problem solving or clinical reasoning skills are not the primary determinant of diagnostic accuracy. Rather, knowledge-based constructs likely play a greater role in diagnostic performance. Dual processing theory (DPT) posits how knowledge-based constructs and information processing (problem solving or reasoning) mechanisms work together to enable categorization tasks such as differential diagnosis. This manuscript describes how medical educators might use DPT to create training and testing methods to improve the diagnostic capabilities of tomorrow’s practitioners and subsequently patient care outcomes.
