Abstract Programming a robot to act intelligently is a challenging endeavor beyond the skill level of most people. Trained roboticists generally program robots for a single purpose. Enabling robots to be programmed by non-experts and to perform multiple tasks are both open challenges in robotics. This paper presents a framework that allows life-long robot task learning from demonstrations. To make that possible, the paper introduces a task representation based on influence diagrams, and a method to transfer knowledge between similar tasks. A novel approach to influence diagram learning is presented along with a demonstration method that allows non-experts to teach tasks to the robot in an intuitive manner. The results from three user studies validate that the approach enables both a simulated and a physical robot to learn complex tasks from a variety of teachers, refining those tasks during on-line performance, successfully completing the tasks in different environments, and transferring knowledge from one task to another.
