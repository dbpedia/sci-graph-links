Abstract This paper considers pre-retrofit and post-retrofit lighting energy end-use of two sub-metered office spaces. Building lighting retrofits are typically installed to reduce energy consumption and operational costs of buildings. This traditionally includes replacing lights and introducing Building Management System (BMS). Through this process, an occupant’s ability to override new computerized controls could be compromised, which can dramatically affect the overall success of the project. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the effectiveness of the lighting retrofit, influence of the BMS upgrade, occupant behavior, and the lessons learned. The analysis comprises three different phases including one pre-retrofit and two post-retrofit phases. Each of the retrofit phases lasted approximately one year, leading to the monitoring of three years of sub-metered lighting energy end-use. The results showed that when the occupants had access to the lighting switches while BMS managed the operational lighting schedule, the office area with the responsible occupant saved 23.2�ompared to the pre-retrofit phase. For the second lighting retrofit phase when the occupants did not have access to the light switches, the lighting schedule operated for more than two hours after the typical work day and the occupant was not able to turn off the lights upon departure. It should be noted that there are limited numbers of studies that consider three years sub-metered lighting retrofit data with the presented granularities in this study. Similar lighting retrofit projects could benefit from the findings of this study. Finally, the results of this sub-metered lighting data could address uncertainty in the selection of lighting power density and associated schedules of building energy simulations.
