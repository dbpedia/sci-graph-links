Abstract The various civilizations which followed one another on the Algerian territory marked it by their presence. The architectural and urban production of each period displays its concepts and its styles, each rich with specific characteristics. The most representative buildings date to the Ottoman period and especially to French colonization. During the latter, and with the multiplication of the administrative offices, numerous public buildings represent different styles: Neoclassical, eclectic, neo-Moorish and art deco, each lying next to one another. Nevertheless, each building was intended to indicate its function. Numerous studies of the buildings erected during the first half of the twentieth century and particularly on the attributes of the neo-Moorish style were examined unlike the architectural output resulting from the Second Empire and relating to public civil architecture, due to the lack of monographic work. Our knowledge in this field thus remains to be improved and constituted. This paper is devoted to the town hall of Annaba, through which we will illustrate the attributes and architectonic specificities as well as the codes inherent in French public civil architecture in Algeria.
