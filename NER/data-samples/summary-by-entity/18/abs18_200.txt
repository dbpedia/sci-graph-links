Abstract We consider linear Hawkes process N t and its inverse process T n . The limit theorems for T n are well known and studied by many authors. In this paper, we study the limit theorems for N t . In particular, we investigate the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and the large deviation principle for N t . The main tool of the proof is based on immigration-birth representation and the observations on the relation between T n and T n .
