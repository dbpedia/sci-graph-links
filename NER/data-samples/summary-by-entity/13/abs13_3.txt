Abstract This paper estimates the discrepancy in university mathematics and science course grades across races. Although there are significant Black–White and Hispanic–White grade discrepancies, or gaps, Black and Hispanic students who are equally prepared for university as White students do as well as White students. The grade gaps are explained after accounting for important factors such as a student’s academic capabilities and socioeconomic status. Varying behaviors of university students relative to high school across races are ruled out as a possible source of the grade gaps.
