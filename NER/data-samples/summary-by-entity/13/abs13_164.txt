Abstract This study examined the impact of a targeted, faculty-led, between-exam review session on re-test performance in a “two-test” system that allows students to test, revisit material, and re-test. Scores from the midterm multiple choice examinations were compared between academic years (AY) 2013–2014, when a review session was held between the test and re-test, and AY 2014–15, which had similar content, but no between-exam review. Despite being well received by the students, the review did not significantly affect the increase in score between the test and re-test. Thus, contrary to our predictions and student evaluations, the review session did not improve the re-test performance over self-study.
