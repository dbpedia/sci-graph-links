Abstract This paper focuses on the use of NVivo10 in the process of assessing a developmental program in goal-corrected emphatic attunement skills in the context of a psychology master’s program course. The authors present the way the software supported this work and discuss how it enabled a process of moving closer to and distancing themselves from the data. The possibility to analyse data in different perspectives—cross-sectional and longitudinal—is also discussed, using qualitative research and analysing different groups of participants (cases) and different years of the program as the project research questions evolved.
