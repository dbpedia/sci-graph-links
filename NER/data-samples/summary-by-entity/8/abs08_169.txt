Abstract This paper presents a review of the literature on generating cutting paths for laser cutting machines. Firstly, the cutting path problem is defined including all relevant technical side constraints which exist plentifully in laser cutting. Secondly, a former classification method is updated to include all types of cutting path problems. Thirdly, a comprehensive review of solution methods and related applications is presented. Throughout the literature review, trends in research in cutting path generation and interesting areas for future research are identified.
