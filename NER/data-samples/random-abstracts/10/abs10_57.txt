Abstract In this paper, we proposed a three-dimensional metamaterial absorber with ultra-broadband in terahertz region. Compared with other three-layer structures, our structure is only composed of graphite film and a metal plate. The simulated results show that the metamaterial absorber can achieve an ultra-broadband absorption more than 90 % from 3 to 9 THz for either transverse electric or magnetic polarization wave at normal incidence. In addition, the absorption properties based on the oblique incidence and different polarization angles are also observed. A good absorption bandwidth can be kept when the incidence angle is up to 60°. Moreover, the absorber is polarization-insensitive with the polarization angle increase. Finally, the power loss density and surface current distributions at distinct resonance point are analyzed, which can demonstrate that the graphite plays an important role for the absorption of electromagnetic waves. We believe that the design idea of the three-dimensional metamaterial absorber maybe can extend to microwave, infrared or optical region.
