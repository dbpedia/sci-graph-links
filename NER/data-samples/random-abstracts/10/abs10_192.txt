Abstract In order to increase the efficiency of mobile video transmission in a 5G network, this paper investigates a cooperative multicast of scalable video using network coding with adaptive modulation and coding over dedicated relay-based cellular networks. Different scalable video layers prefer different protection degrees, and user equipments (UEs) in different locations experience different packet loss rates in wireless networks. Guaranteeing that all UEs experience a certain level of video quality is one of the biggest challenges in scalable video multicast. Using the number of satisfied UEs as a metric, the proposed efficient scalable video multicast based on network-coded cooperation (SVM-NC) scheme, combined with adaptive modulation and coding, enhances the attainable system performance under strict time and bandwidth resource constraints for guaranteed smooth playback. Various simulations were performed for performance evaluation. The proposed scheme ensures that the expected percentage of satisfied UEs approximately achieves the maximum number of UEs in a multicast group by using network-coded cooperation over dedicated relay-based cellular networks. In addition, the peak signal-to-noise ratio metric is asymptotic to the maximum performance of high-resolution video quality offered by service providers.
