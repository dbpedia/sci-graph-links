Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is not just one technologyâ€“it is many technologies working together to increase the automation, safety, and efficiency of everyday tasks. Smart homes, which are very much a part of smart cities, typically use a different combination of technologies to enable IoT features. Familiar wireless technologies, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC, combine with sensors and special light fixtures, to create smart homes that are more efficient, more automated, and more programmable.
