Abstract This paper presents a Vivaldi antenna. The antenna incorporates a slot-line feed, and is designed to operate in a wideband mode, along with four narrowband modes. The wideband mode extends from 1 to 3 GHz. A series of PIN diode switches is employed to reconfigure between the five different operating modes. Wideband-to-multiband reconfigurations are achieved by adjusting the antenna loading internally, and also by the incorporation of band-stop filters. To obtain the wideband mode, wideband matches load is used. On the other hand, to obtain the narrowband modes, two rectangular slits with narrowband matches load are used. The proposed Vivaldi antenna provides wideband operation. It is also supports operation within the LTE, GSM (L-band), GPS, and WiMAX bands.
