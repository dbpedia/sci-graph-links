Abstract This paper presents the design and simulation of low actuation DC RF MEMS ohmic series switches. The proposed switches are suitable for applications to be used in the frequency range from DC to 10 GHz. Therefore these switches can be used for satellite communication and other microwave communication applications. The structure of the series switch is designed to obtain low pull-in voltages in the range of 6–14 V. The switches are simulated in CoventorWare while the RF characteristics are extracted using ANSOFT HFSS. The results show low insertion loss in the range of 0.005 to 0.06 dB and high isolation in the range of −70 to −76 dB.
