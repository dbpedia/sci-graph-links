Abstract Cognitive radio combined with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications provides high data rate, efficiency and high reliability. One of the most important challenges in MIMO communication is combating MIMO multipath channel. MIMO blind equalizers and channel estimators combat MIMO multipath channels without the use of training or pilot sequences. First, the multipath channel is converted into instantaneous mixture channel (IMC), using second-order statistics of the data. Then using higher-order statistics, these mixtures are separated. However, proper selection of IMC is a major challenge. In this paper, a novel blind algorithm for choosing the best IMC is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on the cumulant value of the received signal.
