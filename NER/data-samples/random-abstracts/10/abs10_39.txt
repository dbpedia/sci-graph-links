Abstract The bandpass sampling technique is a promising solution for the architecture of software-defined radio receivers. It is possible to digitize signals directly from the radio frequency stage when properly selecting the sampling frequency. With multistandard or multiband radio receivers, system nonlinearities mainly due to low noise amplifiers and downconversion circuits can generate rich output spectra with variable amplitude component levels. Bandpass sampling of such a spectrum, without causing aliasing, is a challenging task. For a nonlinear system, the minimum sampling frequency has been derived only for single-band and dual-band input signals. In this paper, a generalized bandpass sampling algorithm is developed to determine a minimum valid bandpass sampling frequency for either linear or nonlinear systems by considering a multiband input spectrum. Our objective is reducing the complexity of the sampling frequency calculation. Implementation results demonstrate the efficiency and low complexity of the proposed algorithm.
