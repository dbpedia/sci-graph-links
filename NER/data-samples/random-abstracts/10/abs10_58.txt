Abstract The use of artificial neural networks as the objective function of optimization algorithms is proposed in the recent past. In this paper, the use of artificial neural networks ensemble as objective function in place of single artificial neural networks is proposed. An ensemble hybrid algorithm is developed by using artificial neural networks and bacterial foraging optimization algorithm technique for designing a fractal antenna of a rectenna system working at 2.45 GHz. The closed form expressions are not available for the fractal antennas, so the use of artificial intelligence techniques for their design is appropriate. As the size reduction in rectenna systems used in wireless devices is a significant research domain to meet the demand for reduced size handheld devices, so the geometry of the antenna is selected to achieve this objective and a size reduction of 34.39 % is attained. The bandwidth enhancement of the proposed antenna is also achieved so that it can be used over wide band. The performance of the proposed optimized fractal antenna is verified using simulation and experimental results.
