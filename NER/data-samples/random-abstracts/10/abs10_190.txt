Abstract Within Industrie 4.0, Internet technologies are a key component to enable horizontal integration and thus novel business scenarios such as smart services for maintenance. However, in the past several years numerous targeted attacks on industrial control systems have been discovered. This paper highlights the diverse threat landscape and then describes a stratified security architecture for a specific industrial scenario from an ongoing research project. The resulting system uses a Broker-based data exchange infrastructure and hardware-based security to provide transparent and end-to-end protected data exchange.
