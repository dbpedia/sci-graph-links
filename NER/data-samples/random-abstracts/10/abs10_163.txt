Abstract Modern data management systems often need to deal with massive, dynamic and inherently distributed data sources. We collect the data using a distributed network, and at the same time try to maintain a global view of the data at a central coordinator using a minimal amount of communication. Such applications have been captured by the distributed monitoring model which has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. In this paper we investigate the monitoring of the entropy functions, which are very useful in network monitoring applications such as detecting distributed denial-of-service attacks. Our results improve the previous best results by Arackaparambil et al. in ICLP 1: 95–106 (2009). Our technical contribution also includes implementing the celebrated AMS sampling method (by Alon et al. in J Comput Syst Sci 58(1): 137–147 1999) in the distributed monitoring model, which could be of independent interest.
