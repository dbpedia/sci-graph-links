This study aimed to optimize the applicability of an immunoliposome-based immunomagnetic concentration and separation assay to facilitate rapid detection of Cronobacter sakazakii in powdered infant formula (PIF). To determine the detection limit, specificity, and pre-enrichment incubation time (0, 4, 6, and 8 h), assay tests were performed with different cell numbers of C. sakazakii (2 × 100 and 2 × 101 CFU/ml) inoculated in 10 g of PIF. The assay was able to detect as few as 2 cells of C. sakazakii/10 g of PIF sample after 6 h of pre-enrichment incubation with an assay time of 2 h 30 min. The assay was assessed for cross-reactivity with other bacterial strains and exhibited strong specificity to C. sakazakii. Moreover, the assay method was applied to the detection of C. sakazakii in PIF without pre-enrichment steps, and the results were compared with INC-ELISA and RT-PCR. The developed method was able to detect C. sakazakii in spiked PIF without pre-enrichment, whereas INC-ELISA failed to detect C. sakazakii. In addition, when compared with the results obtained with RT-PCR, our developed assay required lesser detection time. The developed assay was also not susceptible to any effect of the food matrix or background contaminant microflora.
