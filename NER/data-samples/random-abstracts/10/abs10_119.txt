Abstract In this paper, a novel single-stage single-phase buckâ€“boost inverter design is presented. Depending on the duty ratio, the output voltage of the proposed inverter can be lower or higher than the DC input one. Similar to the conventional voltage source inverter, the proposed inverter includes four power electronic switches without the need for any extra switches. All the inverter four switches can be IGBTs or two of them can be replaced by two thyristors with the same circuit design providing a reduction in the circuit cost. The theoretical analysis and modeling of the proposed inverter are presented. The performance of the proposed inverter is theoretically and experimentally studied to validate the presented circuit design.
