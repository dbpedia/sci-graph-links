Abstract In this article, a simple method to tailor the focal patterns of high NA parabolic mirror by manipulating the position of vortex pair of opposite topological charge nested in an azimuthally polarized Gaussian beam is demonstrated numerically using Vector Diffraction Theory. It is observed that proper manipulation of position between the vortex pair generates novel focal patterns including focal hole, transversely polarized focal spot and flat top focus of sub wavelength scale are generated.
