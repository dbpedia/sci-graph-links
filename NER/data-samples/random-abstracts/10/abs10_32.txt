Abstract The authors describe the fabrication of a nanocomposite consisting of reduced graphene oxide, zinc oxide and silver nanoparticles by microwave-assisted synthesis. The composite was further reduced in-situ with hydrazine hydrate and then placed, along with the enzyme glucose oxidase, on a glassy carbon electrode. The synergistic effect of the materials employed in the nanocomposite result in excellent electrocatalytic activity. The Michaelis-Menten constant of the adsorbed GOx is 0.25 mM, implying a remarkable affinity of the GOx for glucose. The amperometric response of the modified GCE is linearly proportional to the concentration of glucose in 0.1 to 12.0 mM concentration range, and the detection limit is 10.6 µM. The biosensor is highly selective, well reproducible and stable. Graphical abstractA nanocomposite consisting of graphene oxide, zinc oxide and silver nanoparticles was prepared by microwave-assisted synthesis and further reduced with 85 % hydrazine hydrate (HAA). The material was incorporated, along with glucose oxidase, into a chitosan (CS) matrix on a glassy carbon electrode to give a glucose biosensor with a 10.6 µM detection limit.
