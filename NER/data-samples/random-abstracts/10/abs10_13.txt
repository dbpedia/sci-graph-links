Abstract In this research, single-phase nanoparticles of La0.8Ag0.2MnO3 with mean particle size of 15 nm have been synthesized by sol–gel method. The microwave properties of La0.8Ag0.2MnO3/paraffin nanocomposite are studied by measuring the complex permittivity and permeability in the frequency range of 1–18 GHz. The composite shows both reflection and absorption electromagnetic shielding effectiveness with maximum total value of 36 dB, which is suitable for defense and microwave radiation shielding applications at high temperatures. The electromagnetic absorption properties are described in terms of dielectric relaxation processes.
