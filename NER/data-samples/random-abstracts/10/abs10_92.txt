Abstract Performance optimization is one of the core issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The existing efforts on performance optimization mainly consist of two research themes: power control and sleep scheduling. A well-designed network performance optimization method is not only close to the actual but also has good generality. There are many aspects that need to be studied. This paper aims to pursue a trade-off between network comprehensive performance and survival time by employing gain and cost to characterize the whole network performance. Towards this goal, a comprehensive performance optimization evaluation model based on complex network theory is proposed. In addition, a relevant optimization algorithm is proposed, which bears a number of merits such as low complexity and competitive performance. Simulation results show that WSNs have the best network average degree to make network obtain maximum income.
