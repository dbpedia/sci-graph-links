Abstract Swarm intelligence (SI)-based metaheuristics are well applied to solve real-time optimization problems of efficient node clustering and energy-aware data routing in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents another superior approach for these optimization problems based on an artificial bee colony metaheuristic. The proposed clustering algorithm presents an efficient cluster formation mechanism with improved cluster head selection criteria based on a multi-objective fitness function, whereas the routing algorithm is devised to consume minimum energy with least hop-count for data transmission. Extensive evaluation and comparison of the proposed approach with existing well-known SI-based algorithms demonstrate its superiority over others in terms of packet delivery ratio, average energy consumed, average throughput and network life.
