Abstract In this paper, a high-efficiency and broadband reflective linear polarization rotator based on anisotropic metamaterial is proposed, which is verified by simulation and experiment. Simulated results indicate that our design can achieve 90° polarization rotation from 5.7 to 10.3 GHz with the relative bandwidth of 57.5 %, which is agreement well with experiment. The further simulated results indicate that our design can achieve linear polarization conversion or rotation by 90° under oblique incident angles with large range for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic waves. Finally, the amplitude and phase of reflective coefficients with different polarization, and surface current distribution of the unit cell structure are simulated to explain the physics mechanism of the high-efficiency and broadband polarization rotation. Our design will provide an important reference for the practical applications of the metamaterial in polarization manipulation.
