Abstract In a recent paper, Agarwa et al. (Appl Phys A 122:166, 2016) proposed a structure of metamaterial unit cell, which could realize dual-band absorption in C-band, and by altering its design parameters, broadband absorption in X-band could also be easily achieved, and its peak absorptivity is over 99 %. However, we find that the peak absorptivity is 40 % in C-band and 32 % in X-band, since the ostensible good return loss performance is caused by the polarization rotation rather than the absorption.
