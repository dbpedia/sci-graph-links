Abstract A multi-cell multi-input multi-output energy-harvesting network for factory-of-things is considered, where the control panel and smart devices are equipped with multiple antennas. Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer can deliver radio frequency energy for devices in the network, thus formulating the issue of quality of service(QoS). Each cell composes of one control panel and several smart devices where the process of SWIPT causes interference to each other, leading to a complicated non-convex problem. In order to solve it, the linear beamformers and receivers have been designed to maintain the QoS by minimizing the interference. Based on the minimum mean-square-error criterion, an joint controller-device design in which the control panels and smart devices would satisfy the transmit power constraints and the receiving energy bound is proposed. Numerical results of MSE uncover good performance of our proposed algorithm in this network.
