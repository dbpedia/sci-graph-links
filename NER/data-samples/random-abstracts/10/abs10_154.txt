Abstract In order to provide committed Quality of Service (QoS) to the users, telecommunication service providers use different resource allocation techniques. One of such schemes is the adaptive bandwidth allocation technique. QoS is improved by minimizing the probability of dropping and blocking calls and by allocating channels, optimally. In this paper, reserved channel technique has been considered for High Altitude Platform (HAP) based communication services deployment. Such implementation is especially feasible in HAP as, on a single HAP, multiple mobile cells are created and optimal resource allocation could be done, centrally. By varying the value of reserved channels and reserved channels for hand-off, we report that the probability of blocking of a new call and successful hand-off of an ongoing call is greatly improved.
