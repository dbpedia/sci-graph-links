Abstract Wireless sensor network being a dominant prerequisite in the modern pervasive environment has nodes connected with multi-hop to transmit and reinforce continuous monitoring with real-time updates from the field environment. To achieve pervasiveness integrating wireless and physical devices is unavoidable. Numerous self-organized tiny sensor nodes cooperate with each other to form the clusters and the most prominent node act as cluster head (CH). The cluster head pioneered based on its battery forte whose failure affects rest of the communications. In this paper, we discuss on the essential of idle resource sharing using participatory devices as relay nodes along with node failure rate and node density to achieve reliable communication. The earlier performances are observed and results are revealed. Hence we concentrate on minimizing the task of CH using relay nodes such as participatory devices and the faulty nodes are identified over Poisson distribution which observes the failure probability without affecting communication and reduced resource consumption.
