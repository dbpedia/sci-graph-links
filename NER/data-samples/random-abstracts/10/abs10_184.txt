Abstract Concomitant with rapid advancements in video streaming technology, concurrence video traffic has increased significantly on communication channels. Conflicts often arise among the various video streams on these communication channels when the available bandwidth is limited because the bitrates and transmission range required often vary. This study proposes a server-side-based rate allocation algorithm for content delivery networks (CDNs). Instead of simply considering bitrate selection from the perspective of network and client conditions, the algorithm combines user experience with video bitrate allocation to maximize viewer engagement. First, the values of users are evaluated and a user value computation method is proposed. Second, we developed a profit maximization bitrate allocation approach (PMBAA) that enables both content providers and CDNs to maximize profits by providing guaranteed video quality. At last, the results of test bed experiments and analyses verify that PMBAA enables high-value clients to obtain more preferable bitrates than the HTTP live streaming algorithm developed by Apple Inc.
