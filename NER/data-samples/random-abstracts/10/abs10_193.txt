Abstract Channel based clock synchronization in packet switched networks (PSNs) is considered for, but not limited to, the time and safety/security critical application of power system protection. The synchronization accuracy requirement of power system protection devices used for line current differential protection is $$10\,\upmu $$ 10Î¼ s, which could be achieved in time division multiplexing networks that were traditionally used in that domain. In PSN, highly accurate synchronization can be achieved with the standard synchronization method IEEE 1588-2008 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) when devices in the communication network are equipped with so called boundary clocks (BCs) or transparent clocks (TCs). However, when BCs or TCs are not available, the required accuracy can hardly be achieved. In this work, a modification of the PTP is proposed that replaces the clock parameter estimation and the computation of the clock control signal. Thereby, the statistics of measured packet delays are considered to select optimum estimation schemes. It is shown that the here proposed method outperforms the Linux PTP in terms of timing accuracy by a factor of 2 in enterprise local area networks and by a factor of 10 in Carrier Ethernet wide area networks.
