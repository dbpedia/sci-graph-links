Emerging nano-scale technologies are pushing the fabrication boundaries at their limits, for leveraging an even higher density of nano-devices towards reaching 4F2/cell footprint in 3D arrays. Here, we study the liftoff process limits to achieve extreme dense nanowires while ensuring preservation of thin film quality. The proposed method is optimized for attaining a multiple layer fabrication to reliably achieve 3D nano-device stacks of 32 × 32 nanowire arrays across 6-inch wafer, using electron beam lithography at 100 kV and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist at different thicknesses. The resist thickness and its geometric profile after development were identified to be the major limiting factors, and suggestions for addressing these issues are provided. Multiple layers were successfully achieved to fabricate arrays of 1 Ki cells that have sub- 15 nm nanowires distant by 28 nm across 6-inch wafer.
