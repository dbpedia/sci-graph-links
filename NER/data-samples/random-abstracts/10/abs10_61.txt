Abstract In this study, we report on the fabrication of simple and rapid graphene quantum dots (GQDs)-based fluorescence “turn-ON” nanoprobes for sensitive and selective detection of ascorbic acid (AA). Pristine GQDs and S and N co-doped-GQDs (SN-GQDs) were functionalized with 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxide (4-amino-TEMPO, a nitroxide free radical). The nitroxide free radicals efficiently quenched the fluorescence of the GQDs and upon interaction of the nanoconjugates with ascorbic acid, the quenched fluorescence was restored. The linear ranges recorded were 0.5–5.7 μM and 0.1–5.5 μM for GQDs-4-amino-TEMPO and SN-GQDs-4amino-TEMPO nanoprobes, respectively. Limits of detection were found to be 60 nM and 84 nM for SN-GQDS-4-amino-TEMPO and GQDs-4-amino-TEMPO for AA detection, respectively. This novel fluorescence “turn-ON” technique showed to be highly rapid and selective towards AA detection.
