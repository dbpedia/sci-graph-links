Abstract It is crucial to reveal the plasmon peak sensitivity responses of individual Cu nanoparticles, which provide another kind of plasmon sensors besides Au/Ag ones. In this paper, such responses to both the bulk and local refractive index (RI) of individual Cu nanosphere sensors are theoretically investigated by Mie theory. Both of them are revealed to be quadratic. The underlying mechanisms are elucidated well in terms of Rayleigh approximation. The corresponding sensitivity factors are demonstrated to increase with the RI of the nanospheres’ bulk and local surrounding mediums linearly. The plasmon peak sensitivities and sensitivity factors of experimentally encountered Cu@Cu2O core–shell nanoparticles are calculated as well, which reveals that appropriate dielectric encapsulations to Cu nanospheres are favored for their potential plasmonic sensing and detection applications.
