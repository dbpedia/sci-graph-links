Abstract A compact multiband pattern diversity antenna for Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) applications is being proposed. The pattern diversity antenna is designed for 2.6 GHz LTE, 3.5/5.5 GHz WiMax, 3.3 GHz MIMO and 5.2 GHz WLAN applications for mobile devices. The compact size of the MIMO antenna (41.05 × 21.1 mm) is due to having compact individual monopole antennas each of dimension 17.5 × 10 mm. A T-shaped and inverted L-shaped stub in the ground plane reduces mutual coupling due to near field whereas slots introduced in the ground plane prevents current to flow through the common ground plane. The important characteristics of MIMO antenna like diversity gain and envelope correlation coefficient have also been presented. Measured and simulated radiation patterns presented show that the MIMO antenna proposed provide pattern diversity.
