Abstract We consider the semilinear Lane–Emden problem where B is the unit ball of $$\mathbb {R}^N$$ RN , $$N\ge 2$$ N≥2 , centered at the origin and $$1<p<p_S$$ 1<p<pS , with $$p_S=+\infty $$ pS=+∞ if $$N=2$$ N=2 and $$p_S=\frac{N+2}{N-2}$$ pS=N+2N-2 if $$N\ge 3$$ N≥3 . Our main result is to prove that in dimension $$N=2$$ N=2 the Morse index of the least energy sign-changing radial solution $$u_p$$ up of $$({\mathscr {E}}_{p})$$ (Ep) is exactly 12 if p is sufficiently large. As an intermediate step we compute explicitly the first eigenvalue of a limit weighted problem in $$\mathbb {R}^N$$ RN in any dimension $$N\ge 2$$ N≥2 .
