Abstract This paper proposed a kind of real-time online solving method based on the analog circuit for the output signal solution of frequency resonant gyroscope. This method firstly established the vibration differential equation of frequency resonant gyroscope, deduced the output signal solving model under some constraints, and used the digital simulation technology for the principle verification of solving equation. Then the verification results showed that the solving equation was feasible. Subsequently, the corresponding circuit design scheme and specific analog circuit design were given, the differential equation of this solving circuit was deduced, and the equivalent relation between the theoretically solving model and circuit differential equation was built. The experimental results showed that there existed a higher linearity between input signal and output signal of angular rate as well as that adj. R2 reached 0.99978. Hence, these experimental results verified the effectiveness of this method. Simultaneously, the analog circuit of the whole solving process was likely to provide the integrated and small solving unit in future. This solving method provided a new way to solve the efficient and real-time angular rate signal for the frequency resonant gyroscope.
