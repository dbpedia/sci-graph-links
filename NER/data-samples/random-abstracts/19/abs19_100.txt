Abstract The plasmonic integrated circuit, a potential application of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), can manipulate an SPP wave propagating on a metal surface in a way similar to electronic circuits. Here, we propose the concept of three-dimensional (3D) SPP wave manipulation: control of an SPP wave propagating in both the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. A hole set in the film can guide an SPP wave in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction, two holographic groove patterns are used to focus an incident SPP wave on one surface of the film to the hole and control the divergent SPP waves transmitted from the hole on the other metal surface, respectively. The holographic groove patterns are designed via the methodology of surface electromagnetic wave holography. 3D finite-difference time-domain method simulations show a good performance of the 3D manipulation via these designed holographic groove patterns.
