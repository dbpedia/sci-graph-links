Abstract We make a scalar representation of interactive models with cold dark matter and modified holographic Ricci dark energy through unified models driven by scalar fields with non-canonical kinetic term. These models are applications of the formalism of exotic k-essences generated by the global description of cosmological models with two interactive fluids in the dark sector and in these cases they correspond to the usual k-essences. The formalism is applied to the cases of constant potential in Friedmann–Robertson–Walker geometries.
