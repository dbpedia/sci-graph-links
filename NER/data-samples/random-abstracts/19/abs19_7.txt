Abstract Squeezed air film between two closely spaced vibrating microstructures is the important source of energy dissipation and has profound effects on the dynamics of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Perforations in the design are one of the methods to model these damping effects. The literature reveals that the analytical modeling of squeeze film damping of perforated circular microplates is less explored; however, these microplates are also an imperative part of the numerous MEMS devices. Here, we derive an analytical model of transverse and rocking motions of a perforated circular microplate. A modified Reynolds equation that incorporates compressibility and rarefaction effects is utilized in the analysis. Pressure distribution under the vibrating microplate is derived by using Greenâ€™s function and also derived by finite element method (FEM) to visualize the pressure distribution under perforated and non-perforated areas of the microplate. The analytical damping results are validated with previous renowned analytical models and also with the FEM results. The outcomes confirm the potential of the present analytical model to accurately predict the squeeze film damping parameters.
