Abstract A reduced order analytical model for peeling of elastic thin films and interface fracture is presented by treating the thin film as a finite length beam with interface interactions accounted for by cohesive zone modeling. The results obtained are shown to be in excellent agreement with finite element simulations and experimental data. Scaling analysis and equations for steady state load and crack length are derived that clearly summarize their parametric dependence.
