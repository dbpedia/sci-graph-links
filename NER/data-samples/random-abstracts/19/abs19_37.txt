Abstract Present study exhibits an experimental examination of mass transfer coefficient and evaporative effectiveness of a falling film evaporator. Further, a statistical replica is extended in order to have optimal controlling parameters viz. non-dimensional enthalpy potential, film Reynolds number of cooling water, Reynolds number of air and relative humidity of up-streaming air. The models not only give an optimal solution but also help in establishing a correlation among controlling parameters. In this context, response surface methodology is employed by aid of design of experiment approach. Later, the response surface curves are studied using ANOVA. Finally, the relations established are confirmed experimentally to validate the models. The relations thus established are beneficent in furtherance of designing evaporators. Additionally, the present study is among the first attempts to reveal the effect of humidity on the performance of falling film evaporator.
