Abstract The effects of RKKY interaction on the critical temperature of a spin-3/2 Blume-Capel model of a film within ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. The film is formed by two magnetic blocs N 1 and N 2, separated by non-magnetic spacer layers (NM) It is found that the critical temperatures of both magnetic blocs increase when increasing their thickness, while they decrease when increasing the thickness of the non-magnetic spacer layer. Besides, the effect of the Fermi level and the crystal field on these critical temperatures is also investigated.
