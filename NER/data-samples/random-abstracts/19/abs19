As they rely upon a full separation of the moving surfaces by a thin (or very thin) fluid film, the knowledge of its thickness is of paramount importance, as for instance to developing lubricated mechanisms with long lasting and efficient designs. As a consequence, a large collection of formulae for point contacts have been proposed in the last 40 years. However, their accuracy and validity have rarely been investigated. The purpose of this paper is to offer an evaluation of the most widespread analytical formulae and to define whether they can be used as qualitative or quantitative predictions. The methodology is based on comparisons with a numerical model for two configurations, circular and elliptical, considering both central and minimum film thicknesses." .

The statistical distribution of different shot scales in a film may be an important identifier of an individual film, an individual author, and of various narrative and affective functions of a film. In order to understand at which level shot scale distribution (SSD) of a movie might become its fingerprint, it is necessary to produce automatic recognition of shot scale on a large movie corpus. In our work we propose an automatic framework for estimating the SSD of a movie by using inherent characteristics of shots containing information about camera distance, without the need to recover the 3D structure of the scene. In the experimental investigation, the comparison of obtained results with manual SSD annotations proves the validity of the framework. Experiments conducted on movies by Michelangelo Antonioni taken from different stylistic periods (1950–57, 1960–64, 1966–75, 1980–82) show a strong similarity in shot scale distributions within each period, thus opening interesting research lines regarding the possible aesthetic and cognitive sources of such a regularity." .

The current study was conducted to examine whether news media stories covering eating disorder disclosures of celebrities corresponded with increases in Internet searches for pro eating disorder material. Results indicated that search volumes for pro eating disorder terms spiked in the month immediately following such news coverage but only for particularly high-profile celebrities. Hence, there may be utility in providing recovery-oriented resources within the search results for pro-eating disorder Internet searches and within news stories of this nature." .

For the polarization equation, a boundary problem is formulated, solutions are obtained, and system parameters for galvanostatic discharge are evaluated. It is shown that the parameters of the solutions meet the test conditions for experimental thin-film Si–O–Al samples and the condition of weak polarization." .

As such, his interest in medieval light theories spurred him to develop a powerful, idiosyncratic response to prevailing discourses of media and medium specificity during the 1960s. When examined in light of contemporaneous projects by Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922–1975) and Roland Barthes (1915–1980), Zorns Lemma points up the significance of medieval thought in the period’s conceptions of art and time." .

The limitation in employing music tags is the ambiguity of each tag. Thus, a single music tag covers too many sub-categories. To circumvent this, multiple tags can be used simultaneously to specify music clips more precisely. However, in conventional music recommendation systems, this might not be achieved because music clips identified by the system might not be prototypical to both or each tag. In this paper, we propose a new technique for ranking proper tag combinations based on the acoustic similarity of music clips. Based on empirical experiments, proper tag combinations are suggested by our proto-typicality analysis." .

In this study, we integrated music listening with a navigation service, allowing users to follow the perceived direction of the music to reach their destination. This navigation interface provided users with two different guidance methods: route guidance and beacon guidance. The user experience of the navigation service was evaluated with pedestrians in a city center and with cyclists in a suburban area. The results show that spatialized music can be used to guide pedestrians and cyclists toward a destination without any prior training, offering a pleasant navigation experience. Both route and beacon guidance were deemed good alternatives, but the preference between them varied from person to person and depended on the situation. Beacon guidance was generally considered to be suitable for familiar surroundings, while route guidance was seen as a better alternative for areas that are unfamiliar or more difficult to navigate." .

His assassination provoked an international outcry, which ended the 30-year presence of Syria and led to the withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon. This paper explores the different representations of Syria in news reports following the investigation into Hariri’s murder. The main aim is to examine the efficacy of Halliday’s systems of THEME and INFORMATION in detecting ideological representations in the news. By ideological representations, we refer to the socially-shared meanings, beliefs and opinions expressed by mainstream news media regarding the portrayal of Syria and its link to the attacks in Lebanon. This paper, which is an extract from my doctoral thesis, is the first attempt to adopt Halliday’s functional model of Theme-Rheme in Arabic and apply his understanding of the clause as a message to English and Arabic news reports. The analysis compares and contrasts the thematic and information structures in 14 reports (7 in English and 7 in Arabic), which were published between 25 and 27 September 2006 by mainstream online news media, including Al-Jazeera and the British Broadcasting Corporation. The news sources provide English and Arabic versions allowing for a comparable analysis of structure, content and style. The results of the analysis confirm that Halliday’s systems of THEME and INFORMATION are effective tools to unlock the meaning-potential in Arabic clauses and detect underlying ideologies in English and Arabic news reports." .

The effect of the squeeze film has been represented by the damping effect in previous studies. Our goal, however, is to quantify the stiffening effect, which affects the resonance frequency of the squeeze film and the oscillator system. The finite difference method for rectangular geometries is applied to solve the nonlinear isothermal Reynold’s equation for the squeeze film. The approach is validated by theoretical results for small squeeze numbers. The stiffening effect actually appears as a negative added mass. The damping effect obtained from numerical solutions matches perfectly with the equivalent damping formula derived from the analytical formula. The dynamic response of sinusoidally forced oscillator involving one squeeze film is obtained numerically in order to demonstrate the stiffening effect of the squeeze film. Three main parameters are considered: the initial gap of the squeeze film, the excitation amplitude, and the excitation frequency. The relationship between the amplitude of the steady-state sinusoidal response and the excitation frequency is determined. Numerical results demonstrate that the squeeze film gives rise to both a shift in the resonance frequency at small amplitude oscillations and amplitude dependence of the resonance frequency known as nonlinear hardening. These effects are both observed in experiments." .

With the increase in ME concentration, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the PSG film increased, whereas the oxygen permeability and water vapor permeability decreased. In addition, the PSG film with ME exhibited antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and antioxidant activity. To apply the ME-containing PSG film to food packaging, Gouda cheese was wrapped with the ME-containing PSG film. During storage, the cheese packaging with the ME-containing PSG film effectively inhibited the microbial growth and retarded the lipid oxidation of cheese compared with the control sample. Thus, the ME-containing PSG film can be used as an antimicrobial and antioxidative packaging material to improve the quality of food products." .

Understanding the dynamics of trapped charge is thus essential for future nanotechnologies, but their direct detection and manipulation is rather challenging2,4,5. Here, a transistor-based set-up is used to create and probe individual electronic defect states that can be coherently driven with microwave (MW) pulses. Strikingly, we resolve a large number of very high quality (Q ∼ 1 × 105) resonances in the transistor current as a function of MW frequency and demonstrate both long decoherence times (∼1 μs—40 μs) and coherent control of the defect-induced dynamics. Efficiently characterizing over 800 individually addressable resonances across two separate defect-hosting materials, we propose that their properties are consistent with weakly driven two-level systems." .

No study till date has explored the associations described above in a large population-based and genetically informative sample. Here, we examined such potential associations between sexual orientation and creative achievement in several different domains (music, writing, dance, visual arts, science, invention, and theater) using a large cohort of 4494 Swedish twins (of which 7.5 % were not exclusively heterosexual). Data were analyzed for the sexes separately as well as pooled. Results showed significant associations between sexual orientation and two of the creative domains—theater and writing—with non-heterosexuals being more creative in these domains. In all other domains, no significant differences were found between the non-heterosexual and heterosexual groups. Findings from co-twin control analyses suggested that the significant associations may not be causal in nature (i.e., homosexual orientation leads to higher creativity) but due to shared liability. However, we lacked power to differentiate between shared genetic and shared environmental influences. Results and potential implications are discussed critically." .

It was considered as a case study in the theatre “Vincenzo Bellini” in Catania (Italy), a horseshoe-shaped opera house where both opera and symphonic concerts can take place. This configuration, at the time, was considered to be the best solution for both a good sound quality as well as a good view of the stage for the spectators sitting in the boxes. The geometry of the theatre determines some gaps due to a concentration of the early sound reflections on the back of the room, involving the last rows of seats, thus causing a non-uniform spread of sound in the theatre. This concentration of reflections does not create optimal conditions for good acoustics due to excessive reverberation and negative influence on the listening to music performances." .

Two statical equivalences are used to reduce the dimension of finite games. Under the vector space structure the subspaces of exact and weighted potential games are investigated. Formulas are provided to calculate them. Then the finite evolutionary games (EGs) are considered. Strategy profile dynamics is obtained using different strategy updating rules (SURs). Certain SURs, which assure the convergence of trajectories to pure Nash equilibriums, are investigated. Using the vector space structure, the projection of finite games to the subspace of exact (or weighted) potential games is considered, and a simple formula is given to calculate the projection. The convergence of near potential games to an e-equilibrium is studied. Further more, the Lyapunov function of EGs is defined and its application to the convergence of EGs is presented. Finally, the near potential function for an EG is defined, and it is proved that if the near potential function of an EG is a Lyapunov function, the EG will converge to a pure Nash equilibrium.

We aimed to examine differences in MD assessed on these image types. MethodsWe obtained 1294 pairs of images saved in both raw and processed formats from Hologic and General Electric (GE) direct digital systems and a Fuji computed radiography (CR) system, and 128 screen-film and processed CR-digital pairs from consecutive screening rounds. Four readers performed Cumulus-based MD measurements (n = 3441), with each image pair read by the same reader. Multi-level models of square-root percent MD were fitted, with a random intercept for woman, to estimate processed–raw MD differences. ResultsBreast area did not differ in processed images compared with that in raw images, but the percent MD was higher, due to a larger dense area (median 28.5 and 25.4 cm2 respectively, mean √dense area difference 0.44 cm (95% CI: 0.36, 0.52)). This difference in √dense area was significant for direct digital systems (Hologic 0.50 cm (95% CI: 0.39, 0.61), GE 0.56 cm (95% CI: 0.42, 0.69)) but not for Fuji CR (0.06 cm (95% CI: −0.10, 0.23)). Additionally, within each system, reader-specific differences varied in magnitude and direction (p < 0.001). Conversion equations revealed differences converged to zero with increasing dense area. MD differences between screen-film and processed digital on the subsequent screening round were consistent with expected time-related MD declines. ConclusionsMD was slightly higher when measured on processed than on raw direct digital mammograms. Comparisons of MD on these image formats should ideally control for this non-constant and reader-specific difference." .

Under anisotropic biaxial prestrains, this structure may buckle into several patterns, including cylindrical, checkerboard, and undulating patterns. The displacement and energy of each pattern are deduced analytically. By comparing their minimum potential energies, the critical buckling condition of each pattern is determined. After secondary bifurcation, the checkerboard pattern occurs just above the critical prestrains, but the undulating pattern dominates other regions. The buckling amplitude and wavenumber of the undulating pattern are shown under biaxial prestrains. Even if the structure is under equi-biaxial prestrains, it may buckle into an asymmetric undulating pattern." .

Using the works of Marian Chace, early conference proceedings, and some brief history about the development of psychotherapy and evidence-based practice as illustrations, this essay presents the historical affiliation between dance/movement therapy and research. The prescience of basic assumptions about dance/movement therapy conceptualized in the early days of the profession, which are now supported by newly emerging neurological and neuropsychological research, is discussed. Among the promising features of the profession noted, are the impressive growth of dance/movement therapy globally, and the fact that the embodied approach embedded in the work has kept the profession close to important body-mind parameters over time. These are argued to ensure its continued growth over the next 50 years. Finally, readers are reminded that engaging with research creates the foundation of improving practice to ultimately benefit clients." .

In order to determine whether these emissions vary predictably in response to audiovisual stimuli, we have continuously monitored carbon dioxide and over one hundred volatile organic compounds in a cinema. It was found that many airborne chemicals in cinema air varied distinctively and reproducibly with time for a particular film, even in different screenings to different audiences. Application of scene labels and advanced data mining methods revealed that specific film events, namely “suspense” or “comedy” caused audiences to change their emission of specific chemicals. These event-type synchronous, broadcasted human chemosignals open the possibility for objective and non-invasive assessment of a human group response to stimuli by continuous measurement of chemicals in air. Such methods can be applied to research fields such as psychology and biology, and be valuable to industries such as film making and advertising." .

Prior to the breakthrough of television in Europe, which would usurp and standardize the art documentary, cinematic reproductions of artworks resulted in experimental shorts that were highly self-reflexive. These films became visual laboratories to investigate the tensions between movement and stasis, the two- and three-dimensional, and the real and the artificial—a film on art was self-consciously presented as an art film. Focusing on La Leggenda di Sant’Orsola (1948) by Luciano Emmer and Le Monde de Paul Delvaux (1946) by Henri Storck, this article also investigates how the animation of the static image by the film medium relates to Surrealist practices." .

The air around the film is proven to play a crucial role, since it changes the dispersion relation of transverse oscillations and transmits viscous stresses to the film, modifying its bending motion.

Cales dissonante Viola-Performance und M. Tuckers ebenso dilettantisches wie geniales Schlagzeug), die in ihrer Kombination eine jener provokanten Grenzüberschreitungen ergeben, welche die Grammatik und Semantik der populären Musik nachhaltig verändert haben.

However, in reality the sounds surrounding us are spectrally and temporally complex, dynamic and overlapping. Thus, research using natural sounds is crucial in understanding the operation of the brain in its natural environment. Music is an excellent example of natural stimulation which, in addition to sensory responses, elicits vast cognitive and emotional processes in the brain. Here we show that the preattentive P50 response evoked by rapid increases in timbral brightness during continuous music is enhanced in dancers when compared to musicians and laymen. In dance, fast changes in brightness are often emphasized with a significant change in movement. In addition, the auditory N100 and P200 responses are suppressed and sped up in dancers, musicians and laymen when music is accompanied with a dance choreography. These results were obtained with a novel event-related potential (ERP) method for natural music. They suggest that we can begin studying the brain with long pieces of natural music using the ERP method of electroencephalography (EEG) as has already been done with functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), these two brain imaging methods complementing each other." .

The liquid sheet produced at a high impact velocity was mainly concerned. Also more features and insights of the sheet were numerically studied using the coupled level set and volume of fluid method, considering effects of four non-dimensional parameters: Reynolds number, Weber number, dimensionless film thickness and drop–film curvature ratio. Results reveal that splashing can be suppressed by decreasing Reynolds number and Weber number. An increase in both the dimensionless film thickness and the film–drop curvature ratio is adverse to splashing onset. In addition, these four parameters can also greatly affect the geometrical shape and diameter of the sheet. In the second part, the air gap generated in the sheet–film contact neck region was investigated. It was noted that gas and liquid vortices produced near the liquid film surface render the film liquid to sink to form the air gap. Meanwhile, liquid accumulates inside the liquid sheet base gradually. Analysis in the velocity field suggests that the very thin preexisting film should be responsible for the vortex generation and the curvature ratio has minor effects on it, which is confirmed quantitatively as well." .

A hole set in the film can guide an SPP wave in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction, two holographic groove patterns are used to focus an incident SPP wave on one surface of the film to the hole and control the divergent SPP waves transmitted from the hole on the other metal surface, respectively. The holographic groove patterns are designed via the methodology of surface electromagnetic wave holography. 3D finite-difference time-domain method simulations show a good performance of the 3D manipulation via these designed holographic groove patterns." .

Although existing methods of similar retrieval or sequence prediction have attained success to some extend, one important factor has not been considered in the previous work, that is, users may change their music interest in different sessions. How to define the users’ current interest is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a topic-based probabilistic model for addressing this problem by developing session-aware latent topics to model the users’ listening behavior. The model is designed based on the insight that users’ listening behavior is subjected to not only their personal interest, but also to their special interest in the session. Specifically, when making recommendation, our model estimates the probability of the song selection based on the mixture of the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. We have conducted experiments on a real music dataset from Last.fm. The empirical results demonstrate that our model performs much better than other state-of-the-art methods." .

In the few years that the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) has utilized social media for public relations and advocacy purposes, both ADTA membership and the general public’s awareness of DMT have already increased markedly. Inherent within the social networking paradigm is the essential role of relationship and reciprocity. These tenets encourage a cross-promotion, not only of dance/movement therapists by dance/movement therapists but of all creative arts therapists by all creative arts therapists. Fully maximizing the growth potential for the field of DMT demands a shift from a twentieth century mindset of isolationism to the social media inspired, twenty first century paradigm of collaboration and mutual support among all creative arts therapists. Fully committing to this paradigm will produce greater awareness of DMT in the general public, a deeper understanding of DMT by allied professionals, an increased consumer demand for our services, a more diverse pool of dance/movement therapists, and a visibility worthy of a profession beginning its second half century." .

As the main contribution of the work we introduce two types of metrics: intensity, relating to how intensively co-present and remote aspects of a performance are rated, and cohesion, relating to how a performance as a whole, the combination of co-present and remote aspects, affects an audience. In particular, we model audience response based on two in the wild evaluations, staged by a low budget theatre company, a streamed and a distributed performance. The streamed performance is similar to NT Live, where a theatre play is delivered to other theatres with an audience. The distributed performance, on the other hand, connects actors in two different theatres (with audiences) creating one single play. The streamed performance was experienced as less intense as well as less cohesive by the remote audience, whilst the distributed performance integrated co-present and remote aspects tightly. Remote aspects of the distributed performance were still experienced as less intense, but the performance as a whole was highly cohesive. Apart from the identification of these two new metrics (intensity and cohesion), based on our experiences we argue that an innovative way of bundling relevant emerging technologies is needed to give a voice to the, as yet silent, remote audience." .

Perforations in the design are one of the methods to model these damping effects. The literature reveals that the analytical modeling of squeeze film damping of perforated circular microplates is less explored; however, these microplates are also an imperative part of the numerous MEMS devices. Here, we derive an analytical model of transverse and rocking motions of a perforated circular microplate. A modified Reynolds equation that incorporates compressibility and rarefaction effects is utilized in the analysis. Pressure distribution under the vibrating microplate is derived by using Green’s function and also derived by finite element method (FEM) to visualize the pressure distribution under perforated and non-perforated areas of the microplate. The analytical damping results are validated with previous renowned analytical models and also with the FEM results. The outcomes confirm the potential of the present analytical model to accurately predict the squeeze film damping parameters." .

The research aims to address the fundamental question: what forms and patterns of representation of Australia are present in South Korean online news media? It is designed in large part to understand how Australia is present as a theme in Korean online news, and how this theme is contextualized by associated topics, such as trade, security, or tourism. The quantitative analysis is augmented using a qualitative method: a series of key informant interviews conducted with editors and journalists responsible for the production and prioritization of news. Further, it is interpreted by locating the research in the context of the Australia-South Korea relationship.

Musical expression is commonly associated with artistry and achievement in music, yet research on pedagogy for teaching musical expression to wind instrumentalists is limited. The purpose of this study is to use perspectives from professional wind instrumentalists and conductors to explore how musical expression on wind instruments is demonstrated and measured. The qualitative tradition of the Delphi method, with three rounds of data collection, provided the structure for answering the research questions. The importance of effectively communicating musical interpretation through performance was a recurring theme within the data collection as well as the literature review. Findings suggest that a performer’s abilities both to appropriately analyze the music and then to successfully communicate his or her interpretation of the music to a listener are critical for achieving artistry in musical expression. The study may provide valuable insight for a deeper understanding of pedagogical strategies needed for teaching musical expression to wind instrumentalists." .

ConclusionThere is a steadily rising concern in adults and children over the potential effects of intracranial deposition of gadolinium. CINEMA is therefore a viable alternative in dynamic neurovascular imaging." .

Human bodies become aggregates of replaceable and exploitable parts, and potential resources for craving others. Our intimate interior contains items that other subjects lack, so that these organs are transformed into (commodifiable) ‘objects of desire’. Clandestine organ markets and the popularity of organ-theft cinema are symptoms of this development. What does it mean for human subjectivity when organs become market commodities? This contemporary issue emerges against the backdrop of a long-standing metaphysical struggle between the traditional Christian view (concerning the inviolable body) and the bio-scientific view (concerning the body as a collection of replaceable parts). I will analyse the ontological repercussions of transplantation medicine from a Lacanian perspective, using organ-theft cinema as a stage on which conflicting and unsettling views of embodiment are enacted, probed and questioned. Three organ-theft movies (Jésus de Montréal, L’Intrus and Crank 2: high voltage) will be subjected to a Lacanian analysis. The intrusive, dehumanising dimension to organ procurement, which tends to be obfuscated (repressed) in standard bioethical discourse about voluntary donation and human dignity, resurges quite emphatically in organ-transplant cinema." .

Ever since, the artist has kept on revisiting the same material, each time with a different technological approach. Originally hailed as a prime example of structural filmmaking, Jacobs’ more recent variations on the theme of Tom Tom the Piper’s Son beg for a broader understanding of his methods and the meanings implied. To gain a deeper insight in this on-going mise-en-abyme (and an obsession dominating a large part of his career), this essay expands comments by the artist himself with concepts taken from animation, media-archaeology and Warburg’s Mnemosyne atlas. Rereading a filmic text with minute attention, remediating it from an analogue to an electronic format, and reanimating the original action by adding a variety of intervals: all Jacobs’ strategies are aimed at demonstrating the afterlife of Tom Tom in a contemporary cultural context." .

The dynamics presented here describe the forcing of a monopole vortex during its generation at the center of the film. This response is quantified by the dimensionless Reynolds and Chandrasekhar numbers. When Chandrasekhar number reaches values near 800, Reynolds number reaches a damping rate. An analysis of the kinetic energy throughout the film shows that its response can be explained by Gibbs and Marangoni elasticity. Upon small forcing, the film shows an fast response after which it maintains its initial speed at all times (Marangoni). For a large forcing however, the speed of the film increases continuously throughout the experiment (Gibbs). Graphical Abstract" .

These newspapers are published under Dogan Media Group (DMG) conglomerate. The main aim of this study is to examine peace journalism principles in practice in the context of three DMG newspapers. The study examines the news coverage of the protests in order to formulate a peace journalism approach for journalists. Coverage on the protests, the framing analysis was used as a method. Gezi stories have been analyzed from the front pages of newspapers between 29 May and 30 June 2013. In Turkey, many newspapers have distorted the reality, emphasized marginality and did not pass the test of democratic examination while covering protests came to ignore the peaceful actions. However, peace journalism assumption should be used by journalists while covering the peaceful actions or protests. In democratic dispensation, representation of the electorate should continue both in public spheres and in media. The role of the media is becoming more and more important. The media should not only focus on the violence, but should give voice to nonviolence and peace protests as well. Results show that these three newspapers give more voice to former Prime Minister R.T. Erdogan than other official sources and tend to use the voices of elite authorities. This research found that, Posta quoted more elite sources in relation to the protests than Hurriyet and Radikal. At the end of this research DMG’s “Written Press Publication Principles” have been found to have little effect on coverage of newspapers." .

First we take a closer look at how journalists (re)framed six official press releases in 75 news reports. It turns out that journalists do not regularly adopt the success frame that the Public Prosecution uses in its press releases. Furthermore, the role of the Public Prosecution Service or the police is downplayed. The moral message that “crime should not pay” receives no coverage in news reports. Second, we analyze how the news reports generated 276 online comments. We distinguish three ways in which online commenters respond to news reports; they (1) appreciate, (2) downplay or (3) condemn the authorities’ success. Commenters are particularly likely to downplay or condemn the police’s success. When a news report focuses on ‘underground bankers’, commenters often express a negative opinion about the effort to curb money laundering. It also appears that readers did not always understand the use of a term like underground banking." .

An initial mutual approach between interacting surfaces, which deviates from the steady-state balanced position, is assumed under the free contact-vibration to predict the response of the mutual approach. An inertia term, which represents the acceleration of the gap motion, is added to the classical force balance equation to form the equation of motion of the mutual approach. Response of the mutual approach is solved based upon the solving of the contact-dynamic model. The oil stiffness is calculated according to the natural frequency of the response under damped and non-damped conditions, the latter of which represents dry contact conditions. The oil film damping is calculated in terms of the principle of the energy conservation which utilizes the whole history of response compared with the log decrement method. Effect of the normal load, the rolling speed and the amplitude of the regular sinusoidal surface waviness on the oil film stiffness, the contact stiffness and the oil film damping are studied. The study provides an insight on the oil film dynamic characteristics of lubricated contact-vibration problems which appear in gears, bearings, etc. The results show that the oil film damping factor decreases with the increasing normal load as well as the increasing rolling speed. The oil film stiffness increases with the normal load and decreases with the rolling speed. Also, compared to the contact stiffness, the oil film stiffness makes less contribution to the total stiffness. The surface waviness amplitude has little effect on the oil film stiffness and the oil film damping." .

In all of these examples, the paper argues that creativity arises from a process of human-robot collaboration. Human influences on the machines involved exist at many levels, from initial creation and programming, via processes of reprogramming and setup of underlying data and parameters, to engagement throughout the process of creative production. The decision to value a machine as a creative other is supported most strongly when collaborating with the machine directly, while witnessing the creative team at work, as opposed simply to seeing the result, is more likely to bring an audience to a similar understanding. The creativity of the human-machine collaborations analyzed in this paper relies on close interaction, within which there is a continual recognition of the otherness of the machine and its nonhuman abilities. Such relations can be theorized by extending Emmanuel Levinas’ conception of the face-to-face encounter within which self and other are brought into proximity, but the alterity of the other is nonetheless retained. The paper’s analysis of creative interactions between humans and robots supports the idea that machines need not be regarded as challenging human artistic practice, but rather enable new ways for creativity to arise through human-machine collaborations within which human and nonhuman creative abilities are combined." .

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to construct cryptographically strong S-boxes using the bee waggle dance algorithm." .

Many analytical models for predicting SFD on the microplate vibrating in a tilting motion have been well established in the past. However, most of the previous works focused on the rectangular torsion microplates. There are few analytical models for the SFD on the circular microplate vibrating in the tilting motion. Only one model was developed by Xia et al. (Microfluid Nanofluid 19:585–593, 2015). However, the gas in the air gap was treated as an incompressible gas in their model, and the perforation effect was not considered. This paper first studies the SFD on a non-perforated circular microplate vibrating in the tilting motion. The effects of both gas compressibility and rarefaction are considered in a modified Reynolds equation. The air pressure under the circular microplate is approximated by using Bessel series. A more accurate analytical expression for the damping and spring constants has been developed. Then, the model for the non-perforated microplates is extended to include the perforation effect. The present models are validated by comparison of the numerical results obtained by finite element method over a wide range of frequency and perforation ratios." .

In the experiment, the enlarged holographic image, which is twice as large as the original display device, projected on the screen of the digitally designed holographic optical element was concentrated at the target observation area so as to increase the visual angle, which is six times as large as that for a general holographic display.

Subsequent illumination of the film with 532-nm light into the trans-isomer band leads to trans-cis isomerization in the indoline azobenzene dye and results in a decrease in the trans-isomer band absorption coefficient. This causes the diffraction efficiency to decrease when probed at 655 nm. The diffraction efficiency returns to its original value when the 532-nm light is blocked by thermal relaxation from the indoline azobenzene cis-isomer to the trans-isomer. Thus, we have been able to optically modulate the diffraction efficiency in a thin film diffraction grating." .

The Carnatic music which is more popular in South India still continues to be uninfluenced by other music traditions and is one of the purest forms of Indian music. Like other music traditions, Carnatic music also has developed its musicography, out of which, a notation system called Sargam is most commonly practiced. This paper deals with development of a music representation or encoding system for the Sargam notation scheme which enables easy music notation storage, publishing, and retrieval using computers. This work follows a novel idea of developing a Unicode-based encoding logic and allows storage and easy retrieval of music notation files in a computer. As opposed to many existing music representation systems for western music notation, iSargam is the only music notation encoding system developed for Indian music notation." .

The effect of S amount in the precursor on the microstructure and element distribution of Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film was discussed. It was found that S content is sufficient in the precursor thin film using Cu2S instead of Cu target. The microstructure, composition homogeneity, and secondary phase formation of the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film are seriously affected by S amount in the precursor thin film. Namely, sufficient S can improve the crystallization and orientation of the precursor thin film and enhance the compactness as well as composition homogeneity of the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film after sulfurization. Moreover, the secondary phase formation in Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film can be greatly inhibited by increasing S content in the precursor thin film." .

We present a rhythmic analysis of a corpus of 15 performances of percussion music from Bamako, Mali. In our corpus, the relative frequency of note onsets in a given metrical position does not correspond to patterns of metrical accent, though there is a stable relationship between onset frequency and metrical position.

The features describe the direction of a brushstroke, which characterizes the artistic manner specific for specific details of a painting. A numerical experiment has shown that the value of the quantitative similarity index of paintings of the same artist (F.S. Rokotov) is higher than the value of the quantitative similarity index of the works of different artists. A portrait attributed to Rokotov is compared with his authentic works, as well as with portraits painted by different artists of the XVII−XIX centuries. The results of the computer analysis of the facture of paintings do not contradict the results of traditional technico-technological investigations." .

It is shown that the combination of thermocapillary and inertial effects in a wavy liquid film leads to deformation of large waves and their decay into narrower waves." .

Further, a statistical replica is extended in order to have optimal controlling parameters viz. non-dimensional enthalpy potential, film Reynolds number of cooling water, Reynolds number of air and relative humidity of up-streaming air. The models not only give an optimal solution but also help in establishing a correlation among controlling parameters. In this context, response surface methodology is employed by aid of design of experiment approach. Later, the response surface curves are studied using ANOVA. Finally, the relations established are confirmed experimentally to validate the models. The relations thus established are beneficent in furtherance of designing evaporators. Additionally, the present study is among the first attempts to reveal the effect of humidity on the performance of falling film evaporator." .
