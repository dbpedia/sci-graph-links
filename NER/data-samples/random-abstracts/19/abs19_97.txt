Abstract The relation between the effective ordinary refractive index n* = (n o n e )1/2 of a quasi-two-dimensional polydomain uniaxial film of a conjugated polymer F8BT in the visible transparency region and the refractive indices (n o,e ) of uniaxial domains with the optical axes randomly oriented in the plane of the film has been confirmed experimentally. The permissible interval of variations in n* has been established and a strong spectral dispersion of this interval near the long-wavelength electronic absorption band of the film has been demonstrated.
