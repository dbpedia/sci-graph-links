Abstract We demonstrate that in the case of small but not zero absorption coefficient, isotropic metafilm can be replaced by an equivalent very thin film with frequency-dependent thickness. An algorithm which allows one to calculate this thickness is proposed. Using it, effective material parameters of reciprocal thin film are obtained.
