Abstract One of a collection of six scholarly essays solicited by this journal to celebrate the first half-century of the American Dance Therapy Association, this paper describes the centrality of research to the profession since its inception. Using the works of Marian Chace, early conference proceedings, and some brief history about the development of psychotherapy and evidence-based practice as illustrations, this essay presents the historical affiliation between dance/movement therapy and research. The prescience of basic assumptions about dance/movement therapy conceptualized in the early days of the profession, which are now supported by newly emerging neurological and neuropsychological research, is discussed. Among the promising features of the profession noted, are the impressive growth of dance/movement therapy globally, and the fact that the embodied approach embedded in the work has kept the profession close to important body-mind parameters over time. These are argued to ensure its continued growth over the next 50Â years. Finally, readers are reminded that engaging with research creates the foundation of improving practice to ultimately benefit clients.
