Self-polarization directed from the top electrode to the bottom one is found in the ferroelectric Pt/PZT/Pt capacitor using the method of depolarizing hysteresis loops. We attribute the self-polarization to the flexoelectric effect caused by the mismatch between the lattice parameters of the bottom Pt film and PZT-film. This result is consistent with the measurements of photocurrent in the short-circuited structure that also indicate the presence of the downward polarization in the PZT-film.
