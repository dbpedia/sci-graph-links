A nonlinear mathematical model of the state of the free surface of a nonisothermal liquid film is presented. The basic wave characteristics and the liquid film free surface state have been calculated for moderate Reynolds numbers in the presence of Marangoni instability. A nonlinear parabolic equation for the amplitude of the envelope of wave train and the results of computational experiment on the nonlinear development of Marangoni instability in liquid films are presented.
