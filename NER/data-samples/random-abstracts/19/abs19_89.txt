Abstract A plane elastohydrodynamic problem for a radial sliding bearing with a thin liner under reciprocating motion under a constant load is considered. It has been shown that at the moment of time when the velocity becomes equal to zero the thickness of the lubricating film exceeds zero and that it continues to decrease during a period of time after changing the direction of rotation of the shaft. Film thickness and pressure distributions at various moments in time, as well as time dependences of the eccentricity and the minimum film thickness along the spatial coordinate, are presented for various values of the dimensionless parameter, which depends on the period of reciprocating motion. It has been shown that the smallest value of film thickness over the entire period of reciprocating motion increases with shortening period of reciprocating motion.
