Abstract The imagining of a remembrance, itself in the process of being forgotten, Kafka’s Josefine provides a fleeting glimpse into the artists who create her. Both simple and complex, an artist and no artist at all, she is also a distilled reflection of the text in which she is contained — a critical commentary/self-critical fiction, on the nature of art.
