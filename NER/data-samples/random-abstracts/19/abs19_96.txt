Abstract This paper is aimed to study the sound focusing effects in the theatre with horseshoe-shaped plan. It was considered as a case study in the theatre “Vincenzo Bellini” in Catania (Italy), a horseshoe-shaped opera house where both opera and symphonic concerts can take place. This configuration, at the time, was considered to be the best solution for both a good sound quality as well as a good view of the stage for the spectators sitting in the boxes. The geometry of the theatre determines some gaps due to a concentration of the early sound reflections on the back of the room, involving the last rows of seats, thus causing a non-uniform spread of sound in the theatre. This concentration of reflections does not create optimal conditions for good acoustics due to excessive reverberation and negative influence on the listening to music performances.
