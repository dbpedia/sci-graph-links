Abstract Data outsourcing service has gained remarkable popularity with considerable amount of enterprises and individuals, as it can relief heavy computation and management burden locally. While in most existing models, honest-but-curious cloud service provider (CSP) may return incorrect results and inevitably give rise to serious security breaches, thus the results verification mechanism should be raised to guarantee data accuracy. Furthermore, the construction of secure-channel incurs heavy cryptographic operations and single keyword search returns many irrelevant results. Along these directions, we further design a significantly more effective and secure cryptographic primitive called as verifiable conjunctive keywords search over encrypted data without secure-channel scheme to assure data integrity and availability. Formal security analysis proves that it can effectively stand against outside keyword-guessing attack. As a further contribution, our actual experiments show that it can admit wide applicability in practice.
