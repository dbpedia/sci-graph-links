Abstract For integers k ≥1 and n≥2k+1 the Kneser graph K(n;k) has as vertices all k-element subsets of [n]:={1;2;:::;n} and an edge between any two vertices (=sets) that are disjoint. The bipartite Kneser graph H(n,k) has as vertices all k-element and (n—k)-element subsets of [n] and an edge between any two vertices where one is a subset of the other. It has long been conjectured that all Kneser graphs and bipartite Kneser graphs except the Petersen graph K(5, 2) have a Hamilton cycle. The main contribution of this paper is proving this conjecture for bipartite Kneser graphs H(n,k). We also establish the existence of cycles that visit almost all vertices in Kneser graphs K(n,k) when n=2k+o(k), generalizing and improving upon previous results on this problem.
