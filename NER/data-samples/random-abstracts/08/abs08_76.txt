Abstract In order to improve the efficiency and quality of estimation of the technical condition and residual service life of technical devices, a special approach has been devised, based on informational support and the automation of preparation for this process and its execution. The methods, models, and means developed represent the methodology of inspection of technical devices with regard to industrial safety. Information technology has been developed, along with the Intelligent Software System that implements it, to automate the collection, storage, and processing of the information necessary to support decision-making in the estimation of technical conditions and residual service life, which constitutes the basis of industrial safety inspection.
