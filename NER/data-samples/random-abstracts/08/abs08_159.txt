Abstract The characteristics of MANET such as decentralization, dynamic topology and openness are susceptible for security threats. To overcome the security threats and to provide a reliable network to transmit packets, a need for trust based routing arises. Moreover, the trust along with energy requirement on ad hoc on demand distance vector have paved way for the development of the newly proposed algorithm named as refined trust and energy based ad hoc on demand distance vector algorithm which is the refined form of the existing trust and energy based ad hoc on demand distance vector algorithms and the classical AODV. In this paper, the refinement parameter is the trust. Moreover, Bayesian probability is introduced in this paper for trust management due to its ability to handle uncertainty for obtaining the refined form of Trust calculation. The proposed algorithm routes the packets from the source to destination not through the shortest route but by selecting a reliable route which consumes low energy and trustful for sending the packets. The simulation results obtained from this work show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing algorithms in terms of Trust based routing and energy efficiency.
