Abstract The finite-time stability problem of discrete switched singular positive systems (DSSPSs) is investigated in this paper. First, the concept of finite-time stability for DSSPSs is proposed, and a necessary and sufficient condition of finite-time stability for DSSPSs under arbitrary switching is obtained. Second, based on the mode-dependent average dwell time approach, by constructing the quasi-linear Lyapunov function, a sufficient stability criterion of finite-time stability for DSSPSs is derived in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
