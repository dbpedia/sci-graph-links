We focus on a cloud computing environment by using open source softwares such as OpenStack and Eucalyptus because of the unification management of data and low cost. A cloud computing is attracting attention as a network service to share the computing resources, that is, networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. We propose jump diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations in order to consider the interesting aspect of the provisioning process. Especially, the reliability and maintainability analysis tool for cloud computing is developed in this paper. Also, we analyze actual data to show numerical illustrations of application of the software analysis tool considering the characteristics of cloud computing.
