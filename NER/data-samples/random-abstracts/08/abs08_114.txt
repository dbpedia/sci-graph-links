Abstract The evolution of modern web application involves a broad range of web technologies such as ActiveX, JavaScript and CGI. It mitigates the demand of bolt-on security services, but remains suffered from code vulnerabilities. Two common issues of web application code vulnerability are the wrong style of writing code and improper server configuration. Enhancing the web applicationâ€™s functionalities and ease of use are the primary concern of developers. Security is their second concern, resulting in code vulnerabilities. The application developers may effectively deal with code vulnerabilities through adhering to Secure Coding Standards. But manually applying all the Secure Coding Standard is susceptible to human errors. Hence, a graph-based interactive system is developed in the context of Secure Coding Standards to handle code vulnerabilities. Evaluation of the developed system is carried out by using standard available datasets such as CVE, NVD, Syhunt Vulnerable PHP Code and OWASP.
