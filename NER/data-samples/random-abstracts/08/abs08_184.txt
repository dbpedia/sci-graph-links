Abstract Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms are considered as the most effective techniques for solving various optimization problems. This paper provides a briefly review of the key features of the cuckoo-inspired metaheuristics: cuckoo search (CS) and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA). In addition, it discusses some of their important and emerging studies, investigates their applications in several fields, and finally clarifies the differences between both algorithms so as to remove confusion between them.
