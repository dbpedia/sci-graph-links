Abstract Braess’s paradox states that removing a part of a network may improve the players’ latency at equilibrium. In this work, we study the approximability of the best subnetwork problem for the class of random $${\mathcal {G}}_{n,p}$$ Gn,p instances proven prone to Braess’s paradox by Valiant and Roughgarden RSA ’10 (Random Struct Algorithms 37(4):495–515, 2010), Chung and Young WINE ’10 (LNCS 6484:194–208, 2010) and Chung et al. RSA ’12 (Random Struct Algorithms 41(4):451–468, 2012). Our main contribution is a polynomial-time approximation-preserving reduction of the best subnetwork problem for such instances to the corresponding problem in a simplified network where all neighbors of source s and destination t are directly connected by 0 latency edges. Building on this, we consider two cases, either when the total rate r is sufficiently low, or, when r is sufficiently high. In the first case of low $$r= O(n_{+})$$ r=O(n+) , here $$n_{+}$$ n+ is the maximum degree of $$\{s, t\}$$ {s,t} , we obtain an approximation scheme that for any constant $$\varepsilon > 0$$ ε>0 and with high probability, computes a subnetwork and an $$\varepsilon $$ ε -Nash flow with maximum latency at most $$(1+\varepsilon )L^*+ \varepsilon $$ (1+ε)L∗+ε , where $$L^*$$ L∗ is the equilibrium latency of the best subnetwork. Our approximation scheme runs in polynomial time if the random network has average degree $$O(\mathrm {poly}(\ln n))$$ O(poly(lnn)) and the traffic rate is $$O(\mathrm {poly}(\ln \ln n))$$ O(poly(lnlnn)) , and in quasipolynomial time for average degrees up to o(n) and traffic rates of $$O(\mathrm {poly}(\ln n))$$ O(poly(lnn)) . Finally, in the second case of high $$r= {\varOmega }(n_{+})$$ r=Ω(n+) , we compute in strongly polynomial time a subnetwork and an $$\varepsilon $$ ε -Nash flow with maximum latency at most $$(1+2\varepsilon + o(1))L^*$$ (1+2ε+o(1))L∗ .
