Abstract With the development of user-centered and environment sensing technology of 5G, large capacity and ubiquitous coverage and massive data collection and processing will bring new challenges in wireless networks. The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has been envisioned to provide a new wireless architecture for reliable transmission of mobile big data. In this paper, we focus on network planning deployment issue based on the optical mixed diet (OMD) technology. Specifically, the ring and spur topology optimization (RSTO) problem under the C-RAN architecture is investigated. The RSTO problem is formulated as a generic integer linear program (ILP) which can optimally (i) minimize the network deploying cost; (ii) identify the locations of Remote Radio Units (RRUs) and optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs); (iii) identify the association relations between RRUs and OADMs; and (iv) satisfy the mobile coverage requirements so as to allow the mobile big data to be transmitted through the RRUs. We propose a new heuristic algorithm based on C-RAN architecture. Numerical results validate the ILP formulation and show the performance benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of efficiency and effectiveness against Gurobi, which is an ILP solver. In numerical studies, we also demonstrate the performance benefits of the incorporation of CoMP technology in terms of total deployment cost reduction.
