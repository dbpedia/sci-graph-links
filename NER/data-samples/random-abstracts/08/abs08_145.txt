Abstract The authors propose a new method to solve classification problem based on separation of two sets in space R d . The necessary and sufficient conditions of ε-separability are proved. The algorithm of constructing two separable ε-nets of size [2d / ε] is proposed. The paper contains an example of applying this algorithm to two sets generated from normally distributed sets. The classification results for the proposed method and for support vector machines are compared.
