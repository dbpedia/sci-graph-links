Abstract In the past 10 years, the independent and innovative communications-based train control system has experienced breakthroughs in key technologies by conducting pilot experiments, field tests, and demonstration projects. For the first time, the design theories and technical aspects of moving block systems, which cover the entire life cycle of fail-safe systems, are set up. The models and algorithms are proposed to control the safe operation of trains. The safety technologies for short-interval train sequencing are adopted to realize the 90 s headway between consecutive trains. The optimized automatic train operation strategies are used to save energy and allow trains to safely reach their destinations. The highly dependable and bi-directional train-to-ground communication technologies are introduced for reliable transmission of safety related train-to-ground information in a complex environment which is compatible with multiple media, such as free waves, leaky waveguides, and leaky feeders. The simulation, tests, and verification technologies based on the minimum system and test cases were adopted to conduct the following: principle demonstration, functional tests, integrated tests, field failure data replay, analysis and disposal, system upgrade, and maintenance.
