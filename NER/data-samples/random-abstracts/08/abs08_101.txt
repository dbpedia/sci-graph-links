Abstract The total chromatic sum of a graph is the minimum sum of colors (natural numbers) taken over all proper colorings of vertices and edges of a graph. We construct infinite families of graphs for which the minimum number of colors to achieve the total chromatic sum is larger than the total chromatic number.
