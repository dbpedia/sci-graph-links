Abstract Component-based software development can help reduce time and cost by means of reusing software components, but the quality of the software may not be ensured if the adopted components contain errors. The Structured Object-oriented Formal Language (SOFL) is a formal specification language that can be used for quality software development. This paper describes a development of desktop application software by connecting with several software components, and how it is developed using SOFL. We introduce how the requirements are analyzed through writing an informal specification and then refining it into a semi-formal specification. We also discuss how the design is carried out by constructing a formal specification in SOFL. Finally, we present the implementation and explain the details of a testing conducted for the quality assurance of the system.
