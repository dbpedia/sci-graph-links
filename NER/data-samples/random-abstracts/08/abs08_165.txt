Abstract The proliferation of GPS-enabled smart mobile devices enables us to collect a large-scale trajectories of moving objects with GPS tags. While the raw trajectories that only consists of positional information have been studied extensively, many recent works have been focusing on enriching the raw trajectories with semantic knowledge. The resulting data, called activity trajectories, embed the information about behaviors of the moving objects and support a variety of applications for better quality of services. In this paper, we propose a Top-k Spatial Keyword (TkSK) query for activity trajectories, with the objective to find a set of trajectories that are not only close geographically but also meet the requirements of the query semantically. Such kind of query can deliver more informative results than existing spatial keyword queries for static objects, since activity trajectories are able to reflect the popularity of user activities and reveal preferable combinations of facilities. However, it is a challenging task to answer this query efficiently due to the inherent difficulties in indexing trajectories as well as the new complexity introduced by the textual dimension. In this work, we provide a comprehensive solution, including the novel similarity function, hybrid indexing structure, efficient search algorithm and further optimizations. Extensive empirical studies on real trajectory set have demonstrated the scalability of our proposed solution.
