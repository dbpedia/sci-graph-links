Abstract This paper presents an overview of ethical issues in professional psychology. Specifically, it addresses the broad ethical ideas and views of psychological practices, in light of cultural competency. Its aim is to be the first Saudi document about ethics and professionalism, with a specific purpose as a guideline for trainees becoming culturally competent ethical psychologists. This paper describes the ethical code through three main categories: General Ethical Standards; Ethical Issues about Assessment and Treatments; and Cultural Competency and Professionalism Issues. Furthermore, it attempts to illustrate some of the cultural dilemmas connected with the application of international psychological ethical guidelines, particularly in Saudi Arabia. This project concludes it is essential for trainees, supervisors, and training program advisors to understand ethical and professional responsibilities, as they relate to culture competence and work, during traineesâ€™ internships.
