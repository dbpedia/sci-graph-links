Abstract Critics have noticed the Daoist gist of the 1872 Chinese version of “Rip Van Winkle” by Washington Irving. The present study discovers that Irving’s tale itself is wealthy with deist and Daoist messages. From three aspects, including Irving’s access to deism and Daoism, deist and Daoist ideas exemplified through a contrast between nature and humans, and deist and Daoist ways of thinking embodied in the hero, this paper demonstrates how the philosophical ideas are redefined through the text and the hero to function as ways of examining the new nation and articulating the self.
