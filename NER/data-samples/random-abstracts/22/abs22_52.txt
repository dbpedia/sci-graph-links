Abstract Connection with nature impacts human wellness, yet few resources currently exist in the international literature to help guide clinicians in the ethical integration of EcoWellness into therapeutic processes. Ethical principles for EcoWellness practice are introduced and linked to applicable portions of the American Counseling Associationâ€™s (2014) Code of Ethics. The author presents a case example to demonstrate the application of these principles in a clinical setting and implications for counselor education and research are discussed.
