Abstract Ein meister las has been regarded an »eigentümliches Gemisch« by scholars who have questioned its authenticity. Those critics who have (in the opinion of the present author, rightly) rehabilitated the poem as part of Walther’s »authentic« corpus have generally overlooked the nonetheless perceptive observations that underlie this critical discomfiture. The present essay reads the poem as the locus of a uniquely Waltherian dialogue between the genres of Spruchdichtung, Minnesang, and the devotional lyric in order to account for the critics’ unanimous perception of it as a »problematic« poem.
