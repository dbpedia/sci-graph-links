Abstract In this paper, we exploit epistemic logic (or the modal logic of knowledge) for multiagent systems to discuss the compositionality of several privacy-related information-hiding/disclosure properties. The properties considered here are anonymity, privacy, onymity, and identity. Our initial observation reveals that anonymity/privacy properties are not necessarily sequentially compositional. This means that even though a system comprising several sequential phases satisfies a certain unlinkability property in each phase, the entire system does not always enjoy a desired unlinkability property. We show that the compositionality can be guaranteed provided that the phases of the system satisfy what we call independence assumptions. More specifically, we develop a series of theoretical case studies of what assumptions are sufficient to guarantee the sequential compositionality of various degrees of anonymity, privacy, onymity, and/or identity properties. Similar results for parallel composition are also discussed. Further, we use the probabilistic extension of epistemic logic to consider the compositionality of probabilistic anonymity/privacy. We show that the compositionality can also be guaranteed in the probabilistic setting, provided that the phases of the system satisfy a probabilistic independence assumption.
