Abstract Externalism holds that the content of our utterances and thoughts are determined partly by the environment. Here, I offer an argument which suggests that externalism is incompatible with a natural view about ontological commitment–namely, the Quinean view that such commitments are fixed by the range of the variables in your theory. The idea briefly is that, if Oscar mistakenly believes that water = XYZ, the externalist ontologically commits Oscar to two watery kinds. In contrast, the Quinean commits him to one such kind (albeit a metaphysically impossible kind). The penultimate section addresses a variety of objections to the argument.
