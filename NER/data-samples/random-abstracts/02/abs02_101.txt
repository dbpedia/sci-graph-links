Abstract Phase equilibria, structure identification, and dissociation enthalpies of HFC-134a hydrates in the presence of NaCl are investigated for potential application in desalination. To verify the influence of NaCl on the thermodynamic hydrate stability of the HFC-134a hydrate, the three-phase (hydrate (H) - liquid water (L W ) - vapor (V)) equilibria of the HFC-134a+NaCl (0, 3.5, and 8.0 wt%)+water systems are measured by both a conventional isochoric (pVT) method and a stepwise differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) method. Both pVT and DSC methods demonstrate reliable and consistent hydrate phase equilibrium points of the HFC-134a hydrates in the presence of NaCl. The HFC-134a hydrate is identified as sII via powder X-ray diffraction. The dissociation enthalpies (Î”H d ) of the HFC-134a hydrates in the presence of NaCl are also measured with a high pressure micro-differential scanning calorimeter. The salinity results in significant thermodynamic inhibition of the HFC-134a hydrates, whereas it has little effect on the dissociation enthalpy of the HFC-134a hydrates. The experimental results obtained in this study can be utilized as foundational data for the hydrate-based desalination process.
