Its quasi-sealed-off operation appeared to be possible only by using active gas mixture composition with extremely high content of oxygen — up to 50 % with respect to CO concentration. Average output power of the first-overtone CO laser came up to ~2 W with the efficiency of ~2 %. The laser spectrum obtained by using three sets of output couplers consisted of more than 100 vibrational–rotational spectral lines in 28 vibrational first-overtone bands of CO molecule within 2.55÷3.90 μm wavelength range. The number of laser radiation pulses which could be produced by the laser in sealed-off mode of operation (without gas mixture renovation) reached ~5×105 at the averaged output power near its maximum, and ~106 at lower (near its half-maximum) averaged output power. Special features of laser radiation temporal behavior were discussed. Under repetitively pulse pump with repetition rate from 300 up to 7500 Hz, a temporal profile of the CO laser radiation changed from the train of time-separated laser pulses with high peak power to quasi-CW mode of operation." .

The proposed structure consists of a graphene layer composed of H shape between two cut wires, by breaking symmetry can control EIT-like effects and by increasing the asymmetry in the structure has strong coupling between elements. It is important that the peak frequency of transmission window can be dynamically controlled over a broad frequency range by varying the chemical potential of graphene layer. The results show that high refractive index sensitivity and figure of merit can be achieved in asymmetrical structures which is good for sensing applications. We calculated the group delay and the results show we can control the group velocity by varying the S parameter in asymmetrical structure.

Their cosmological nature makes them the best tool to explore the final stages in the lives of very massive stars up to the highest redshifts. Furthermore, studying the emission from their low-energy counterparts (optical and infrared) via rapid spectroscopy, we have been able to pin down the exact location of the most distant galaxies as well as placing stringent constraints on their host galaxies and intervening systems at low and high-redshift (e.g. metallicity and neutral hydrogen fraction). In fact, each GRB spectrum contains absorption features imprinted by metals in the host interstellar medium (ISM) as well as the intervening intergalactic medium (IGM) along the line of sight. In this chapter we summarize the progress made using a large dataset of GRB spectra in understanding the nature of both these absorbers and how GRBs can be used to study the early Universe, in particular to measure the neutral hydrogen fraction and the escape fraction of UV photons before and during the epoch of re-ionization." .

This hypothesis of “smaller-is-better” has motivated optical engineers to build various nanophotonic devices, although an understanding leading to fundamental scaling behavior for this new class of devices is missing. Here we analyze scaling laws for optoelectronic devices operating at micro and nanometer length-scale. We show that optoelectronic device performance scales non-monotonically with device length due to the various device tradeoffs, and analyze how both optical and electrical constrains influence device power consumption and operating speed. Specifically, we investigate the direct influence of scaling on the performance of four classes of photonic devices, namely laser sources, electro-optic modulators, photodetectors, and all-optical switches based on three types of optical resonators; microring, Fabry-Perot cavity, and plasmonic metal nanoparticle. Results show that while microrings and Fabry-Perot cavities can outperform plasmonic cavities at larger length-scales, they stop working when the device length drops below 100 nanometers, due to insufficient functionality such as feedback (laser), index-modulation (modulator), absorption (detector) or field density (optical switch). Our results provide a detailed understanding of the limits of nanophotonics, towards establishing an opto-electronics roadmap, akin to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors." .

The original PAD has a rod-connected random network structure with a highly ordered local tetrahedral configuration, and it forms a sizable PBG. Our calculations indicated that the PBG of PAD is relatively robust against the introduction of positional disorder that distorts the local tetrahedral configuration, but considerably fragile against the fragmentation of the network structure. PBG formation in a higher frequency region was found in a PAD structure of isolated dielectric spheres. Based on these findings, the physical origin of PBG formation in PADs has been discussed in light of the picture of dielectric and air bands." .

Toward this, we study charge and spin transport in bilayer graphene-based spin valve devices fabricated in a new device architecture that allows us to make a comparative study by separately investigating the roles of the substrate and polymer residues on spin relaxation. First, the comparison between spin valves fabricated on SiO2 and BN substrates suggests that substrate-related charged impurities, phonons and roughness do not limit the spin transport in current devices. Next, the observation of a fivefold enhancement in the spin-relaxation time of the encapsulated device highlights the significance of polymer residues on spin relaxation. We observe a spin-relaxation length of ~10 μm in the encapsulated bilayer, with a charge mobility of 24 000 cm2 Vs−1. The carrier density dependence on the spin-relaxation time has two distinct regimes; n<4 × 1012 cm−2, where the spin-relaxation time decreases monotonically as the carrier concentration increases, and n ⩾ 4 × 1012 cm−2, where the spin-relaxation time exhibits a sudden increase. The sudden increase in the spin-relaxation time with no corresponding signature in the charge transport suggests the presence of a magnetic resonance close to the charge neutrality point. We also demonstrate, for the first time, spin transport across bipolar p–n junctions in our dual-gated device architecture that fully integrates a sequence of encapsulated regions in its design. At low temperatures, strong suppression of the spin signal was observed while a transport gap was induced, which is interpreted as a novel manifestation of the impedance mismatch within the spin channel." .

The conservation law is based on the time-stationary Boltzmann equation for binary electron-atom scattering. We model the energy loss of the electrons with a continuous slowing-down approximation. A first order moment approximation with respect to the angular variable is discussed. We propose to use a minimum entropy closure to derive a system of hyperbolic conservation laws, known as the M1 model [11]. A finite volume scheme for the numerical solution of the resulting equations is presented. Important numerical aspects of the scheme are discussed, such as bounds for the finite propagation speeds, as well as difficulties arising fromspatial discontinuities in thematerial coefficients and the scaling of the characteristic velocities with the stopping power of the electrons.We compare the accuracy and performance of the numerical solution of the hyperbolic conservation law to Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate a reasonable accuracy of the proposed method and showthat compared to the MonteCarlo simulation the finite volume scheme is computationally less expensive." .

The influence of flux angle on the surface morphology and the microstructure was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy. The optical constants were obtained from analysis of the experimental recorded transmission and reflectance spectral data over the wavelength range 300 nm to 1800 nm. The band gaps of the synthesized thin films were found to be direct allowed transitions and increased from 1.44 eV to 1.66 eV with increasing γ from 0° to 85°, respectively. The absorption coefficients of the films are in the range of 105 cm−1 to 106 cm−1. The refractive indexes were evaluated in the transparent region in terms of the envelope method suggested by the Swanepoel model. It has been found that the refractive index decreases from 2.66 to 2.06 with increasing deposition angle from 0° to 85°, respectively.

It is shown that the Doppler frequency shifts, due to atomic motion, can play an important role in adiabatic population transfer processes of atomic internal states by a pair of laser fields. For the limiting case of slow atoms (Doppler shift much smaller than the photon recoil energy), the atoms occupy the same target state regardless of the order of switching of laser fields, while for the case of fast atoms interacting with the intuitive sequence of pulses, the target state is the intermediate atomic state. Furthermore, it is shown that this novel technique for adiabatic population transfer is related to a level crossing in the bright–intermediate state basis (rather than in the original atomic basis). It is shown that these processes are robust with respect to parameter fluctuations, such as the laser pulse area and the relative spatial offset (delay) of the laser beams. The obtained results can be used for the control of temporal evolution of atomic populations in cold atomic beams by externally adjustable Doppler shifts." .

The Fe thickness dependence of magnetization shows a significant increase of Fe magnetic moment at small Fe thicknesses. Close to the interface, the Fe moment is found to be 2.9 μB, which is higher than the value reported in bulk Fe (2.2 μB). It is shown that the increase in Fe moment is mainly associated with the increase of the Fe–Fe distance close to the interface due to the lattice mismatch between Fe and Au.

Commercial applications for lithium niobate require high crystalline quality currently limited to bulk and ion sliced material. Thin film lithium niobate is an attractive option for a variety of integrated devices, but the research effort has been stagnant due to poor material quality. Both lattice matched and mismatched lithium niobate are grown by molecular beam epitaxy and studied to understand the role of substrate and temperature on nucleation conditions and material quality. Growth on sapphire produces partially coalesced columnar grains with atomically flat plateaus and no twin planes. A symmetric rocking curve shows a narrow linewidth with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8.6 arcsec (0.0024°), which is comparable to the 5.8 arcsec rocking curve FWHM of the substrate, while the film asymmetric rocking curve is 510 arcsec FWHM. These values indicate that the individual grains are relatively free of long-range disorder detectable by x-ray diffraction with minimal measurable tilt and twist and represents the highest structural quality epitaxial material grown on lattice mismatched sapphire without twin planes. Lithium niobate is also grown on lithium tantalate producing high quality coalesced material without twin planes and with a symmetric rocking curve of 193 arcsec, which is nearly equal to the substrate rocking curve of 194 arcsec. The surface morphology of lithium niobate on lithium tantalate is shown to be atomically flat by atomic force microscopy." .

Observables such as structure functions, transverse momentum distributions, and distribution amplitudes are defined from the hadronic light-front wavefunctions. One obtains new insights into the hadronic spectrum, light-front wavefunctions, and the functional form of the QCD running coupling in the nonperturbative domain using light-front holography—the duality between the front form and AdS5, the space of isometries of the conformal group. In addition, superconformal algebra leads to remarkable supersymmetric relations between mesons and baryons of the same parity. The mass scale $${\\kappa}$$ κ underlying confinement and hadron masses can be connected to the parameter $${\\Lambda_{\\overline {MS}}}$$ ΛMS¯ in the QCD running coupling by matching the nonperturbative dynamics, as described by the effective conformal theory mapped to the light-front and its embedding in AdS space, to the perturbative QCD regime. The result is an effective coupling defined at all momenta. This matching of the high and low momentum transfer regimes determines a scale Q 0 which sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative hadron dynamics. The use of Q 0 to resolve the factorization scale uncertainty for structure functions and distribution amplitudes, in combination with the principle of maximal conformality for setting the renormalization scales, can greatly improve the precision of perturbative QCD predictions for collider phenomenology. The absence of vacuum excitations of the causal, frame-independent front form vacuum has important consequences for the cosmological constant. I also discuss evidence that the antishadowing of nuclear structure functions is non-universal; i.e., flavor dependent, and why shadowing and antishadowing phenomena may be incompatible with the momentum and other sum rules for nuclear parton distribution functions." .

When the integrand has standard growth conditions, the qualitative theory is well-understood. When it comes to unbounded functionals, that is, when the domain of the integrand is not the whole space and may depend on the space-variable, there is no satisfactory theory. In this contribution we develop a complete qualitative stochastic homogenization theory for nonconvex unbounded functionals with convex growth. We first prove that if the integrand is convex and has p-growth from below (with p > d, the dimension), then it admits homogenization regardless of growth conditions from above. This result, that crucially relies on the existence and sublinearity at infinity of correctors, is also new in the periodic case. In the case of nonconvex integrands, we prove that a similar homogenization result holds provided that the nonconvex integrand admits a two-sided estimate by a convex integrand (the domain of which may depend on the space variable) that itself admits homogenization. This result is of interest to the rigorous derivation of rubber elasticity from polymer physics, which involves the stochastic homogenization of such unbounded functionals." .

The exchange functional combines one-fourth of exact exchange with three-fourths of the correct asymptotic potential (CAP) generalized gradient approximation functional. It is combined with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof correlation energy with a slightly modified parameterization so as to cancel the gradient terms of CAP exchange with that of correlation, in the limit of slowly varying density. The resulting global hybrid functional, called CAP0, gives heats of formation, ionization potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, binding energies of weakly interacting systems, barrier heights for hydrogen and non-hydrogen transfer reactions, bond distances, and harmonic frequencies on standard test sets that are competitive with results from other long-range-corrected, Coulomb-attenuated, or global hybrid functionals. In fact, they are generally superior to or competitive with CAM-PBE0 and, except for heats of formation, with CAM-B3LYP as well. Advantageously, the Rydberg excitation energies from CAP0 are superior to those of other global hybrids and of the long-range-corrected hybrids. They are similar to those from CAM-B3LYP and modestly inferior to the CAM-PBE0 errors.

Although PET/MRI has been used in many settings, not all cancers benefit from the combined modality. With the availability of somatostatin receptor-targeted PET tracers such as 68Ga-DOTA-TOC and 68Ga-DOTA-TATE, imaging of NET patients has refocused on targeted imaging, particularly with the development of peptide receptor radiotherapy. Nonetheless, there are many patients who continue to benefit from dedicated MR imaging, such as those with liver-predominant disease. In these patients, SSR PET/MRI is an important option for optimal imaging. Both diffusion-weighted imaging and hepatobiliary phase imaging provide improved lesion detection compared to conventional MRI and CT, and the results can effect therapeutic decisions. Additionally, the use of motion correction techniques can be used to leverage the additional PET data acquired in dedicated liver PET/MRI to remove respiratory artifacts." .

One key mechanism behind such an influence is the absorption of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation by ozone in the tropical stratosphere, a process that modifies temperature and wind patterns and hence wave propagation and atmospheric circulation2,3,4,5. The amplitude of UV variability is uncertain, yet it directly affects the magnitude of the climate response6: observations from the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite7 show broadband changes up to three times larger than previous measurements8,9. Here we present estimates of the stratospheric ozone variability during the solar cycle. Specifically, we estimate the photolytic response of stratospheric ozone to changes in spectral solar irradiance by calculating the difference between a reference chemistry–climate model simulation of ozone variability driven only by transport (with no changes in solar irradiance) and observations of ozone concentrations. Subtracting the reference from simulations with time-varying irradiance, we can evaluate different data sets of measured and modelled spectral irradiance. We find that at altitudes above pressure levels of 5 hPa, the ozone response to solar variability simulated using the SORCE spectral solar irradiance data are inconsistent with the observations." .

A system and an apparatus interact for a certain time period (measurement time), and during this interaction, information about an observable is transferred from the system to the apparatus. In this study, we quantify the energy fluctuation of the quantum apparatus required for this physical process to occur autonomously. We first examine the so-called standard model of measurement, which is free from any non-trivial energy–time uncertainty relation, to find that it needs an external system that switches on the interaction between the system and the apparatus. In such a sense this model is not closed. Therefore to treat a measurement process in a fully quantum manner we need to consider a “larger” quantum apparatus which works also as a timing device switching on the interaction. In this setting we prove that a trade-off relation (energy–time uncertainty relation), $$\\tau \\cdot \\Delta H_A \\ge \\frac{\\pi \\hbar }{4}$$ τ·ΔHA≥πħ4 , holds between the energy fluctuation $$\\Delta H_A$$ ΔHA of the quantum apparatus and the measurement time $$\\tau $$ τ . We use this trade-off relation to discuss the spacetime uncertainty relation concerning the operational meaning of the microscopic structure of spacetime. In addition, we derive another trade-off inequality between the measurement time and the strength of interaction between the system and the apparatus." .

Over 80% modulation depth is observed, and shows no degradation after repetitive switching. The spectral bandwidth approaches 100 nm.

In fs LPP, the average speed of fast species is unaffected by an increase in ambient pressure, while in ns LPP, the speed is found to reduce with pressure. The slow species shows a sharp peak in the OTOF spectra with a narrow velocity distribution for fs LPP, indicating a large number density and low electron temperature, which is consistent with optical emission spectroscopic (OES) studies.

The techniques which we are concentrating here are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) linked with different image analysis methods and X-ray diffraction techniques.

The program is more efficient, and it offers more detailed morphological information of the particles than the manual technique. However, particle shapes that are very different from spherical proved to be problematic also for the novel program.

The ground-state structures of neutral GdSi n (n = 2–9) excluded GdSi7 can be regarded as replacing a Si of the ground-state structure of Si n+1 with a Gd atom. When adding an additional electron to the ground-state structure of the neutral, the extra electron effect on the geometries is very strong. As a result, the ground-state structures of anion GdSi n − (n = 6–9) differ from those of their neutral. The theoretical AEAs of GdSi n are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Based on the theoretical results, the experimental PES (taken from Grubisic et al. in J Am Chem Soc 131:10783–10790, 2009) of GdSi4 − have been reassigned. Assigning 2.15 ± 0.05 eV to the experimental AEAs is more reasonable than 1.65 ± 0.05 eV. The excellent agreement between the experimental PES and the theoretical simulations indicates that the ground-state structures of GdSi n − (n = 3–9) are reliable.

Using the Pekar variational method, the effects of the temperature, impurity and electromagnetic fields on the transition are investigated through the eigenenergies of the ground and first-excited states of the polaron in a triangular potential quantum dot. Those parameters are essential for the transition of the polaron from the ground state to the first-excited state. This quantum system in nanostructure can be employed as a two-level quantum qubit. The numerical result shows the weak evolution of the probability density with the electron-phonon coupling constant, the cyclotron frequency and the Coulombic potential. It is also noted that this probability increased with the confinement length and electric-field strength. The tunneling of temperature leads to the amplification of the probability density." .

A two-step chain-branching reaction model is used to give a thermally neutral induction zone followed by a chemical reaction zone for the detonation wave. A sufficiently large distance of travel of the Mach stem is computed to observe the asymptotic behavior in the far field. Depending on the scale at which the Mach reflection process occurs, it is found that the Mach reflection of a cellular detonation behaves essentially in the same way as a planar ZND detonation wave. The cellular instabilities, however, cause the triple-point trajectory to fluctuate. The fluctuations are due to interactions of the triple point of the Mach stem with the transverse waves of cellular instabilities. In the vicinity of the wedge apex, the Mach reflection is found to be self-similar and corresponds to that of a shock wave of the same strength, since the Mach stem is highly overdriven initially. In the far field, the triple-point trajectory approaches a straight line, indicating that the Mach reflection becomes self-similar asymptotically. The distance of the approach to self-similarity is found to decrease rapidly with decreasing thickness of the detonation front." .

Close attention is paid to the damaging factor of proton irradiation, leaving aside passivation effects by hydrogen. The concept of defect production and annealing processes being accepted in the literature so far needs to be reconsidered. Contrary to expectations the dominant impurity-related defects produced by MeV protons turn out to be electrically neutral in n-type material. Surprisingly, radiation acceptors appear to play a minor role. Annealing studies of irradiated samples of such complex defects as a divacancy tied to a phosphorus atom and a vacancy tied to two phosphorus atoms. The latter defect features high thermal stability. Identification of the dominant neutral donors, however, remains unclear and will require further, more detailed, studies.

The acceleration of cosmic rays and their evolution along with that of magnetic fields in these media is still not well understood. Diffuse radio sources of synchrotron origin associated with the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) such as radio halos, relics and mini-halos are direct probes of the underlying mechanisms of cosmic ray acceleration. Observations with radio telescopes such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, the Very Large Array and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope have led to the discoveries of about 80 such sources and allowed detailed studies in the frequency range 0.15–1.4 GHz of a few. These studies have revealed scaling relations between the thermal and non-thermal properties of clusters and favour the role of shocks in the formation of radio relics and of turbulent re-acceleration in the formation of radio halos and mini-halos. The radio halos are known to occur in merging clusters and mini-halos are detected in about half of the cool-core clusters. Due to the limitations of current radio telescopes, low mass galaxy clusters and galaxy groups remain unexplored as they are expected to contain much weaker radio sources. Distinguishing between the primary and the secondary models of cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms requires spectral measurements over a wide range of radio frequencies and with high sensitivity. Simulations have also predicted weak diffuse radio sources associated with filaments connecting galaxy clusters. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a next generation radio telescope that will operate in the frequency range of 0.05–20 GHz with unprecedented sensitivities and resolutions. The expected detection limits of SKA will reveal a few hundred to thousand new radio halos, relics and mini-halos providing the first large and comprehensive samples for their study. The wide frequency coverage along with sensitivity to extended structures will be able to constrain the cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms. The higher frequency (>5 GHz) observations will be able to use the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect to probe the ICM pressure in addition to tracers such as lobes of head–tail radio sources. The SKA also opens prospects to detect the ‘off-state’ or the lowest level of radio emission from the ICM predicted by the hadronic models and the turbulent re-acceleration models." .

However, Hall effect studies frequently reveal an unconventional behavior that cannot be readily explained with the simple band-semiconductor Hall effect model. Here, we develop an analytical model of Hall effect in organic field-effect transistors in a regime of coexisting band and hopping carriers. The model, which is supported by the experiments, is based on a partial Hall voltage compensation effect, occurring because hopping carriers respond to the transverse Hall electric field and drift in the direction opposite to the Lorentz force acting on band carriers. We show that this can lead in particular to an underdeveloped Hall effect observed in organic semiconductors with substantial off-diagonal thermal disorder. Our model captures the main features of Hall effect in a variety of organic semiconductors and provides an analytical description of Hall mobility, carrier density and carrier coherence factor." .

One of the most critical factors affecting the measurement uncertainty with the PQED method is the determination of the aperture area. This paper describes an upgrade to an optical method for direct determination of aperture area where superposition of equally spaced Gaussian laser beams is used to form a uniform irradiance distribution. In practice, this is accomplished by scanning the aperture in front of an intensity-stabilized laser beam. In the upgraded method, the aperture is attached to the PQED and the whole package is transversely scanned relative to the laser beam. This has the benefit of having identical geometry in the laser scanning of the aperture area and in the actual photometric measurement. Further, the aperture and detector assembly does not have to be dismantled for the aperture calibration. However, due to small acceptance angle of the PQED, differences between the diffraction effects of an overfilling plane wave and of a combination of Gaussian laser beams at the circular aperture need to be taken into account. A numerical calculation method for studying these effects is discussed in this paper. The calculation utilizes the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral, which is applied to the geometry of the PQED and the aperture. Calculation results for various aperture diameters and two different aperture-to-detector distances are presented." .

However, it seems there is no indication for the existence of the longitudinal spin separation of light. In this paper, we propose and experimentally realize the spin separation along the propagation direction by modulating the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase. Due to the spin-dependent divergence and convergence determined by the PB phase, a focused Gaussian beam could split into two opposite spin states, and focuses at different distances, representing the longitudinal spin separation. By combining this longitudinal spin separation with the transverse one, we experimentally achieve the controllable spin-dependent focal shift in three dimensional space. This work provides new insight on steering the spin photons, and is expected to explore novel applications of optical trapping, manipulating, and micromachining with higher degree of freedom." .

We demonstrate such intensity-dependent beam trapping in chiral soft matter, exhibiting one-dimensional discrete diffraction along the helical axis and one-dimensional continuous diffraction in the orthogonal plane. In nematic liquid crystals with suitable birefringence and chiral arrangement, the reorientational nonlinearity is shown to support bell-shaped solitary waves with simple astigmatism dependent on the medium birefringence as well as on the dual diffraction of the input wavepacket.

In particular, clarifying the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity is a central challenge because magnetism may play a key role in their exotic superconductivity. BaFe2As2 is one of ideal systems for such investigation because its superconductivity can be induced in several ways, allowing a comparative examination. Here we report a study on the spin fluctuations of the hole-overdoped iron-based superconductors Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x = 0.5 and 1.0; Tc = 36 K and 3.4 K, respectively) over the entire Brillouin zone using inelastic neutron scattering. We find that their spin spectra consist of spin wave and chimney-like dispersions. The chimney-like dispersion can be attributed to the itinerant character of magnetism. The band width of the spin wave-like dispersion is almost constant from the non-doped to optimum-doped region, which is followed by a large reduction in the overdoped region. This suggests that the superconductivity is suppressed by the reduction of magnetic exchange couplings, indicating a strong relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors." .

The change of relative intensity between the leading and trailing components is the predominant feature of mode switching. The intensity ratio between the leading and trailing components are measured for the individual profiles averaged over 30 seconds. It is found that there is an excess of high ratios over the normal distribution, which indicates that two modes exist in the pulsar. The distribution of abnormal mode has a narrower width indicating that the abnormal mode is more stable than the normal mode. A total of 76 mode switching events are detected in our data. It spends 89 % in the normal mode and 11 % in the abnormal mode. The intrinsic distributions of mode timescales are constrained with power-law distributions. The significant difference in the index of the duration distribution between normal and abnormal modes possibly indicates that the timescale for the abnormal mode to get stable is shorter than that for the normal mode.

The average width of transition region network boundaries is obtained from the two-dimensional autocorrelation function of SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) synoptic images of the Sun in two emission lines, He i 586 Å and O v 630 Å during 1996 – 2012. The width of the network boundaries is found to be roughly correlated with the solar cycle variation with a lag of about ten months. A comparison of the widths in the two emission lines shows that they are larger for the He i line. The SOHO/CDS data also show large asymmetry in boundary widths in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) image directions, which is shown to be caused by image distortions that are due to instrumental effects. Since the network boundary widths are related to the magnetic flux concentration along the boundaries, the results are expected to have implications on the flux transport on the solar surface, solar cycle, and the mass and energy budget of network loops and jets." .

This demand was satisfied by the advent of short-wavelength free-electron lasers. However, for any given free-electron laser setup, a limit presently exists in the generation of ultra-short pulses carrying substantial energy.

Here we report a concerted approach involving tailored materials, magnetostatics and detection electronics to enhance the resolution of nuclear magnetic resonance sensing by three orders of magnitude.

To exemplify this capability we demonstrate the direct detection and relaxometry of nuclear polarization and real-time recording of dynamic susceptibility effects related to human heart function.

Each selective oxidation cycle involves four general steps: (a) a peroxo or weakly adsorbed O2 group releases an O atom to substrate to form substrate oxide and an oxo group, (b) an oxygen molecule adds to the oxo group to generate an η2-ozone group, (c) the η2-ozone group rearranges to form an η3-ozone group, and (d) the η3-ozone group releases an O atom to substrate to form substrate oxide and regenerate the peroxo or weakly adsorbed O2 group. This catalyst could potentially be synthesized via the condensation reaction Zr(N(R)R′)4 + 2 C6H4–1,6-(N(C6H3–2′,6′-(CH(CH3)2)2)OH)2 → Zr(C6H4–1,6-(N(C6H3–2′,6′-(CH(CH3)2)2)O)2)2 [aka Zr_Benzol catalyst] + 4 N(R)(R′)H where R and R′ are CH3, CH2CH3, or other alkyl groups. For direct ethylene epoxidation, the computed enthalpic energetic span (i.e., effective activation energy for the entire catalytic cycle) is 27.1 kcal/mol, which is one of the lowest values for catalysts studied to date. We study reaction mechanisms and the stability of different catalyst forms as a function of the oxygen atom chemical potential. Notably, an aromatic linkage in each ligand prevents this catalyst from deactivating to form an inactive octahedral-like structure that contains the same atoms as the dioxo complex, Zr(Ligand)2(O)2. Due to a side reaction that can transfer an allylic H atom from alkene to catalyst, this catalyst is useful for directly epoxidizing alkenes such as ethylene that do not contain allylic H atoms. To better understand the reaction chemistry, we computed net atomic charges and bond orders for the two catalytically relevant reaction cycles. These results quantify electron transfer and bond forming and breaking during the catalytic process." .

Unlike the standard case, in which the amount of extractable energy is constrained, here there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity can be extracted.

In this study we have theoretically investigated reactive properties of LOR using both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

This behaviour is driven by the structure of the ground-state manifold which extends the celebrated two-in/two-out ice states to include branching structures built from three-in/one-out, three-out/one-in and all-in/all-out tetrahedra defects. Distinctive liquid-like patterns in the magnetic correlations serve as a signature of this intermediate range order. Possible applications to materials as well the effects of quantum tunnelling are discussed." .

The designed microcavity supports the fundamental and first-order transverse modes of Gaussian mode beam with controllable longitudinal modes, respectively. The transverse mode is determined by two holographic mirrors made from deliberately designed groove patterns via the surface electromagnetic wave holography methodology, while the longitudinal mode is determined by the length of cavity. Both numerical simulations and leaky-wave SPP mode observations confirm the realization of full mode selection in the fabricated cavity.

On a single device we perform three routing procedures on entangled states, preserving the encoded quantum state with an average fidelity of 97.1%, measuring in the coincidence basis.

Depending on the solution concentration of coreactant and QDs, the surface-confined CNTs could either quench or enhance the ECL intensity. Lowering the solution concentration of QDs was found to be beneficial for enhancing ECL. A V-shaped profile of ECL intensity ratio (at CNTs over bare GCE) versus coreactant concentration suggested that either low or high concentrations of coreactant were needed for effective ECL generation. The ECL quenching by CNTs was believed to follow the typical dynamic quenching mechanism, which was confirmed by fluorescent data that provided a Stern-Volmer and an estimated quenching constant of 11.7 g/L and 1.2 × 109 L/g•s, respectively, for the excited state CdTe* quenching by CNTs in solution.

Attention is mainly focused on the relation between the measure and the final entanglement obtained via swapping. During the study, the entanglement of formation (EoF) is employed as a quantifier to characterize and quantify the entanglements present in all involved states. All concerned EoFs are expressed analytically; thus, the relation between the final entanglement and the measuring state is established. Through concrete analyses, the measure demands for getting a certain amount of a final entanglement are revealed. It is found that a maximally entangled final state can be obtained from any two given initial entangled states via swapping with a certain probability; however, a peculiar measure should be performed.

As a means to overcome this capacity crunch, space-division multiplexing (SDM) using few-mode fibers (FMF) has been proposed and demonstrated. In single-mode optical fibers, Rayleigh scattering serves as the dominant mechanism for optical loss. However, to date, the role of Rayleigh scattering in FMFs remains elusive. Here we establish and experimentally validate a general model for Rayleigh scattering in FMFs. Rayleigh backscattering not only sets the intrinsic loss limit for FMFs but also provides the theoretical foundation for few-mode optical time-domain reflectometry, which can be used to probe perturbation-induced mode-coupling dynamics in FMFs. We also show that forward inter-modal Rayleigh scattering ultimately sets a fundamental limit on inter-modal-crosstalk for FMFs. Therefore, this work not only has implications specifically for SDM systems but also broadly for few-mode fiber optics and its applications in amplifiers, lasers, and sensors in which inter-modal crosstalk imposes a fundamental performance limitation." .

Betatron x-rays are usually produced via self-injected electron beams, which are not controllable and are not optimized for x-ray yields. Here, we present a new method for bright hard x-ray emission via ionization injection from the K-shell electrons of nitrogen into the accelerating bucket. A total photon yield of 8 × 108/shot and 108 photons with energy greater than 110 keV is obtained. The yield is 10 times higher than that achieved with self-injection mode in helium under similar laser parameters. The simulation suggests that ionization-injected electrons are quickly accelerated to the driving laser region and are subsequently driven into betatron resonance. The present scheme enables the single-stage betatron radiation from LWFA to be extended to bright γ-ray radiation, which is beyond the capability of 3rd generation synchrotrons." .

Here, we demonstrate single-electron spin resonance in a quadruple quantum dot. A few-electron quadruple quantum dot is formed within a magnetic field gradient created by a micro-magnet. We oscillate the wave functions of the electrons in the quantum dots by applying microwave voltages and this induces electron spin resonance.

This work adds the property of spatial order to the concept of quantum foam that was introduced by John Wheeler over 50 years ago. It is shown that this ordering results in new gravitational phenomena that affect elementary particles with masses close to the Planck mass. The only known elementary particles with a mass comparable to or greater than the Planck mass are black holes. Calculated in this work are the energies of particles within the crystal, their dispersion curves, group velocities and effective inertial masses. It is shown that, for particles having particular energies and momenta, the crystal can modify the inertial mass such that it is no longer equal to the gravitational mass—a violation of Einstein’s equivalence principle in appearance only. Under certain conditions, particular particles can have a negative effective inertial mass such that it is pushed by the pull of an external gravitational force produced by sources other than the crystal. The connections between the effects of the gravity crystal and dark energy and dark matter are discussed. Also discussed is how to determine the properties of the universe-wide gravity crystal by studying the motion of black holes and galaxies—in effect using black holes as hyper-resolving microscopes to study the fine structure of the universe." .

Firstly, starting from a set of complete orthogonal time-dependent basis with undetermined coefficients, a time-dependent Hamiltonian is derived via Counterdiabatic driving for the purpose of guiding the system to attain an arbitrary target state at a predefined time. Then, on request of the assumed target states, two single-mode driving protocols and a multi-mode driving protocol are proposed as examples to discuss the validity of the QSE scheme. The result of comparison between single-mode driving and multi-mode driving shows that multi-mode driving seems to have a wider rang of application prospect because it can drive the system to an arbitrary target state from an arbitrary initial state also at a predefined time even without the use of microwave fields for the transition between the two ground states. Moreover, for the purpose of discussion in the scheme’s feasibility in practice, a polynomial ansatz as the simplest exampleis used to fix the pulses.

The latter is collected with high efficiency and adjustable temporal and spectral properties into a spatially well-defined cavity mode.

Structural parameters and properties such as singlet-triplet gaps, electron affinities, ionization potentials, dipole moments, enthalpies of formation, and bond dissociation energies have been calculated in a set of six well-characterized singlet diradicals, and benchmarked against experimental data and wavefunction-based CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations. The complexity of the open-shell singlet ground state is revealed in the difficulties to properly represent the diradical character reported by some DFT functionals, specially those that do not comprise a certain amount of Hartree-Fock exchange in their formulation. We find that STGs, EAs, dipole moments, and thermochemical properties are, in general, satisfactorily calculated, while for IPs larger deviations with respect to the experiments are found in all cases. The best overall performance is accounted for by hybrid functionals, including some of the long-range corrected functionals, but also pure functionals, comprising the kinetic energy density in their formulation, are found to be competent. Composite methods perform satisfactorily, especially G3(MP2)-RAD and G3X(MP2)-RAD, which calculate singlet-triplet gaps and electron affinities more accurately. On the other hand, G3-RAD and G3X-RAD provide better ionization potentials. This study emphasizes that the use of recently developed functionals, within the broken symmetry approximation, is an appropriate tool for the simulation of organic singlet diradicals, with similar accuracy compared to more expensive composite methods.

Within the framework of a relativistic single particle model, the effects of density-dependent electromagnetic form factors on the exclusive $ (e,e'p)$ reaction are investigated in the quasi-elastic region. The density-dependent electromagnetic form factors are generated from a quark-meson coupling model and used to calculate the cross sections in two different densities, either at the normal density of $ \\rho_0 \\sim 0.15$ fm^-3 or at the lower density, $ 0.5\\rho_0$ . Then these cross sections are analyzed in the two different kinematics: One is that the momentum of the outgoing nucleon is along the momentum transfer. The other is that the angle between the momentum of the outgoing nucleon and the momentum transfer is varied at fixed magnitude of the momentum of the outgoing nucleon. Our theoretical differential reduced cross sections are compared with the NIKHEF data for the 208 Pb(e, e’p) reaction, which is related to the probability that a bound nucleon from a given orbit can be knocked-out of the nucleus. The effects of the density-dependent form factors increase the differential cross sections for both knocked-out proton and neutron by an amount of a few percent. Moreover they are shown to be almost the same within only a few percent, i.e., nearly independent of the shell location of knockout nucleons. These results are quite consistent with the characteristics of double magic nuclei which have relatively sharp smearing in the density distribution." .
