Abstract Together with the problem of confinement, plasma–wall interactions present the major constraints toward a magnetic fusion reactor. The solutions of Grad–Shafranov equation (GSE) analytically can be used for theoretical studies of plasma equilibrium, transport and magneto-hydrodynamic stability. Here we introduce specific choices for source functions, kinetic pressure and poloidal plasma current, to be quadratic in poloidal magnetic flux and derive an analytical solution for GS equation. With applying this solution to IR-T1 tokamak, we have calculated the poloidal magnetic flux, toroidal current density and normalized pressure profiles for this tokamak. Toroidal and poloidal flows can considerably change the equilibrium parameters of tokamak. These effects on the equilibrium of tokamak plasmas are numerically investigated using a code FLOW. As a comparative approach to equilibrium problem, the code is used to model equilibrium of IR-T1 tokamak for case pure toroidal flow.
