Abstract A classical charged particle travels along a circular orbit and interacts with a silver atom in its ground state fixed at the center of the circle through Biot-Savart coupling. We find that if the silver atom initially lies in a spin superposition state of valence electron, in the co-rotating frame of reference the projected measurements of the spin of silver’s valence electron along the z direction determine the rotational direction, and the projected measurements of that spin along the x or the y direction yield planet versions of the state of Schrödinger’s cat.
