Abstract Statistical analysis of the results of molecular-dynamic modeling for nucleation of metal (Cu) vapors in inert gas atmosphere (Ar) is carried out. Features of the initial stage of nucleation are considered for estimation of the probability of the growth of small atomic clusters within a supersaturated nonequilibrium medium and the efficiency of heat removal from them during collisions with inert gas atoms and other metal atoms.
