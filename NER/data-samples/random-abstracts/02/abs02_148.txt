Abstract We present calculations of deuteron elastic and nonelastic breakup cross sections and angular distributions at deuteron energies below 100Â MeV obtained using the post-form DWBA approximation. The elastic breakup cross section was extensively studied in the past. Very few calculations of nonelastic breakup have been performed, however. We compare two forms of the elastic DWBA breakup amplitude but conclude that neither provides a correct description of the inclusive proton emission cross section.
