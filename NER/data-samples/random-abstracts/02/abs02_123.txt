Abstract The structures, adiabatic electron affinities (AEAs), dissociation energies, simulated photoelectron spectra (PES), relative stabilities, hardness, charges transfer, and magnetic moments of neutral GdSi n (n = 2–9) and their anions have been examined by using the four density functional schemes. Basis sets used in this work are of segmented Gaussian valence basis sets and relativistic small-core effective core potentials with additional diffuse 2dfg functions for Gd atoms and aug-cc-pVTZ for Si atoms. The ground-state structures of neutral GdSi n (n = 2–9) excluded GdSi7 can be regarded as replacing a Si of the ground-state structure of Si n+1 with a Gd atom. When adding an additional electron to the ground-state structure of the neutral, the extra electron effect on the geometries is very strong. As a result, the ground-state structures of anion GdSi n − (n = 6–9) differ from those of their neutral. The theoretical AEAs of GdSi n are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Based on the theoretical results, the experimental PES (taken from Grubisic et al. in J Am Chem Soc 131:10783–10790, 2009) of GdSi4 − have been reassigned. Assigning 2.15 ± 0.05 eV to the experimental AEAs is more reasonable than 1.65 ± 0.05 eV. The excellent agreement between the experimental PES and the theoretical simulations indicates that the ground-state structures of GdSi n − (n = 3–9) are reliable. Hardness analysis shows that photochemical sensitivity of GdSi8 is the best among these species. Analysis of magnetic moments shows that the total moments on the Gd do not quench, and the total magnetic moments are contributed by Gd atom.
