Abstract The problem of the calculation of inclusive breakup cross sections in nuclear reactions is reexamined. For that purpose, the theory proposed by Ichimura et al. (Phys Rev C 32:431, 1985) is revisited, both in its prior and post representations. We briefly outline the connection of this theory with that proposed by Udagawa and Tamura (Phys Rev C 24:1348, 1981) and apply both theories to the inclusive breakup of $$^6$$ 6 Li on $$^{209}$$ 209 Bi at near-barrier energies, comparing also with available data. The relative importance of elastic versus non-elastic breakup, as a function of the incident energy and of the projectile separation energy, is also investigated.
