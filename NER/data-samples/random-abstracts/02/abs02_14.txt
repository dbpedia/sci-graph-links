Abstract This work describes the gravitational effects of an ordered array of Planck masses, arrayed in a cubic lattice with a lattice constant equal to the Planck length. This work adds the property of spatial order to the concept of quantum foam that was introduced by John Wheeler over 50 years ago. It is shown that this ordering results in new gravitational phenomena that affect elementary particles with masses close to the Planck mass. The only known elementary particles with a mass comparable to or greater than the Planck mass are black holes. Calculated in this work are the energies of particles within the crystal, their dispersion curves, group velocities and effective inertial masses. It is shown that, for particles having particular energies and momenta, the crystal can modify the inertial mass such that it is no longer equal to the gravitational mass—a violation of Einstein’s equivalence principle in appearance only. Under certain conditions, particular particles can have a negative effective inertial mass such that it is pushed by the pull of an external gravitational force produced by sources other than the crystal. The connections between the effects of the gravity crystal and dark energy and dark matter are discussed. Also discussed is how to determine the properties of the universe-wide gravity crystal by studying the motion of black holes and galaxies—in effect using black holes as hyper-resolving microscopes to study the fine structure of the universe.
