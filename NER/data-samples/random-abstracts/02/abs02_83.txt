Abstract A V-shaped nanoantenna lens capable to realize effective focusing is designed by numerical simulation on the basis of theories pertinent to surface plasmon. The focusing of lens within the scope of broadband and its broad angles of view are also explored. The lens can realize focusing while the wavelength of incident light ranges from 432 to 632 nm. Focusing with equal focal distance can be achieved while the incident angle ranges from −30° to 30°. These research works give great potential to promote the use of metallic nanostructures in the fields of laser direct writing, superdiffraction lithography, high-density optical storage, and optical integrated devices.
