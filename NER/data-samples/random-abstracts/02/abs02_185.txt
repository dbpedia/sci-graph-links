Abstract The electron transport properties of C60, Au@C60 and Ag@C60 junctions between Au electrodes are investigated with density functional theory and the first-principle nonequilibrium Greens function. Density of states and transmission possibility as functions of energy are examined, and currentâ€“voltage characteristics of all these models are calculated with and without spin correction. With spin correction, we find a spin-current difference in Au@C60 as large as an order of magnitude. It may be used to obtain high-purity arbitrary spin current. By comparing the calculation results with and without spin correction, we attribute this spin difference to the spin resonance between transmission electrons and the valence electron of endohedral Au atom.
