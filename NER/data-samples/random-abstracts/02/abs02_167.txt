Abstract I give a brief account of the status and perspectives of lattice calculations of the light-front wave functions at small transverse separations, usually referred to as hadron distribution amplitudes (DAs). The existing calculations indicate that the corrections to the asymptotic form of such distributions at large scales are rather small as compared to earlier model estimates. Lattice calculations also suggest an alternating pattern of such corrections for the nucleon resonances with increasing mass. Several recent results are discussed, including precise determination of the second moment of the pion DA, leading-twist DAs of the nucleon and $$N^*(1535)$$ Nâˆ—(1535) , and the first calculation of the flavor-symmetry breaking corrections in the DAs of the baryon octet.
