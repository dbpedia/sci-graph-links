Abstract The continuously mode-locked operation of a novel Nd,Y:SrF2 laser pumped by the low power 796 nm multimode laser diode and mode-locked using a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror is demonstrated. The continuous train of pulses with the total output power of 70 mW and the pulse duration of 0.9 ps with the repetition rate of 142 MHz at the wavelength of 1.06 μm was generated from the resonator without dispersion compensation giving a good potential for generation of femtosecond pulses from a diode pumped system.
