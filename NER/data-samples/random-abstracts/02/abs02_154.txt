Abstract We derive a large deviations principle for the two-dimensional two-component plasma in a box. As a consequence, we obtain a variational representation for the free energy, and also show that the macroscopic empirical measure of either positive or negative charges converges to the uniform measure. An appendix, written by Wei Wu, discusses applications to the subcritical complex Gaussian multiplicative chaos.
