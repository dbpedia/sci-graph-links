Abstract It is well known that quantum correlations for bipartite dichotomic measurements are those of the form $${\gamma=(\langle u_i,v_j\rangle)_{i,j=1}^n}$$ γ=(⟨ui,vj⟩)i,j=1n , where the vectors u i and v j are in the unit ball of a real Hilbert space. In this work we study the probability of the nonlocal nature of these correlations as a function of $${\alpha=\frac{m}{n}}$$ α=mn , where the previous vectors are sampled according to the Haar measure in the unit sphere of $${\mathbb R^m}$$ Rm . In particular, we prove the existence of an $${\alpha_0 > 0}$$ α0>0 such that if $${\alpha\leq \alpha_0}$$ α≤α0 , $${\gamma}$$ γ is nonlocal with probability tending to 1 as $${n\rightarrow \infty}$$ n→∞ , while for $${\alpha > 2}$$ α>2 , $${\gamma}$$ γ is local with probability tending to 1 as $${n\rightarrow \infty}$$ n→∞ .
