Abstract In this paper, we show that the diffusion Monte Carlo method is able to describe triple ionization energies with the participation of the core electrons. Some states (ground and ionized states) of the ammonia molecule were calculated with trial wave functions constructed by Hartree–Fock and Kohn–Sham orbitals. The results are in good agreement with theoretical data presented in the literature, taking into account the simplicity of the strategy, but the accuracy was influenced by the choice of the orbital in the construction of the trial wave function (hence the quality of the nodal surface), as suggested by Per et al. (J Chem Theory Comput 8:2255–2259, 2012).
