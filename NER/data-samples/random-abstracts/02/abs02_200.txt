Abstract The technique of obtaining spherical particles from rod-like plant virus, tobacco mosaic virus, in a preparative scale was developed. The conditions of tobacco mosaic virus isolation for obtaining spherical particles were selected. Spherical particles were examined by methods of electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and dynamic light scattering. Information about inner structure of spherical particles was obtained. High electron density of spherical particles was demonstrated. The analysis of ultrathin sections showed that spherical particles are homogenous within and do not contain any cavities.
