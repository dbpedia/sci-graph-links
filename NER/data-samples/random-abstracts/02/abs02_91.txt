Abstract Optical properties of multi-ring with spatial symmetry breaking are investigated theoretically. Tunable ultrahigh order surface plasmonic resonance is achieved, which is found to be sensitive to geometric parameters. Certain high-order surface plasmonic resonances can be either suppressed or enhanced when geometrical parameters are adjusted. Moreover, more than one quadrupolar-dipolar, octupolar-dipolar, and hexadecapolar-dipolar mode of the surface plasmonic resonance can be achieved. The asymmetry also allows the generation of strong electric field enhancement with these nanostructures that can be applied in the field of surface-enhanced spectroscopy and biosensing.
