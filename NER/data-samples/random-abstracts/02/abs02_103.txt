Abstract Halogen-containing plasma, particularly, freons, is often used to form topologies on the surface of semiconductors. This paper investigates the kinetics of the interaction between the R-12 freon and the surface of a semiconductor structure. The R-12 freon is effective for etching semiconductors, particularly, gallium arsenide, as it provides sufficient rates of interaction while preserving a uniform and clean surface. In this work, the surface of the samples is inspected with a Solver P47Pro atomic-force microscope.
