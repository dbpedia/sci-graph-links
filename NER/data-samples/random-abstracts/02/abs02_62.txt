Abstract. In this study, the diamagnetic susceptibility of an off-center hydrogenic donor impurity confined by pyramid and cone-like quantum dots has been investigated. To this end, the finite-element method and the Arnoldi algorithm are used to find energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the systems. Then, the effect of impurity position and dot size has been investigated on the diamagnetic susceptibility. We have found that the diamagnetic susceptibility has a maximum around the impurity position 4nm for two quantum dots. The diamagnetic susceptibility in the cone-like quantum dot is smaller than that in the pyramid quantum dot. Numerical studies reveal that the diamagnetic susceptibility depends strongly on the geometry of the dot.
