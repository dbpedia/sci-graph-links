Summary Multiple particle production in electron-positron interactions has been observed in an experiment performed at Adone, the Frascati 2×1.5 GeV e+e− storage ring. A total number of 239 events collected at several energies of the incident electron and positron beams between 0.8 and 1.0 GeV were analysed. The distribution of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the final state is discussed and some upper limits on these multiplicities are reported. The observed lower limit to the total cross-section for multiple particle production in e+e− interactions, averaged over the energy range explored, is 3·10−32 cm2 with a statistical error of ±10% and a systematic uncertainty of ±25%.
