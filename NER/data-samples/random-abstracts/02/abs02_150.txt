Abstract In this paper, we study the quantum dynamics of a charged particle in the plane in the presence of a periodically pulsed magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. We show that by controlling the cycle when the magnetic field is switched on and off appropriately, the result of the asymptotic completeness of wave operators can be obtained under the assumption that the potential V satisfies the decaying condition $${|V(x)| \le C(1 + |x|)^{-\rho}}$$ |V(x)|≤C(1+|x|)-ρ for some $${\rho > 0}$$ ρ>0 .
