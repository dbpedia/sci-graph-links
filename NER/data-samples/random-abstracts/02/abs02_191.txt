Abstract Pulse-pumped MOVPE-fabricated (metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy) semiconductor lasers emitting in the spectral ranges 1000–1100 and 1400–1600 nm at temperatures of 110–120 K are studied. It is found that cooling the lasers for both spectral ranges to low temperature results in their light–current curves approaching linearity, and an optical power of, respectively, 110 and 20 W can be attained. The low-temperature effect is reduced for lasers emitting in the spectral range 1400–1600 nm. The processes affecting a rise in the internal optical loss in semiconductor lasers are considered. It is shown that an increase in the carrier concentration in the waveguide of a laser structure greatly depends on temperature and is determined by the noninstantaneous capture (capture rate) of carriers from the waveguide into the active region. It is demonstrated that, upon lowering the temperature to 115K, the concentration of electrons and holes in the waveguide becomes lower, which leads to a significant decrease in the internal optical loss and to an increase in the output optical power of the semiconductor laser.
