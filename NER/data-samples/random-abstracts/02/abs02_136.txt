As silicon-based electronics approach the limit of scaling for increasing the performance and chip density, III窶天 compound semiconductors have started to attract significant attention owing to their high carrier mobility. However, the mobility benefits of III窶天 compounds are too easily accepted, ignoring a harmful effect of unavoidable threading dislocations that could fundamentally limit the applicability of these materials in nanometer-scale electronics. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that describes the degradation of carrier mobility by charged dislocations in quantum-confined III窶天 semiconductor metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFETs). Based on the results, we conclude that in order for III窶天 compound MOSFETs to outperform silicon MOSFETs, Fermi level pinning in the channel should be eliminated for yielding carriers with high injection velocity.
