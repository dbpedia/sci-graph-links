Abstract In this work we study the resonant and coherent properties of single InP-based InAs quantum dots, which show an optical emission in the telecom C-band and L-band. High-resolution resonant photocurrent spectroscopy on p–i–n devices reveals narrow linewidths and fully resolved fine structure splittings. We observe Lorentzian line shapes, which allow for the extraction of dephasing times as a function of the applied bias voltage. Coherent ps laser excitation results in pronounced Rabi rotations with increasing pulse area. For π-pulse excitation, we obtain more than 93 % of the theoretically expected photocurrent amplitude. Our results also demonstrate that such state-of-the-art InP-based quantum dots for the telecom band exhibit promising key parameters comparable to well-established InAs/GaAs counterparts.
