Abstract We demonstrate the high-order harmonic generation in the plasmas produced on the surfaces of organic targets. The role of resonances and two-color pump-induced enhancement of harmonics is analyzed. We show that the harmonic spectra from organic molecules-contained plasmas demonstrate the similarities and distinctions with the one from graphite ablation.
