Abstract A series of penta- and heteropentadienyl [CH2CHCHCHXBe]+, (X = CH2, O, NH, S) complexes has been theoretically studied. All calculated complexes show beryllium atoms with two, three, and five coordination numbers. The density functional theory (DFT) was used to determine the electron and structural behavior of those beryllium complexes. The nature of the ligands plays an important role in the form of binding to the beryllium atom. Beryllium structures 1–4 are able to coordinate only one hydrogen molecule. A molecular orbital analysis for all complexes was performed in order to know more about the nature of their bonding scheme.
