Abstract We selected 82 u-band variable objects based on the u-band photometry data from SCUSS and SDSS, in the field of LAMOST Complete Spectroscopic Survey of Pointing Area at Southern Galactic Cap. The magnitude variation of the targets is restricted to larger than 0.2 mag and limiting magnitude down to 19.0 mag in u-band. According to the spectra from LAMOST, there are 11 quasars with redshift between 0.4 and 1.8, 60 variable stars and 11 unidentified targets. The variable stars include one active M-dwarf with a series of Balmer emission lines, seven Horizontal Branch stars containing six RR Lyrae stars matching with SIMBAD, and one giant, one AGB star and two RR Lyrae candidates by different color selections. All these variable stars mainly locate near the main sequence in the g–r $g\mbox{--}r$ vs. u–g $u\mbox{--}g$ diagram. The quasars are well distinguished from stars by both u–g $u\mbox{--}g$ color and variation in u-band.
