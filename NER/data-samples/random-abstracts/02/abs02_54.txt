Abstract With the introduction of simultaneous PET/MRI scanners, concurrent acquisition of PET and MRI data is feasible, allowing for improved patient convenience and decreased radiation dose. Although PET/MRI has been used in many settings, not all cancers benefit from the combined modality. With the availability of somatostatin receptor-targeted PET tracers such as 68Ga-DOTA-TOC and 68Ga-DOTA-TATE, imaging of NET patients has refocused on targeted imaging, particularly with the development of peptide receptor radiotherapy. Nonetheless, there are many patients who continue to benefit from dedicated MR imaging, such as those with liver-predominant disease. In these patients, SSR PET/MRI is an important option for optimal imaging. Both diffusion-weighted imaging and hepatobiliary phase imaging provide improved lesion detection compared to conventional MRI and CT, and the results can effect therapeutic decisions. Additionally, the use of motion correction techniques can be used to leverage the additional PET data acquired in dedicated liver PET/MRI to remove respiratory artifacts.
