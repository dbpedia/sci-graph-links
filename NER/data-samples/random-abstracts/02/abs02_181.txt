Abstract Plasma screening effects on S-wave resonance states of two-electron systems, starting from $$\hbox {Be}^{2+}$$ Be2+ to $$\hbox {Ne}^{8+}$$ Ne8+ , are investigated in a quantum plasma medium using highly correlated Hylleraas-type wave functions in the framework of the stabilization method. Resonance parameters (resonance position and width) for the $$2s^{2} \,\,^{1}\hbox {S}^{\mathrm{e}}$$ 2s21Se and $$2p^{2} \,\,^{1}\hbox {S}^{\mathrm{e}}$$ 2p21Se states along with the ground state energies are reported for the first time as functions of screening parameter. The $$2p^{2} \,\,^{1}\hbox {S}^{\mathrm{e}}$$ 2p21Se resonance parameters for He and $$\hbox {Li}^{+}$$ Li+ embedded in quantum plasma environments are also reported.
