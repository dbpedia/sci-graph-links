Abstract. Using the Pekar variational method, the effects of the temperature, impurity and electromagnetic fields on the transition are investigated through the eigenenergies of the ground and first-excited states of the polaron in a triangular potential quantum dot. Those parameters are essential for the transition of the polaron from the ground state to the first-excited state. This quantum system in nanostructure can be employed as a two-level quantum qubit. The numerical result shows the weak evolution of the probability density with the electron-phonon coupling constant, the cyclotron frequency and the Coulombic potential. It is also noted that this probability increased with the confinement length and electric-field strength. The tunneling of temperature leads to the amplification of the probability density.
