Abstract Curved mating surfaces that exist in complex engine parts such as turbine blades play a critical role in part fitting and assembly and, thus, system performance. Control of precise surface metrology (e.g., form error, surface roughness) during machining of such surfaces is highly challenging, especially when processing super alloys like hardened steels. This work aims to experimentally investigate surface metrology of a 12.70-mm-thick curved plate platform (with S-shaped sidewall) of AISI SS304 material during milling on a vertical three-axis milling machine with three different tool path strategies: ramp, contour, and peripheral. Experiments are performed to study surface location error (SLE) and roughness during upward and downward feeding of tool on both concave and convex sidewall surfaces at different spindle speed and feed combinations. SLE values that are estimated as undercut or overcut with respect to the desired surface are found to be minimum with ramp (15.05 μm), followed by contour (18.63 μm), and maximum with peripheral (24.12 μm) milling paths. However, peripheral milling may be preferable in terms of surface roughness (improved about 40 %) and overall machining time (six times faster than ramp milling). The findings are analyzed based on the associated cutting mechanics and cutting forces.
