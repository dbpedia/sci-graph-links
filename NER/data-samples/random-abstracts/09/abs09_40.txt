Abstract Airlinesâ€™ expensive resources, especially aircraft, are to be optimally scheduled to cover flights of timetables. However, the irregular flight, due to bad weather, mechanical fault and so on, is inevitable. Moreover, flight delays become more severe with the rapid development of the air transport industry in China and have huge irregular flight cost. In order to alleviate flight delays impact on the flight plan, we present a double objective multi-commodity network flow model of flight delay propagation-based aircraft scheduling and minimize the total delay propagation and airline operation cost as the optimization objective. Branch-and-price solution and column generation algorithm are used to solve the problem. Computational results obtained by using data from a major domestic airline show that our approach can reduce delay propagation significantly, thus improving on-time performance and robustness of aircraft scheduling, and decreasing the total cost simultaneously.
