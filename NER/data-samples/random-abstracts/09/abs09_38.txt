Abstract Mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCM) with a uniform size distribution (1–2 μm in diameter) were replicated from mesoporous silica microspheres (MSM) by using sucrose as a carbon source. MCM (BET surface area=1,001 m2/g, total pore volume=0.82 cc/g, average pore size=3.4 nm) was used as the support of MnO x nanocrystals (Mn3O4 with MnO as a minor phase). The MnO x /MCM composite was prepared by pore-filling wet-impregnation of Mn nitrate solution followed by a moderate annealing under Ar flow. Thus obtained MnO x /MCM composite was characterized as a high capacity anode for lithium ion battery (LIB). The electrochemical responses of MnO x /MCM were investigated in comparison with those of commercial graphite. The MnO x /MCM composite exhibited the reversible capacity of ∼720 mAh g−1 at the current density of 200 mA g−1 with an excellent cycling stability up to 100 cycles. The MnO x /MCM composite also showed much higher volumetric capacity and better rate capability than the state of the art graphite anode, suggesting its potential use as a new anode material for LIBs.
