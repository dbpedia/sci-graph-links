Abstract For the polymerization of dimethacrylates, thermodynamic properties related to effect of the formed network polymer on the reaction between pendant methacrylate groups and free radicals have been studied. The polymer matrix creates steric hindrances for this reaction and impedes the shrinkage process accompanying the opening of ะก=ะก bonds. As a result, internal stresses develop in the polymer, the heat of polymerization of methacrylate groups decreases compared with the polymerization of methyl methacrylate, and the full conversion of double bonds is prevented. The relaxation of internal stresses and of excess free volume leads to the spontaneous cracking of network polymers and causes formation of regular adhesive-shrinkage patterns. The process of superslow relaxation of internal stresses in polymer films has been ascertained, and the mechanochemical model of this process has been advanced. The effect of internal stresses on the physicomechanical properties of polydimethacrylates has been discussed.
