Abstract We report a new composition of optical fiber containing ZrO2 to get better solubility of Er and Er/Yb for efficient high power optical amplifier. Performance of the doped fibers composed of zirconia–yttria–alumina–silica glass–ceramic host is studied for multi-wavelength-channel amplification in C-band region with core as well as cladding pumped configuration. The cross-section of the fibers is made almost hexagonal and coated with low index polymer acrylate resin. Maximum output power of 0.5 W is achieved at 1572 nm when I/P signal is maintained in the range +6 to 9 dBm at pump power of 4 W. This type of glass composition doped with Er shows 30 % pump conversion efficiency, however, there is a scope for improvement.
