We present a direct-write patterning method for the realization of electroluminescent (EL) line art using a surface-emissive light-emitting electrochemical cell with its electrolyte and EL material separated into a bilayer structure. The line-art emission is achieved through subtractive patterning of the electrolyte layer with a stylus, and the single-step patterning can be either manual for personalization and uniqueness or automated for high throughput and repeatability. We demonstrate that the light emission is effectuated by cation-assisted electron injection in the patterned regions and that the resulting emissive lines can be as narrow as a few micrometers. The versatility of the method is demonstrated through the attainment of a wide range of light-emission patterns and colors using a variety of different materials. We propose that this low-voltage-driven and easy-to-modify luminescent line-art technology could be of interest for emerging applications, such as active packaging and personalized gadgets.
