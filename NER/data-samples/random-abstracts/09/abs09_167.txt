Abstract The structural and optical properties of a metamorphic GaAsSb bulk layer grown on a GaAs substrate are studied. As the excitation power density (at a wavelength of 0.65 μm) reaches 9 kW cm−2 at liquid-nitrogen temperature and 230 kW cm−2 at room temperature, a superluminescence signal is observed at wave-lengths of 0.943 and 0.992 μm, respectively.
