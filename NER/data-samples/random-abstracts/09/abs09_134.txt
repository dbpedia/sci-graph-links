Abstract The spatial variability of precipitation was investigated in the northwestern corner of Iran using data collected at 24 synoptic stations from 1986 to 2015. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used to regionalize precipitation in the study area. Eleven precipitation variables were averaged and arranged as an input matrix for the R-mode PCA to identify the precipitation patterns. Results suggest that the study area can be divided into four spatially homogeneous sub-zones. In addition, the spatial patterns of annual precipitation were identified by applying the T-mode PCA and CA to the annual precipitation data. The delineated spatial patterns revealed three distinct sub-regions. The resultant maps were compared with the spatial distribution of the rotated principal components (PCs). Results pointed out that the delineated clusters are characterized by different precipitation variability; and using different precipitation parameters can lead to different spatial patterns of precipitation over northwest Iran.
