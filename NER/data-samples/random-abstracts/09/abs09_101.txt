We study the influence of the furnace and electric-contact heating, the temperature of austenitization, and the sand-blasting treatment on the structure, decarburization, strength, and durability of 60S2 and 65G steels. It is shown that, with the help of electric-contact heating, it is possible to minimize the decarburization of the subsurface layers of steels and make their fatigue strength 1.2–1.4 times higher. At the same time, after sand blasting, it becomes 1.5–2 times higher. It is shown that, after the corresponding modes of thermal and sand-blasting treatment, the strength and durability of 65G steel are higher than for 60S2 steel in the case where their hardnesses are identical. Therefore, this steel can be regarded as an alternative material for manufacturing of highly loaded elastic elements.
