The field of stretchable electronics has recently gained significant interest from the academic community, with a focus on producing materials that demonstrate reliable electrical performance with improved response to mechanical deformation. This review highlights the recent progress in understanding the relationships between the mechanical behavior and electrical performance of such devices. Potential solutions can take the form of intrinsically elastic polymers, polymer semiconductor/elastomer blends and alternative engineering-oriented approaches, which are discussed herein. Trends and design strategies are beginning to manifest in this early stage of the stretchable electronics field. The development of stretchable electrical systems can provide unique applications of organic electronics.
