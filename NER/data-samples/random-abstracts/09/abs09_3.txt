Abstract Using the methods of biosensor and proteomic analysis isatin-binding activity of liver proteins has been investigated in mice from the control and flight groups. Isatin-binding activity was higher in mice of the flight group. The content of certain individual isatin-binding proteins in the samples of the flight groups insignificantly differed from the ground control. However, in samples from animals exposed to weekly postflight adaptation, the level of certain proteins was significantly increased. The latter suggests that the main events in the proteome of mice (at least in subproteome of isatin-binding proteins) occur in the early postflight period.
