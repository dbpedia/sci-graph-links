Abstract Adobe and soil samples from Fort Fillmore (1851–1862), New Mexico, were subjected to various laboratory tests in order to evaluate the nature of adobe decay. Samples were collected from the Officers’ Quarters and the Enlisted Men’s Barracks, so that adobe quality at these two distinctive areas—once housing two distinctive groups of soldiers—could be estimated. Test results provided measures of various agents and processes of adobe decay, such as structural failure or chemical and water activities, and suggested that most of the adobe decay at Fort Fillmore has been due to imperfections in the manufacturing process. Adobe for the Officers’ Quarters was better made than adobe for the barracks. Some tentative explanations for this difference in quality are discussed, including the possibility that it was the result of a symbolic expression of status distinctions.
