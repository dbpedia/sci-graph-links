Abstract The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of urban solid waste leachate on the mechanical properties of soil. To provide a more accurate identification of the contaminated soils, cylindrical specimens of the soil, according to the density curves with different initial conditions (different initial contamination levels) were prepared, then the soil specimens were loaded at different load levels using a direct shear testing equipment and a universal testing machine to apply axial compression on the specimens. Results for the stressâ€“strain and failure behavior of the soil specimens containing different percentages of the solid waste leachate were evaluated. The most important result was reducing the mechanical properties of the soil contaminated with different percentages of solid waste. The addition of lower quantities of leachate gave far more significant results compared to the addition of higher amounts of leachate.
