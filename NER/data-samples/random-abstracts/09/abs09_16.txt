Abstract The full-scale measurements of initial stresses and numerical modeling of stresses in rock mass enclosing deep open pit mine Zhelezny under planning at Kovdor Mining-and-Processing Integrated Work are presented in the article. The authors have located hazardous areas in pit wall rock mass and validated stability conditions for pit walls with steeply sloped benches.
