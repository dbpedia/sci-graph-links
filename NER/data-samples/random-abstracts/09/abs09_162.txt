Abstract The gains from lead time reduction are obtained by the continuous improvement of programmes in shop floor variables, like repair time, setup time, mean time to failure and so on. In this paper, we focused on repair time and to improve that a production manager must choose the best option to invest the limited financial resources. Specifically, the objective of this paper is to study the effects on overall lead time when repair lead time is reduced through improvement in one of three strategies: repair time mean, repair time variability or eliminating the worst cases repair times. We conducted a simulation to compare the three strategies to determine the best one regarding lead time reduction. Our results indicate that for simple tasks when variability is low, the mean strategy is best. When the variability is moderate, we suggest the worst case strategy, which usually has a lower cost and exhibits a similar effect on lead time as the mean and variability strategies. When variability is high, as expected, the variability strategy is best. In addition, for complex tasks, the mean strategy is always the best option. However, for situations in which it is not possible to improve the mean, the worst case strategy is an excellent alternative in a manufacturing environment with low variability. In the presence of moderate and high variability, we suggest the variability improvement strategy as the best alternative to mean strategy.
