Abstract. I suggest that a new state (Phys. Rev. C 90, 024309 (2014)) observed in 12Be, with a neutron decay energy of 1243keV, is likely to be $ 2^{+}$, rather than the previously suggested ($ 2^{-}$, ( $ 1^{-}$)). Primary p-wave decay is then to the first excited state of 11Be, but a possible d-wave g.s. branch could be as large as about 10%.
