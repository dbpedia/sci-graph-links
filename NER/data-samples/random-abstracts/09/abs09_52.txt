Abstract The adsorption of ethyl acetate, a volatile organic compound, on activated carbons, synthesized from various precursors based on by-products and waste materials—polymer, biomass, coal tar pitch—was studied. The activated carbons were prepared by thermochemical treatment of the precursors, carbonization, and subsequent activation with water vapor. Surface and textural properties of obtained carbon adsorbents were characterized by low-temperature N2 adsorption, Boehm’s method, etc. The activated carbons are distinguished by relatively high surface area and developed pore structure. The adsorption investigations were performed with water solutions of ethyl acetate, and the obtained results fit well the Langmuir model, as well as the Freundlich model. All activated carbons demonstrated considerably high adsorption capacity in the range 160–450 mg/g. The obtained data indicate that the adsorption ability of activated carbon toward ethyl acetate depends on the surface area, and it increases with increasing the content of mesopores, where ethyl acetate molecules are preferably adsorbed.
