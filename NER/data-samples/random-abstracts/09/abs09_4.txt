Abstract The shale gas experiences many different spatial scales during its flow in the reservoir, which will engender different flow mechanisms. In order to accurately simulate the production performance of shale gas well, it is essential to establish a multi-continuum model for shale gas reservoir. Based on the geometrical scenario of multistage horizontal well fracturing, this paper builds up a triple-continuum model incorporating three systems: matrix with extremely low permeability, less permeable natural fractures and highly permeable hydraulic fractures. This numerical model employs Langmuir adsorption equation to present the influence of desorption gas in matrix and considers the Klinkenberg effect in matrix and natural fractures by adjusting the apparent permeability. The solution of this model is achieved using implicit scheme. Eventually, this model is applied on the single well production situation in a synthetic reservoir, production decline curves and cumulative production curves are obtained, then the sensitivity analysis is made on various kinds of parameters; thus, the influences of these parameters on production rate are obtained: The gas rate will rise with the increase in hydraulic fracture half-length, meshing size, Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure, but with the decrease in hydraulic fracture spacing.
