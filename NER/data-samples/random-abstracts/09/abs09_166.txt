Abstract The bracket-type connection is often used for the weak-axis steel connection of H-shaped beam-to-column. However it lead to weakness of competitiveness in steel structure due to difficulty in production and installation of connection. Consequently, new shaped weak-axis connection was developed. It has a simple shape with less spot of welding points, and has advantage about showing the obvious power flow in connection points. In this study, monotonic and cyclic loading tests in full-scale were performed to evaluate structural behavior and examine on-site application. Therefore, 12 specimens (9 specimens for monotonic loading test and 3 specimens for cyclic loading test) were manufactured for the variables which are overlap length of beam end and column flange. As the results, new shaped weak-axis connection is appeared Special Moment Frame (SMF) and have excellent structural performance and workability when the parameter is over 50 mm.
