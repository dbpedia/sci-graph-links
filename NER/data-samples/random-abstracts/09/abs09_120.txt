Abstract This paper describes the rotation effects on the wave reflection in a pyroelectric half-plane using an inhomogeneous wave approach. The rotation in the governing pyroelectric equation is characterized by considering the Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations. A scenario is modeled where a quasi-transverse wave is incident on the free boundary surface, resulting in reflected waves like temperature wave, quasi-transverse wave, quasi-longitudinal wave, and surface wave. Rotationâ€™s effects on the reflection angle, velocity, attenuation, and energy coefficients of the reflected wave are presented.
