Abstract In this paper, we consider the dynamics of the space vehicle motion at interaction with soil surface in the case of landing gear failure. The time dependences are obtained for the landing parameters such as overloads, linear velocity of the center of mass, angular velocity of the vehicle, and clearance. The criticality degree in the case of failure is evaluated.
