Abstract Failure analysis of wear block used in the crush deck of a Sinter Plant was carried out. Crush deck acts as a platform to transfer the hot sinter cake from sinter machine to crushing unit. Hot sinter cake with a temperature around 800 °C falls on the crush deck from the discharging end of rotating sinter machine. This investigation consists of visual observation, chemical analysis, characterization of microstructures, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and measurement of hardness. Analysis revealed that this is an iron-based material with Cr–Ni alloying with higher hardness and lower toughness, which was due to improper microstructure. Microstructure revealed a large number of primary carbides along with needle-shaped carbides, which drastically reduce the toughness of the material. Application point of view the wear block should have optimum combination of toughness and wear resistance at elevated temperature; however, analyses showed the actual wear block had with higher wear resistance and lower toughness. This was reflected in the undesirable microstructure observed during metallographic study. It was thus concluded that the component failed before a proper life cycle was achieved due to poor material properties. Based on the failure analysis suitable heat treatment process was recommended. Metallurgical study carried out on the suggested material, showed significant improvements in material property. Trial of recommended wear block was taken at the plant level and life of the recommended material improved twice than that of previous one.
