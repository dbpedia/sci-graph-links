Abstract We address a finite-plasticity model based on the symmetric tensor $$\varvec{P}^\top \! \varvec{P}$$ P⊤P instead of the classical plastic strain $$\varvec{P}$$ P . Such a structure arises by assuming that the material behavior is invariant with respect to frame transformations of the intermediate configuration. The resulting variational model is lower dimensional, symmetric and based solely on the reference configuration. We discuss the existence of energetic solutions at the material-point level as well as the convergence of time discretizations. The linearization of the model for small deformations is ascertained via a rigorous evolution-$$\Gamma $$ Γ -convergence argument. The constitutive model is combined with the equilibrium system in Part II where we prove the existence of quasistatic evolutions and ascertain the linearization limit (Grandi and Stefanelli in 2016).
