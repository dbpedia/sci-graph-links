Abstract Cavity corner is one of the most common machining features in the complex structural components of aircraft, and processing pocket corner by plunge milling has the advantages of higher metal removal rate, smaller machining distortion, and higher machining precision, and especially is suitable for cavity corner machining with large depth. However, there are some problems in current corner plunge milling approach, such as sidewall over-cut, invalid tool location points, and uncontrollable residual height. Therefore, a universal layering algorithm for plunge milling tool path generation is projected and established. First, define and represent two-dimensional corner model. Next, the terminologies about machining layer circle, cutter circle, and cuspidal point circle are introduced and layering model is built. Then, construct cutter circle arrangement program on the basis of the intersection between layer circle and corner model. Meanwhile, the relationship between residual height and layering model is determined. Finally, the layering tool path is recursively generated in line with radial cutting width. Two groups of contrast experiments prove effectively that the proposed method excels the conventional methods in guaranteeing residual height and avoiding invalid tool location points. In addition, the layering method can maintain an efficient processing tool path ratio of more than 80%. Furthermore, the application of a CAD solid model of an aircraft panel demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the layering approach.
