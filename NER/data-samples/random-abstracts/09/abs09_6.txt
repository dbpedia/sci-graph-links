Abstract Several real life reinforced soil structures such as traffic supporting embankments and pavements are subjected to cyclic loads. The behaviour of soil-reinforcement interface under cyclic load is different from that under monotonic load. In the investigation reported herein, cyclic pullout tests were conducted on geogrid embedded in sand. A load controlled pullout test apparatus complying with the dimensions suggested by ASTM D-6706-01 was designed and fabricated in-house. Modular units for applying both cyclic and monotonic load were also designed and fabricated. Cyclic load was applied through a pneumatic double acting air cylinder. In addition, the setup consisted of a signal generator and a filter lubricator regulator volume booster. The effect of normal stress and cyclic load on the pullout behaviour was studied. It was found that cyclic loads of a lower magnitude than the monotonic capacity could cause failure. In the case of cyclic loads of small magnitude, the displacements showed tendency to stabilize. In the case of higher magnitudes of cyclic loads, the displacements progressively increased to failure. An initial stiffness was noticed in the system due to the initial densification achieved near the interface due to the dynamic nature of the cyclic pullout forces. Normal load as well as cyclic load played important roles in the number of cycles to cause failure. Post-cyclic monotonic tests showed the effect of degradation of the soil-geosynthetic interface after subjecting the same to certain number of load cycles.
