Abstract Deepwater offshore structures such as semi-submersible platforms suffer powerful ocean waves due to their location and site condition. The long distance away from the shore also brings many difficulties to energy supply for the platform operation. How to reduce the response of the platform and convert the wave energy into electrical power is a meaningful topic. In this paper, a tuned heave plate system (THP) is presented and designed to be employed on a semi-submersible platform for heave motion suppression and energy harvesting. This THP system is composed of spring supports, a power take-off system (PTO), and a heave plate. The PTO system is a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG), which could directly convert the kinetic energy of the heave plate into electronic power. The stiffness of the spring supports is designed based on the principle of the tuned mass damper (TMD). The numerical model of the platform and the THP system is established according to the hydrodynamic analysis results of the platform. The model is tested and modified by scale model tests on the platform in the wave tank. A parameter study, including the size, tuned period, and damping ratio of the THP system, is conducted systematically based on the numerical model. The optimal parameters of the THP are selected due to the maximum heave motion reduction under severe wave conditions in South China Sea. The performance of the semi-submersible with and without the THP system under different wave conditions is analyzed. It is demonstrated that this novel tuned heave plate system could reduce the heave motion of the semi-submersible platform significantly and generate considerable power, which makes the THP system have a broad prospect for development.
