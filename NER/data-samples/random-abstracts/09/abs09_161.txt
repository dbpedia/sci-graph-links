Abstract Methods of determining the total deformation modulus of frozen ground are analyzed. Published data and the results of more than 800 compression tests, conducted by the authors in the course of engineering research in different regions of the cryolithozone of Russia, are colligated. It is shown that GOST 25100-2011 and SP 25.13330.2012 specifications are inconsistent and there is no justification for subdividing frozen fine-disperse soils into plasto- and solid-frozen. Soils are given for including in the revised SP 'Foundation beds and foundations on permafrost' the requirement that foundation beds on frozen fine-disperse soils be reckoned in terms of both groups of limiting states â€” deformations and carrying capacity. Suggestions are given for determining the deformation modulus by means of compression tests.
