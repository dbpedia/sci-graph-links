Abstract BackgroundResistant ovary syndrome (ROS) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Infertility is a common complaint of woman presenting with ROS, and little progress has been made in term of reproduction with the patient’s own gamete. So far only one case report of live birth has been reported after in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes in a patient suffering from ROS in 2013. Case presentationA secondary infertile woman of 33 years-old was manifested with oligomenorrhea and markedly increased gonadotropin levels around postmenopausal range, but had normal antral follicle count, normal serum inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone levels. She had normal karyotype of 46,XX and normal thyroid function. There were no abnormal findings in some autoantibody assays and FSH receptor sequencing. After oral contraceptive pills combined with triptorelin depot were administered, her gonadotropin levels reduced but it showed no response to high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (hp-HMG 300IU/d for 15 days). Then endometrium was prepared with estradiol valerate and IVM from small antral follicles were performed. Five immature oocytes were retrieved. Twenty-four hours after IVM culture, 3 oocytes matured to metaphase II stage and were inseminated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection using her husband’s sperm. Two top-quality embryos were transferred and one embryo was cryopreserved. The patient got pregnant and delivered a healthy boy at term. ConclusionIVM using their own oocytes could be an available treatment for infertile women with ROS.
