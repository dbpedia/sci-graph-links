Abstract Nyctanthes arbor-tristis (L.) popularly known as ‘Parijat’ belongs to the family Oleaceae and is widely used in the traditional system of medicines in India. It has immense biological properties. In the present study, the shade-dried flowers were extracted in three different solvents such as ethanol, ethyl acetate, and water. The antioxidant activities were evaluated by four different in vitro assays—DPPH free radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation, and reducing power determination. Phytoconstituents like total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extracts were also measured. The maximum antioxidant activity was observed in ethanolic extract of the flower. The higher phenolic content was found in aqueous extract (177.0 ± 0.17 µg mg−1 gallic acid equivalent). Flavonoid content was higher in ethanolic extract 29.25 ± 0.13 µg mg−1 equivalent to rutin) of flower than the other two extracts. This indicates that both phenolic and flavonoid contents might be responsible for the antioxidant potential of the flower. Ethanolic extract of the flower was found most potent in antioxidant activity in all assays. Thus, the ethanolic extract of the flower can be used as a cheap natural source of antioxidants.
