Embryonic implantation comprises a dynamic and complicated series of events, which takes place only when the maternal uterine endometrium is in a receptive state. Blastocysts reaching the uterus communicate with the uterine endometrium to implant within a narrow time window. Interplay among various signalling molecules and transcription factors under the control of ovarian hormones is necessary for successful establishment of pregnancy. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow embryonic implantation in the receptive endometrium are still largely unknown. Here, we show that Sry-related HMG box gene-17 (Sox17) heterozygous mutant female mice exhibit subfertility due to implantation failure. Sox17 was expressed in the oviduct, uterine luminal epithelium, and blood vessels. Sox17 heterozygosity caused no appreciable defects in ovulation, fertilisation, blastocyst formation, and gross morphology of the oviduct and uterus. Another group F Sox transcription factor, Sox7, was also expressed in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium relatively weakly. Despite uterine Sox7 expression, a significant reduction in the number of implantation sites was observed in Sox17 heterozygous mutant females due to haploinsufficiency. Our findings revealed a novel role of Sox17 in uterine receptivity to embryo implantation.
