Abstract Shuni virus (SHUV) was recently identified in Israel in several brains of ovine, bovine, and goat fetuses and newborn animals with congenital arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome. In the present study, the sequences of several Israeli SHUV strains were analyzed in detail; based on the small genome segment which encodes the nucleocapsid protein and the small nonstructural protein (NSs), a very high similarity of 99–100 % among each other was found. In contrast to the highly conserved N protein, several mutations were found within the NSs-coding sequence of SHUVs present in brain samples of malformed fetuses, resulting in a considerably frequent appearance of stop codons. Interferon alpha/beta production was demonstrated in an in-vitro interferon bioassay; hence, the virus isolated from the brain of a malformed sheep fetus acquired mutations, resulting in the loss of its NSs protein function.
