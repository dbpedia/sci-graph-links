Abstract Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of mortality. Many times healthcare professionals tend to segregate patient populations in different kind of risks: low, intermediate and high depending on standard clinical variables such as age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking and diabetes. Normally one of the most used factors for risk stratification is low density lipoprotein (LDL) as well as Framingham risk score (FRS). On the other hand, using a powerful discriminator as Coronary artery calcium (CAC) itâ€™s possible to separate patients included in a database better than using LDL. The aim of this work was to study the association between clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and the earlier discriminators of cardiovascular disease.
