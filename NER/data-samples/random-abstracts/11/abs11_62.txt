Abstract Emergence and worldwide spreading of resistant bacteria to antibiotic have raised the importance for finding therapeutic alternative to compensate antibiotic drawbacks. Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication involved in the development of various common bacterial behaviors including virulence factors expression, and targeting QS seems to be relevant to the struggle against bacterial infection. In this report, relevant literature on intrication of QS system and antimicrobial sensitivity mechanisms in P. aeruginosa PAO1 are reviewed.
