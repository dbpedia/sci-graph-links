Abstract Campomanesia xanthocarpa (Myrtaceae) is used in Brazilian traditional medicine against fever, diabetes, hypercholesteremic, obesity, and urinary diseases. In the present study, the compounds 2′,6′-dihydroxy-3′-methyl-4′-metoxychalcone and 2′,4′-dihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethyl-6′-methoxychalcone were identified for the first time in leaves of the C. xanthocarpa. These compounds and the hydroethanolic extract (HECX) significantly inhibited paw edema and reduced both leukocyte migration and the leakage of protein into the pleural cavity. No toxicity was detected by HECX in an acute toxicity test.
