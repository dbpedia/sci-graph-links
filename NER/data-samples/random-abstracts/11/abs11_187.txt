Abstract ObjectiveTo observe the clinical effects of tuina manipulations plus the functional training on scapulohumeral periarthritis (SP), and provide the better therapeutic plan for SP patients. MethodsA total of 76 cases with SP in conformity with the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into a tuina group and an acupuncture group, 38 patients in each group. All the patients were instructed to do functional training under the guidance of the professional medical practitioners. The patients in the tuina group were treated additionally with tuina manipulations, while the patients in the acupuncture group were added with acupuncture treatment. The two groups were treated once every day. After ten sessions, the changes in the scores of visual analog scale (VAS) and Melle were observed, and the clinical effect was compared. ResultsAfter the treatment, VAS and Melle scores were all lower in the tuina group than those in the acupuncture group, with statistical significances between the two groups (P<0.05). The remarkable effective rate was 5.3% in the acupuncture group and 21.1% in the tuina group. The remarkable effective rate was higher in the tuina group than that in the acupuncture group, with a statistical significance (P<0.05). ConclusionTuina manipulations plus functional training for SP can effectively alleviate pain and restore the functions of the shoulder joint, with a better effect than acupuncture plus functional training.
