Objective:To assess the association between gestational age versus corrected age at the time of hip ultrasound with findings for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in preterm breech infants.Study Design:A retrospective medical chart review was conducted to examine hip ultrasounds of 318 premature breech infants for findings associated with DDH.Results:Positive findings for DDH occurred in 3/135 (2%) of infants <32 weeks gestational age and 17/183 (9%) of infants 32 to <37 weeks gestational age (odds ratio: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.79, P<0.015). No infants born <32 weeks gestational age had abnormal findings for DDH upon follow-up ultrasound. Infants <40 weeks corrected age at the time of hip ultrasound were more likely to have DDH findings compared with infants â©¾44 weeks corrected age (odds ratio: 7.83, 95% CI: 2.20 to 29.65, P<0.001).Conclusion:Current hip ultrasonography policies that include screening of premature breech infants may need to be revised.
