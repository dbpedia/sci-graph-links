Abstract Anther culture is one of the most widely used methods to induce gametic embryogenesis. The aim of this investigation was to induce microspore embryogenesis in almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.), through this technique. Anthers were cultured at the vacuolated developmental stage, and seven cultivars, two culture media and two temperature treatments were assessed. Although evidence of the microspore induction was observed in all the genotypes and treatments tested (symmetrical nucleus division and multinucleated structures), calli were produced merely by anthers cultured in the medium P and the regeneration of embryos was detected only in anthers of the cultivars Filippo Ceo, Lauranne and Genco, placed on medium P and subjected to the Control treatment (direct culture at 25 ± 1 °C, without the hot thermal shock at 35 ± 1 °C for 7 days). Characterization by SSR marker analysis of the embryo genotypes revealed that the regenerants had a single allele for each locus whereas the parent cultivar was heterozygous, indicating their development from haploid microspores. This study reports the evidence of gametic embryogenesis and, particularly, of microspore embryogenesis through in vitro anther culture, in almond, and, for the first time to our knowledge, the production of homozygous embryos.
