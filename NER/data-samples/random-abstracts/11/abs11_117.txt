Abstract We describe a case of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) that may have occurred following drug-induced liver injury with camostat mesilate and/or benzbromarone in an elderly patient. The patientâ€™s liver biopsy showed chronic active hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Stopping the use of these drugs did not lead to complete remission, but the use of a low dose of corticosteroids completely cured his liver dysfunction. In the present case, liver dysfunction was caused by an autoimmune mechanism. Special attention should be paid to idiopathic AIH and drug-induced AIH in elderly patients.
