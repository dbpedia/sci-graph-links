Abstract In the late 1970s, calcitriol was introduced into clinical practice for the management of secondary renal hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since then, the use of calcifediol or other native forms of vitamin D was largely ignored until the publication of the 2009 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations. The guidelines suggested that measurement of circulating levels of 25(OH)D (calcifediol) and its supplementation were to be performed on the same basis as for the general population. This indication was based on the fact that the precursors of active vitamin D had provided to CKD patients considerable benefits in survival, mainly due to their pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. However, despite the long-term use of various classes of vitamin D in CKD, a clear definition is still lacking concerning the most appropriate time for initiation of therapy, the best compound to prescribe (active metabolites or analogs), the proper dosage, and the most suitable duration of therapy. The aim of this position statement is to provide and critically appraise the current plentiful evidence on vitamin D in different clinical settings related to CKD, particularly focusing on outcomes, monitoring and treatment-associated risks. However, it should be taken in account that position statements are meant to provide guidance; therefore, they are not to be considered prescriptive for all patients and, importantly, they cannot replace the judgment of clinicians.
