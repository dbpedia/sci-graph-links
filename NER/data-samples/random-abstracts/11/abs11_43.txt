Abstract AimsThis study aimed to clarify trends in clinical performance in diabetic patients over a 12-year period in primary care clinics and hospitals in Japan. Materials and methodsThe Shiga Diabetes Clinical Survey records medical performance in diabetic patients in primary care clinics and hospitals in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. In this study, laboratory data, modality of treatment for diabetes, and status of examination for diabetic complications were examined using results of surveys in 2000, 2006, and 2012. The study included 17,870, 18,398, and 24,219 patients for those years, respectively. ResultsMean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level significantly improved over 12 years and was significantly lower in the primary care clinics group than the hospitals group (7.3 ± 1.5 vs. 7.4 ± 1.4 % in 2000, 7.2 ± 1.2 vs. 7.4 ± 1.3 % in 2006, and 6.9 ± 1.0 vs. 7.1 ± 1.1 % in 2012). With regard to diabetic treatment modality, patients treated in hospitals used insulin more frequently than those in primary care clinics. The proportion of patients examined for diabetic complications increased but did not reach 50 % in 2012. Mean blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lowered, but blood pressure control was worse than that of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. ConclusionsThis study shows that glycemic control in both primary care clinics and hospitals has improved and was almost acceptable. However, examinations for diabetic complications and the control of blood pressure were still insufficient.
