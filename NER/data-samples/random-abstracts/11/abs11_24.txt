Abstract Ovulatory dysfunction refers to absent ovulation or luteal insufficiency. It is commonly seen in women with irregular menstruation or menstrual cycles, especially in those with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Ovulatory dysfunction is considered the single-most frequent cause of female infertility. Clinically, the two major causes of ovulatory dysfunction are polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS). Acupuncture-moxibustion improves ovulation and helps with infertility. Through a systematic review and analysis on relevant literatures in Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture-moxibustion Databank over the last decade, this paper summarized the characteristics and pattern of acupuncture-moxibustion points for improving ovulation in order to provide an optimal acupuncture-moxibustion protocol in this regard.
