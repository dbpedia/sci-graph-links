Summary Background.For critical ill patients, the use of a blood gas analyzer (BGA) rather than central laboratory instruments (CL) for biochemical and hematological parameters is common due to more convenient monitoring. Potential significant differences between the methods could be misleading. This study aimed to confirm the agreement between the BGA and CL results and to analyze the effects of inter-methods bias on medical decisions. Methods.Blood samples from arterial lines were collected in the Cardio Surgical Intensive Care Unit simultaneously for gas analyses (RapidPoint 500, Siemens, Erlangen, Germania) and CL ( D×C $D{\times}C$ 880i and D×H $D{\times} H$ 800 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) determinations. Methods were compared using Passing-Bablok (PB) regression and Bland Altman analysis. Positive and negative false results of the BGA tests were calculated considering the reference CL tests at critical values for glucose (70, 150 and 180 mg/dL), hemoglobin (7 and 10 g/dL), potassium (3.5–5 mEq/L), sodium (135–145 mEq/L) and lactate (6.5–19.3 mg/dL). Results.PB regression did not show a significant deviation from linearity for all of the parameters; proportional and constant differences were observed for hemoglobin, potassium, and lactate. Intercept and slope of sodium and glucose regression line were significantly different from zero and one respectively. Only the potassium, lactate, and glucose bias estimations were acceptable. However, for hemoglobin it was possible to significantly lower negative false results using PB transformed data. Conclusions.Only the glucose, potassium and lactate results, using both methods, were interchangeable; however the hemoglobin adjustment of BGA values based on PB regression might represent a safer solution.
