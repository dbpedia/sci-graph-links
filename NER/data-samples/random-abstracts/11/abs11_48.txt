Abstract Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy otherwise known as viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is a neuropathological condition affecting more than 50 fish species worldwide, mostly marine. Different PCR protocols with specific primers were reported from many countries for confirmation of VNN in fishes. In the present study, two pairs of primers were designed and evaluated for the diagnosis of clinical and subclinical cases of infections from field. These primers designated as BARL-F1/BARL-R1 amplified a 902 bp product in the variable region (T4) of the coat protein gene by first step PCR. Nested PCR primers BARL-F2/BARL-R2 amplified a fragment of 313 bp. The results were comparable with other commonly used primer sets such as F2/R3 and RG668f/RG919r primers. These new primers could detect betanodavirus in standard reference samples containing low, moderate and high viral load. Known positive and negative control samples of fish also revealed a predictive value of 100 % by RT-PCR diagnosis.
