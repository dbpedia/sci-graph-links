Abstract Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone shown to be active in the treatment of type-2 diabetes (T2D) and has also been shown as efficacious in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that is expressed in numerous cells, rapidly inactivates endogenous GLP-1. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition is employed as a therapeutic avenue to increase GLP-1 levels in the management of T2D. The effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of AD has been reported in various animal models of AD. With this background, the present study was designed to examine the effectiveness of linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Nine-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were administered linagliptin orally (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. At the end of the linagliptin treatment, mice were evaluated for cognitive ability on the Morris Water Maze and Y-maze. Following cognitive evaluation, mice were sacrificed to determine the effect of the linagliptin on brain incretin levels, amyloid burden, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. We confirm that linagliptin treatment for 8 weeks mitigates the cognitive deficits present in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, linagliptin also improves brain incretin levels and attenuates amyloid beta, tau phosphorylation as well as neuroinflammation. In conclusion, linagliptin possesses neuroprotective properties that may be attributed to the improvement of incretin levels in the brain.
