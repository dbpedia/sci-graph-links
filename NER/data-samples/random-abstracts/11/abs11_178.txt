Abstract The aim of the present paper is to analyze the well-being of elderly people in institutions, particularly in relation to the use of space in the Nursing Home (NH). Little research has been done on how older people experience the environment of the NH. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 Nursing Home residents between the ages of 67 and 90. The findings indicate that the informants’ expressions of well-being belong to two main categories: “Well-being in public and private spaces” “Lack of Well-being in public and private spaces”. Two comprehensive themes were identified as relevant to a better understanding of the residents’ expressions of well-being: Emotional states, Own/Others’ behaviors and activities. From results emerged that in residents’ room, peacefulness is fundamental to relaxation and sleep; in lounge, being excluded from the group can be a source of negative feelings. Lack of well-being in the bathroom is related to feelings of incapacity and to violations of privacy. Practical implications of findings are discussed with regard to the role of health care assistants, nurses and activities co-ordinators in the promotion of residents’ well-being.
