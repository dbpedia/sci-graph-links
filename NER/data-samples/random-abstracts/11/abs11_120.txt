Abstract Determination of the mechanical strength of stones after freeze–thaw action is important for evaluating the durability of natural building stones used in cold regions. In this research, we proposed a novel physico-mechanical parameter (PMP) for estimating the mechanical strength of travertines after a freeze–thaw test, which is based on initial mechanical strength, effective porosity, and mean pore size of the stones. For this purpose, 12 samples of travertines were selected and their initial mechanical strengths (uniaxial compressive, Brazilian tensile and point load strengths), effective porosity, and mean pore size were determined. Then a freeze–thaw test was conducted up to 60 cycles on samples, and their mechanical strengths were measured. The results showed that PMP is in good accuracy for estimating the mechanical strengths of stones after a freeze–thaw test, and thus making a rapid durability assessment. As a result, the PMP avoids performing a freeze–thaw test, which is laborious and time-consuming.
