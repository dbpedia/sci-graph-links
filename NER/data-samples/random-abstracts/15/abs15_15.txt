Abstract The importance of e-commerce continues to grow in retail, providing companies with a tool to improve commercial and marketing strategies. In this context, understanding this distribution channel becomes a fundamental matter for both managers and academics. This paper examines determinants of online fashion retailing and proposes a model of the formation of online purchase intention. To this end, a total of 433 individuals were surveyed. Based on the hypothesised model developed through a detailed review of the literature on the constructs proposed, a set of measurement items was adapted to the context of this research, and a 30-item questionnaire was implemented. A regression analysis of latent variables was used based on the optimisation technique of the partial least squares. The results indicate that the key factors influencing online fashion purchase intention are perceived value, trust, and fashion innovativeness, whereas time saving and perceived security are the main antecedents predicting perceived value and trust, respectively. Electronic innovativeness was proven to not have the influence expected on online shopping, which could be explained by the fact that e-commerce is not an innovation any longer.
