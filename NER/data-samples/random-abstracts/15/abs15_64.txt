Abstract Transport has always been, and will continue to be, a means to serve to eradicate world inequalities bringing relief and salvation across the globe and no transport mode more so perhaps than aviation. However, aviation has served as both the salvation and the aggressor, having also itself been the victim of terrorist attacks. Arguably (to date) in 2016, the world could consider itself fortunate not to have witnessed a devastating cyber-terrorist attack on an aircraft. Certainly concerns were raised after the disappearance of MH370 in terms of cockpit tampering; and yet, these reports only touched upon the surface of an effervescing iceberg – set to erupt into a tsunami of devastation. The question inevitably remains ‘when’ rather than ‘if’ this will occur. This research reviews the vulnerability of air travel and the preparedness of the industry in terms of coordination (prevention and protection) from the perspective of policy, legislation (regulation) and organisation.
