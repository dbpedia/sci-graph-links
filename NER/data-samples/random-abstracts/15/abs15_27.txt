Abstract Patent thickets are sets of overlapping intellectual property rights that occur in fragmented technology markets. Their potential impacts on innovation have become an increasing concern in recent years. I estimate the direct and indirect effects of patent thickets on market value of publicly traded manufacturing firms. I find that patent thickets decrease the market value of firms, holding R&D and patenting activities of these firms constant. I also find that while firms do not change their R&D activities in response to patent thickets, they do reduce negative cost effects of patent thickets on market value through defensive patenting.
