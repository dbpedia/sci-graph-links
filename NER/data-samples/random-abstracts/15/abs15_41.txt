Abstract The implementation of lean manufacturing (LM) means a systematic approach of various management methods and practices, which may influence individualsâ€™ job content and the quality of work. However, research related to socio-technical and ergonomics (SE) factors has for a long time solely focused on regular production work to a large extent. This study aims to assess the relationship between LM and SE practices in companies undergoing a lean implementation. The proposed method comprises a combination of techniques that allow the identification of deficiencies related to the adoption of LM practices that may support SE practices implementation, indicating a prioritization of improvements opportunities to better sustain them. Further, through the establishment of the degree of criticality of LM practices, our outcomes allow to identify implementation gaps in the lean process that are highly related with the current status of socio-technical and ergonomics improvements in the company, anticipating problems and developing the practices that converge to them.
