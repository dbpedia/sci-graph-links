Abstract Geotourism could be one of the powerful tools for protecting the environment. It provides a long-term competitive edge through geomanagement. As a niche area of the global tourism industry, geotourism is growing rapidly due to the high appreciation of landscape and geological phenomena. Fostering the nature and cultural sustainability, geotourists seek geological wonders framed in a natural and cultural authenticity. Responding to the call of the Egyptian Tourism Ministry to study non-traditional patterns of tourism, this study aims to investigate the factors predicting the behavioural intention to take geotours among international tourists. The study incorporated new constructs in the theory of reasoned action to achieve its aim. Employing structural equation modelling, findings revealed that behavioural intention of taking geotours is affected by geotouristsâ€™ attributes, attitudes towards geotours, cultural heritage and subjective norms. The study introduces useful implications to policymakers and managers of tourism authorities in developing countries.
