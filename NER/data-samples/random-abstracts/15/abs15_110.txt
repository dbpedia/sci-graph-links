Abstract The personnel cost of a housekeeping department mostly has the largest percentile among the costs of personnel who do not have a direct interaction with the customers. This fact makes housekeeping personnel costs the very first component that has to be decreased. Because of this, it is an important issue to minimize housekeeping costs and make an effective housekeeping schedule for hotels especially luxury hotels. This paper proposes a fuzzy score-based performance measurement model to manage the number of workers recruited for the housekeeping department which focuses on the minimization of total human resources costs. The steps of the model utilize time studies, expert opinions and past data. The proposed model is applied to a real case, and the results show that the proposed model has significant improvements on the performance of the department while decreasing the total human resources costs of housekeeping department and the requirement for the seasonal workers. The model results in less human resources turnover ratios and less customer complaints on room cleanliness.
