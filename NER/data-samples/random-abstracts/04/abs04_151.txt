Abstract Variations in the O, Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic compositions in rocks of various ages, minerals, and mantle temperature in the geological history are considered. Two periods in the Earth’s history are studied: the beginning of the formation of the planet until the turn of (3.4) 2.7–2.5 Ga and the tectonic movement period in the last 2 Ga, and also the transitional period within 2.7–2.0 Ga.
