Abstract We consider chemical reactions for the appearance of water during the formation of the planet from cosmic gas and dust material to explain the early geological existence of the Earth’s hydrosphere. This process is fully supported by the resources of the initial substances and thermal energy. Thus, the concept of V.I. Vernadsly about the geological eternity of the World Ocean and ancient age of the oceanic lithosphere is supported. The identical high location of the ancient and modern continental platforms under the conditions of continual isostatical equilibrium in the asthenosphere–lithosphere–hydrosphere gives grounds to conclude that the ocean water depth is stable. Taking this into account, we can consider that the geological evolution of the Earth began in the conditions of the existence of the World Ocean when the mass of the hydrosphere only slightly exceeded the modern one.
