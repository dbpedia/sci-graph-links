Abstract A reference section of the Paleogene and Neogene located in the Kvachina Bay, West Kamchatka, is characterized in detail with description of ancient sequences and their lithological and paleontological features. Debatable problems of division and correlation of the section are reported. Its importance for deciphering of the geological events of the region is examined, as well as for the development of the stratigraphic scheme of the Cenozoic of West Kamchatka.
