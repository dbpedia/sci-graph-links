Abstract As a consequence of recent developments in mass spectrometry, the application of non-traditional stable isotope systems (e.g. Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Sr, Zn) as well as radiogenic isotopes to archaeological materials is now possible. These techniques have opened new perspectives in bioarchaeology and can provide information on metabolism, diet and the mobility of past individuals. This review demonstrates this potential and describes the principle of these new analytical approaches. In addition, we emphasize how the “non-traditional” stable isotope systems compare and contrast with classic isotopic analyses.
