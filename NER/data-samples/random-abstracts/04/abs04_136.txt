Abstract This study aims to determine the depths of geological structures in Fethiye–Burdur fault zone. This fault length, which is considered the landward continuation of the Pliny-Strabo trench, is an important feature in SW Turkey. The NW–SE extension is probably responsible for the formation of the Burdur Basin during Plio-Quaternary time. Study area is located in a region which has the potential seismic events along the Burdur tectonic lines. For this purpose, Euler deconvolution was applied on two separate cross-sections of the region’s Bouguer gravity map and basement rock depth of the region were determined. Euler deconvolution yields fast and successful results in determining the depths of graben-type tectonic structures. The depths of geological structures were determined through different window sizes and structural index values. The maximum depth value determined in the region was approximately 13 km. The determined depths were used to reveal cross-sections of possible underground structures.
