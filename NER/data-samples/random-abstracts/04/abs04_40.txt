Abstract The Shishe-botagh area is located in the western Azerbaijan Province, Iran. In this paper, geological map, ASTER satellite images were used and processed by ENVI software. Furthermore, lithogeochemical data were analyzed by fractal modeling. In this paper alternation zones distinguished by using band ratio, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). Geochemical anomalies were separated by number â€“ size (N-S) fractal model. The (N-S) fractal method was utilized for delineation of high intensive Au, As and Ag anomalies with silica veins in the west and South West of the the Shishe-botagh area.
