Abstract The uneven character of the distribution of 18O/16O and 234U/238U values was established in the vertical cross section of the productive sequence of the Dybryn uranium deposit (Vitim uranium-ore region, Buryatia). Both a deficiency and an excess of 234U in relation to the equilibrium 234U/238U ratio in the vertical sequence may provide evidence for the extremely low rate of the infiltration water flow. The behavior of oxygen isotope characteristics for different size fractions of terrigenous rocks provides evidence for active uranium redistribution and openness of the isotope system of this element during interaction of terrigenousâ€“sedimentary rocks with infiltration waters.
