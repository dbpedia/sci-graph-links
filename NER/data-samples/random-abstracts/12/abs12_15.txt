Abstract Two resolutions of the same 3-design are said to be orthogonal when each parallel class of one resolution has at most one block in common with each parallel class of the other resolution. If an H design has two orthogonal resolutions, then the H design is called a doubly resolvable H design. In this paper, we construct two infinite classes of doubly resolvable H(n, g, 4, 3)s for $$n=6$$ n=6 or 8 and use a quadrupling construction to obtain more infinite classes of doubly resolvable H designs.
