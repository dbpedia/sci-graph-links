Abstract In recent years, building energy consumption has increased in response to climate change, resulting in a worldwide reduction of energy efficiency. A strong response is required, through both the enhancement of building energy efficiency and the reduction of power usage. These objectives could be achieved by pursuing “Blackout” prevention, through developing a control unit such as that of the urban energy grid system that was used in the Energy Operation Center (EOC) for smart cities. In this context, this paper presents an optimization operation technique for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), using control monitor-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient operation of the EOC. BIM is one of the approaches that can be used for the visual representation, management, and exchange of information on all aspects of a building. The EOC should be able to efficiently represent the data from the building information, and the operator maintaining it should be able to promptly acquire the data for handling it. This suggests that the control of energy consumption by a Building Automation System (BAS) to maximize building energy efficiency will lead to improved total energy performance, reduced operating costs, and reduced environmental impact.
