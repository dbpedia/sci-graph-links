Abstract In the recent paper, entitled “Outdoor ventilation performance of various configurations of a layout of two adjacent buildings under isothermal conditions” by Ayo et al. (2015) (Building Simulation, 8: 81–98), an expression is presented for evaluating the temporal average of positive air exchange rate (AER+) in a three-dimensional canyon. This comments show that this expression for the temporal average of AER+ is incorrect. Also, this discussion gives a corrected expression for the temporal average of AER+.
