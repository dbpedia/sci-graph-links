Abstract The city of Panama was founded on 15 August 1519 and was the first Spanish port on the American Pacific coast. In 1671 the city was destroyed by the pirate Henry Morgan. The archaeological site of Panam치 Viejo was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2003. The archaeological department of Patronato Panam치 Viejo, the institution responsible for site management, has designed a long-term plan that involves survey, excavation, analysis, conservation, curation of collections, education, and general and specialized promotion. The site-management structure, including fundraising, is innovative and original for the region. This paper presents a synthesis of more than a decade of archaeological research at the site, the legal framework in which it takes place, and its significance in the regional context.
