Abstract Aggregate architectures are full-scale spatial formations made from loose granular matter. Especially if the individual grain is custom-designed, the range of behaviours can be calibrated to match a wide range of architectural and structural performance criteria. The aggregate becomes programmable matter. The relevance of loose granular systems for architecture is on the one hand their rapid re-configurability, allowing for a system not to be destroyed but rather to be recycled. On the other hand aggregates per se can be functionally graded either within one and the same particle type or through mixing different particle geometries. This enables the variation of architectural properties throughout one and the same material system, which is one of the core postulates of current architectural design research. However, very few examples of designed granular matter in architecture exist. The results presented here are thus one of the first coherent bodies of comprehensive research in this field compiled over a period of five years. Methodologically aggregate systems challenge conventional architectural design principles: whereas an architect generally precisely defines local and global geometry of a structure, in a designed granular system he can only calibrate the particle geometry in order to tune the overall behaviour of the aggregate formation. Thus new design methods have been developed throughout the research projects, which are informed by the related fields of granular physics and behaviour-based robotics. In this context the article provides an introduction to both designed particle systems and suitable fabrication approaches in an architectural context. Case study projects serve to verify the applicability of the concepts introduced. The research findings are discussed with regards to their practical, methodological and design theoretical contributions. To conclude, further directions of research are highlighted.
