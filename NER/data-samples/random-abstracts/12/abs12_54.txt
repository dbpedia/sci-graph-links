Abstract Immovable cultural properties constituting cultural heritage centre upon regions that have the level of natural features required for basic human needs. Such regions constitute a space with characteristics of an eco-cultural subregion and they do not have any administrative or geographical boundaries. Aims of this study are to introduce the concept of eco-cultural subregion, which is the holistic expression of natural features together with cultural heritage, to the literature; to present a method in identifying geographical boundaries of subregions; and to formulate a classification system. The research was conducted in the Phrygian Valley, which is one of the most important centres of ancient Phrygians in Western Anatolia, using a method based on GIS-MCDM (Geographic Information System-Multiple Criteria Decision Making). The selected MCDM technique was Simos Procedure. Natural features and cultural heritage were considered together and the entire Phrygian Valley was approached as both an ecological and a cultural region. Ecological features were analysed using 7 main and 17 subfactors, while cultural heritage was analysed using 2 main factors and 15 subfactors. Simos Procedure was employed in the assignment of weight for main factors and subfactors. First 17 ecological subregions with similar characteristics under 4 levels were identified. Considering their cultural heritage values, a classification system was formulated and eco-cultural subregions were expressed in level/degree in this system. In consequence of this procedure boundaries of eco-cultural subregions were drawn and mapped. This classification also enabled to identify the concept of eco-cultural subregion which is not found in the literature. It is expected that eco-cultural subregions will provide to discuss ecological features and cultural heritage holistically in conservation and planning studies.
