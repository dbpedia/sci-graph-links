Abstract Distinctive archaeological features can be attributed to the life cycle of buildings from construction to destruction. One group of features that has not been closely examined on historic sites are those resulting from the erection of construction devices such as derricks and scaffolding. Descriptions of these devices in the literature are provided. Archaeological features of derricks and scaffolds on house sites in Tennessee and Virginia are compared to those in the literature. Attributes such as distance from the building, spacing, and feature fill that differentiates them from other earthfast features are discussed. The identification of such temporary construction features is important for understanding the level of technology employed in American construction, dating buildings under construction, origins, and possible ethnic affiliation of these devices.
