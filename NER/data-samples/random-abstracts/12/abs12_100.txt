Abstract In this paper, I mine the scholarly work of longtime MIT professor Donald Schön for a set of tactics which, having originated in his studies of the architectural design studio, are shown to be relevant to the architectural analysis of existing buildings. In this way, a specific and hitherto untapped potential of Schön’s work is developed, but more critically, I use the discussion to support a strategy of designerly analysis which suggests an expansion of studio pedagogy as a field for learning.
