In this respect, advanced glazing solutions are of vital importance to mitigate energy demand of buildings, thus to reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, in this research, a novel glazing technology called solar pond window is introduced, and it is numerically and experimentally investigated for different design configurations. The optimum design of this novel glazing covers four 5-mm-thick glass panes, two 20-mm-thick water layers, and one 20-mm-thick Krypton layer in the middle. The average heat transfer coefficient (U-value) of the optimum case is found to be about 0.40 W/$$\\hbox {m}^{2}$$ m2  K. If air is used as insulative gas in the interlayer, the U-value of the glazing is determined to be around 0.90 W/$$\\hbox {m}^{2}$$ m2  K, which is still competitive with the U-value range of argon-filled triple-glazed windows with low-e coatings. The fabrication cost of the optimum design of solar pond window is around €120/$$\\hbox {m}^{2}$$ m2 . Overall, solar pond window technology is a cost-effective and energy-efficient glazing, which has a great potential to be the future of fenestration products as well as being capable of meeting the latest building fabric standards." .

NPP projects have frequently exceeded the planned time and cost despite reliable estimates at the start of the project. This was attributed to unpredictable causes at the beginning and to shortage of proper tools to quantitatively analyze the inevitable uncertainties. To overcome these difficulties, computerized systems have been widely proposed in the construction industry as effective aids to proactively control the potential risks and to monitor continuously their status and variation. However, there are few risk management systems focused on NPP projects. In this study, we developed a computer-based risk management system for NPP projects, called Nuclear Risk Management System (NuRMS), which is helpful for furnishing project managers with warning signals as a project is progressing and for tracking the changes in risk variation at a desired confidence level. In developing the NuRMS, the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS), the weights for risk categorization, computation of the Total Risk Score (TRS), and integration of risk analysis tools with relation-based and cost-loaded activity schedule were core tasks. To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed NuRMS, the system was operated using risk information derived from constructing the auxiliary buildings of Shin-Kori units 3 and 4 located in Korea, as an illustrative case. The results showed the system’s capacities and suggested that it may be applied to a real NPP engineering, procurement, and construction project. The developed NuRMS is expected to assist a project manager in monitoring, tracking, and controlling potential impacts of risk events during the overall implementation of NPP projects." .

This paper evaluates the impact of the integration of a battery in a positive energy building used to increase its self-consumption of electricity. Parametric studies are carried out by varying the building envelope characteristics, the power supply system, the climate, the lighting and appliances profiles, the roof tilt angle, the battery size and the electricity tariffs, leading to 3200 cases. The analysis is performed on an annual basis in terms of self-consumption and self-production rate and payback period. It is shown that the battery size leading to the minimum payback period within the input range is comprised between 2.6 and 4.5 kWh. The lowest payback periods, (~7 years), are reached with a well-insulated building envelope, a high lightning and appliance consumption, a low feed-in tariff and a 3.7 kWh battery. Finally, simple correlations (based on the feed-in tariff, the annual electrical consumption and production) to predict the optimal size of battery and the lowest payback period are proposed." .

Function is a widely accepted foundational concept for design activities, and while affordances have the potential to be a more broadly applicable, little work has been done to show how this new approach can be reconciled with more familiar design modeling practices. In this paper, affordances are shown to provide an alternative means for linking intentional and physical design descriptions across the product life cycle. This approach involves a renewed engagement with the affordance ontology of ecological psychology, which is compared, contrasted, and integrated with function theory. This integrated perspective is used to shine light on the possibilities and limitations of affordance-based design reasoning and to construct a representational hierarchy for use in the design process. This work demonstrates the robustness of the ecological perspective in design scenarios and highlights ways in which function- and affordance-based design processes can be integrated while retaining the strengths of both. The outcome of this integration is a stronger representational and reasoning framework for early-stage design that supports instead of supplants traditional methods of engineering design." .

The outcomes reveal four segments of public transport users: one positive, one indifferent and the other two negative. Managerial implications of the findings are discussed." .

The error of this insistence was persuasively argued by Jane Jacobs in the 1960s. Subsequently, planning theory and practice came to recognise the importance of density, but this return to favour requires remaining constantly alert to the possible dangers and pitfalls. MethodsCritically considering the traditional and contemporary urban planning literature and the empirical evidence in the recent economic and geographical research, this article investigates the whys and wherefores of density in urban planning. It addresses two main questions: Is urban density really desirable (and why)? Is it effectively manageable (and how)? ResultsDensity per se is meaningless unless it is a tool or condition for achieving something further. And even if the instrumental function of density were to be acknowledged, it is crucial to take into account that density is not solely (or merely) a tool which—in certain conditions—can be useful in reducing commute times and minimising the encroachment on undeveloped land. Its primary advantage concerns favouring the concentrated diverse admix of human preferences, tastes, abilities, know-how, uses, activities, and so forth. ConclusionsAfter having expressly laboured to avoid it for so long, the aim is not to create density directly, but to open the door and allow density to happen in our cities, thanks to more abstract and general planning rules." .

With the rapid development of urbanization and constant advancement of suburbanization, the middle class has increasingly come to influence city traffic. Research into middle-class commuting activities thus has practical significance for improving traffic congestion and reducing the commuting burden in metropolitan cities. Based on a dataset formed by 816 completed surveys, this paper analyzes the commuting mode, time and distance of middle-class residents in Guangzhou City using the descriptive statistical method. The results indicate that private cars are the main commuting mode, followed by public transport. Meanwhile, middle-class residents mainly undertake medium-short time and medium- short distance commuting. The study subsequently uses multilevel logistic regression and multiple linear regression models to analyze the factors that influence commuting mode choice, time and distance. The gender, age, number of family cars, housing source and jobs-housing balance are the most important factors influencing commuting mode choice; housing, population density, jobs-housing balance and commuting mode significantly affect commuting time; and transport accessibility, jobs-housing balance and commuting mode are the notable factors affecting commuting distance. Finally, this paper analyzes what is affecting the commuting activities of middle-class residents and determines the differences in commuting activity characteristics and influence factors between middle-class and ordinary residents. Policy suggestions to improve urban planning and urban management are also proposed." .

Demand response is one of the emerging tools in this new landscape. Targeting service sector buildings, we investigated a tariff driven demand response model as a means to shave electrical peak loads and thus reducing grid balancing energy. In this paper is presented a software framework for load shifting which uses a tariff signal for the electric energy as minimization target. The framework can be used both on top of an existing building management system to shift heat generation towards low-tariff times, as well as to simulate load shifting for different buildings, heat pumps and storage configurations. Its modular architecture allows us to easily replace optimizers, weather data providers or building management system adapters. Our results show that even with the current TOU tariff system, up to 34 % of cost savings and up to 20 % reduction in energy consumption can be achieved. With Sub-MPC, a modified MPC optimizer, we could reduce computing times by a factor 50, while only slightly affecting the quality of the optimization." .

However, those factors are not usually considered when the city is planned, and it is difficult to ensure that urban planning will create more sustainable cities. Therefore, knowledge of the relationship between planning variables and future operating cost of urban public services can help to improve the decision-making process in the early stages of urban planning. In a set of Spanish cities on two different territorial levels, the degree of correlation between three of the urban planning variables that define the urban morphology and the operating cost of street lighting infrastructure has been analysed. The study shows that at whole city level, the operating cost is closely related to housing density and relative length of roads, while for new residential developments, the most crucial urban variable is the relative area occupied by the streets. It has also become clear that per area and per capita operating cost of illuminating newly developed areas is significantly higher than the average cost for the whole city." .

Its accuracy depends on input parameters such as wind pressure and opening discharge coefficients. In most cases, these parameters are obtained from secondary sources which are solely representative for very simplified buildings, i.e. for buildings without facade details. Although studies comparing wind pressure coefficients or discharge coefficients from different sources exist, the knowledge regarding the effect of input data on AFN is still poor. In this paper, the influence of wind pressure data on the accuracy of a coupled AFN-BES model for a real building with natural wind- and stack-driven ventilation was analyzed. The results of 8 computation cases with different wind pressure data from secondary sources were compared with the measured data. Both the indoor temperatures and the airflow were taken into account. The outcomes indicated that the source of wind pressure data had a significant influence on the model performance." .

This study predicts thermal and energy performance of mixed-mode ventilation by integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with energy simulation. In the simulation of change-over mixed-mode ventilation, it is critical to determine whether outdoor conditions are suitable for natural ventilation at each time step. This study uses CFD simulations to search for the outdoor temperature thresholds when natural ventilation alone is adequate for thermal comfort. The temperature thresholds for wind-driven natural ventilation are identified by a heat balance model, in which air change rate (ACH) is explicitly computed by CFD considering the influence of the surrounding buildings. In buoyancy-driven natural ventilation, the outdoor temperature thresholds are obtained directly from CFD-based parametric analysis. The integrated approach takes advantage of both the CFD algorithm and energy simulation while maintaining low levels of complexity, enabling building designers to utilize this method for early-stage decisionmaking. This paper first describes the workflow of the proposed integrated approach, followed by two case studies, which are presented using a three-floor office building in an urban context. The results are compared with those using an energy simulation program with built-in multizone modules for natural ventilation. Additionally, adaptive thermal comfort models are applied in these case studies, which shows the possibility of further reducing the electricity used for cooling." .

Thus, decisions on envelope design are contained by the objective, whether to advance or limit heat gain or loss, which pertains to the climatic conditions of the construction site. The purpose of this article is to probe the potency of using unventilated air-gapped facades for thermal insulation in hot climates. It is expected to gain positive results regarding the capability of air gap as a thermal insulation in walls of buildings, consequently, reducing the cost of thermal insulation materials and the cost of energy consumed as well. Three different profiles of building facades were selected: a controlled façade with no insulation material, a façade with an air gap as a substitute to the thermal insulation material, and a façade with a polystyrene layer of thermal insulation. The methodology of work depended on building three models in a simulation software for the examined building. Design-Builder Simulation software was repeatedly run to estimate the quantities of energy consumption associated with the usage of the proposed facades through multiple analysis processes. The resulting annual average, annual cooling, and annual heating energy consumption were compared. So that the effectiveness of an air gap as a thermal insulator could be examined. The results showed that unventilated air-gapped facade profiles had a limited efficiency in thermal insulation in hot-humid areas. They showed greater efficiency in reducing heating loads than cooling loads. Reduction efficiency values were twofold more in the winter season than in the summer season. Thus, the role of air-gapped facades as thermal insulators might be more efficient in areas where heating seasons are longer than cooling seasons." .

The architectural and urban production of each period displays its concepts and its styles, each rich with specific characteristics. The most representative buildings date to the Ottoman period and especially to French colonization. During the latter, and with the multiplication of the administrative offices, numerous public buildings represent different styles: Neoclassical, eclectic, neo-Moorish and art deco, each lying next to one another. Nevertheless, each building was intended to indicate its function. Numerous studies of the buildings erected during the first half of the twentieth century and particularly on the attributes of the neo-Moorish style were examined unlike the architectural output resulting from the Second Empire and relating to public civil architecture, due to the lack of monographic work. Our knowledge in this field thus remains to be improved and constituted.

We discuss how these kinds of activities have played out in four PD projects that we have participated in. Furthermore, we show that the decisions are interlinked, and discuss the notion of decision linkages. We emphasize the design result as the most important part of PD. Finally, participation is discussed as the sharing of power, asking what the perspective of power and decision-making adds to the understanding of design practices." .

In this work, we aim to provide an initial approach to the question of how to model architectural data in a formal ontology structure and consider some of the problems involved. This question is challenging both for the inherent difficulties of the discourse to be modelled but also for the lack of available structured data sources that would distinctly represent the architectural perspective proper, as well as for the contentious nature of the definition of architecture itself. We, therefore, take the step of exploring in broad strokes the possible approaches to architecture, tracing the notion of architecture as idea, process or thing from the literature. On the basis of this enquiry, we propose a model of some top-level referents of architecture using FRBRoo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that can be used to model creative processes. We argue that with the addition of only four classes to this model, to capture certain architecturally specific concepts and activities, we are able to provide an adequate high-level first approach to this problem. Further, by connecting this work to the existing extension of CRMba, which models built work as a system of relations of filled and unfilled spaces, there is a sufficient high-level ontological structure to begin to test for its utility to explore the issues of the relation between architecture as idea, process and thing." .

Seemingly, to his Dutch colleagues, Nio's work is on the track of liberating architecture from the burden of cultural responsibilities (Ibelings Supermodernism: Architecture in the age of globalization: Nai Uitgevers Pub, 1998), yet it evinces significant differences from other work in that vein. MethodsNio’s projects are compared with Jencks' phenomenology of iconic architecture (Jencks The iconic building: Rizzoli New York, 2005), in order to demonstrate the importance and peculiarity of Nio’s work within the context of Iconic Architecture and the Superdutch period, and the extent to which his work can be considered different. ResultsThis article argues that Nio’s architecture is not based on the production of outstanding shapes (Lootsma SuperDutch Afterthoughts Post. Rotterdam. Rotterdam: 010 Publisher, 2001), or the clever interpretation of a given program (Betsky Reading MVRDV: NAi 2003), but on the creation of disquieting presences in the built environment. Most of his work consists of pieces of architecture each of which has its own name, character and identity and seems to rely on disrupting the expected and disturbing the quiet. ConclusionsThis paper examines Nio’s work, with particular attention to three case studies, in order to generate a series of qualitative characteristics that define his idiosyncratic architecture." .

A strong response is required, through both the enhancement of building energy efficiency and the reduction of power usage. These objectives could be achieved by pursuing “Blackout” prevention, through developing a control unit such as that of the urban energy grid system that was used in the Energy Operation Center (EOC) for smart cities. In this context, this paper presents an optimization operation technique for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), using control monitor-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient operation of the EOC. BIM is one of the approaches that can be used for the visual representation, management, and exchange of information on all aspects of a building. The EOC should be able to efficiently represent the data from the building information, and the operator maintaining it should be able to promptly acquire the data for handling it. This suggests that the control of energy consumption by a Building Automation System (BAS) to maximize building energy efficiency will lead to improved total energy performance, reduced operating costs, and reduced environmental impact." .

Therefore, the task of selecting a capable contractor for smooth project delivery is challenging. Although previous studies have attempted to improve the methods of bidding evaluation, limitations still exist. First, the evaluation results might be biased due to the heterogeneity in a small group of experts with different professional experience and capabilities. Second, multi-correlation can reduce the validity of the weightings of the indexes and evaluation results. Third, the subjectivity of the weightings can be a crucial hurdle to the selection of a suitable contractor for a specific project. To overcome these shortcomings, this study introduces Partial Least Squares (PLS) path modeling and develops a Sequence-Multi-Criteria System which can aggregate the evaluation results from different professional practitioners without the use of pre-defined weighting schemes, thus providing a reliable reference for bid evaluation. We incorporated this approach into an evaluation procedure stipulated in the procurement documents of the World Bank and specifically aimed at selecting suitable contractors for large construction projects. A case study was conducted via comparisons across various scenarios, and the validity of this approach was subsequently proved." .

Nevertheless, traditional wisdom and personal cultivation is often neglected in this process of creating architecture. This paper makes a connection between the Chinese ideogram of 道 (dao = way), with the Greek term of φρόνησις (phronesis = practical wisdom), in the context of architecture. We argue that both terms bring forth the importance of ethics and practical wisdom in the making of architecture, as a process of cultivation. This argument is discussed through two case studies: a historical Chinese garden (Sima Guang’s ‘Garden of Solitary Enjoyment’), as a manifestation of Dao, and an educational situation from a contemporary architectural design studio in a school of architecture, as a manifestation of phronēsis. Both these diverse examples offer a possibility to see architecture as the creation of ‘vessels for life’ where ‘vessel’ and ‘life’ are inseparable." .

Cities have long been known to be society’s predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution and disease. MethodsWe conducted a review around the topic urban and transport planning, environmental exposures and health and describe the findings. ResultsWithin cities there is considerable variation in the levels of environmental exposures such as air pollution, noise, temperature and green space. Emerging evidence suggests that urban and transport planning indicators such as road network, distance to major roads, and traffic density, household density, industry and natural and green space explain a large proportion of the variability. Personal behavior including mobility adds further variability to personal exposures, determines variability in green space and UV exposure, and can provide increased levels of physical activity.Air pollution, noise and temperature have been associated with adverse health effects including increased morbidity and premature mortality, UV and green space with both positive and negative health effects and physical activity with many health benefits. In many cities there is still scope for further improvement in environmental quality through targeted policies. Making cities ‘green and healthy’ goes far beyond simply reducing CO2 emissions. Environmental factors are highly modifiable, and environmental interventions at the community level, such as urban and transport planning, have been shown to be promising and more cost effective than interventions at the individual level. However, the urban environment is a complex interlinked system.Decision-makers need not only better data on the complexity of factors in environmental and developmental processes affecting human health, but also enhanced understanding of the linkages to be able to know at which level to target their actions. New research tools, methods and paradigms such as geographical information systems, smartphones, and other GPS devices, small sensors to measure environmental exposures, remote sensing and the exposome paradigm together with citizens observatories and science and health impact assessment can now provide this information. ConclusionWhile in cities there are often silos of urban planning, mobility and transport, parks and green space, environmental department, (public) health department that do not work together well enough, multi-sectorial approaches are needed to tackle the environmental problems. The city of the future needs to be a green city, a social city, an active city, a healthy city." .

Conversely, the social, economic, and environmental impacts of transport are framed as critical issues that can challenge the sustainability of cities and regions. This paper presents a critical literature review of the relationship between public transportation and sustainability. First the paper offers a review of key sustainable transportation concepts and how public transport contributes to sustainability goals. Second, the paper reviews past studies that analyse sustainable transportation in order to develop recommendations for planning, engineering, and researching sustainable public transport. Finally, the paper concludes by offering suggestions for future research into the sustainability performance of public transit." .

Especially if the individual grain is custom-designed, the range of behaviours can be calibrated to match a wide range of architectural and structural performance criteria. The aggregate becomes programmable matter. The relevance of loose granular systems for architecture is on the one hand their rapid re-configurability, allowing for a system not to be destroyed but rather to be recycled. On the other hand aggregates per se can be functionally graded either within one and the same particle type or through mixing different particle geometries. This enables the variation of architectural properties throughout one and the same material system, which is one of the core postulates of current architectural design research. However, very few examples of designed granular matter in architecture exist. The results presented here are thus one of the first coherent bodies of comprehensive research in this field compiled over a period of five years. Methodologically aggregate systems challenge conventional architectural design principles: whereas an architect generally precisely defines local and global geometry of a structure, in a designed granular system he can only calibrate the particle geometry in order to tune the overall behaviour of the aggregate formation. Thus new design methods have been developed throughout the research projects, which are informed by the related fields of granular physics and behaviour-based robotics. In this context the article provides an introduction to both designed particle systems and suitable fabrication approaches in an architectural context. Case study projects serve to verify the applicability of the concepts introduced. The research findings are discussed with regards to their practical, methodological and design theoretical contributions. To conclude, further directions of research are highlighted." .

This issue provides an overview of the applications of perspective to architecture and their current validity in design. The sequence of topics underlines the relationships between historical literature and coeval realisations, and the connection with other applications, such as cartography. The affirmation of a shared rule of perspective was the result of a long process of practical experimentation. The starting point was the classical principles of optics in the applications to the wall paintings of Pompeii, where the fascinating story of architectural perspective began. Thus, in this context, the term ‘architectural perspective’, also refers to the set of perspective constructions realised on the surfaces of a wall or room to simulate a different space than those actually built. Several “real scale” examples document the broad experimentation of projective devices in which the image interacts with the space and representation becomes architecture, offering suggestions are still valid today for its possible applications in design." .

While it is a cornerstone of neurosciences that experiences are remembered, because transmitters activate gene expression in neurons, long-term adaptive astrocyte plasticity has not been described. Here, we investigated whether the transcription factor CREB mediates adaptive plasticity-like phenomena in astrocytes. We found that activation of CREB-dependent transcription reduced the calcium responses induced by ATP, noradrenaline, or endothelin-1. As to the mechanism, expression of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active CREB mutant, had no effect on basal cytosolic calcium levels, extracellular calcium entry, or calcium mobilization from lysosomal-related acidic stores. Rather, VP16-CREB upregulated sigma-1 receptor expression thereby increasing the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and its uptake by mitochondria. Sigma-1 receptor was also upregulated in vivo upon VP16-CREB expression in astrocytes. We conclude that CREB decreases astrocyte responsiveness by increasing calcium signalling at the endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria interface, which might be an astrocyte-based form of long-term depression." .

Such construction module could open the way to simple installation onto the existing residential, public or office buildings of various shapes and ensure better energy performance of the refurbished buildings. The optimal glazing size of the east-, south- and west-oriented façades of the module with the optimal shape is determined by the glazing-to-wall area ratio where the sum total of the annual energy need for heating and cooling of the module is minimal. The sum of the annual energy is defined through an extensive parametric numerical analysis including variations regarding the module’s aspect ratio, the thermal transmittance of its envelope and the glazing size in its east-, south- and west-oriented façades. A parametric analysis carried out in the previously described manner leads to analytic functional dependence between the energy consumption and the module’s design parameters. It is therefore possible to make a fairly simple preliminary estimate of the annual energy need, in addition to defining the optimal floor plan shape of the module along with the optimal proportion of glazing in its east-, south- and west-oriented façades. The optimal proportion of glazing varies from 24 to 91% in the south-oriented façade, from 7 to 43% in the east and from 9 to 55% in the west façade, at the thermal transmittance of the thermal envelope 0.100 W/(m2 K). The variation in the optimal glazing proportion of the module with the thermal transmittance of the thermal envelope 0.165 W/(m2 K) ranges from 14 to 85% in the east, from 28 to 97% in the south and from 16 to 68% in the west-oriented façade. The presented research study permits a choice of the optimal module design with respect to baseline characteristics of the existing building and allows for a more systematic as well as energy-efficient refurbishment process." .

No such finding however is evident for side setback areas, short distances kept between adjacent buildings, which in the case of comparatively dense Japanese urban neighborhood environments can be as short as a few decimeters. The present study locates side setback areas and building facades that look towards them in Japanese planning terminology, and examines them from the residents’ point of view. The data for this preliminary step of the research was collected based on a carefully designed and explained 2014 survey of 190 academics scholars throughout Japan. The results suggest that no demographic characteristic or housing type, number of floors or period of time living in the area were shown to be significant in residents’ perceptions towards the side setback areas. Those who had no side setback area were more concerned with their privacy, smoke, sound or darkness whereas those with side setback areas were more satisfied. As for preferences, having a Green Wall, Terrace/Balcony and Living/Dining were the preferred choice of those with side setback areas. All respondents tended to perceive the spaces as valued for the light and ventilation they provide. Several activities such as storage, parking and drying clothes were common among the respondents’ perceptions of activities suitable for these spaces." .

It holds high cultural value, represents the tangible continuation of the past and forms the unique character and identity of each mountain region. Yet, controversy regarding funding for its preservation often arises. In this paper, we used two Contingent Valuation surveys to estimate the social benefit deriving from protecting the traditional architecture in the mountainous village of Sirako and, through it, to examine perceptions and attitudes of local residents and visitors. Research findings revealed a strong social will in favor of the good’s protection followed by high percentages of positive willingness to pay (WTP). However, WTP is significantly higher among residents. Cultural heritage value, of the good, appears to prevail, along with the environmental one. However, both residents and visitors pointed out that local heritage, if well-preserved, will boost tourism development. Residents appeared to better recognize the true level of architectural decay, expressed higher apprehension for its protection and were willing to pay higher amount of money. Tourists, on the other side, expressed high satisfaction for their visit, appreciated the beauty and serenity emerging from local built and natural environment and spent several days visiting the surrounding area. The longer they stayed and got familiar with the village, the more willing they were to contribute to local heritage’s protection. Percentages reflecting indifference for protecting architecture were extremely low. Yet, they were higher among tourists. Traditional architecture is considered as public good; an opinion resulting in an important percentage of visitors stating that national government should provide the necessary funding. In addition, the architecture appears to hold a high level of topicality. Those descending from Sirako or emotionally connected to it, of both social groups, turned out to be more concerned about the good and with a stronger sense of responsibility for it. Use-value of the good holds high economic value, as well, while higher percentages of zero WTP appeared among non-users. Research findings revealed social attitudes and perceptions on what constitutes architectural heritage, in its cultural and economic frame. If taken under consideration, they may form useful drivers for local, heritage-based, sustainable development." .

Their relationship, connected with the design of the building, can facilitate the growth of photo/heterotrophic organisms and therefore facilitate the increase of the relative CO2 production. Taking this into account, the impact of biological proliferation in a historical building is discussed for the Mithraeum of “Casa di Diana” in the archaeological site of Ostia Antica, which is subjected to guided tours. In this work, for the first time, we propose a study on biological monitoring to evaluate the contribution of bioactivity to air quality, with the objective to increase the comfort of visitors and to open the site for more than one day per week, suggesting possible tools providing a good compromise between building conservation and human comfort. In the sense, it has been possible to distinguish the contribution of the plants from the one deriving from humans: high values of carbon dioxide have been recorded during the night and its scarce removal during the day (air flow). The window present is not sufficient to eliminate the CO2, involving concentrations of CO2 relatively high in comparison to the proposed limits and guidelines defined by law. The obtained results strongly encouraged the elimination of flora in order to increase the comfort of visitors and to open the house for more than one day per week. Although, this process involves an important economic effort, the present study allows making an objective decision which has an important value in a cultural heritage management.

Moreover, we give formulae for the asymptotic entropy, and prove that it is equal to the rate of escape of the random walk with respect to the Green distance. When the building arises from a Fuchsian Kac–Moody group our results imply results for random walks induced by bi-invariant measures on these groups, however our results are proven in the general setting without the assumption of any group acting on the building. The main idea is to consider the retraction of the isotropic random walk onto an apartment of the building, to prove existence of the asymptotic entropy for this retracted walk, and to ‘lift’ this in order to deduce the existence of the entropy for the random walk on the building." .

About 40 % of all primary energy is used in buildings all over the world. This paper is the second part of the study on the life-cycle energy (LCEA), emissions (LCCO2A) and cost (LCCA) assessment of two residential buildings constructed in urban and rural areas. MethodsIn the first part, the methodology, formulations and procedure for such a comprehensive analysis are provided, while this paper provides an application of the methodology that considers two actual buildings located in Gaziantep, Turkey. The proposed model focused on building construction, operation and demolition phases to estimate energy use, carbon emissions and costs per square meter over a 50-year lifespan. The optimum thickness of insulation used to reduce energy consumption and emissions per square meter is determined. Results and discussionIt is found that the operating phase is dominant in both urban and rural residential buildings and contributes 87–85 % of the primary energy requirements and 88–82 % of CO2 emissions, respectively. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions were 5.8 and 3.9 tons CO2 eqv. for BT1 and BT2, respectively. It is calculated that the life-cycle energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the residential buildings can be reduced by up to 22.8 and 23.4 %, respectively, by using a proper insulation material for the external walls. The life-cycle cost, consisting of mortgage, energy, maintenance, service and demolition payments are calculated to be 7.28 and 1.72 million USD for BT1 and BT2, respectively. ConclusionsBuilding envelope developments, such as better wall insulation, provide noteworthy potential energy savings and contribute to the reductions from cooling and space heating. Therefore, primary strategies and technologies needed for efficient buildings include optimal insulation of external walls. The economic insulation thickness of the residential buildings in Gaziantep is determined to be 80 mm by using a life-cycle cost analysis. The results show that because of the differences in building structures and living standards, life-cycle energy intensity and CO2 emissions in urban residential buildings are 29 and 25 % higher than in rural conditions." .

When dealing with transit design in real systems, detailed descriptions of cities are too complex to allow an analytical formulation that leads to exact results, so heuristics have been used. Alternatively, optimal design of transit systems at a strategic level has been done based on simplified descriptions using regular patterns or small networks to face and solve ad-hoc transit design problems. In this paper we propose a parametric description of cities for the normative analysis of transit systems. This is achieved after a synthesis of different ways to describe a city’s urban form that can be found in the literature, with an emphasis on the road network and the role of centers and subcenters. These diverse descriptions are assessed with the help of topological indicators and synthetic information regarding real cities. The parameters characterize the underlying network, the zones involved and the spatial pattern of transport demand, such that the design of public transport systems can be studied normatively for different city shapes. The model is applied to describe three very different real cities." .

According to theoretical analysis, NC-TZ is non-dimensional and ranges from 0 to 1. When NC-TZ tends toward 0, the control effect of the local ventilation system on IAQ is more satisfactory. When NC-TZ tends toward 1, the control effect on IAQ is less satisfactory. The numerical simulation on a push–pull ventilation system with varying exhaust flow rates and varying distances between push and pull hoods was performed. The results demonstrate that for the same capture efficiency, changing the local ventilation system characteristics can change the control effect on the local environment. The results for obstacles at different positions also indicate that NC-TZ can clearly reflect the control effect on IAQ of the local ventilation systems in industrial buildings." .

Using a spatial urban equilibrium model, we find that if the number of access nodes, i.e. stations, is limited, stations contribute to the degree of urbanization. The total effect on road congestion, however, is small. By contrast, if stations are omnipresent there is little effect on urban spatial structure, but a considerable decrease in congestion. This suggests there is a policy trade‐off between congestion and urbanization which crucially depends on the type of railway network. We find similar results for a within‐city metro network. The key methodological contribution is that, besides the dependence between mode choice and where to work/live, the model allows for differences in the degree of substitutability – local competition – between transport modes. We find that an increase in the substitutability between car travel and railway travel substantially decreases the congestion reduction benefits of a dense railway network." .

These include a designer called naqash who creates the design on graphs, and a coder called talim-guru who encodes that design in a specific notation called talim which is deciphered and interpreted by the weavers to weave the design. The technological interventions over the years have influenced these artifacts considerably and triggered major changes in the practice, from heralding profound cognitive accomplishments in manually driven design process causing major alterations in the overall structure of the practice. The recent intervention is by the digital technology: on the one hand, it has brought precision and speedy processing in the design process, and on the other, it has eliminated some of the crucial actors from the practice. This paper, which forms part of a larger study on the situated and distributed cognitive process in Kashmiri carpet-weaving practice, describes the technological makeover of the design artifacts involved in this practice over the years and their resultant cognitive impact on the design process as well as on the practice." .

Total energy consumption, including space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting and other household appliances, was simulated by considering building construction and materials, equipment and appliances, local climates and occupancy patterns. The model was used to analyse energy use by private dwellings in more than five thousand CCDs in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The predicted results focus on electricity consumption (natural gas and other fuel sources were excluded as the data are not available) and track the actual electricity consumption at CCD level with an error of 9.2% when summed to state level. For NSW and Victoria 2006, the predicted state electricity consumption is close to the published model (within 6%) and statistical data (within 10%). A key feature of the model is that it can be used to predict hourly electricity consumption and peak demand at fine geographic scales, which is important for grid planning and designing local energy efficiency or demand response strategies." .

Excavation of three Historical period sites of buildings moved in the 19th century in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area has revealed features and produced artifact frequencies corresponding to these expected patterns. This suggests that historical archaeological evidence of moved buildings is more common than we realize and must be considered in any architectural studies." .

The perspective’s rationality becomes the pretext for subverting the foundations and illusive dynamics of the architectural representation. In those years, quadratura painting and stage design become for the artists a common field of experimentation and spatial research. In this context, the artistic production of the Galli Bibiena both in scenographic and architectural field, it seems to have played a key role. This paper, after examining the relations between perspective painting and theatre scenes, and between built architecture and architectural imagery, focuses on a perspective analysis of the scene “drawing” of the Galli Bibiena. The aim has been to use perspective drawings as real project prefigurations, giving back through strict photogrammetry procedures, a great practicality and virtual materiality to the spaces and architectures simulated on the two-dimensions of the flat surface." .

They recognize antigens with high specificity and are indispensable for immunological memory following pathogen exposure or vaccination. The constant, crystallizable fragment (Fc) of IgG molecules mediates antibody effector functions such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. These functions are regulated by a single N-linked, biantennary glycan of the heavy chain, which resides just below the hinge region, and the presence of specific sugar moieties on the glycan has profound implications on IgG effector functions. Emerging knowledge of how Fc glycans contribute to IgG structure and functions has opened new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of defined antibody glycoforms in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Here, we review recent advances in understanding proinflammatory IgG effector functions and their regulation by Fc glycans." .

Despite such growth, there is not a shared understanding of many aspects of the tourism development framework for all kinds of agricultural heritage sites. Given that meanings and characteristics are critical to determining the appeal of a particular activity among tourism consumers and because the development directions of AHST are essential for achieving heritage conservation goals, a study was conducted in 2014–2015 to assess stakeholder preferences for definitional phrases and their perceptions. This manuscript summarizes the characteristics of AHST in four aspects, taking agricultural heritage systems in China as examples: 1) synthesis of agritourism, cultural heritage tourism, and ecotourism; 2) annual variation of tourism attractions and activities; 3) the dominant role of artisan farmers; 4) the unique gastronomic experiences of traditional food. Finally, there are some objectives offered by this research from economic, environmental, cultural, social and political perspectives to build a framework of AHST according to its features and characteristics. Based on environmental and cultural objectives, with political and social support, through reaching the core objectives of economic development, AHST will be sustainable and agricultural heritage systems will be well conserved. This study carries important implications for the further applications of AHST." .

An insulating envelope is a configuration of a set of rectangular panels that respects a set of limitations. Due to the number of façades to be renovated and the number of possible configurations for a single façade, the envelope configuration is both a mass customization problem as well as a combinatorial one. The paper then introduces a decision support system based on the framework of constraint satisfaction, as it fits neatly the constrained nature of the problem. Two configuration tasks have been identified as prerequisite to envelopes configurations: (1) the configuration of a questionnaire for information inputs and (2) the configuration of a constraint satisfaction problem for each one of the façades to be renovated. The system architecture promotes maintenance, modularity and efficiency as different configuration tasks are divided into web-services. Conception and implementation of the massive building thermal renovation are then supported." .

Building lighting retrofits are typically installed to reduce energy consumption and operational costs of buildings. This traditionally includes replacing lights and introducing Building Management System (BMS). Through this process, an occupant’s ability to override new computerized controls could be compromised, which can dramatically affect the overall success of the project. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the effectiveness of the lighting retrofit, influence of the BMS upgrade, occupant behavior, and the lessons learned. The analysis comprises three different phases including one pre-retrofit and two post-retrofit phases. Each of the retrofit phases lasted approximately one year, leading to the monitoring of three years of sub-metered lighting energy end-use. The results showed that when the occupants had access to the lighting switches while BMS managed the operational lighting schedule, the office area with the responsible occupant saved 23.2% compared to the pre-retrofit phase. For the second lighting retrofit phase when the occupants did not have access to the light switches, the lighting schedule operated for more than two hours after the typical work day and the occupant was not able to turn off the lights upon departure. It should be noted that there are limited numbers of studies that consider three years sub-metered lighting retrofit data with the presented granularities in this study. Similar lighting retrofit projects could benefit from the findings of this study. Finally, the results of this sub-metered lighting data could address uncertainty in the selection of lighting power density and associated schedules of building energy simulations." .

Architectural form-making is becoming more dynamic and expressive in today’s world, deviating from traditional designs, especially in urban contexts. Current technology enables such forms to be created, but prior to their construction there is no easy way to determine how they might affect the stress levels of the people who experience the redesigned environment. The physical geography of cities is already known to have an effect on human well-being, and specific design issues have been correlated with negative health outcomes, including increased levels of anxiety. However, the positive or negative changes that can be induced through new designs are often just a matter of speculation. Our research helps to address this issue by developing a prototype interface to evaluate human-experience factors during the design review process. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate biometric data obtained from participants through an Augmented Reality experience, and parsed that data with respect to the participants’ personal backgrounds and other demographic information. The prototype toolset was developed based on three different architectural variables—shape, height, and visual pattern. The results from the experiment indicate there is a relationship between these architectural forms and stress levels. This research contributes to design pedagogy and practice, and it helps to show how continuous parametric form generation can be used to better reduce anxiety levels in future urban environments." .

In particular, the energy demand for cooling in the residential sector is increasing due to the large occupancy floor area and high usage of air conditioning. Minimizing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions is one of the highest priority goals set for national energy management strategies in developed countries including Canada. In this study, a framework based on the life cycle assessment approach is developed to assess the environmental impacts of different building cooling systems, namely conventional snow storage system, watertight snow storage system, high-density snow storage system, and the conventional chiller cooling system. Moreover, all these systems have varying energy requirements and associated environmental impacts during different phases (extraction and construction, utilization, and end of life) of the life cycle of a building. A low-rise residential building in Kelowna (BC, Canada) has been selected for the pragmatic application of the proposed framework. The annual cooling energy demand for the building is estimated for different phases. Subsequently, the life cycle impact assessment has been carried out using SimaPro 8.1 software and TRACI 2.1 method. For sustainability evaluation of different cooling systems over their life cycle, multi-criteria decision analysis has been employed using the ‘Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE II).’ The results showed that the snow storage systems tend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and associated environmental impacts more than the conventional system." .

We have shown that the buildings are occupied by a single nymph, male or female, which increases the height of its turret each night by about 3 cm, during a short active growing phase. The nymph softens and reshapes the apex by pushing upwards a lump of freshly mixed soaked clay, without any opening present, i. e., without ever exposing itself to the outside. We also established that the nymph is very active once its building is achieved. For example, it restores the height of the turret to its original value when shortening and opens the top of its building in case of variation of environmental parameters. Finally, we have shown how the nymph opens its edifice to reach the outside for molting into an adult stage (imago).

The drive to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the development of advanced computational methods for energy efficient design, management and control of buildings and systems. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are the major source of energy consumption in buildings and ideal candidates for substantial reductions in energy demand. Significant advances have been made in the past decades on the application of computational intelligence (CI) techniques for HVAC design, control, management, optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis. This article presents a comprehensive and critical review on the theory and applications of CI techniques for prediction, optimization, control and diagnosis of HVAC systems. The analysis of trends reveals that the minimisation of energy consumption was the key optimization objective in the reviewed research, closely followed by the optimization of thermal comfort, indoor air quality and occupant preferences. Hardcoded Matlab program was the most widely used simulation tool, followed by TRNSYS, EnergyPlus, DOE-2, HVACSim+ and ESP-r. Metaheuristic algorithms were the preferred CI method for solving HVAC related problems and in particular genetic algorithms were applied in most of the studies. Despite the low number of studies focussing on multi-agent systems (MAS), as compared to the other CI techniques, interest in the technique is increasing due to their ability of dividing and conquering an HVAC optimization problem with enhanced overall performance. The paper also identifies prospective future advancements and research directions." .

As such, the purpose of this study was to explore designers’ perspectives on if and how decisions made during the design process for interior textiles may impact human health and the environment throughout the product life cycle, and if and how these decisions may be influenced by the engagement with and/or responsibilities toward stakeholders. This research was informed by multiple frameworks, including the design for the environment (DfE), product life cycle assessment (LCA), and stakeholder theory. Data were collected using an interpretive, qualitative research method that involved in-depth interviews with 12 US designers/design managers who specialize in the development of residential and/or commercial interior textiles. Findings revealed that participants demonstrated professional understanding of human health and environmental issues during the preliminary stages of the life cycle, including raw material selection, textile fabrication, and finishes and treatments, whereas understanding of such issues at the later stages of the life cycle (packaging and transportation, consumer care, and post use) tended to be more theoretical rather than strategic. Findings also revealed differences among designers employed by DfE-oriented companies and designers employed at more conventional companies with respect to their apparent understanding of how decisions made during the design process may impact human health and the environment throughout the product life cycle. This research contributes to our understanding of the role that designers may play in mitigating the negative impacts of interior textiles throughout the product life cycle. A limitation of this study is the size of the sample; conclusions are based upon the insights gained from 12 designers of interior textile products, and thus may not be generalizable to all designers/companies in the residential and/or commercial interior textile industry." .

The growing population demands more built environment to accommodate the socioeconomic wellbeing. Adopting conventional construction practices would continue the aforementioned issues. Therefore, it is important to integrate life cycle thinking into building construction to minimize its social, environmental, and economic impacts. The objective of this study is to assess the life cycle impact of commonly used wall–roof systems for low rise commercial building construction in Canada. A framework is developed to assess different building alternatives using the triple bottom line of sustainability. Identified environmental and socioeconomic impact indicators are eventually aggregated to develop a life cycle impact index. Material quantities of six wall–roof combinations for a single-storey commercial building were obtained from industrial partners. State-of-the-art life cycle assessment software is used to assess the life cycle impacts of different wall–roof systems. To accommodate decision makers’ preferences of sustainability, wall–roof combinations are assessed for three potential scenarios namely, eco-centric, neutral, and economy-centric using multi-criteria decision analysis. The framework has also been implemented on a case study of low rise building in Calgary (Alberta, Canada) to evaluate its practicality. The study results revealed that the concrete–steel building is the most sustainable alternative in neutral and economy-centric scenario while steel–wood building is the most sustainable building in eco-centric scenario." .

The paper reports an attempt of designing nearly zero energy buildings using end-of-life shipping containers named HPP, which can be used for emergency housing scopes, but also for forestries and low cost housing projects. These devices were analyzed from an energy, environmental and lighting point of view using respectively EnergyPlus, SimaPro and DIALux. For each case study, three different floor areas, i.e. 14 m2 (S type), 7 m2 (XS) and 5.6 m2 (XXS), and three wall coatings (Corten steel, Corian and wood) were considered. The key aspect of HPPs is the use of moving furniture attached to horizontal rails fixed on the ceilings; it allows to modify the room usage by changing the allocation of the indoor elements. Each HPP is equipped with PV modules and a rainwater recovering system. Energy demand of HPPs was simulated in unsteady regime taking into account thermal insulation of the envelope and HVAC system characteristics. Lighting systems were designed to guarantee adequate indoor illuminance values considering different furniture configurations and the effect of natural and artificial light. A cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the HPP module was performed to assess the potential environmental impacts in terms of primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Sound insulation of one HPP configuration was also assessed. The simulations demonstrate that the HPP modules solution can be considered a nearly zero energy building and they are also able to guarantee a comfortable living not only for short-term periods, in particular the largest one." .

TOC is used to discover contradictions and TRIZ is used to solve the conflicts in the process of product conceptual design, so we describe a process model to realize the theoretical interaction based on TRIZ and TOC. Beginning with the interaction between users and product to be designed, this paper makes a survey of user demand, summarizes in which stage of product development is and analyzes the directions of product technology evolution by selecting evolution routes of technical system. After design conflicts in product system are determined, the designer achieve the solutions of each sub-function of product according to their experience and heuristic association by using TRIZ tools. Designers let the users select the sub-function solutions from the morphological matrix and combine into a few suitable programs. Finally, the designer conduct program evaluation to obtain the optimal product solution by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). As a case study, an innovative design of the UV lampblack purification machine has been achieved with application of the process model." .

Routledge, New York, 2014) asserts that each layer of an instructional design is related to a body of theory closely associated with the concerns of that particular layer. This study focuses on one layer, the control layer, examining potential candidates for layer-related theory to determine the validity of this claim. In the process of completing this study, the authors came to the realization that what they considered a relatively uncharismatic and uncomplicated layer actually holds the key to a better understanding of interactivity, interface design, and the design of more conversational instructional experiences." .

After the fall of communism, the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of hundreds of thousands of flats that were constructed and owned by the state was transferred to their occupants. In the capital, Tirana, there was also a huge wave of new condominium construction after 1990. A new law on the management and maintenance of condominium building was recently adopted and is in the early stages of implementation. This article discusses how residents of condominiums actually manage the maintenance of their buildings in Tirana. It reveals that condominium laws have had little impact and that the performance of maintenance tasks is based on informal and often ad-hoc agreements, in keeping with the cultural norms of the society and the actual financial situation of the residents." .

Inattention to the array of values of heritage sites leads to the supremacy of a number of them and provides a controversy story of the archaeological site in question. Any heritage management and interpretation effort should correctly identify the different values of the site. Indeed, there is a need to manage and interpret the sites in a way to address the connection between the sites-based values and the associated and surrounding features. In current heritage management practice, values and values-based management are considered to be one of the most important approaches for the management of archaeological heritage. This study aims to understand how the values of the archaeological site of Umm Qais in northern Jordan can be adequately managed as both a natural and cultural landscape. At issue are conflicting views over the different values, their meaning and their uses by the different stakeholders. This research focuses on the ways in which these values are managed and interpreted to the public and whether it is done properly and in a fair manner. The fieldwork study led to a more complex understanding of how conflicting perceptions of values of Umm Qais as a national heritage site by the different stakeholders have affected implementation of management and interpretation projects. The results presented here indicate that the heritage management approach from the case study of Umm Qais focuses specifically on values associated with the physical archaeological aspect of the site, while those associated with the historic neighborhood of the site are neglected. The interpretation of the site has frequently focused on certain aspects of values at the expense of others. Information and insights gained from this study and specific suggestions for changing approaches are considered with regard to potential impacts on the management of the archaeological site and with regard to the public in general." .

Four representative federal public housing villas built between 1980s and 2010s were modeled and analyzed. The Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES-VE) energy modeling software was used to estimate the energy consumption and savings due to different refurbishment configurations applied to the villas. The refurbishment technical configurations were based on the UAE’s Estidama green buildings sustainability assessment system. The refurbishment configurations include upgrading three elements: the wall and roof insulation as well as replacing the glazing. The annual electricity savings results indicated that the most cost-efficient refurbishment strategy is upgrading of wall insulation (savings up to 20.8 %) followed by upgrading the roof’s insulation (savings up to 11.6 %) and lastly replacing the glazing (savings up to 3.2 %). When all three elements were refurbished simultaneously, savings up to 36.7 % were achieved (villa model 670). The savings translated to CO2 emission reduction of 22.6 t/year. The simple and discounted payback periods for the different configurations tested ranged between 8 and 28 and 10 and 50 years, respectively." .

These factors include aspects such as weather dependence, user behaviour, socio-economic situation, type of the energy installations and typology of buildings. The high number of factors increases the complexity of analysis and leads to a lack of confidence in the results of the energy simulation analysis. This fact grows when we move one step up and perform global analysis of blocks of buildings. The aim of this study is to report a new methodology for the assessment of the energy performance of large groups of buildings when considering the real use of energy. We combine two clustering methods, Generative Topographic Mapping and k-means, to obtain reference dwellings that can be considered as representative of the different energy patterns and energy systems of the neighbourhood. Then, simulation of energy demand and indoor temperature against the monitored comfort conditions in a short period is performed to obtain end use load disaggregation. This methodology was applied in a district at Terrassa City (Spain), and six reference dwellings were selected. Results showed that the method was able to identify the main patterns and provide occupants with feasible recommendations so that they can make required decisions at neighbourhood level. Moreover, given that the proposed method is based on the comparison with similar buildings, it could motivate building occupants to implement community improvement actions, as well as to modify their behaviour." .

In our theory we obtain a genuine energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field and a genuine energy-momentum conservation law for the system of the interacting gravitational, Maxwell and Dirac fields. Moreover, the energy-momentum tensors of the Maxwell and Dirac fields are symmetric, and it is shown that the equations of motion for the gravitational potentials are equivalent to Einstein equation of General Relativity. Precisely, the Einstein equation in which the second member is the sum of the energy-momentum tensors of the Maxwell, Dirac and the interaction Maxwell–Dirac fields all defined in an effective Lorentzian spacetime whose use is eventually no more than a question of mathematical convenience." .

Moisture also has an impact on the indoor air quality and the hygrothermal comfort of the building’s occupants. To better assess these pathologies, it is necessary to take into account the heat and moisture transfer between the building envelope and its indoor ambience. In this work, a new methodology was developed to predict the overall behavior of buildings, which combines two simulation tools: COMSOL Multiphysics© and TRNSYS. The first software is used for the modeling of heat, air and moisture transfer in multilayer porous walls (HAM model: Heat, Air and Moisture transfer), and the second is used to simulate the hygrothermal behavior of the building (BES model: Building Energy Simulation). The combined software applications dynamically solve the mass and energy conservation equations of the two physical models. The HAM-BES coupling efficiency was verified. In this paper, the use of a coupled (HAM-BES) co-simulation for the prediction of the hygrothermal behavior of building envelopes is discussed. Furthermore, the effect of the 2D HAM modeling on relative humidity variations within the building ambience is shown. The results confirm the importance of the HAM modeling in the envelope on the hygrothermal behavior and energy demand of buildings." .

Based on the feedback from over 319,000 visitors at 791 locations, we create an index that shows the extent to which World Heritage sites are actually branding themselves as such. We find great heterogeneity throughout the list and explain this econometrically with site-specific incentives. Notably, the sites that benefit more from the World Heritage brand are significantly more willing to contribute to the collective brand than sites that benefit less. Specifically, rural sites are much better branded than urban sites, as rural sites benefit more from the brand than urban sites. We also find a positive relationship between World Heritage branding and its conservation status and a U-shaped relationship between a site’s visitor numbers and its branding. Furthermore, Asian sites are much better branded than sites in the Middle East, and richer countries and those with already more international tourists are branded less. The difficulty of effective branding, e.g., for large, open-access sites, has no significant effect. Our findings suggest that mandatory World Heritage branding obligations would have a positive effect on the World Heritage brand equity, bringing conservation and economic benefits to a much wider range of World Heritage sites." .

It operated between 1904 and 1927 in the Otway Ranges, southwest of Melbourne. Survey and excavation of the site in 1997 and 1998 yielded evidence of architectural layout and consumption practices. Spatial analysis of the mill examines the structure and pattern of housing, the nature and distribution of amenities, and movement between the site and nearby townships. Workers and residents were both isolated from and integrated with the wider world, continually negotiating the use of space within their homes, around the camp, and beyond." .

Since a building is not always constructed exactly as the design information specifies, there will be discrepancies between a BIM created in the design phase (called as‐designed BIM) and the as‐built conditions. Point clouds captured by laser scans can be used as a reference to update an as‐designed BIM into an as‐built BIM (i.e., the BIM that captures the as‐built information). Occlusions and construction progress prevent a laser scan performed at a single point in time to capture a complete view of building components. Progressively scanning a building during the construction phase and combining the progressively captured point cloud data together can provide the geometric information missing in the point cloud data captured previously. However, combining all point cloud data will result in large file sizes and might not always guarantee additional building component information. This paper provides the details of an approach developed to help engineers decide on which progressively captured point cloud data to combine in order to get more geometric information and eliminate large file sizes due to redundant point clouds." .

The method was developed for the U.S. Building Energy Asset Score, a whole-building energy efficiency rating system focusing on building envelope, mechanical systems, and lighting systems. The Asset Score is based on simulated energy use under standard operating conditions. Existing weather normalization methods such as those based on heating and cooling degrees days are not robust enough to adjust all climatic factors such as humidity and solar radiation. In this work, over 1000 sets of climate coefficients were developed to separately adjust building heating, cooling, and fan energy use at each weather station in the United States. This paper also presents a robust, standardized weather station mapping based on climate similarity rather than choosing the closest weather station. This proposed simulated-based climate adjustment was validated through testing on several hundreds of thousands of modeled buildings. Results indicated the developed climate coefficients can adjust the climate variations to enable a fair comparison of building energy efficiency." .

However, their design, construction and operation present several critical challenges. In particular, the considerable load reductions are not always compatible with the increased level of comfort expected in modern houses. Tropical climates, meanwhile, should be more amenable to the implementation of positive energy houses for two reasons. Firstly, negligible heating is generally required as compared to colder climates, where the heating energy requirements are considerable. Then, renewable energy resources are usually abundant in tropical climates. This paper investigates the feasibility of positive energy residential buildings in the tropical island of Mauritius. A baseline model representing a typical Mauritian house is designed using DesignBuilder software. The energy efficiency of the model is then optimised by investigating a whole range of passive building design strategies, many of them adapted from vernacular architecture. Results reveal that the application of passive strategies such as shading, insulation and natural ventilation have precluded the need for artificial cooling and ventilation in the positive energy (PE) house. The resulting electricity consumption of the house decreases from 24.14 to 14.30 kWh/m2/year. A 1.2 kW photovoltaic system provides the most cost-effective solution to exceed the annual electricity requirements of the house." .

Setting up a scene is a very similar process to architectural planning, made of plans, sections and executive details of each element, in order to create a physical space but having the sole purpose of giving back a global image of itself, exactly coincident with the planned sketch. However, this design complexity is rarely highlighted by scholars, who end up commenting that the sketch is just like a perspective painted image, without reading the need for transposition into the physical space of the stage, that instead affects many compositional choices and exceptions, hidden in the apparent harmony of the general overall picture. In particular, we’ll examine Ferdinando Galli Bibiena’s treatise, L’architettura civile preparata su la geometria e ridotta alle prospettive (1711), which carefully describes the aforementioned stage design complexity." .

The critical political situation in the country urges the development of cultural heritage management policies in order to protect it more thoroughly and consistently. Moving on from the numerous international initiatives and projects dealing with a mostly “remote” approach to the issue, the project here presented to engages with staff members of the Department of Antiquities (DoA) in the development of a joint strategy for the application of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) to the preservation and monitoring of Libyan cultural heritage. A series of training courses resulted in an initial development of new ways of recording and analysing field data for a better awareness of the full range of threats that the archaeology of the country is subject to. Focussing on the case of the Jebel Nafusa, the training involved the assessment of site visibility on satellite imagery, the analysis of high-resolution satellite datasets for archaeological mapping, the creation of a GIS spatial database of field data, and the mapping of risks and threats to archaeology from remote sensing data. This led to the creation of of a risk map showing the areas that are affected by a number of threats, thus giving the DoA a tool to prioritise future fieldwork to keep the assessment of site damage up to date. Only a collaborative approach can lead to a sustainable strategy for the protection of the invaluable cultural heritage of Libya." .

Categorization of better performing kitchens from this derivative matrix enabled in deriving the built parameter thresholds for a ‘better’ kitchen design. This derived kitchen showed 60 % reduction in PM2.5 peak concentration during cooking hours. The evaluation described here is essentially a “proof of concept”, that effective building design can be an alternative way to reduce HAP without the introduction of chimneys, improved cookstoves or shifting to cleaner fuel." .

In parallel, across the landscape, urban, architectural and interior design disciplines, there has been a growing acceptance that a balance of spatial characteristics—including prospect, refuge, mystery and complexity—is desirable in a natural, urban or interior environment. Yet, the evidence that the design disciplines cite for the desirability of these characteristics is often entirely qualitative and only rarely acknowledges the results from the fields of spatial psychology and environmental preference theory. MethodsThe purpose of this paper is to provide a critical overview of the results of quantitative research which has been undertaken into the veracity of prospect-refuge theory and closely associated aspects of environmental preference theory. This meta-analysis not only involves a review of the results, but also their broad classification to develop a more holistic picture of the field, its findings and any gaps. The purpose of this process is not, explicitly at least, to assess the believability or rigour of this past research, but rather to examine and classify the findings, both for and against prospect-refuge theory, in a way that is useful for the design disciplines. ResultsUrban and interior studies supported the significance of prospect, and were more neutral about refuge. Studies related to natural environments provided evidence for the significance of both prospect and refuge, which has been linked to comfort, but also included evidence against and a neutral finding. More specifically for designers, the results for complexity seem to confirm that a degree of complexity in interior space is preferred, but they are unclear about how much or where it should be. The results for mystery are less emphatic with the majority being neutral or contrary. Discussion and ConclusionsThe quantitative evidence for prospect-refuge theory remains inconsistent. It is especially problematic that the results which are most commonly cited in architecture relate to studies of natural environments, not interiors or urban environments. As this paper demonstrates, the results are most valid in specific venues." .

After successful implementation of lean principles to the manufacturing sector, researchers have been trying to apply lean principles to the construction sector. However, construction is completely different from manufacturing. Prefabricated and industrialized buildings bear a striking resemblance to manufacturing due to completing most processes in the factory environment. This paper uses value stream mapping (VSM) as a lean technique in the production phase of Pprefabricated steel frames (PSFs) in a case study. The case includes construction of three 16-story residential buildings made of PSFs with bolt and nut connections in Iran. The production processes are investigated, and the current state of the production line is examined. The VSM uses elaboration of maps to identify the current state of production, diagnose wastes and their root causes, and finally, propose improvements in the future state. To investigate the productivity of the production line and implement lean principles, discrete event simulation (DES) was carried out. After identifying and reducing some of the wastes in the current state, the future state was modeled. The results showed 34 % reduction in the lead time of production and 16 % reduction of costs. These results support the hypothesis that lean principles can be successfully applied to industrialized and prefabricated construction." .

Possible market potentials are calculated with the aid of a scenario which can also be adapted in the context of individual scenarios based on the given data. The study makes it clear that TCC is not only to be evaluated technologically (R + D, standards etc.); market development depends at least as much on soft (social) factors. In part, this concerns the identity of timber construction itself, which must deconstruct the mindsets that have formed over decades in the wood-based sector and are communicated in marketing. At the same time, a co-operation between concrete and timber constructors becomes necessary, which experts call a “clash of cultures.”" .

Technologies are changing the role of such spaces, allowing a more in-depth knowledge diffusion and social interactions. Static places become dynamic cultural environments in which people can discover and share new knowledge. Nowadays, cultural heritage is approaching to a new digital era in which people become active elements, as recipients of the actions ensuring the sustainability of such heritage, both moneywise but also simply as the perceived quality of life. In this perspective, this paper presents a novel recommender system to individual and people group in order to create a social recommendation service for cultural ICT applications. As key aspect of the presented work, we introduce a method for discovering and exploiting social affinity between users based on artwork features and user experience. In addition, we propose an architecture of the recommender system related with the affinity and discuss the architecture in terms of sparsity, group recommendation, and sustainability." .

This issue is important because it will improve the application of thermal indices in predicting the thermal perception of tourists. This study aims to compare the differences in thermal perception and preferences between local and overseas visitors to the Royal Botanic Garden (RBG) in Melbourne during summer. An 8-day survey was conducted in February 2014 at four sites in the garden (n = 2198), including 2 days with maximum temperature exceeding 40 °C. The survey results were compared with data from four weather stations adjacent to the survey locations. One survey location, ‘Fern Gully’, has a misting system and visitors perceived the Fern Gully to be cooler than other survey locations. As the apparent temperature exceeded 32.4 °C, visitors perceived the environment as being ‘warm’ or ‘hot’. At ‘hot’ conditions, 36.8 % of European visitors voted for no change to the thermal conditions, which is considerably higher than the response from Australian visitors (12.2 %) and Chinese visitors (7.5 %). Study results suggest that overseas tourists have different comfort perception and preferences compared to local Australians in hot weather based at least in part on expectations. Understanding the differences in visitors’ thermal perception is important to improve the garden design. It can also lead to better tour planning and marketing to potential visitors from different countries." .

Having been the anchor of Penn Square, the city’s physical and social center, the Watt and Shand was perceived by many as a central component of local identity formation, reflecting not only its importance as a manifestation of tangible heritage, but its importance as an arena for the negotiation of the intangible heritage of ritualized consumerism. This article examines the processes of heritage creation and urban renewal by exploring the closing of the Watt and Shand Building, how and why alternative uses of the building were negotiated, and how an alternative heritage narrative emerged through an archaeological investigation of the homes of a radical congressman, Thaddeus Stevens, and his African American associate, Lydia Hamilton Smith." .

Research conducted in the past has included surveying plug load equipment, measuring plug load electricity consumption and equipment operating patterns, and studying plug load reduction solutions in office buildings, but plug load energy use across other building types is poorly understood. A university campus, which houses many building types, presents a unique opportunity to understand plug load profiles across building types. In this study, an equipment inventory was performed in 220 buildings on Stanford University’s campus, totaling 8,901,911 ft2 of building space and encompassing lab buildings, office buildings, recreation facilities, public space, and service buildings. Within these buildings, 110,529 pieces of plug load equipment were recorded. Energy consumption estimates were developed from published values and used to evaluate the aggregate plug load energy consumption of this equipment by equipment type and by building type. In total, it is estimated that the plug loads from these buildings consume nearly 50 million kWh per year and comprise 32% of the electricity consumption of the buildings surveyed. This data can be used to better target energy conservation efforts throughout multiple sectors." .

In contrast, most geoscientists are convinced that geology can be practised on an everyday basis, as it is part of our daily life as a facet of the natural environment that humans have used for 100 s of thousands of years. Even in places where the natural world seems far from its original condition, one can still experience geology. This consideration is of increasing importance, as today, more than half the world’s population lives in towns and cities. In this context, we can still present geology to an interested public through establishing leisure walks, either guiding or using leaflets, easily carried booklets and even web ‘apps’. The style chosen aims to be accessible to a broader public, but crucially, in an urban context, there should always be an aim to demonstrate the relationship between geology and society, as well as architecture and history. Indeed, the realisation of many participants in such activities that building stones can belong to, and provide evidence of, both a natural and a built heritage can be a revelation." .

Using examples from Morven, the utility of several are surveyed here. Of particular service was the practice of recording elevations as feet (ft.) above-sea-level readings; it permitted planned variations in garden contours (i.e., terraces, falls, sunken groves, drainage grading) to be observed across wide areas of the site. The system of measurement used in the 18th century, based on Renaissance surveying techniques, and knowledge of its use in designing gardens, enables modern archaeologists to predict where key elements of older landscapes may be found below ground. Other methods discussed include the use of the split spoon auger, the steel T-probe, post hole digger, backhoe trenching, checkerboard excavation, and areal excavation. While none is particularly unique or innovative, using them in combination provides the archaeologist with powerful tools for interpretation of buried historic landscapes." .

However, user evaluations of passive houses that solely employ air heating indicate that bathrooms are often perceived as too cold and bedrooms as too warm. Based on these experiences, the functional requirement of providing thermal comfort using only air heating has not been adopted in the Norwegian standard for passive houses. Instead, usually local heat sources are installed in living rooms and bathrooms to facilitate temperature zoning within the dwelling. The questions asked in this study are how well this heating and ventilation concept functions in practice from the occupants’ point of view and whether it provides thermal comfort in the various rooms. Therefore, a questionnaire was distributed to the occupants of a typical multifamily passive house project in Norway. Despite the small sample size, the findings give important insight into the residents’ perception of the thermal conditions and clearly demonstrate the limitations of the heating and ventilation solution. Based on the results, the need for further development and further studies to provide temperature zoning is outlined." .

Such regions constitute a space with characteristics of an eco-cultural subregion and they do not have any administrative or geographical boundaries. Aims of this study are to introduce the concept of eco-cultural subregion, which is the holistic expression of natural features together with cultural heritage, to the literature; to present a method in identifying geographical boundaries of subregions; and to formulate a classification system. The research was conducted in the Phrygian Valley, which is one of the most important centres of ancient Phrygians in Western Anatolia, using a method based on GIS-MCDM (Geographic Information System-Multiple Criteria Decision Making). The selected MCDM technique was Simos Procedure. Natural features and cultural heritage were considered together and the entire Phrygian Valley was approached as both an ecological and a cultural region. Ecological features were analysed using 7 main and 17 subfactors, while cultural heritage was analysed using 2 main factors and 15 subfactors. Simos Procedure was employed in the assignment of weight for main factors and subfactors. First 17 ecological subregions with similar characteristics under 4 levels were identified. Considering their cultural heritage values, a classification system was formulated and eco-cultural subregions were expressed in level/degree in this system. In consequence of this procedure boundaries of eco-cultural subregions were drawn and mapped. This classification also enabled to identify the concept of eco-cultural subregion which is not found in the literature. It is expected that eco-cultural subregions will provide to discuss ecological features and cultural heritage holistically in conservation and planning studies." .

The bullet concentrations surround four large piles of river cobbles and associated wood fragments. Later research suggested the features represent two distinct firing range complexes, each comprised of multiple target positions and at least one firing position. The cobble piles and wood are believed to be remains of target markers’ shelters. Feature SC-2 provides significant evidence supporting this hypothesis but appears to exhibit an atypical style of architecture. Historical investigation validates Feature SC-2’s geographic location, while artifact analysis dates the feature to the period of Fort Fred Steele’s military occupation. An in-situ fired bullet in direct contact with wooden architecture, a brief metal-detecting survey, and a firing range model further corroborate the identification of Feature SC-2 as a target marker’s shelter on an established firing range." .

A pre-investigation concerning the diagnosis of damage phenomena and the risk assessment of interventions is a crucial aspect for the success of a restoration campaign. The question of “How to optimally preserve a monument within its current conditions” is replaced by “How can a monument optimally perform in the conditions suited to the assigned rehabilitation project”. Today historic farms and their surroundings, after being abandoned for several decades, are the subject of different types of private or commercial rehabilitation projects. An example of such a project is the farm “Hof De Pleyne” in Loppem (West-Flanders, Belgium). The project intended to integrate a restaurant kitchen into the former animal barn. The limits of salt content with respect to the desired rehabilitation facilities while respecting safety regulations are presented." .

This study investigates the impact of photovoltaic canopy shade and tree shade on thermal comfort through meteorological observations and field surveys at a pedestrian mall on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus. During the course of 1 year, on selected clear calm days representative of each season, we conducted hourly meteorological transects from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and surveyed 1284 people about their thermal perception, comfort, and preferences. Shade lowered thermal sensation votes by approximately 1 point on a semantic differential 9-point scale, increasing thermal comfort in all seasons except winter. Shade type (tree or solar canopy) did not significantly impact perceived comfort, suggesting that artificial and natural shades are equally efficient in hot dry climates. Globe temperature explained 51 % of the variance in thermal sensation votes and was the only statistically significant meteorological predictor. Important non-meteorological factors included adaptation, thermal comfort vote, thermal preference, gender, season, and time of day. A regression of subjective thermal sensation on physiological equivalent temperature yielded a neutral temperature of 28.6 °C. The acceptable comfort range was 19.1 °C–38.1 °C with a preferred temperature of 20.8 °C. Respondents exposed to above neutral temperature felt more comfortable if they had been in air-conditioning 5 min prior to the survey, indicating a lagged response to outdoor conditions. Our study highlights the importance of active solar access management in hot urban areas to reduce thermal stress." .

Bike Score® is a metric capturing environmental characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between and within-city variability in cycling behavior. MethodsWe used linear regression to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities. ResultsAt the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 % (95 % CI: 0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 %) in many North American cities. Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores (>90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 % higher (β = 4.0, 95 % CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0–25). City specific analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 %. ConclusionsThe Bike Score metric was associated bicycle mode share between and within cities, suggesting its utility for planning bicycle infrastructure." .

In such conditions, a person’s energy balance is not disturbed because of stresses from extreme heat or cold. Bioclimatic structure has been well researched and should be a consideration in the planning process for arranging comfortable spaces. It represents the understanding that energy balance is one of the basic elements of a sustainable landscape design. The goals of this study have been to create ideal places for human thermal comfort and to advance objectives focused on the importance of sustainable and ecological landscape planning and design work, along with their accompanying economic benefits. In this study, which focuses on the climate of the Province of Aydin, the most suitable areas for bioclimatic comfort have been identified. The climate values for the Aydin Province have been taken from a total of 22 meteorological stations. Stations at altitudes ranging from 11 to 871 m were used to note the climate changes that occurred. The average temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed from each station, including data collected using Geographic Information System (GIS) software, were transferred. GIS maps were then created from the imported data, and areas of optimal comfort around the city of Aydin were determined. The results show the range that is suitable for a bioclimatic comfort zone in Aydin. The bioclimatic comfort range was determined to be roughly 17 °C for Aydin, and the city of Aydin demonstrated a comfort range between 14 and 19 °C. As a result, the city of Aydin was shown to be a suitable area for bioclimatic comfort." .

This paper uses semi-structured interviews and agency consultations to supplement document reviews and news paper articles to address the dearth of research on the subject in Ghana. Findings show that dominant political elites, with little or no urban planning background, control and dictate urban planning activities resulting in chaotic scenes and urban blight across Ghanaian cities. Analyses here reinforce the growing recognition that urban planning outcomes in Ghana, and most African countries are not shaped by professional practice and do not reflect the aspirations of the community, but instead political elites. Urban planning agencies are left vulnerable as their activities are interfered, dictated and hindered by both traditional and mainstream political elites. This paper advocates for independence of urban planning agencies in the performance of their duties." .

There is considerable evidence, however, that occupants do not understand the principles of how buildings function and that they use the systems non-optimally. The purpose of the paper is to quantify the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption and show how it is affected by design strategies. Numerical simulations of an office were performed with the dynamic thermal simulation software TRNSYS. Three types of behaviour (‘careless’, ‘normal’, and ‘conscious’) and two types of design (‘ordinary’ and ‘robust’) were considered. The results show that the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption is greatly diminished with robust design solutions, solutions that make buildings less sensitive to occupant behaviour. The careless user consumes 75–79 % less energy if the robust design solutions are applied rather than the ordinary design solutions. It is argued that a realistic view of occupant behaviour is advantageous in the creation of energy-efficient buildings (that is, leaving less need to learn how buildings work, to be motivated to save energy, or to perform specific energy-saving actions). However, the possibility of personal control should not be eliminated." .

In order to quantify the energy and material inputs and environmental releases associated with each stage of construction sector, life cycle energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and cost analysis of contemporary residential buildings have been conducted within two parts. MethodsThis paper is the first part of the study which includes the literature review and methodology used for such a comprehensive analysis. It was determined that there are three basic methods used in life cycle analysis: process analysis, input–output (I–O) analysis, and hybrid analysis. In this study, Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE) is used for the calculation of primary energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. The second part of this study is about the application of the methodology which considers two actual buildings constructed in Gaziantep, Turkey. Results and discussionThe proposed research focused on building construction, operating, and demolition phases. Energy efficiency, emission parameters, and costs are defined for the building per square meter basis. It is seen that the primary energy use and emissions of residential buildings around the world falls in the range of about 10 to 40 GJ/m2 and 1–10 t CO2/m2 respectively. ConclusionsThe literature survey demonstrates that there are limited number of studies about life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) of residential buildings in the world. It was decided to use the ICE database as it is one of the most comprehensive databases for building materials, globally. The results of the study show that minimizing energy, material, and land use by considering potential impacts to the environment on a life cycle basis are the basic steps in designing an energy-efficient and environmental-friendly building." .
