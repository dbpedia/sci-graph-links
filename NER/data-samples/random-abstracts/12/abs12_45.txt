Abstract This paper builds a weighted bus adjacency-stop complex network model of Qingdao city based on the dynamic travel time between each two adjacent stops, using bus system data from 2014.09 to 2015.09, including 261 lines, 1758 stations and 1 billion arrival time of all the buses, provided by Urban Public Transport Development Research Institute of Qingdao. Based on this model, this paper have analyzed the static topological properties of Qingdao bus network, and also studied the features of dynamic weighted network based on average travel time. Weighted average path length shows the characteristics of morning and evening peak in working days, but the standard deviation is 4 min, which reveals the difference of bus system running status between the peak and non-peak is not obvious. Combined with GIS, in this paper, temporal and spatial visual analyses for node strength, edge weight, and weighted average path length in a working day are carried out. The results prove that the morning and evening peak of Qingdao bus system mainly appears in the central areas of Shinan District and Shibei District, and the nodes with large carrying capacity are mainly distributed in the commercial activity center, train station and bus station, etc.
