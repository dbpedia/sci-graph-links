Nepal’s forests are particularly important to the nation’s poorest inhabitants, as many depend upon them for daily survival. Two-thirds of Nepal’s population relies on forests for sustenance, and these pressures are likely to increase in the future. This, coupled with high population densities and growth rates, highlights the importance of studying the relationship between human communities, forest cover trends through time, and forest management institutions. Here, we used surveys to explore how household attitudes associated with conservation-related behaviors in two rural communities—one that has experienced significant forest loss, and the other forest gain—compare with forest cover trends as indicated by satellite-derived forest-loss and -regeneration estimates between 2005 and 2013. Results found a significant difference in attitudes in the two areas, perhaps contributing to and reacting from current forest conditions. In both study sites, participation in community forestry strengthened support for conservation, forest conservation-related attitudes aligned with forest cover trends, and a negative relationship was found between economic status and having supportive forest conservation-related attitudes. In addition, on average, respondents were not satisfied with their district forest officers and did not feel that the current political climate in Nepal supported sustainable forestry. These findings are important as Nepal’s Master Plan for the Forestry Sector has expired and the country is in the process of structuring a new Forestry Sector Strategy." .

Our hypothesis was that tree species shape the non-mycorrhizal fungal assemblages in soil and litter and that the diversity of fungal communities in these two compartments is partly dependent on the coverage of trees in the Neotropical rainforest. In French Guiana, a long-term plantation and a natural forest were selected to test this hypothesis. Fungal ITS1 regions were sequenced from soil and litter samples from within the vicinity of tree species. A broad range of fungal taxa was found, with 42 orders and 14 classes. Significant spatial heterogeneity in the fungal communities was found without strong variation in the species richness and evenness among the tree plots. However, tree species shaped the fungal assemblages in the soil and litter, explaining up to 18 % of the variation among the communities in the natural forest. These results demonstrate that vegetation cover has an important effect on the structure of fungal assemblages inhabiting the soil and litter in Amazonian forests, illustrating the relative impact of deterministic processes on fungal community structures in these highly diverse ecosystems." .

Alluvial aquifers of gravel-bedded river floodplains present a conundrum: despite no possibility for photosynthesis in groundwater and extreme paucity of labile organic carbon, they support diverse and abundant large-bodied consumers (stoneflies, Insecta: Plecoptera). Here we show that up to a majority of the biomass carbon composition of these top consumers in four floodplain aquifers of Montana and Washington is methane-derived. The methane carbon ranges in age from modern to up to >50,000 years old and is mostly derived from biogenic sources, although a thermogenic contribution could not be excluded. We document one of the most expansive ecosystems to contain site-wide macroinvertebrate biomass comprised of methane-derived carbon and thereby advance contemporary understanding of basal resources supporting riverine productivity." .

However, a complete reinstatement of natural flow regimes is often unrealistic when balancing water needs for ecosystems, energy production, and other human uses. Thus, stakeholders must identify a prioritized subset of flow prescriptions that meet ecological objectives in light of realistic constraints. Yet, isolating aspects of flow regimes to restore downstream of hydropower facilities is among the greatest challenges of environmental flow science due, in part, to the sheer volume of available environmental flow tools in conjunction with complex negotiation-based regulatory procedures. Herein, we propose an organizational framework that structures information and existing flow paradigms into a staged process that assists stakeholders in implementing environmental flows for hydropower facilities. The framework identifies areas where regulations fall short of the needed scientific process, and provide suggestions for stakeholders to ameliorate those situations through advanced preparation. We highlight the strengths of existing flow paradigms in their application to hydropower settings and suggest when and where tools are most applicable. Our suggested framework increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the e-flow implementation process by rapidly establishing a knowledge base and decreasing uncertainty so more time can be devoted to filling knowledge gaps. Lastly, the framework provides the structure for a coordinated research agenda to further the science of environmental flows related to hydropower environments." .

It is still unknown how this huge microbial diversity, including many potentially competing organisms, may persist at a single site. One of plausible hypotheses is that a large number of spatially separated microcommunities exist within each complex habitat. Smaller subset of the species may exist in each microcommunity and actually interact with each other. We sampled two groups of microbial stalactites growing at a single acidic mine drainage outlet as a model of multiplicated, low-complexity microhabitat. Samples from six other sites were added for comparison. Both tRFLP and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing showed that microbial communities containing 6 to 51 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTU) inhabited all stalactites. Interestingly, most OTUs including the highly abundant ones unpredictably alternated regardless of physical and environmental distance of the stalactites. As a result, the communities clustered independently on sample site and other variables when using both phylogenetic dissimilarity and OTU abundance metrics. Interestingly, artificial communities generated by pooling the biota of several adjacent stalactites together clustered by the locality more strongly than when the stalactites were analyzed separately. The most probable interpretation is that each stalactite contains likely random selection from the pool of plausible species. Such degree of stochasticity in assembly of extremophilic microbial communities is significantly greater than commonly proposed and requires caution when interpreting microbial diversity." .

This study used three choice experiments (species-, guild-, and ecosystem-based surveys) in parallel to quantify non-use values for little-known aquatic species at risk in southern Ontario. Mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) ranged from $9.45 to $21.41 per listing status increment under Canada’s Species at Risk Act for both named and unnamed little-known species. Given the broad range of valuable ecosystem services likely to accrue to residents from substantial increases in water quality and the rehabilitation of coastal wetlands, the difference in WTP between species- and ecosystem-based surveys seemed implausibly small. It appeared that naming species—the ‘iconization’ of species in two of the three surveys—had an important effect on WTP. The results suggest that reasonable annual household-level WTP values for little-known aquatic species may be $10 to $25 per species or $10 to $20 per listing status increment. The results highlighted the utility of using parallel surveys to triangulate on non-use economic values for little-known species at risk." .

Indeed, the Pb concentrations in the liver and kidney tissues was with 31.4 and 60.3 mg kg−1 dry weight (dw), respectively, above concentrations considered as potentially toxic level in common birds (i.e. 30 mg kg−1). These Pb concentration may have possibly been associated with lethal toxicosis in this endangered species suggesting Pb as major threat for G. japonensis populations. Thus, the inputs of Pb into Zhalong Wetland should be reduced to maintain and reestablish environmental conditions supporting the population development of these migratory red-crowned cranes in the Zhalong Wetland, a critical crane habitat for the long-term sustainability of this species." .

Spatial variations in SOC, TN and TP concentrations and the factors affecting them were investigated using geostatistical analysis and stepwise linear regression, respectively. ResultsThe L. glaber–C. glauca forest exhibited higher coefficients of variation (CVs) of SOC (35 %) and TN (34 %) concentrations than the C. axillaris forest (27 % for SOC and 21 % for TN), but the CV of TP concentration in the L. glaber–C. glauca forest (17 %) was lower than that in the C. axillaris forest (24 %). Stand characteristics contributed the most to spatial variations in SOC and TP, while soil texture made the greatest contribution to variations in TN. Topography contributed the least to variations in SOC, TN and TP. ConclusionsStand characteristics, together with topography and soil texture, contributed to spatial variations in SOC, TN and TP concentrations. The contributions of stand characteristics differed in SOC, TN and TP due to their different cycling characteristics." .

Spotted salamanders (n = 17) were collected and examined for parasites and only three females harbored nematodes (Physaloptera spp.). Chronic aquatic bioassays were conducted using water collected from eight breeding ponds during different hydroperiod events. No lethal or sublethal effects were measured in Ceriodaphnia dubia; however, decreased growth and survival were seen in Pimephales promelas. Aqueous, sediment, and salamander hepatic samples were analyzed for As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Ni. Metal analysis revealed possible increased metal exposure following precipitation, with greatest metal concentrations measured in sediment samples. Hepatic metal concentrations were similar in parasitized and non-parasitized individuals, and greatest Pb concentrations were measured following normal precipitation events. Determining environmental stressors of amphibians, especially during their breeding and subsequent larval life stage, is imperative to improve species conservation." .

This study assessed changes in soil erosion for the years 1990, 2000 and 2012 as a result of such watershed management practices in Agula watershed using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation factors were computed in a geographic information system for 30 × 30 m raster layers using spatial data obtained from different sources. The results revealed significant reduction in soil loss rates by about 55 % from about 28 to 12 t ha−1 per year in 1990–2000 and an overall 64 % reduction from 28 to 10 t ha−1 per year in 1990–2012. This change in soil loss is attributed to improvement in surface cover and stone bund practices, which resulted in the decrease in mean C and P-factors, respectively, by about 19 % and 34 % in 1990–2000 and an overall decrease in C-factor by 29 % in 1990–2012. Considerable reductions in soil loss were observed from bare land (89 %), followed by cultivated land (56 %) and shrub land (49 %). Furthermore, the reduction in soil loss was more pronounced in steeper slopes where very steep slope and steep slope classes experienced over 70 % reduction. Validation of soil erosion estimations using field observed points showed an overall accuracy of 69 %, which is fairly satisfactory. This study demonstrated the potential of watershed management efforts to bring remarkable restoration of degraded semi-arid lands that could serve as a basis for sustainable planning of future developments of areas experiencing severe land degradation due to water erosion." .

Foliar P in corn (Zea mays L.) and changes in labile P in Aquic Hapludults were determined following P application of 0–560 kg P ha−1 as KH2PO4 and an application of Fe3+ (150 mg Fe3+ kg−1) in field mini-lysimeters to develop calibrations of soil and plant nutritional responses. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of uppermost leaves of plants at the V2, V5, and V8 stages showed that foliar P proportionally increased with addition rates. Exchangeable and enzyme-labile P forms were effective indicators of foliar XRFS-P for up to 30 days after emergence. Phosphorus calibration curves developed for flag leaves showed that spatial distribution of foliar P (3.6, 4.2, and 5.3 g kg−1) corresponded to field zones treated with 0, 15, and 30 kg P ha−1 as dairy manure P for the past 18 years. Up-to-date crop uptake and availability of P in these Hapludults were best described by a square root function of soil XRFS-P and total exchangeable inorganic P (r2 = 0.4; RMSE = 419 and 422 g ha−1, respectively). Therefore, a timely knowledge of canopy P status and its linkage to actual soil P status supports in situ element-specific sensing and precision nutrient management in order to manage the declining use-efficiency in crops and reduce potential loss to the environment." .

However, how small-scale impacts on plant diversity differ according to pine size and habitat context remains unclear. We assessed the effects of different stages of pine invasion on plant communities in forest and steppe sites located in southern Chile. In each site, we sampled plant diversity under and outside the canopy of Pinus contorta individuals, using paired plots. We assessed the relative impact of pine invasion on plant species richness and cover. In both sites, richness and cover beneath pine canopy decreased with increasing pine size (i.e. height and canopy area). A significant negative impact of pines on species richness and plant cover was detected for pines over 4 m in height. The impact of pines on plant richness and cover depended on pine size (i.e. canopy area) and habitat type. Larger pines had more negative impacts than smaller pines in both sites, with a greater impact for a given pine size in the Patagonian steppe compared to the A. araucaria forest. Species composition changed between under and outside canopy plots when pines were 4 m or taller. Pine presence reduced cover of most species. The impacts of pine invasions are becoming evident in forested and treeless ecosystems of southern Chile. Our results suggest that the magnitude of pine invasion impacts could be related to how adapted the invaded community is to tree cover, with the treeless environment more impacted by the invasion." .

Range shifts are expected to occur as species track their current climate niche yet the potential for exploitation of new ecological opportunities that may arise as ecosystems and communities remodel is rarely considered. Here we show that grasswrens of the Amytornis textilis-modestus complex responded to new ecological opportunities in Australia’s arid biome through shifts in habitat preference following the development of chenopod shrublands during the late Plio-Pleistocene. We find evidence of spatially explicit responses to climatically driven landscape changes including changes in niche width and patterns of population growth. Conservation of structural and functional aspects of the ancestral niche appear to have facilitated recent habitat shifts, while demographic responses to late Pleistocene climate change provide evidence for the greater resilience of populations inhabiting the recently evolved chenopod shrubland communities. Similar responses could occur under future climate change in species exposed to novel ecological conditions, or those already occupying spatially heterogeneous landscapes. Mechanistic models that consider structural and functional aspects of the niche along with regional hydro-dynamics may be better predictors of future climate responses in Australia’s arid biome than bioclimatic models alone." .

Gaertn., commonly known as shea tree or Vitellaria, is ranked the most important tree species of the savannah regions in the most African countries due to its ecological and economic importance for livelihoods and national economies. However, the savannah regions are the most vulnerable areas to the global climate change. Moreover, the Vitellaria populations on farmlands are threatened by the dominance of old trees with low or lack of regeneration. In this study both morphological and genetic diversity were assessed using several phenotypic traits and 10 microsatellite markers, respectively, to assess the impact of land use and agro-ecozone types on Vitellaria in Ghana. The land use types were forests and farmlands, and the agro-ecozone types included the Transitional, Guinea, and Sudan savannah zones. The mean values of morphological traits, such as diameter at breast height (DBH) and canopy diameter (CD), were statistically different between forest (DBH = 22.20, CD = 5.37) and farmland (DBH = 39.85 CD = 7.49) populations (P < 0.00001). The Sudan savannah zone with mean petiole length of 4.96 cm showed significant difference from the other zones, likely as a result of adaptation to drier climate conditions. Genetic data analysis was based on 10 microsatellite markers and revealed high genetic diversity of Vitellaria in Ghana: mean expected heterozygosity, H e was 0.667, and allelic richness, measured as number of effective alleles A e , was 4.066. Both farmlands and forests were very diverse indicating lack of negative influence of farmer’s selection on genetic diversity. Fixation index was positive for all populations (mean F IS = 0.136) with farmlands recording relatively higher values than forests in all ecological zone types studied, probably indicating less gene flow in the farmlands. Moderate differentiation (F′ ST = 0.113) was comparable to other similar tree species. Both land use and ecological zone types influenced genetic differentiation of Vitellaria at varying levels. The species was spatially structured across three ecozones and following climatic gradient. The forest reserves are used in situ conservation for Vitellaria in Ghana. High diversity observed in the most arid zones provides opportunity to find and use appropriate plant materials for breeding climate change resilient trees." .

Waste from poultry farms is expanding in the study area and is commonly used by the White Stork as a new food resource, which may explain the increase in the number of breeding Storks in the region. The study was carried out at 24 sites, including 88 different colonies of White Stork in northern Algeria, Sétif (36°09′N, 05°26′E; 900 m.a.s.l.); over a 4-year period (2002–2005) with considerable variation in rainfall. Nests were monitored at different distances from 30 rubbish dumps emanating largely from chicken farms. Results of the General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) showed that breeding success of White Stork was dependent upon distance to dumps, recording the highest values in nests close to these places with food supply. There was a highly significant interaction between the year and the distance to the rubbish dumps. That is, reproductive success was higher when there was extra food in all years except in 2002, which could be due to the very low rainfall during spring 2002. Also, we found a significant interaction between colony size and distance to a rubbish dump. Results suggest that White Stork breeding success was also affected by natural food resources, since bigger colonies may deplete natural prey sooner, which is more evident in dry years." .

Dynamic CO2FIX-v3.1 model has been used to estimate the carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of existing agroforestry systems (AFS) for simulation period of 30 years in twenty six districts from ten selected states of India. The observed number of trees on farmers’ field in these districts varied from 1.81 to 204 per hectare with an average value of 19.44 trees per hectare. The biomass in the tree component varied from 0.58 to 48.50 Mg DM ha−1, whereas, the total biomass (tree and crop) ranged from 4.96 to 58.96 Mg DM ha−1. The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.28 to 24.13 Mg C ha−1. The average estimated carbon sequestration potential of the AFS, representing varying edapho-climatic conditions, on farmers field at country level was 0.21 Mg C ha−1yr−1.

Here we assemble inventories of native and non-native species from 20 world regions and contrast relative numbers among these species assemblages. Multivariate ordination indicates that the distribution of species among insect orders is completely different between native and non-native assemblages. Some orders, such as the Psocoptera, Dictyoptera, Siphonaptera, Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera, are always over-represented in the non-native compared to native assemblages. Other orders, such as the Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Mecoptera and Microcoryphila, are consistently under-represented in non-native assemblages. These patterns most likely arise both as a result of variation among taxa in their association with invasion pathways responsible for transporting species among world regions, as well as variation in life-history traits that affect establishment potential. However, our results indicate that species compositions associated with invasiveness are fundamentally different from compositions related to insularity, indicating that colonization of islands selects for a different group of insect taxa than does selection for successful invaders. Native and non-native assemblage compositions were also related, to a lesser extent, to latitude of the region sampled. Together, these results illustrate the dominant role of invasion pathways in shaping the composition of non-native insect assemblages. They also emphasize the difference between natural background colonization of islands and anthropogenic colonization events, and imply that biological invasions are not a simple subset of a long-standing ecological process." .

Riparian and reservoir shorelines are the two most important wetland types in a dammed river. To date, few studies have concerned the heavy metal pollution in wetland soils of these river–reservoir systems. In this study, we measured the concentrations of ten heavy metals (Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) in surface soils collected from riparian and reservoir shorelines along the Han River in different seasons. Our results found that the Co, Cu, and Ni concentrations in riparian wetlands were significantly lower than those in reservoir shorelines. In riparian wetlands, only soil Sr concentration significantly increased after summer and autumn submergence. Multivariate statistical analyses demonstrated that Ba and Cd might originate from industrial and mining sources, whereas Sr and Mn predominantly originated from natural rock weathering. The ecological risk assessment analysis indicated that both riparian and reservoir shorelines along the Han River in China exhibited a moderate ecological risk in soil heavy metals. The upper Han River basin is the water resource area of China’s Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. Therefore, to control the contamination of heavy metals in wetland soils, more efforts should be focused on reducing the discharge of mining and industrial pollutants into the riparian and reservoir shorelines." .

The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the abundance of coastal mesopredatory fish, defined as mid-trophic level demersal and benthic species with a diet consisting predominantly of invertebrates, and ambient environmental variables in a fjord system influenced by both eutrophication and overfishing. A field survey was conducted over a coastal gradient comprising 300 data points sampled consistently for fish community and environmental data. Results from multivariate and univariate analyses supported each other, demonstrating that mesopredatory fish abundance at species and functional group level was positively related to the cover of structurally complex vegetation and negatively related to eutrophication, as measured by water transparency. Contrary to other studies showing an inverse relationship to piscivore abundance over time, the spatial distribution of mesopredatory fish was not locally regulated by the abundance of piscivorous fish, probably attributed to piscivores being at historically low levels due to previous overfishing. Mesopredatory fish abundance was highest in areas with high habitat quality and positively related to the abundance of piscivores, suggesting a predominance of bottom-up processes. We conclude that, in parallel with ongoing regulations of fishing pressure, measures to restore habitat function and food web productivity are important for the recovery of coastal fish communities in the area." .

Quarantine efforts have been imposed in the USA to minimize further spread of the ant. To aid the quarantine efforts, there remains an acute need for a rapid, field portable method for the identification of these ants. In this report, we describe two novel monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the S. invicta venom protein 2 produced by S. invicta. Using these monoclonal antibodies we developed a lateral flow immunoassay that provides a rapid and portable method for the identification of S. invicta ants. The lateral flow immunoassay was validated against purified S. invicta venom protein 2 and 33 unique ant species (representing 15 % of the total species and 42 % of the Myrmicinae genera found in Florida), and only S. invicta and the S. invicta/richteri hybrid produced a positive result. These monoclonal antibodies were selective to S. invicta venom protein 2 and did not bind to proteins from congeners (i.e., S. geminata or S. richteri) known to produce a S. invicta venom protein 2 ortholog. This S. invicta lateral flow immunoassay provides a new tool for regulatory agencies in the USA to enforce quarantine protocols and limit the spread of this invasive ant.

It is a source of good quality fish and wildlife. The phytoplankton was evaluated seasonally (summer 2013 to spring 2014), at 12 stations. A total of 186 taxa from 95 genera and seven classes, namely, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Euglenophyceae, Rhodophyceae and Chrysophyceae were recorded. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Bacillariophyceae followed by Dinophyceae. The Shannon–Wiener Diversity Index (1.75–3.30) classified Bardawil Lagoon as being a not stressed environment. Differences in the phytoplankton community structure and abundance between previous results and the present study showed significant changes with the change in salinity. Seasonal differences in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the phytoplankton communities in the different sites were marked. The phytoplankton annual succession was characterized. No sign of eutrophication was observed, and most of the dinoflagellate species detected have been described as harmful or able to occur at high biomass. The study showed that Bardawil water is still oligotrophic, free of contaminants, so we suggest the need to add fertilizers to accelerate the production of natural food organisms to increase fish and crustacean production. Before the addition of any fertilizer, it must dig two or three canals to facilitate exchange of water between the Mediterranean Sea and the lagoon to prevent undesirable harmful algae bloom." .

Understanding factors influencing the proliferation and spread of invasive species from aquaculture sites to native habitats is necessary to develop management strategies aimed at mitigating their spread and subsequent impacts. This study compares population dynamics of the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida between mussel farms and a natural reef site in northern New Zealand (36°35′S 175°05′E) and investigates how the abundance of U. pinnatifida on mussel farms, and its presence on adjacent reefs, relates to different environmental variables and physical attributes of mussel farms. Monitoring from 2011 to 2014 found that U. pinnatifida on mussel farms were larger and more seasonally and reproductively persistent compared to populations on adjacent reefs. Region-wide surveys found U. pinnatifida at all mussel farming sites examined (n = 25) and at eight adjacent reefs. Coastal populations were most abundant in reef habitats lacking native macroalgal canopies. Abundance of U. pinnatifida on mussel farms was related to the size of mussels present, but not strongly related to wave exposure, turbidity or spatial attributes of farms. Undaria pinnatifida was found on a number of native reefs adjacent to mussel farms, but its presence on these reefs was not related to the size of farms or distance from shore. These results demonstrate how marine farms provide an optimal environment for the proliferation of invasive species, and management strategies must consider that farms of any size or position relative to shore pose a risk of introducing invasive species to native habitats." .

Nutrient solutions containing 0.05, 0.8 or 10 mM Ca were adjusted to pH 4, 5, 6, or 7. Overall, the greatest growth was obtained with nutrient solutions containing 0.8 mM Ca at pH 6. Foliar Ca deficiency symptoms developed at 0.05 mM Ca. Sensitivity of teak clones to Al was tested at pH 4 and 0, 50 or 300 µM Al by staining of roots. Roots that were stained with Chromezurol S (CAS) also stained with hematoxylin, but not necessarily with Eriochrome Cyanine R (ECR). On the other hand, roots that stained with hematoxylin did not necessarily stain with CAS or ECR. This indicates that hydrolysis of Al (as detected by CAS) leads to membrane damage which is detected by hematoxylin. A selection of clones were grown in split pots containing either limed or non-limed soil, and Al activity in the soil solution related to root biomass. Five clones were identified as Al resistant in the solution screening, and two clones were Al resistant in the soil screen, with two clones resisting low pH and Al toxicity in soil and solution screens. This study revealed that some teak clones tolerate low pH soils and moderately toxic 25 µM {Al3+} activity, and may be suitable for poor soils, but soils used in Australia for teak plantations are often too hostile and would require amelioration." .

This study compares historical and recent records of the deep-water Mediterranean kelp Laminaria rodriguezii in the Adriatic Sea. Historical records include data from herbarium collections and trawling fishery expeditions in the mid-twentieth century, while recent data comprise records of the last 17 years from MEDITS expeditions, ROV surveys of historical kelp locations, benthic surveys and records by fishermen. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the Adriatic population of L. rodriguezii has suffered a decline of more than 85 % of its historical range and is now present only around the small offshore island of Palagruža. Bottom trawling activities are presumably responsible for the disappearance elsewhere. We propose to classify L. rodriguezii as “Endangered” in the Adriatic Sea under IUCN criteria B1ab(i,iii,iv), ver 3.1. Oceanographic characteristics of the habitat suggest that besides high water transparency, presence of North Adriatic Dense Water with both strong currents and stable low temperatures of around 14 °C are essential oceanographic factors for the development of L. rodriguezii in the Central Adriatic. The origin of cold water thus differs from that at upwelling sites permitting populations of tropical deep-water kelps. The phylogenetic position of L. rodriguezii is so far unknown. DNA sequences from nuclear and cytoplasmic markers of two thalli from Croatia and the western Mediterranean confirmed that L. rodriguezii is a member of the Laminariaceae and most closely related to L. ochroleuca, L. pallida and the Brazilian deep-water kelp L. abyssalis." .

Understanding the interactions between seabirds and fisheries is thus crucial for seabird management and conservation. Using bird-borne GPS loggers, we investigate to what extent incubating lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus at Helgoland overlap on a spatio-temporal scale with fishing vessel positions obtained through the vessel monitoring system, as well as the distance around vessels at which birds adopt a non-random search behaviour that is indicative of the utilization of discards. We characterize foraging trips and discuss our findings in view of potential effects of the change of the European discard policy on lesser black-backed gulls. Individuals overlapped on a spatio-temporal scale with fishing vessels in one-third of the foraging trips (17 of 48 trips). Within <5 km of fishing vessels, birds exhibited lower flight speeds and higher path tortuosity values, indicating non-random search behaviour and thus the utilization of discards. To feed on discards, birds travelled greater total distances and spent more time away from the colony than birds feeding on non-discards, which is mainly due to the distant location of fishing grounds from the colony. Our results support previous studies showing the spatio-temporal overlap between birds and fishing vessels and behavioural switching from commuting to foraging. The inferred use of both discards and non-discards highlights the dual feeding strategy in this population, but a long-term reduction in discards may negatively affect the population on Helgoland, if sufficient alternative high-energetic food resources are not available within their foraging range." .

Here, we use intrinsic and genetic markers to understand the impact of bycatch on the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the loggerhead turtle sharing the same foraging grounds in the western Mediterranean Sea. Turtles of Atlantic origin settle on the continental shelf later and at a larger size than turtles of Mediterranean origin and hence have been suggested to be more vulnerable to pelagic fishing gears, whereas those of Mediterranean origin would be more vulnerable to neritic ones. To assess whether this hypothesis holds true, we compared the genetic make-up of turtle bycatch from drifting longlines and bottom trawl/trammel nets in three different regions (eastern mainland Spain, southern Balearic Islands and southern Italy). A total of 176 incidentally caught turtles were considered, and size and habitat use, as revealed by stable isotopes, were incorporated to the analysis. No genetic, size or isotopic differences were found between turtles caught with drifting longlines and bottom trawl/trammel nets within any of the three regions. However, genetic, size and isotopic differences were detected among regions, regardless of the fishing gear. Thus, the population make-up of loggerhead bycatch depends on the area where the fishing operations are conducted, but not on the fishing gear used. Accordingly, the actual impact of loggerhead bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea will depend not only on the total number of turtles taken, but also on the geographic distribution of the fishing effort." .

To this end, interpolation mapping was conducted using Ordinary Kriging. The mean concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ni and Cu in the samples were 0.72, 11.41, 29.87 and 14.82 mg kg−1, respectively, which were all higher than their background values. The spatial variation in the concentration of heavy metals could be attributable to point sources and vehicle emissions. Considering the severity of the potential ecological risks of metals, the descending order of contaminants’ concentrations was Cd > Cu > Ni > Pb. The Potential Ecological Risk Index (RI) suggested that approximately 40 % and 59 % of the samples posed high and significantly high potential ecological risks, respectively. Moreover, ecological risk decreased progressively going from southwest to northeast over the under-study area.

Linear features are pervasive across the landscape, and of particular importance, seismic lines established in the 1900s (legacy seismic lines) are slow to regenerate. Off-highway vehicles are widely used on these seismic lines and can hamper vegetative re-growth because of ongoing physical damage, compaction, and active clearing. Restoration of seismic lines within caribou range is therefore a priority for the recovery of threatened populations in Alberta, but a triage-type approach is necessary to prioritize restoration and ensure conservation resources are wisely spent. To target restoration efforts, our objective was to determine factors that best explained levels of off-highway vehicles use on seismic lines intersecting roads. We investigated the relative importance of local topography, vegetation attributes of seismic lines, and broad-scale human factors such as the density of infrastructures and the proximity to recreation campsites and towns to explain the observed levels of off-highway vehicles use. We found that off-highway vehicles use was mainly associated with local topography and vegetation attributes of seismic lines that facilitated ease-of-travel. Broad-scale landscape attributes associated with industrial, recreation access, or hunting activities did not explain levels of off-highway vehicles use. Management actions aimed at promoting natural regeneration and reduce ease-of-travel on legacy seismic lines within caribou ranges can be beneficial to caribou recovery in Alberta, Canada, and we therefore recommend restrictions of off-highway vehicles use on low vegetation, dry seismic lines in caribou ranges." .

Out of the 806 stranded individuals, the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta was the most frequent species (57.1 %) followed by the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea (41.8 %), while green turtles Chelonia mydas and Kemp’s Ridley turtles Lepidochelys kempii were rare (respectively 1.0 and 0.1 %). Relative stranding densities of loggerheads showed an increase through time, whereas two leatherback stranding peaks were detected during the years 1994–1998 and 2009–2013. The highest loggerhead stranding density was observed on the southern coast during spring and summer when they are more susceptible to anthropogenic threats. The highest number of leatherback strandings was observed in the North-Central and Central-South western sectors during autumn and in the southern sector during summer, which may relate to seasonal food availability and water temperature considering those stranded animals that were subject to a post-mortem evaluation interaction with fisheries as the primary cause of stranding. Results show for the first time that waters off the Portuguese mainland coast is an important pathway for loggerheads and leatherbacks in the North Atlantic region. The present study serves as important baseline to the development of future sea turtle conservation efforts in the Portuguese mainland coast." .

The Midwestern state of Indiana contains tens of thousands of miles of regulated drains that represent biotic communities that comprise the headwaters of the state’s many rivers and creeks. Traditional management, however, reduces these waterways to their most basic function as conveyances, ignoring their role in the ecosystem as hosts for biotic and abiotic processes that actively regulate the fate and transport of nutrients and farm chemicals. Novel techniques and practices such as the two-stage ditch, denitrifying bioreactor, and constructed wetlands represent promising alternatives to traditional management approaches, yet many of these tools remain underutilized. To date, conservation efforts and research have focused on increasing the voluntary adoption of practices among agricultural producers. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the roles of the drainage professionals responsible for the management of waterways and regulated drains. To address this gap, we draw on survey responses from 39 county surveyors and 85 drainage board members operating in Indiana. By examining the backgrounds, attitudes, and actions of these individuals, we consider their role in advocating and implementing novel conservation practices." .

We measured resting and active metabolic rates of giant pandas in order to determine if current bamboo resources were sufficient for adding additional animals to populations in natural reserves. Resting metabolic rates were somewhat below average for a panda sized mammal and active metabolic rates were in the normal range. Pandas do not have exceptionally low metabolic rates.

Using a transition-matrix model, we made predictions for the whole Catalonian forest over an 11-year interval. It turned out that the sampling was the major source of uncertainty and accounted for at least 60 % of the total uncertainty. ContextWith the development of new policies to mitigate global warming and to protect biodiversity, there is a growing interest in large-scale forest growth models. Their predictions are affected by many sources of uncertainty such as the sampling error, errors in the estimates of the model parameters, and residual errors. Quantifying the total uncertainty of those predictions helps to evaluate the risk of making a wrong decision. AimsIn this paper, we quantified the contribution of the sampling error and the model-related errors to the total uncertainty of predictions from a large-scale growth model in Catalonia. MethodsThe model was based on a transition-matrix approach and predicted tree frequencies by species group and 5-cm diameter class over an 11-year time step. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we propagated the sampling error and the model-related errors to quantify their contribution to the total uncertainty. ResultsThe sampling variance accounted for at least 60 % of the total variance in smaller diameter classes, with this percentage increasing up to 90 % in larger diameter classes. ConclusionAmong the few possible options to reduce sampling uncertainty, we suggest improving the variance–covariance estimator of the predictions in order to better account for the multivariate framework and the changing plot size." .

Recent studies have addressed changes of land cover with socioeconomic development in the drylands in northern China. However, the changes in land use intensity and the potential role of environmental conservation measures have yet to be adequately examined. Given the importance of land management intensity to the ecological conditions and regional sustainability, our study projected land system change in Hohhot city in the drylands in northern China from 2013 to 2030. Here, land systems are defined as combinations of land cover and land use intensity. Using the CLUMondo model, we simulated land system change in Hohhot under three scenarios: a scenario following historical trends, a scenario with strong socioeconomic and land use planning, and a scenario focused on achieving environmental conservation targets. Our results showed that Hohhot is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all three scenarios. The agricultural intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend scenario compared to those with more planning interventions. The dynamics of grasslands depend strongly on projections of livestock and other claims on land resources. In the historical trend scenario, intensively grazed grasslands increase whereas a large amount of the current area of grasslands with livestock converts to forest under the scenario with strong planning. Strong conversion from grasslands with livestock and extensive cropland to semi-natural grasslands was estimated under the conservation scenario. The findings provide an input into discussions about environmental management, planning and sustainable land system design for Hohhot." .

Since this dominant tall grass threatens biodiversity and forage quality, our hypothesis was that B. genuense abundance influenced that of palatable species for the chamois, depending on their functional traits and distribution patterns. Our sampling design used plots of 10 × 10 m and 1 × 1 m to investigate the plant community level and fine-scale interactions. We analyzed data using correlation, generalized linear models, and redundancy analyses. We found that B. genuense can reach high abundance values on the deepest soils. Its high cover value influences plant community composition by competitive exclusion of subordinate species and suppression of functional features because of temporal or spatial niche overlap. This leads to low cover of palatable species at a fine scale, and to poor pasture quality for chamois at a wider scale. Therefore, we postulated that B. genuense invasion, enhanced by long-term grazing cessation, may reduce the availability of palatable plants for Apennine chamois, especially below the potential timberline (1900–2000 m a.s.l.). The high abundance of B. genuense may amplify the effect of other negative factors, such as competition with red deer (Cervus elaphus) and climate change, in restricting the suitable habitat of the Apennine chamois to the higher sectors of the central Apennines. Thus, we suggested that B. genuense spread should be monitored carefully and plans to control its invasion should be implemented." .

Here we assess determinants of climatic debt accumulated in French forest herbaceous plant communities between 1987 and 2008 (that is, a 1.05 °C mean difference between the observed and bioindicated temperatures). We show that warmer baseline conditions predispose plant communities to larger climatic debts, and that climate warming exacerbates this response. Forest plant communities, however, are absorbing part of the temperature increase mainly through the species’ ability to tolerate changing climate. As climate warming is expected to accelerate during the twenty-first century, plant migration and tolerance to climatic stresses probably will be insufficient to absorb this impact posing threats to the sustainability of forest plant communities." .

Based on the 3 wetland degradation stages, we determined the effects of wetland degradation on the structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling (nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying) microbial communities in 3 soil types (intact wetland: marsh soil; early degrading wetland: marsh meadow soil; and degraded wetland: meadow soil) using 454-pyrosequencing. The structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities differed in the 3 soil types. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in most soil samples but the most abundant soil nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microbial bacteria differed at the class, order, family, and genus levels among the 3 soil types. At the genus level, the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacterium sequences related to Bradyrhizobium were from marsh and marsh meadow soils; whereas those related to Geobacter originated from meadow soil. The majority of ammonia-oxidizing bacterium sequences related to Nitrosospira were from marsh (except for the 40-60 cm layer), marsh meadow and meadow soils; whereas those related to Candidatus Solibacter originated from 40-60 cm layer of marsh soil. The majority of denitrifying bacterium sequences related to Candidatus Solibacter and Anaeromyxobacter were from marsh and meadow soils; whereas those related to Herbaspirillum originated from meadow soil. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species were correlated with soil type based upon Venn and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Changes in soil type, caused by different water regimes were the most important factors influencing compositional changes in the nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying microbial communities." .

Although this taxon is colonial, it displays many morphological characters very close to the typically late Famennian solitary species Palaeosmilia aquisgranensis (Frech, 1885), described earlier from the same locality. Hence, we postulate that F. catenata is derived from P. aquisgranensis.

Many seagrass ecosystems are dominated by a single species, with research showing that genotypic diversity at fine spatial scales plays an important role in maintaining a range of ecosystem functions. However, for most seagrass species, information on fine-scale patterns of genetic variation in natural populations is lacking. In this study, we use a hierarchical sampling design to determine the levels of genetic and genotypic diversity at different spatial scales (centimeters, meters, kilometers) in the Australian seagrass Zostera muelleri. Our analysis shows that at fine spatial scales (<1 m), levels of genotypic diversity are relatively low (R (Plots) = 0.37 ± 0.06 SE), although there is some intermingling of genotypes. At the site (10’s m) and meadow location (km) scale, we found higher levels of genotypic diversity (R (sites) = 0.79 ± 0.04 SE; R (Locations) = 0.78 ± 0.04 SE). We found some sharing of genotypes between sites within meadows, but no sharing of genotypes between meadow locations. We also detected a high level of genetic structuring between meadow locations (F ST = 0.278). Taken together, our results indicate that both sexual and asexual reproductions are important in maintaining meadows of Z. muelleri. The dominant mechanism of asexual reproduction appears to occur via localized rhizome extension, although the sharing of a limited number of genotypes over the scale of 10’s of meters could also result from the localized dispersal and recruitment of fragments. The large number of unique genotypes at the meadow scale indicates that sexual reproduction is important in maintaining these populations, while the high level of genetic structuring suggests little gene flow and connectivity between our study sites. These results imply that recovery from disturbances will occur through both sexual and asexual regeneration, but the limited connectivity at the landscape scale implies that recovery at meadow-scale losses is likely to be limited." .

The relationship between plant resource knowledge and availability was tested in a rural community (Palmital) in a dry Atlantic Forest fragment in the state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil, using data from phytosociological studies and interviews. We considered both total use and separate use categories. Use Value (UV) was significantly associated with all of the analyzed ecological variables, but there was an association with relative dominance and a weak relationship with relative density. When the UVs were separately analyzed for each category, we found that some, i.e., fuel and construction, corroborate the Ecological Apparency Hypothesis, while others do not, particularly the medicinal and food categories. In addition, we found large differences with respect to the ecological variables that best correlated with UV. The data suggest that the cost/benefit relationship predicted by Optimal Foraging Theory can explain the Ecological Apparency Hypothesis when the following factors are considered: (a) resource acquisition optimization and security; (b) a higher probability of acquiring more abundant species during random collection events; and (c) differential utilization patterns (distinct requirements for a specific use) for each use category. Some implications for conservation are also discussed." .

ObjectivesWe projected changes in forest landscapes resulting from four climate scenarios (baseline, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), by simulating changes in tree growth and disturbances at the southern edge of Canada’s boreal zone. MethodsProjections were performed for four regions located on an east–west gradient using a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) parameterized using a forest patch model (PICUS). ResultsClimate-induced changes in the competitiveness of dominant tree species due to changes in potential growth, and substantial intensification of the fire regime, appear likely to combine in driving major changes in boreal forest landscapes. Resulting cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems would be manifold but key changes would include (i) a strong decrease in the biomass of the dominant boreal species, especially mid- to late-successional conifers; (ii) increases in abundance of some temperate species able to colonize disturbed areas in a warmer climate; (iii) increases in the proportions of pioneer and fire-adapted species in these landscapes and (iv) an overall decrease in productivity and total biomass. The greatest changes would occur under the RCP 8.5 radiative forcing scenario, but some impacts can be expected even with RCP 2.6. ConclusionsWestern boreal forests, i.e., those bordering the prairies, are the most vulnerable because of a lack of species adapted to warmer climates and major increases in areas burned. Conservation and forest management planning within the southern boreal transition zone should consider both disturbance- and climate-induced changes in forest communities." .

For this purpose, sediment samples were collected in thirteen locations and characterized for metal content (Pb, Cr, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Fe) using the total digestion technique. Pollution level was assessed via the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (C ), potential ecological risk (PER), and pollution load index (PLI). Our results showed that all metals were lower than the threshold effect levels (TEL), the effect range low (ERL), the probable effect level (PEL), the effect range median (ERM), and the probable effect concentration (PEC) value, except Pb and Cr (higher than TEL), the threshold effect concentration (TEC), and the toxicity reference value (TRV). The geoaccumulation index (Igeo) indicated no pollution for Cr, Cu, Zn, and Fe, but moderate pollution for Pb. The enrichment factor showed no enrichment for most of the studied metals. This was further confirmed by the contamination factor that indicated low contamination levels, with the exception of Pb. The pollution load index (PLI) showed moderate pollution status in all the studied stations in the Ichkeul Lake and rivers ecosystem. The statistical results presented similar trends of Zn and Pb probably due to their similar pollution sources. It was found that the Ichkeul Lake and river ecosystems are characterized by moderate pollution status in all the studied sites except for that of a feeder river drained from an old lead mine which had relatively high metallic concentrations of Pb and Cd. It can be argued that effective remediation strategies and environmental management plans are required to control and reduce the input of environmentally hazardous toxic pollutants (Cd and Pb). This study may serve as a useful reference tool pertinent to approaches to the remediation of the old lead mine area surrounding the Ichkeul Lake as well as other areas under similar ecological conditions.." .

We report on organochlorine pesticide and PCB concentrations in eggs of the little egret, Egretta garzetta, and the black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax, collected in 1993–1994, and on mercury, cadmium, and lead concentrations in feathers of 20-day-old nestlings collected from the same nests in 1994, from heronries near Pavia, northern Italy. Organochlorine pesticide and PCB residues were lower than those commonly associated with mortality and reduced reproductive success. As population levels of the species studied are not declining, these contaminants appear to have no significant adverse effect on reproduction in the heronries studied. DDE levels have decreased markedly in heron eggs since 1978. However, the presence of both DDT and β-HCH, albeit at low levels, is notable, given that these compounds were banned in Italy in 1978 and 1988, respectively. Relatively high levels of Hg, Cd, and Pb in feathers suggest birds in their colonies are exposed to these contaminants, although both Cd and Pb may relate more to external than to internal contamination." .

This paper focuses on better understanding the management of human-use pharmaceutical wastes generated at the residential level within the Administrative Beirut Area. A survey encompassing 300 households was conducted. Results revealed that the majority of respondents were found to dispose of their unwanted medications, mainly through the domestic solid waste stream. Willingness to participate in a future collection program was found to be a function of age, medical expenditure, and the respondents’ views towards awareness and the importance of establishing a collection system for pharmaceutical wastes. Respondents who stated a willingness to participate in a collection program and/or those who believed in the need for awareness programs on the dangers of improper medical waste disposal tended to favor more collection programs managed by the government as compared to a program run by pharmacies or to the act of re-gifting medication to people in need. Ultimately, collaboration and coordination between concerned stakeholders are essential for developing a successful national collection plan." .

Compared to other remedial strategies, phytoremediation is a low cost, environmentally-friendly, sustainable means of remediating the contamination. This review first provides an overview of phytoremediation studies where the soil is contaminated with just one type of pollutant (heavy metals or organics) and then critically evaluates the applicability of phytotechnologies for the remediation of contaminated sites where the soil is polluted by a mixture of organic and heavy metal contaminants. In most of the earlier research studies, mixed contamination was held to be detrimental to plant growth, yet there were instances where plant growth was more successful in soil with mixed contamination than in the soil with only individual contaminants. New effective phytoremediation strategies can be designed for remediation of co-contaminated sites using: (a) plants species especially adapted to grow in the contaminated site (hyperacumulators, local plants, transgenic plants); (b) endophytic bacteria to enhance the degradation in the rizhosphere; (c) soil amendments to increase the contaminants bioavailability [chelating agents and (bio)surfactants]; (d) soil fertilization to enhance the plant growth and microbial activity in the soil; and (e) coupling phytoremediation with other remediation technologies such as electrokinetic remediation or enhanced biodegradation in the rhizosphere." .

Maps that predict the potential spread of an invader based on known habitat preferences can be extremely valuable for assessing invasion risk and prioritizing management actions for invasion control or prevention. Most maps are developed by using environmental data on the species’ known distribution to map the potential niche of the species in a new location. However, this approach is complicated when a species spreads to an area where environmental conditions are much different than in other places it is known to exist. Didemnum vexillum was discovered in Southeast Alaska in 2010, marking the northernmost known range of this species. A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to assess potential habitat for D. vexillum in other parts of Southeast Alaska using summer and winter temperature and salinity as controlling factors. This research highlights the uncertainty of using the species’ current distribution to evaluate potential spread to an environment at the edge of a species’ environmental tolerances. It also identifies gaps in our knowledge of D. vexillum thermal and salinity tolerances, including potential synergistic and additive effects of both low temperature and low salinity, which limit investigation of mechanistic modeling methods." .

We proposed a new evaluation framework integrating ecosystem services importance assessment and landscape connectivity analysis with human ecological demand importance assessment to identify ecological sources. Afterwards, ecological corridors were identified using Minimum Cumulative Resistance model based on sources and resistance surface modified through nighttime light data. Combined with ecological sources and corridors, LESP for Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region can be constructed. The ecological sources are mainly located in western Beijing and southwestern Chengde. The ecological source area totals 36,245.50 km2, accounting for 21.26% of the ecological land in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. The ecological corridors cross the whole region, from northeast to southwest, similar to the direction of the Yanshan–Taihang Mountain Chain. All the national nature reserves and 91.4% of the provincial nature reserves are distributed within the LESP. The validity of our methodology is confirmed by the distribution of the nature reserves.

Understanding how rates of assemblage turnover vary along gradients is crucial to forecast where climate change could promote the fastest changes within extant communities. Here we analysed turnover rates of plant assemblages along a 2500 m elevation gradient in the Swiss Western Alps. We found a peak of turnover rate between 1800 and 2200 m indicating an acceleration of grassland compositional changes at the transition between subalpine and alpine belts. In parallel, we found a peak in phylogenetic turnover rate in Poales between 1700 m and 1900 and Super-Rosids between 1900 and 2300 m. Our results suggest that changes in abiotic or biotic conditions near the human-modified treeline constitute a strong barrier for many grassland plant species, which share analogous elevation range limits.

Due to its chemical similarity to calcium it accumulates in bones and irradiates the bone marrow, causing its high radio-toxicity. Assessing 90Sr is therefore extremely important in case of a nuclear disaster. In this work 16 soil samples were collected from the exclusion zone (<30 km) of the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to measure 90Sr activity concentration using liquid scintillation counting. 137Cs activity concentration was also measured with gamma-spectroscopy in order to investigate correlation with 90Sr. The 90Sr activity concentrations ranged from 3.0 ± 0.3 to 23.3 ± 1.5 Bq kg−1 while the 137Cs from 0.7 ± 0.1 to 110.8 ± 0.3 kBq kg−1. The fact that radioactive contamination originated from the Fukushima nuclear accident was obvious due to the presence of 134Cs. However, 90Sr contamination was not confirmed in all samples although detectable amounts of 90Sr can be expected in Japanese soils, as a background, stemming from global fallout due to the atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. Correlation analysis between 90Sr and 137Cs activity concentrations provides a potentially powerful tool to discriminate background 90Sr level from its Fukushima contribution." .

We show that the dermal exposure to Cu, Ni, and Cd affected the mortality and morphology of A. chlorotica, and the number and functioning of coelomocytes. These features particularly were pronounced in animals treated with Ni and Cu and interestingly to a lesser extend with Cd. In contrast, Cd induced a strong expression of metallothioneins (MT-2) and heat shock proteins (HSP72). The presence of MT-2 was detected not only in coelomocytes but also in the intestine, blood vessels, and epidermis. In conclusion, Allolobophora chlorotica coelomocytes are adopted to respond differentially to various heavy metals, generating powerful response towards potentially most dangerous exogenous non-essential elements." .

The Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) was introduced to Madagascar in 2011. This introduction presents a potentially dangerous prey item to a relatively naïve, highly diverse endemic carnivore fauna. Using a multivariate niche modeling approach (background test), we assessed the predicted niche overlap between D. melanostictus and six endemic carnivores in eastern Madagascar. The overlap between this potential prey and predators was assessed on four environmental niche axes: temperature, precipitation, vegetation cover and elevation. Our results showed a mixture of niche overlap and divergence between D. melanostictus and the six carnivores for environmental axes tested. There was significant overlap with five of the carnivores on temperature and NDVI axes. On the precipitation axis, there was significant overlap between D. melanostictus with two species. Our results suggested that wide-ranging, locally rare carnivores may overlap extensively with D. melanostictus. The six carnivores that inhabit the eastern rainforest of Madagascar will likely share multiple, niche axes with this novel potential prey item. Species that eat the non-native common toad and are susceptible to its toxins are at conservation risk because their populations may not be robust enough to adapt quickly to this threat. We advocate closely monitoring these emerging interactions and suggest a preemptive conservation strategy for carnivores potentially at risk." .

We evaluate the seasonality and ecophysiology of the different life phases of the rhodophyte G. skottsbergii by analyzing variation in fluorescence yield and photosynthetic pigment composition. There were significant seasonal differences in maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) between gametophyte and tetrasporophyte phase, and between reproductive and vegetative specimens.

The results showed that the PSDI is valuable because it allows for the acquisition of data on environmental monitoring, agricultural and aquaculture facilities. It also has a positive impact on decision-making processes and improves numerous planners’ activities concerning both the inclusion of environmental indicators in spatial plans and the support of nature conservation and environmental management in the process of working on future land use.

To accomplish this, it is essential to examine the ecology of introduced species in native populations. We examined organization patterns, spatial structure, and competitive abilities of ground-dwelling ants in different habitats of a protected area in east-central Argentina, where several highly invasive ant species naturally coexist, to determine whether all they are ecologically dominant in their native range as in their introduced range. We sampled ant communities at Otamendi Nature Reserve and found 49 ant species co-occurred with moderate separation among habitats, including five species that are global invaders; but only Solenopsis richteri (the most numerically dominant) and Linepithema humile (the best mass recruiter) were ecologically co-dominant along with another three non-invasive species in locally rich assemblages. Their co-occurrence was apparently facilitated by both niche and competitive differences. However, we found no evidence for discovery-dominance trade-offs, and ant diversity and spatial segregation suggested that competition only plays a secondary role in structuring assemblages in arboreal habitats. Despite L. humile and S. richteri were ecologically co-dominant, their hegemony was lower in the reserve than in their introduced range likely due to biotic resistance. The other invasive ants (Wasmannia auropunctata, Brachymyrmex patagonicus, and Nylanderia fulva) were not dominant. It is possible that their establishment, persistence, and high prevalence in anthropic habitats in native and introduced populations to be attributed to their better physiologic adaptations to disturbed habitats rather than to their superior competitive abilities." .

To ensure MPA efficacy at the design, uptake and management levels, baseline data on fish populations associated with deep nearshore reefs are needed. This study employed baited remote underwater stereo-video systems to investigate fish habitat associations at shallow (11–25 m) and deep (45–75 m) reef sites in the Tsitsikamma National Park MPA, South Africa. The compositions of fish assemblages at shallow and deep reef sites were significantly different. Specifically, rare species, juveniles and low trophic level species dominated the shallow reef, while deep reef assemblages were characterised by large, sexually mature and predatory fish. The body size of abundant species was also correlated with depth, with larger individuals being more abundant on deeper reefs. Habitat types were identified according to a habitat classification system established in a previous study, which resulted in four broad depth separated habitat types (defined by macrobenthos and environmental variables). Canonical analysis of principle coordinates (CAP) indicated that habitat type was a good categorical predictor of the observed fish assemblages. The CAP analysis determined that 86 % of the samples were correctly assigned to the habitat type from which they were collected, indicating that specific fish assemblages were associated with distinct habitat types. This study highlights the importance of protecting both shallow and deep reefs, not only to ensure the conservation of particular fish assemblages, but also to provide protection for all stages of the life cycle of fish species." .

Compartmentalization methods applied to such graphs aim to define clusters of highly interconnected patches. Recent studies show that compartmentalization based on modularity is suitable, but it applies to non-weighted graphs whereas most landscape graphs involve weighted nodes and links. ObjectivesWe propose to adapt modularity computation to weighted landscape graphs and to validate the relevance of the resulting compartments using demographic or genetic data about the patches. MethodsA weighted adjacency matrix was designed to express potential fluxes, associating patch capacities and inter-patch distances. Eight weighting scenarios were compared. The statistical evaluation of each compartmentalization was based on Wilks’ Lambda. These methods were performed on a grassland network where patches are documented by annual densities of water voles in the Jura massif (France). ResultsThe scenarios in which patch capacity is assigned a small weight led to the more relevant results, giving high modularity values and low Wilks’ Lambda values. When considering a fixed number of compartments, we found a significant negative correlation between these two criteria. Comparison showed that compartments are ecologically more valid than graph components. ConclusionsThe method proposed is suitable for designing ecologically functional areas from weighted landscape graphs. Maximum modularity values can serve as a guide for setting the parameters of the adjacency matrix." .

Results show that if a warming climate will offer new opportunities to increase income, either through expansion of cash crop cultivation or new land use options such as short-term rotation forestry, these opportunities will almost always be seized. Even if high environmental premiums were offered to maintain current cultural landscapes, only 43 % of farmers would prefer the existing grassland cultivation. Therefore, the continuity of characteristic Austrian landscape patterns seems unlikely.

Communities in water and sediment were hypothesized to show greater taxonomic similarity than those in soil, while microbial communities in sediment and soil would show greater functional similarity. Habitat-specific communities showed significant differences in phylogenetic structure and β-diversity (P < 0.001), but site-specific differences in community structures within a single habitat type did not differ greatly (P ≥ 0.083). Community exchange among habitats generally influenced < 5 % of the total community composition in a single sample, with the exception of the sediment community at the Minnesota River site, which contributed to a mean of 14 % of the microbial community in the water column. Communities from all habitat types were significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.44–0.64, P ≤ 0.004). Furthermore, approximately 33 % of the taxonomic units were found in all samples and comprised at least 40 % of the bacterial community. Functional annotation of shotgun sequencing data revealed similar functional profiles for sediment and soil communities that were distinct from those in the water. Results of this study suggest that sediments, when disturbed, contribute significantly to bacterial communities in the water and that a core bacterial community may be supported in the soils and sediments. Furthermore, a high degree of functional redundancy results in similar functional profiles in sediment and soil communities." .

Cu, Zn, and Cd levels in sediment exceeded the Chinese marine sediment quality criteria. The geoaccumulation index was highest for Cd followed in a decreasing order by Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Cr. Metal levels were highest in the four mollusk species. The oyster and veined rapa whelk had the highest bioaccumulation factors, indicating that these two species would be well suited for monitoring the metal pollution in this area. Our comparison of estimated daily intake values for human consumption of the seafood species to the Food and Agricultural Organization-recommended daily dietary allowances indicate potential health risks from the intake of Cd from all shellfish other than our crab species and Zn intake from oyster consumption. An analysis of target hazard quotients identified noncarcinogenic health risks from Cd (in all shellfish analyzed except for our crab species), Cu, and Zn (in oysters and veined rapa whelks). Moreover, an analysis of cancer risk from Pb ingestion detected an increased risk for consumption of all shellfish except for the crab species. Health risks seem especially pronounced for the consumption of oysters and the veined rapa whelks; a seafood advisory may be warranted for these mollusks." .

Thus, encouraging the adoption of water-saving technologies and practices is critical to preserving water resources, yet difficult to achieve. The research problem addressed in this study is the lack of characterization of residents who use urban irrigation, which hinders the design of effective behavior change programs. This study examined audience segmentation as an approach to encouraging change using current residential landscape practices. K-means cluster analysis identified three meaningful subgroups among residential landscape irrigation users (N = 1,063): the water considerate majority (n = 479, 45 %), water savvy conservationists (n = 378, 36 %), and unconcerned water users (n = 201, 19 %). An important finding was that normative beliefs, attitudes, and perceived behavioral control characteristics of the subgroups were significantly different with large and medium practical effect sizes. Future water conservation behaviors and perceived importance of water resources were also significantly different among subgroups. The water considerate majority demonstrated capacity to conserve, placed high value on water, and were likely to engage in behavior changes. This article contributes to the literature on individuals who use residential landscape irrigation, an important target audience with potential to conserve water through sustainable irrigation practices and technologies. Findings confirm applicability of the capacity to conserve water to audience segmentation and extend this concept by incorporating perceived value of water resources and likelihood of conservation. The results suggest practical application to promoting residential landscape water conservation behaviors based on important audience characteristics." .

Our main questions are: what environmental classifications account for variations in riparian plant assemblages along Mediterranean river floodplains? How is classification predictive power affected by taxonomic resolution? What are the environmental features that may be influencing plant taxa composition? We collected riparian vascular plant and environmental GIS data (morphology and land-use) from 189 river segments. Hierarchical clustering was used to derive environmental and biological groups of segments. We applied a measure of classification strength (CS) to account for variations in riparian plant assemblages, considering CS with respect to species and higher taxonomic levels. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination to identify major environmental features influencing plant assemblages. Our results showed the correspondence’s strength between classifications and plant taxa was significant, albeit low, for all data. The hybrid classification, based on morphology plus land use, gave the best CS values for all taxonomic levels and emerged as the best determinant for discriminating differences in riparian plant composition. The correspondence between the classification criteria and plant assemblages depended on the taxonomic level analysed and genus level has best CS results. NMS for taxonomic groups showed that only a few environmental features could be identified as major factors influencing plant composition in floodplains, among which cover of mixed woodlands was the best. A local-scale approach and incorporation of more detailed variables into the classification scheme may therefore improve the match between environmental classification and plant community composition." .

Further, human have significant exposure to phthalates. However, little is known concerning the exposure of wildlife to phthalates. We report urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations from fifty juvenile alligators from three Florida lakes and a site in the Everglades. Urinary phthalate monoester concentrations varied widely among alligators from the different sites but also among alligators from the same site. Mono-2-ethylhexy phthalate and monobutyl phthalate were found in most samples of alligator urine with maximums of 35,700 ng/mL and 193 ng/mL, respectively. Monobenzyl phthalate was found in 5 alligators with a maximum of 66.7 ng/mL. Other monoesters were found in only one or two alligator urine samples. The wide variation within and among sites, in addition to the high levels of mEHP, mBP and mBzP, is consistent with exposure arising from the intermittent spraying of herbicide formulations to control invasive aquatic plants in Florida freshwater sites. Phthalate diesters are used as adjuvants in many of these formulations." .

If species persistence is to be achieved, ecologically informed, effective conservation action is required. Yet it remains a challenge to identify optimal places in a landscape to direct habitat reconstruction and management. Rather than relying on individual landscape metrics, process-based regional scale assessment methodology is needed that focuses primarily on species persistence. This means integrating, according to species’ ecology, habitat extent, suitability, quality and spatial configuration. The rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence (REMP) methodology has been developed for this purpose. However, till now no practical conservation planning application of REMP has been described. By integration of expert ecological knowledge, we extended REMP’s capabilities to prioritize conservation action for a highly modified agricultural region of central NSW, Australia based on the metapopulation ecology of 34 fauna species. The region’s current capacity to support the species was evaluated in relation to the pre-European state for which there was known viability. Six of the species were found to currently have insufficient habitat to support viable populations. Seeking locations to maximize overall improvement in viability for these species, we prioritized conservation action to locations near the threshold of metapopulation persistence." .

We tested a method for mapping digitally the continuous distribution of the SOC stock in three dimensions in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau. The approach integrated the spatial distribution of the mattic epipedon which is a special surface horizon widespread and rich in organic matter in Tibetan grasslands. Prediction models resulted in high prediction accuracy. An average SOC stock in the mattic epipedon was estimated to be 4.99 kg m−2 in a mean depth of 14 cm. The amounts of SOC in the mattic epipedon, the upper 30 cm and 50 cm accounted for about 21%, 80% and 89%, respectively, of the total SOC stock in the upper 1 m depth. Compared with previous estimates, our approach resulted in more reliable predictions. The mattic epipedon was proven to be an important factor for modelling the realistic distribution of the SOC stock in Tibetan grasslands. Vegetation-related covariates have the most important influence on the distribution of the mattic epipedon and the SOC stock in the alpine grassland soils of northeast Tibetan Plateau." .

We assess the use of camera trap hit (detection) rates as a noninvasive alternative to live trapping for estimating population densities of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus (Erxleben, 1777)) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Erxleben, 1777))—two common small (≤1.5 kg) mammal species in the boreal forests of northern North America. We compared hit rates from camera trapping to live trapping mark-recapture density estimates and asked if the hit window—the length of time used to group consecutive videos together as single detections or “hits”—has an effect on the correlation between hit rates and live trapping density estimates. The relationship between hit rate and population density was sensitive to hit window duration for red squirrels with R 2 values ranging from 0.41 to 0.68, and a 5-min hit window generated the highest value. R 2 values for snowshoe hares ranged from 0.70 to 0.90, and a 10-min hit window generated the highest value, but hares were live trapped and filmed only at very low densities. Our results indicate that camera trapping is a robust means for estimating the density of red squirrels, but the appropriate hit window duration must be determined empirically if camera trapping data are to be used to monitor populations of this species. Additional live trapping and filming of snowshoe hares is required to better assess camera trapping of this species." .

Thus, an integrated approach is needed that includes the “cryptic diversity” represented partly by lichens, which are among the most sensitive organisms to environmental change due to their physiological characteristics. The use of functional traits and ecological attributes may improve the interpretation of how species respond to climate change. Thus, we quantified the future climate change impacts on 41 lichen species distributed in the Iberian Peninsula using ensemble climatic suitability maps (derived from generalized linear and generalized additive models, and classification and regression tree analysis) and different metrics. We also determined the lichen traits/attributes that might be related to a shared response to climate change. The results indicated a loss of bioclimatic space for 75% of the species studied and an increase for 10 species, especially in Mediterranean ones. Most of the species that will lose more than 70% of their current modeled distribution area comprised big macrolichens with cyanobacteria as the photobiont, thereby indicating a great biomass loss in forests, which might affect nutrient cycles. We also found that the predicted distributions were trait-related. Smaller species, green-algae lichens, and saxicolous and epiphyte species will respond better to future climate change. The results of this type of study may help to identify the species that are most vulnerable to climate change and facilitate the development of conservation measures to avoid their decline." .

Passive acoustics is a potential non-intrusive approach for surveying this fragile ecosystem with minor disturbances. Invertebrate sounds can be major contributors to natural coastal soundscapes but are not well studied. We conducted controlled tank-based experiments to identify sound-producing invertebrates inhabiting north-east Atlantic maerl beds and to characterise their sounds in terms of frequency features and source levels. We also determined which sound types are able to be detected above natural maerl ambient noise and suitable for in situ monitoring. Tank recording sessions of 20 abundant and potentially soniferous invertebrates from maerl beds revealed eight soniferous species and 15 different sound types. Two new sound-producing families were identified, Calyptraeidae and Majidae. Six sound types had properties consistent with detectability and identification for in situ acoustic studies: the feeding sound of sea urchins Echinus esculentus, Paracentrotus lividus and Psammechinus miliaris, snapping sound of the snapping shrimp Athanas nitescens, and feeding and other sounds of the spider crab Maja brachydactyla. Estimated detection distances ranged from a few metres for sea urchin feeding sounds up to about 40 m for A. nitescens snaps and spider crab feeding sounds. These invertebrates, particularly A. nitescens, probably make a substantial contribution to the maerl ambient noise. This invertebrate sound library sets a basis for in situ acoustic studies." .

The proposed methodology rests on three steps combining different participatory tools that promote a comprehensive examination of the perceptions hold by relevant stakeholder groups. The first step consists of an institutional and stakeholder analysis developed in the study area. The second includes a participatory workshop, where a sequence of scoping exercises is conducted with the active collaboration of the invited stakeholders. The final step aims to validate scoping results and develop dependency networks between organizations and the identified ecosystem services. The approach was tested in the Arrábida Natural Park, a marine and coastal protected area in Portugal. Invited participants were able to identify an extensive list of ecosystem services in the natural area, establish linkages between those services and human wellbeing, identify drivers of change and perform a preliminary screening of the associated ecological, social, and economic values. The case study evaluation provided positive feedback on the usefulness of the approach, which advances the existing set of methods for participatory identification of ecosystem services and sets the scene for involvement of stakeholder groups in assessment and management processes." .

Two of the ponds were in the borough of Jabłonna Lacka and one in the borough of Sabnie. The fields around each pond were divided into transects with three concentric soil moisture sections, each with different soil water contents. Soil and plant samples were taken from each transect to determine the concentrations of copper and zinc by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Despite the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the fields, copper and zinc had not polluted the soil or the plants growing in the soil depressions. Out of the six plants tested, only C. palustre had an increased concentration of zinc. Different farming methods used on the fields affected the concentrations of copper and zinc in the soil of the different depressions. The highest concentrations of these metals were found in the soil of the periodically wet sections." .

Live coral cover in back reef and fringing reef habitats initially remained relatively stable, but began a gradual decline around 2010. We assessed the changes in the functional composition of the herbivorous fish community following the pulse perturbations and during the time of gradual coral decline on the back reef and fringing reef. Forty-nine species of herbivorous fishes quantified in yearly surveys between 2006 and 2014 were assigned to six functional groups: browser, detritivore, excavator, farmer, grazer/detritivore, and scraper. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses revealed that despite unique functional assemblages initially existing among the fringing reef, back reef, and fore reef habitats, the herbivorous fish communities in all three habitats responded in a qualitatively similar fashion to coral decline by moving toward functional communities characterized by an increased representation of excavators and scrapers. Island-wide scraper biomass increased by ~sevenfold in the post-disturbance time period, while excavator biomass increased by nearly threefold. The biomass of detritivores and grazers/detritivores also increased over the same time period, but to a much lesser degree, while the biomass of browsers and farmers remained essentially unchanged. Macroalgae remained a relatively minor space holder (<10 % cover) in lagoon habitats and on the fore reef through 2014, enabling recruitment of juvenile coral and initiating coral recovery on the fore reef. Results suggest that a functional community with a substantial biomass of herbivores and the capacity for the biomass of scrapers and excavators to increase rapidly in response to landscape-scale declines in coral cover may enhance resilience by preventing the widespread establishment of macroalgae." .

The ramifications of the latter for the functioning of benthic ecosystems are unknown, but are dependent ultimately on rates of utilisation relative to inputs. Low input and high utilisation can strengthen bottom-up pathways and enhance consumer biomass and abundance. However, if inputs exceed utilisation rates, dung can accumulate, leading to a decline in water quality, with important repercussions for resident assemblages. Here, we quantify the consequences of hippo dung inputs on benthic assemblages in an estuarine lake in South Africa. The system supports over a thousand hippos, and during recent drought periods (extending over a decade), hippo dung has been observed to form mats over benthic habitats. Enrichment of plots using exclusion/inclusion cages with dung at naturally occurring concentrations indicated a decline in benthic chl-a by roughly 50% and macrofaunal abundance, biomass and richness by up to 76, 56 and 27% respectively. Our findings suggest that persistent inputs of hippo dung can act as an important stressor of benthic systems, leading ultimately to a loss of productivity. Accumulation of hippo dung over benthic habitats is therefore an important mechanism by which hippos indirectly structure aquatic ecosystems." .

A floristic survey has been carried out yearly 1 year after the construction of the artificial ecosystem in 2004, observing the modification of the vascular flora composition in time. The flora of the ESF accounted for 54 % of the whole Regional Park’s flora; alien species amount to 12 %; taxa of conservation concern are 6 %. Comparing the data in the years, except for the biennium 2006/2007, we observed a continuous increase of species richness, together with an increase of endemics, species of conservation concern, and alien species too. Once the endemics appeared, they remained part of the flora, showing a good persistence in the artificial wetland. Included in a natural park, but trapped in a sprawling and fast growing urban context, this artificial ecosystem provides multiple uses, by preserving and enhancing biodiversity. This is particularly relevant considering that biodiversity can act as a driver of sustainable development in urban areas where most of the world’s population lives and comes into direct contact with nature." .

In addition, correlation method and ANOVA were used to reveal the effect of LUI on ecosystem services and human well-being. These results showed that LUI was correlated with changes in ecosystem services and human well-being in the study area. As LUI increased, there were increases in crop production and living standard well-being and a reduction in regulating services (soil conservation and climate regulation). The statistical results between LUI and food security were not significant. Furthermore, there were tradeoffs between provisioning and regulating services and synergies between regulating services when the LUI increased. These findings revealed the different responses of ecosystem services and human well-being to increasing LUI and provided guidelines for land-use decision-making and ecosystem services management." .

In a climate change scenario, this typically Mediterranean species is expected to expand its range in response to increasing temperatures. We collected 25,132 high-resolution occurrence records from P. kuhlii European range between 1980 and 2013 and modelled the species’ distribution with a multi-temporal approach, using three bioclimatic variables and one proxy of urbanisation. Temperature in the coldest quarter of the year was the most important factor predicting the presence of P. kuhlii and showed an increasing trend in the study period; mean annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality were also relevant, but to a lower extent. Although urbanisation increased in recently colonised areas, it had little effect on the species’ presence predictability. P. kuhlii expanded its geographical range by about 394 % in the last four decades, a process that can be interpreted as a response to climate change." .

In 2012, the basin experienced the second year of a severe drought and the third multi-year drought in the last 15 years. During severe droughts, low reservoir and river levels can cause economic and ecological impacts to the reservoir, river, and estuarine ecosystems. During drought, augmenting Apalachicola River discharge through upstream reservoir releases and demand management are intuitive and often-suggested solutions to minimizing downstream effects. We assessed whether the existing reservoir system could be operated to minimize drought impacts on downstream water users and ecosystems through flow augmentation. Our analysis finds that in extreme drought such as observed during 2012, increases in water releases from reservoir storage are insufficient to even increase Apalachicola River discharge to levels observed in the 2007 drought. This suggests that there is simply not enough water available in managed storage to offset extreme drought events. Because drought frequency and intensity is predicted to increase under a variety of climate forecasts, our results demonstrate the need for a critical assessment of how water managers will meet increasing water demands in the ACF. Key uncertainties that should be addressed include (1) identifying the factors that led to extremely low Flint River discharge in 2012, and (2) determining how water “saved” via demand management is allocated to storage or passed to downstream ecosystem needs as part of the ongoing revisions to the ACF Water Control Manual by the US Army Corps of Engineers." .

The future of these megaherbivore-impoverished ecosystems is difficult to predict, though many studies have demonstrated increasing representation of C3 woody plants.

We use isotopic records of historical common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) canines to quantify herbaceous vegetation change in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda following a period of civil unrest and poaching. This poaching event led to population collapse of two threatened African megaherbivore species: hippopotamus and African elephants (Loxodonta africana). Serial carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) in canine enamel from individuals that lived between 1960–2000 indicated substantial increases in C3 herbaceous plants in their diet (<20% C3 in the 1960s to 30–45% C3 in the 80s and 90s), supported by other observational and ecological data. These data indicate megaherbivore loss results in succession of both woody and herbaceous C3 vegetation and further reaching effects, such as decreased grazing capacity and herbivore biodiversity in the area. Given multiple lines of evidence, these individuals appear to accurately capture herbaceous vegetation change in Mweya." .

In a subtropical area of the coast of Brazil, Southwestern Atlantic (23°48′S, 45°22′W), the effect of predators on subtidal benthic assemblages was tested by manipulating consumers access to experimental units. Community attributes were then measured at two different successional stages (30 and 100 days) and two spatial scales (within and among sites a few kilometers apart). Since recruitment can modulate predation, settlement rate and composition of recruits were also estimated at each site. Consumer effects were not general, depending on both site and successional stage. During early succession, and at sites where bare space was promptly occupied, predation did not reduce species richness, probably because settlement of a diverse species pool was intense. However, where recruitment rate was reduced and space occupation slower, predation decreased species richness as has been commonly observed in tropical areas. In later assemblages, and at sites where recruitment was intense, predation altered species composition, either facilitating poorer competitors or mediating competitive interactions between dominant species, as predicted by classical theory for temperate areas. This study shows that the outcome of predation in subtropical areas may vary, with effects either resembling those reported to the tropics or more aligned to classic observations in temperate areas. We advocate that variation between these extremes can be largely explained by recruitment dynamics." .

Survival on the boundary depends on how well individuals discriminate optimal from suboptimal habitat patches. Such behaviour is called habitat choice and was only rarely applied to macroecology, although it links species ecological niche and species distribution. Surface and subterranean aquatic species are spatially strongly segregated, even in the absence of physical barriers. We explored whether a behavioural response to light functions as a habitat choice mechanism that could explain species turnover between surface and subterranean aquatic ecosystems. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we studied the behavioural response to light of ten pairs of surface and subterranean amphipods that permanently co-occur in springs. Surface species showed a weak photophobic, photoneutral, and in one case, photophilic response, whereas all subterranean species showed a strong photophobic response. Eyeless subterranean but not eyed surface amphipods appear to orient themselves with light cues. On a local scale, this difference possibly diminishes harmful interactions between the co-occurring amphipods, whereas on a regional scale, photophobia could explain limited dispersal and a high degree of endemism observed among subterranean species." .

Unbiased recursive partitioning analyses identified a suite of interacting and conditional ecological factors encompassing social rank, host anemone species, and location effects as the primary factors predicting the distribution of melanistic morphs. Melanistic morphs were generally associated with host anemones from the genus Stichodactyla and with fish having a high social rank. The lack of a distinct melanistic morph locational ‘hot spot’ common to all species, despite locational coexistence, suggests that causative factors of location effects were different among species. Our results highlight the complexity of clownfish polymorphism associated with melanism, with multiple non-exclusive potential explanations identified for future investigation." .

These human-related disturbances on animals may induce behavioural and physiological changes that can ultimately affect their fitness, showing a similar anti-predator response that against natural predator or other threats. Here, we combine the use of behavioural and physiological approaches to assess the potential effect of winter human activities on a threatened farmland bird in Europe, the pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata). We compared before, during and after weekend variations in human activity rates, pin-tailed sandgrouse behaviour (flocking and flying behaviour, interspecific association in mixed flocks and habitat use) and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. Human disturbances, in particular those associated with hunting activities, peaked during weekends. Sandgrouse showed significant behavioural changes (increased sandgrouse-only flock sizes, increased proportion of birds flying and changes in habitat use) during weekends and higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations after the weekends compared with during or before weekends. Therefore, physiological stress levels could be modulated by behavioural adjustments such as increased flock sizes and changes in habitat use that may allow sandgrouse to cope with increased human disturbance rates during weekends. Nevertheless, temporal and spatial organization of hunting days among groups of estates might be good strategies to buffer these potential adverse effects on wintering pin-tailed sandgrouse and other steppe species of conservation concern, while preserving a socio-economically important activity such as hunting." .

To study the spread and ecological associations of these invasive species, algal abundance, biomass and biodiversity of benthic assemblages at three different tidal levels were examined during five years. Sparse Ahnfeltiopsis sp. thalli (3 % cover) were detected in February 2007 at the three tidal levels. By January 2011, its cover had increased to 11 %, while its biomass showed a 27-fold increase. S. dubyi was detected at the lower intertidal level in January 2010 with a cover of 2 %. By January 2011, it had increased to 5 % and spread to the other intertidal levels. The presence of these two non-indigenous algae modified the substrate and the structure and composition of the benthic assemblage. The constant increase in the algal biomass and presence along the intertidal suggest that the effect will be greater in the future. Moreover, the effects of these exotic algae could potentially displace Brachidontes rodriguezii—an important ecosystem engineer that creates microhabitat for a large number of organisms on these shores." .

Even though large volume of literature materials is available of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change for many areas, very little is known of it in the floodplain of the Sokoto Rima River Basin of Nigeria despite the basin’s strategic importance. Thus, this study characterized the basin’s LU/LC and its change using computer-based digital classification of near-anniversary Landsat 5 TM imagery of November 23, 1998, and Landsat 8 OLI of December 2, 2013. The results of the digital classification were complimented with field-based observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 % of the basin’s uses is under cultivation, 22 % is under fallow, 27 % is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 % is forested. Change events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of increased human population pressure and effects of climate change. The LU/LC patterns and changes suggest underutilization and mismanagement of the floodplain which have impact on soil, hydrology and biodiversity with serious implication for livelihood and food security. The study recommends that interventions are needed to promote enhanced and sustainable management of land, water and vegetation resources in the basin, with particular emphasis on empowering the local land users to participate actively toward sustainable management of the floodplain." .

Many mountains are separated by lowland that likely was unsuitable for high-alpine plants even during cold climatic periods. We explore the relative importance of these processes using two endemic sister species: the widespread Ethiopian/eastern East African Carex monostachya and the mainly western East African C. runssoroensis. These bog-forming sedges co-occur in some mountains and are hypothesized to hybridize. The two species were distinctly differentiated for genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), also in one mountain where they co-occur. However, the plants from another mountain showed strong signals of admixture. The results suggest initial divergence into one western and one northern/eastern lineage, followed by long-distance dispersal resulting in secondary contact zones. In addition within species genetic diversity was clearly structured with distinct genetic groups on some, but not all mountains. Differentiation levels varied considerably and did not always correspond to the extent of lowland habitat between mountains. The narrow Rift Valley in the otherwise nearly contiguous highlands in Ethiopia appears to present a much stronger barrier to dispersal than the extensive lowlands separating Ethiopia from East Africa. This may be a general pattern since it has been documented also for other afro-alpine species." .

The Hancornia speciosa, popularly called Mangaba, is a plant species that has potential commercial value and contributes to rural economic activities in Brazil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of global climate change on the potential geographic distribution, productivity, and value of production of H. speciosa in Brazil. We used MaxEnt to estimate the potential geographic distribution of the species in current and future (2050) climate scenarios. We obtained the productivity and value of production for 74 municipalities in Brazil. Moreover, to explain the variation the productivity and value of production, we constructed 15 models based on four variables: two ecological (ecological niche model and the presence of Unity of conservation) and two socio-economic (gross domestic product and human developed index). The models were selected using Akaike Information Criteria. Our results suggest that municipalities currently harvesting H. speciosa will have lower harvest rates in the future (mainly in northeastern Brazil). The best model to explain the productivity was ecological niche model; thus, municipalities with higher productivity are inserted in regions with higher environmental suitability (indicated by niche model). Thus, in the future, the municipalities harvesting H. speciosa will produce less because there will be less suitable habitat for H. speciosa, which in turn will affect the H. speciosa harvest and the local economy." .

We used 25 years of fishery-independent trap data (N = 11,237 trap hauls) to examine the spatial and temporal variability in temperate reef fish abundance along the southeast coast of the USA, a relatively understudied region with many economically important reef fish species. Overall, 441,298 individuals from 118 species were caught in the trap survey. Number of species and total number of individuals caught in the trap survey declined over the 25 years, but when separated, nontargeted fish species declined more than fishery-targeted species. For instance, traps caught a median of 18 nontargeted individuals and a median of 2–3 nontargeted reef fish species in the early 1990s, but by the 2010s, traps caught a median of fewer than three nontargeted individuals and a median of one nontarget species. Using generalized additive models, we found that the catch of fishery-targeted and nontargeted species was positively related to bottom water temperature, while depth influenced nontargeted and fishery-targeted species in opposite ways. The substantial and consistent decline in nontargeted fish species suggests that more research and management attention should be given to these often ignored species. These results suggest that the temperate reef fish community in the southeast USA is influenced by more than just fishing, perhaps including invasive species (e.g., lionfish Pterois volitans), decadal-scale environmental variability, or climate change." .

In this study, we examine diploidy as well as regional and local spatial genetic structure using males of Bombus vosnesenskii, a stable bumble bee species found across western North America. Specifically, we investigate patterns of genetic structure in both island and mainland populations, across spatial scales, and over a range of natural and human-altered habitats. We document high levels of male diploidy, with significantly higher levels in mainland populations compared to island populations and increasing diploidy in areas with poor nesting habitat. Interestingly, we also find evidence of significant spatial genetic structure from 0 to 10 km and 0 to 5 km on island and mainland populations, respectively. Finally, we document low but significant genetic differentiation across the region (ΦST = 0.049).

An Agassiz trawl deployed in the same area yielded samples for taxonomic validation and comparison to the visual survey. The sponge grounds were observed between 1200 and 1440 m depth. Eight species were identified in the trawl samples from five genera: Geodia, Thenea, Pheronema, Aphrocallistes and Craniella. In addition, there were 2 unresolved species of Craniella, one of Hexadella and 2 other unidentifiable Porifera species. Seven taxa were consistently identified from the video footage. Craniella longipilis was numerically dominant across all depths, but other species showed significant change in abundance with depth. At shallower depths Pheronema carpenteri was more prevalent, whereas the encrusting species Hexadella sp. increased in frequency with depth. Although all species have been previously reported from the North Atlantic, community composition at Rosemary Bank appears to be more diverse than other regions. Estimates of the number of sponges within the surveyed area suggest around 88 million sponges may be present. The community appears to be largely in pristine condition and the recent designation of Rosemary Bank as a nature conservation MPA should help ensure it remains so." .

Land-cover patterns likely explain much of this variation, although little is known about how they vary among watersheds. Our goal was to analyze a series of urban catchments within a range of impervious cover to evaluate how land-cover varies among them. We then highlight examples from the literature to explore the potential effects of land-cover pattern variability for urban watershed management. High-resolution (1 m2) land-cover data were used to quantify 23 land-cover pattern and stormwater infrastructure metrics within 32 catchments across the Triangle Region of North Carolina. These metrics were used to analyze variability in land-cover patterns among the study catchments. We used hierarchical clustering to organize the catchments into four groups, each with a distinct landscape pattern. Among these groups, the connectivity of combined land-cover patches accounted for 40 %, and the size and shape of lawns and buildings accounted for 20 %, of the overall variation in land-cover patterns among catchments. Storm water infrastructure metrics accounted for 8 % of the remaining variation. Our analysis demonstrates that land-cover patterns do vary among urban catchments, and that trees and grass (lawns) are divergent cover types in urban systems. The complex interactions among land-covers have several direct implications for the ongoing management of urban watersheds." .

In transitional waters, salinity is a key driver of ecological processes mostly depending on the balance between marine and river inputs, a balance that can be significantly modified by climate change and by anthropogenic alteration of the watershed. Mesoamerica being considered as a climate change hot-spot and as an ecoregion strongly vulnerable to global change, our study aimed at analyzing the relationship between salinity, river runoff, and rainfall variability in a tropical coastal lagoon and to assess the respective influence of climate change and watershed management. The study focusing on the large and shallow coastal lagoon of Laguna de Terminos in south eastern Mexico established: (1) the variability in salinity distribution along the yearly cycle and the occurrence of a high salinity anomaly period during the wet season of 2009; (2) the relationship between lagoon waters salinity and river inputs further underlying the anomalous situation encountered in 2009; (3) a long term increase in river discharge during the past 60 years, indicating potential salinity decrease in the lagoon during that same period; (4) an absence of any change in rainfall linking the increase in runoff to watershed management rather than long term trend in climate change. Additionally, the specific context of the 2009–2010 Central-Equatorial Pacific El Niño is underlined and the potential relationship between river discharge and ENSO is discussed. Those results should be of significant practical value to decision-makers who are often keen to point the finger at global climate change when local environmental management is also and sometime most significantly responsible." .

Here, we assess how soil C-N-P stoichiometry is affected by climatic change along a 3500-km temperate climate transect in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results reveal that the soil from more arid and warmer sites are associated with lower soil organic C, total N and P. The ratios of both soil C:P and N:P decrease, but soil C:N increases with increasing aridity and temperature, indicating the predicted decreases in precipitation and warming for most of the temperate grassland region could lead to a soil C-N-P decoupling that may reduce plant growth and production in arid ecosystems. Soil pH, mainly reflecting long-term climate change in our sites, also contributes to the changing soil C-N-P stoichiometry, indicating the collective influences of climate and soil type on the shape of soil C-N-P balance." .

In this study, one set (eight treatments with four replications) of field-moist surface soils (0–15 cm) and their air-dried counterparts obtained from a long-term liming experiment were incubated at 30 °C under waterlogged conditions for 10 days, and the amounts of net NH4 +-N released (soluble and exchangeable) were determined after extraction with 4 M KCl. Another set of three surface soils were used to evaluate the effect of six heavy metals on the NH4 +-N release under waterlogged conditions. Results showed that increasing the liming rate from 0 to 17,930 kg ha−1 effective calcium carbonate equivalent increased the average soil pH from 4.98 to 7.06, averages of the amounts of NH4 +-N released ranged from 1.6 to 5.2 mg N kg−1 field-moist soil, and the corresponding amounts released in air-dried soils ranged from 18.9 to 32.9 mg N kg−1 soil. This increase of the amount NH4 +-N released in air-dried soil samples is presumably due to a slaking effect. At 5 mmol kg−1 soil, all six heavy metals inhibited the NH4 +-N released. The relative effectiveness of the heavy metals in inhibition of the NH4 +-N released varied among the three soils. Lead(II) was the most effective inhibitor of NH 4 +-N release in Clarion and Harps soils and Cd(II) in Harps soil. Cobalt(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) were the least effective inhibitors of NH4 +-N release in Clarion, Harps, and Okoboji soils, respectively." .

Measuring T. matsutake biomass in soil allows us to determine the kinetics of fungal growth before and after fruiting, which is useful for analyzing the conditions of the shiro and its surrounding mycorrhizosphere, predicting fruiting timing, and managing forests to obtain better crop yields. Here, we document a novel method to quantify T. matsutake mycelia in soil by quantifying a single-copy DNA element that is uniquely conserved within T. matsutake but is absent from other fungal species, including close relatives and a wide range of ectomycorrhizal associates of P. densiflora. The targeted DNA region was amplified quantitatively in cultured mycelia that were mixed with other fungal species and soil, as well as in an in vitro co-culture system with P. densiflora seedlings. Using this method, we quantified T. matsutake mycelia not only from shiro in natural environments but also from the surrounding soil in which T. matsutake mycelia could not be observed by visual examination or distinguished by other means. It was demonstrated that the core of the shiro and its underlying area in the B horizon are predominantly composed of fungal mycelia. The fungal mass in the A or A0 horizon was much lower, although many white mycelia were observed at the A horizon. Additionally, the rhizospheric fungal biomass peaked during the fruiting season." .

The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) drilling rig explosion of 2010 affected an approximately 176,000 km2 surface area of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) when an estimated 210 million gallons of oil from the Macondo Prospect spilled into the environment. Pelagic Sargassum, a complex of two surface drifting species (Sargassum natans and Sargassum fluitans) of marine brown macroalgae and a critically important habitat in the GOM ecosystem, was suffused by Macondo Prospect 252 oil released during the DWH event. Using 16S rRNA PCR and Roche 454 pyrosequencing, the effect of the oil on the bacterial population associated with pelagic Sargassum and contiguous waters was examined by comparing sequence data generated from samples collected from oiled and non-oiled locations in the northern GOM. Sequence data showed similar microbial composition in Sargassum regardless of exposure to oil primarily dominated by five phyla; Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and unclassified bacteria. The microbial composition in water samples was significantly less diverse than for Sargassum and consisted primarily of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Due to the evenly distributed abundance of microbial species on oiled and non-oiled pelagic Sargassum, study findings indicate that DWH spilled oil had minimal effect on the composition and diversity of the microbial community associated with Sargassum and contiguous waters. However, higher abundances of Sulfitobacter and one species of Psychrobacter were found in oiled water samples when compared to non-oiled water samples indicating some effect of DHW oil in the microbial composition of seawater. Though there are a number of marine studies using molecular biology approaches, this is the first molecular examination of the impact of the DWH oil spill on bacterial communities associated with pelagic Sargassum and contiguous waters from the GOM." .

We examined and compared the developmental characteristics of native and commercial colonies and their first-generation hybrids under the same laboratory conditions. Young queens and males produced in both native and commercial colonies were mated to generate four genotype groups: Native × Native (N♀ × N♂), Native × Commercial (N♀ × C♂), Commercial × Commercial (C♀ × C♂), and Commercial × Native (C♀ × N♂).

Our results showed that the semi-arid steppe in north China was resistant to both daytime and nighttime warming, but vulnerable to drought. Nighttime warming, but not daytime warming, enhanced community resistance to drought via stimulating carbon sequestration, whereas neither daytime nor nighttime warming affected community resilience to drought. Large decline in plant community cover, primarily caused by the reduction in the cover of dominant and rare species rather than subordinate species during drought, did not preclude rapid ecosystem recovery.

However, these landscapes are very vulnerable to change. In China, rapid land use change, especially urbanization, has become one of the main challenges for the conservation of cultural heritage landscapes in rural areas. This paper focuses on the designated cultural villages in rural China by systematically analyzing the spatial distribution of the designated cultural landscape across the country and assessing the threats these traditional landscapes are facing under current and future urbanization and other land use pressures. Current designated cultural heritage landscapes in China are predominantly located in the rural and peri-urban regions of Central and South China and less frequently found in other regions. Especially in these regions risks to land use change are large. These risks are assessed based on observed recent land use change and land use model simulations for scenarios up to 2050. The risk assessment reveals that especially in Southeast China along the sea coast and near the cities along the Yangtze River, high pressures are expected on cultural heritage landscapes due to urbanization. At the same time, in Southwest China, especially in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, high pressures due to other land use changes are expected, including land abandonment. This assessment gives direction and guidance toward the selection of the most threatened cultural villages for detailed investigation and additional protection measures." .

Here, we provide a large-scale assessment of invasions, using an extensive literature review and standardized field surveys, to characterize the invasion dynamics of non-native ascidians in the continental United States and Alaska. Twenty-six non-native ascidian species have established documented populations on the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts (spanning 25–57°N). Invader species richness is greatest for the Pacific coast (19 spp.), followed by the Atlantic (14 spp.) and Gulf (6 spp.) coasts, and decreases towards higher latitudes. Most species (97 %) expanded their range after initial introduction, although the direction and latitudinal extent of secondary spread varied. Temporal analyses, based on literature reported first records and repeated field surveys, show an increase in recorded non-native ascidians at continental, regional, and local scales. Our results underscore that non-native species continue to establish and spread, and the transfer of biofouling organisms on underwater surfaces of vessels is an active and potent vector that remains largely unmanaged.

Methods Eight years after a single fertilization of K-deficient Picea abies with 200 kg K ha−1, fine roots were collected from 7 control and 6 K-fertilized plots. Fine root biomass and morphology were determined. The identification of ectomycorrhizal taxa was determined by morphotyping and by amplification of the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results K-fertilization did not affect the amount of fine root biomass and ectomycorrhizal community structure in the Oi + Oe and Oa layers but led to a significant increase in fine root biomass, fine root length, and root tip number in the mineral soil layer. Conclusion An increase in growth due to K-fertilization leads to great exploration of the mineral soil by fine roots but does not affect the ectomycorrhizal community structure in the organic horizons." .

Results reveal that all heavy metals/metalloid exceeded the background values for soil environmental quality of heavy metals in Guizhou area. Geo-accumulation index (I geo) showed that arsenic had the highest contamination level (I geo=4) among the seven heavy metals/metalloid, and the contamination levels of mercury and lead were also relatively high (I geo=3). Pearson correlation and cluster analysis identified that mercury, copper and arsenic had a relationship, and their presence might be mainly related to mining activity, coal and oil combustion, and vehicle emissions. Improved Nemerow index indicated that the overall level of heavy metal contamination in the studied area ranged from moderately–heavily contaminated to heavily contaminated level. Potential ecological risk index (R I) analysis manifested that the whole ecological risk level ranged from high degree to very high degree (325.30≤R I≤801.02) in the studied soil samples, and the potential ecological risk factors (E r i ) of heavy metals/metalloid were as follows: Hg > As > Cd > Pb > Cu > Ni > Cr, and the E r i of Hg and As reached very high risk grade." .

To better understand natural recovery processes of the damaged habitat, field investigation and laboratory analysis were used to analyze relationships between plant colonization and soil characteristics in an over 30-year natural recovery of a damaged giant panda habitat in a debris flow gully after the 1976 Songpan-Pingwu earthquake in Sichuan Province, China. Four different damaged sites were selected that located at the center of the gully (center), on a flat alluvial fan (fan), in a side slope of the gully (slope), and at the ecotone between the gully and native forest (ecotone). Vegetation characteristics, soil physicochemical properties, and microbial biomass in the different sites and soil depths were measured. After the natural recovery, the soil fertility, water retention, and microbial biomass were highest at ecotone, followed by fan, slope, and center. Only a few perennial herbs colonized at center; shrubs started to invade at fan and slope, and the native trees dominated the community of ecotone. Furthermore, Fargesia spathacea (food for the giant panda) started to be re-established at ecotone, and the community characteristic of ecotone recovered similarly to the native habitat. These results suggested that improving the soil fertility, water retaining capacity and microbial biomass is fundamental to the plant colonization, particular for F. spathacea’s reestablishment in a damaged giant panda habitat." .

Initial ideas about spatial resilience focused on coral reefs and emphasized escalating anthropogenic disturbances across the broader seascape. This perspective resonated with a new awareness of global drivers of change, such as growth in international trade and shifts in climate, and the need to respond by scaling up governance and management. We review recent trends and emerging ideas in spatial resilience, using coral reefs and dependent communities as exemplars of multi-scale social–ecological systems. Despite recent advances, management and governance of ecosystems remain spatially fragmented and constrained to small scales. Temporally, many interventions still miss or ignore warning signals and struggle to cope with history, politics, long-term cumulative pressures, feedbacks, and sudden surprises. Significant recent progress has been made in understanding the relevance of spatial and temporal scale, heterogeneity, networks, the importance of place, and multi-scale governance. Emerging themes include better integration of ecology and conservation with social and economic science, and incorporating temporal dynamics in spatial analyses. A better understanding of the multi-scale spatial and temporal processes that drive the resilience of linked social-ecosystems will help address the widespread mismatch between the scales of ongoing ecological change and effective long-term governance of land- and seascapes." .

This type of management can be facilitated by an understanding of the thermal ecology of aquatic organisms. However, information on thermal ecology for entire taxonomic groups is rarely compiled or summarized, and reviews of the science can facilitate its advancement. Crayfish are one of the most globally threatened taxa, and ongoing declines and extirpation could have serious consequences on aquatic ecosystem function due to their significant biomass and ecosystem roles. Our goal was to review the literature on thermal ecology for freshwater crayfish worldwide, with emphasis on studies that estimated temperature tolerance, temperature preference, or optimal growth. We also explored relationships between temperature metrics and species distributions. We located 56 studies containing information for at least one of those three metrics, which covered approximately 6 % of extant crayfish species worldwide. Information on one or more metrics existed for all 3 genera of Astacidae, 4 of the 12 genera of Cambaridae, and 3 of the 15 genera of Parastacidae. Investigations employed numerous methodological approaches for estimating these parameters, which restricts comparisons among and within species. The only statistically significant relationship we observed between a temperature metric and species range was a negative linear relationship between absolute latitude and optimal growth temperature. We recommend expansion of studies examining the thermal ecology of freshwater crayfish and identify and discuss methodological approaches that can improve standardization and comparability among studies." .

Lipid class and FA profiles of four soft coral families (eleven species) and one hydrocoral family (four species) from the northeastern part of the Sea of Okhotsk were studied for the first time and compared with their tropical counterparts. Among cold-water cnidarians, soft corals contained much more monoalkyldiacylglycerols but less triacylglycerols than hydrocorals. The lipid class profile of all azooxanthellate soft corals did not differ, whereas FA profiles of these corals from cold-water and tropical regions differed. The key FAs were arachidonic (20:4n-6) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) acids, followed by 24:5n-6 and 24:6n-3. Within the cold-water corals, a sharp difference in polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) profiles between Primnoidae species and other families (Nephtheidae, Paragorgiidae, and Acanthogorgiidae) was found. The high level of n-3 PUFAs (20:5n-3 and 24:6n-3) in Primnoidae and the high level of n-6 PUFAs (20:4n-6 and 24:5n-6) in other cold-water coral families indicated the substantial difference in a feeding behavior between these corals inhabiting the same biotope. Based on the FA markers, a dietary predomination of herbivorous zooplankton is assumed for Primnoidae. An opportunistic feeding on various food sources is supposed for other cold-water coral families studied. The lipid and FA profiles were found to be characteristic for tropical zooxanthellate reef-building and soft corals, azooxanthellate soft corals from tropical and cold-water regions, and Primnoidae among cold-water coral families." .

The North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) hosts nearly 120 species of wetland-dependent birds representing 21 families. Strategic management requires knowledge of avian habitat requirements and assessment of species most vulnerable to future threats. We applied bioclimatic species distribution models (SDMs) to project range changes of 29 wetland-dependent bird species using ensemble modeling techniques, a large number of General Circulation Models (GCMs), and hydrological climate covariates. For the U.S. PPR, mean projected range change, expressed as a proportion of currently occupied range, was −0.31 (± 0.22 SD; range − 0.75 to 0.16), and all but two species were projected to lose habitat. Species associated with deeper water were expected to experience smaller negative impacts of climate change. The magnitude of climate change impacts was somewhat lower in this study than earlier efforts most likely due to use of different focal species, varying methodologies, different modeling decisions, or alternative GCMs. Quantification of the projected species-specific impacts of climate change using species distribution modeling offers valuable information for vulnerability assessments within the conservation planning process." .

Contamination of the River Nile water with various pesticides poses a hazardous risk to both human and environmental compartments. Therefore, a large scale monitoring study was carried on pesticides pollution in three geographical main regions along the River Nil water stream, Egypt. MethodsOrganochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by GC-ECD. ResultsOrganochlorine pesticides mean concentrations along the River Nile water samples were 0.403, 1.081, 1.209, 3.22, and 1.192 μg L−1 for endrin, dieldrin, p, p’-DDD, p, p’-DDT, and p, p’-DDE, respectively. Dieldrin, p, p’-DDT, and p, p’-DDE were above the standard guidelines of the World Health Organization. Detected organophosphorus pesticides were Triazophos (2.601 μg L−1), Quinalphos (1.91 μg L−1), fenitrothion (1.222 μg L−1), Ethoprophos (1.076 μg L−1), chlorpyrifos (0.578 μg L−1), ethion (0.263 μg L−1), Fenamiphos (0.111 μg L−1), and pirimiphos-methyl (0.04 μg L−1). Toxicity characterization of organophosphorus pesticides according to water quality guidelines indicated the hazardous risk of detected chemicals to the public and to the different environmental compartments. The spatial distribution patterns of detected pesticides reflected the reverse relationship between regional temperature and organochlorine pesticides distribution. However, organophosphorus was distributed according to the local inputs of pollutant compounds. ConclusionsToxicological and water quality standards data revealed the hazardous risk of detected pesticides in the Egyptian River Nile water to human and aquatic life. Thus, our monitoring data will provide viewpoints by which stricter legislation and regulatory controls can be admitted to avoid River Nile pesticide water pollution." .

Yet, their role in the trophodynamics of the novel assemblages has been largely overlooked. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of the alien fish species on the structure of the food web along the Israeli upper shelf soft bottoms, as expressed by their biomass relative abundance, and by comparing the mean and distribution patterns of the trophic levels among the aliens and the local native species. Our study, based on examination of more than 200,000 fishes belonging to 111 species, revealed that at 20-m alien species comprised 54 % of all sampled individuals while comprising 70 % of the biomass; at 40 the alien species comprised 67 % of all sampled individuals and 45 % of the biomass. Overall, the mean weighted trophic level of the aliens was 3.74, while that of the natives was 3.39. Depth was found as an important factor affecting the trophic levels of both native and alien species. At a depth of 20 m, the combined mean weighted trophic level (natives + aliens) was slightly higher than at 40 m (3.61 and 3.56, respectively), although depth impact differed between aliens and natives. Between a depth of 20 and 40 m, the mean weighted trophic level of aliens increased from 3.65 to 3.85, while that of the natives decreased from 3.54 to 3.33. These findings indicate that the local food webs have gone through significant modification, with a trend of increasing dominance of alien fish." .

A total of 6285 turtles of five species were encountered, with the three most common species being loggerhead (Caretta caretta; n = 3192), green (Chelonia mydas; n = 2572), and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea; n = 376). Generalized linear models demonstrated that loggerhead and green turtle strandings have increased over the last 10 years. Strandings were highest from October to March, which coincides with the greatest bottom pair trawl, gill net, and possibly double-rig trawl fishing effort near the coast. Our results provide a baseline to compare future sea turtle stranding patterns. For reducing sea turtle mortalities, we suggest that time/area closures and/or reduction in gill net, pair trawl, and possibly double-rig trawl fishing effort in coastal waters of southern Brazil during austral spring and summer be considered for future fisheries management plans." .

Idotea balthica inhabits floating algae at the sea surface and accumulations of decaying algae on the seafloor, whereas I. granulosa primarily occurs in intertidal macroalgal belts. In laboratory experiments on individually reared isopods I. balthica outperformed I. granulosa with regard to growth, reproduction, and mortality in both a fully inundated habitat and in a tidal habitat with 5 h of daily emergence. We hypothesized that habitat segregation in the two isopod species is driven by one or multiple types of biotic interactions: (1) no interaction, (2) cannibalism, (3) intraguild predation, and (4) terrestrial predation. In order to evaluate how habitat segregation can be explained by each of these interaction types we employed a size-structured population model to account for the body-size-dependent predation. Net population growth rates were fitted to the simulations as a measure of population fitness. Experimental results served as database for parameter and process identification. As predation rates were unknown, we performed a sensitivity analysis for these. We found that below 5 h of daily tidal emergence either cannibalism or terrestrial predation sufficed to explain habitat segregation. Intraguild predation, in contrast, advantaged I. balthica in any case. From linear extrapolation of the effects occurring under conditions of 5 h of daily tidal emergence, we predict that contrasting physiological responses in I. balthica and I. granulosa would cause segregation even without any interaction if emergence lasted long enough." .

Based on field samplings in a typical saline groundwater-irrigated region, spatial variations of soil microbial metabolic activities were investigated. Combined with groundwater quality analysis, the relationship between microbial activities and water salinity was also studied. The results demonstrated that moderate spatial heterogeneity of soil microbial activities presented under the total dissolved solids (TDS) of groundwater ranging from 0.23 to 12.24 g L−1. Groundwater salinity and microbial activities had almost opposite distribution characteristics: slight saline water was mainly distributed in west Baqu and south Quanshan, while severe saline and briny water were dominant in east Baqu and west Huqu; however, total AWCD was higher in the east-center and southwest of Baqu and east Huqu, while it was lower in east Baqu and northwest Huqu. The results of correlation analyses demonstrated that high-salinity groundwater irrigation had significantly adverse effects on soil microbial activities. Major ions Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl_, and SO4 2− in groundwater decisively influenced the results. Three carbon sources, carbohydrates, amines, and phenols, which had minor utilization rates in all irrigation districts, were extremely significantly affected by high-salinity groundwater irrigation.

While the overall ecology of tidal rock pools has been well studied, the dynamics of the phytoplankton assemblage have been comparatively neglected. In addition, there are no studies to date which describe the dynamics of phytoplankton within a habitat associated with stromatolites. The aim of this study was to investigate the coarse-scale phytoplankton community composition of a series of peritidal pools associated with living stromatolites, using a spectral fluorescence analysis tool, in relation to source-specific drivers related to both freshwater and marine forces. Three sites were sampled monthly from January to December 2014. Physico-chemical, biotic and meteorological parameters were recorded to assess some of the factors which might influence the phytoplankton size-fractionation and community composition using a generalised linear modelling approach. Results indicate that fresh or marine pool state, temporal differences associated with season, macronutrients (N and P), and benthic microalgal biomass are important drivers of the phytoplankton assemblages. Specifically, a transition from fresh to marine pool conditions resulted in an increased abundance of smaller phytoplankton size fractions and a shift from Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta to Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta. Overall, the community was dominated by Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. There was consistency between the drivers and composition of the phytoplankton community compared to those from the few other comparable published studies. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a system which is dominated by benthic rather than pelagic microalgae in terms of biomass, thereby supporting the persistence of actively accreting stromatolites." .

More than eight species of vocal MMs are found to spatially converge on fish spawning areas containing massive densely populated herring shoals at night-time11,12,13,14,15,16 and diffuse herring distributions during daytime. We find the vocal MMs divide the enormous fish prey field into species-specific foraging areas with varying degrees of spatial overlap, maintained for at least two weeks of the herring spawning period. The recorded vocalization rates are diel (24 h)-dependent for all MM species, with some significantly more vocal at night and others more vocal during the day. The four key baleen whale species of the region: fin, humpback, blue and minke have vocalization rate trends that are highly correlated to trends in fish shoaling density and to each other over the diel cycle. These results reveal the temporospatial dynamics of combined multi-species MM foraging activities in the vicinity of an extensive fish prey field that forms a massive ecological hotspot, and would be unattainable with conventional methodologies.

We quantified Hg concentrations in eggs of two species of songbirds, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), nesting in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA. Geometric mean concentrations of total Hg (THg) were lower in red-winged blackbird eggs [218 and 107 ng/g dry weight (dw) for 2012 and 2013, respectively] than in tree swallow eggs (228 and 300 ng/g dw for 2012 and 2013, respectively), presumably reflecting differences in the trophic positions of these two species. Concentrations of MeHg averaged 98.4 % of THg in red-winged blackbird eggs. Levels of THg observed in this study were well below critical toxicological benchmarks commonly applied to eggs of avian species, suggesting these breeding populations were not adversely affected by exposure to MeHg. In red-winged blackbirds, concentrations of THg in eggs collected in 2012 were twice those in eggs collected in 2013. Hg levels in eggs of both species increased with date of clutch initiation. In red-winged blackbirds, for example, temporal patterns showed that a 3-week delay in clutch initiation increased egg THg by 60 %.

Here, we characterise the cutaneous bacterial communities of a captive colony of the critically endangered Australian southern corroboree frog, Pseudophyrne corroboree, and examine the effect of dietary carotenoid supplementation on bacterial abundance, species richness and community composition. Individuals receiving a carotenoid-supplemented diet exhibited significantly higher bacterial abundance and species richness as well as an altered bacterial community composition compared to individuals that did not receive dietary carotenoids. Our findings suggest that dietary carotenoid supplementation enhances the cutaneous bacteria community of the southern corroboree frog and regulates the presence of bacteria species within the cutaneous microbiome. Our study is the second to demonstrate that carotenoid supplementation can improve amphibian cutaneous bacterial community dynamics, drawing attention to the possibility that dietary manipulation may assist with the ex situ management of endangered species and improve resilience to lethal pathogens such as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)." .

Clams that had their siphons amputated every 2 weeks for 10 weeks were caged in the field with non-amputated clams, and their siphon tissue mass and shell growth were compared. Quantitative regeneration was confirmed in siphon-amputated clams, based on the greater total siphon weight (including the weight of amputated parts) than remaining siphon weight of control clams. However, the growth of siphon-amputated clams was lower than that of control clams. Regeneration rate was much lower in short-siphoned species than in long-siphoned species estimated from literature values, suggesting that quantitative regeneration might be less important for short-siphoned species than for long-siphoned species." .

We aim to assess the ecological impacts of bamboo expansion and the effectiveness of bamboo control for restoring alpine vegetation and species diversity. We quantified the extent of bamboo expansion, its effects on an alpine ecosystem, and the recovery of species diversity by bamboo removal over 6 years in Daisetsuzan National Park, northern Japan. We established paired, experimental plots assigned to either removal or control treatments following an encroaching gradient from interior to terminal locations in a large bamboo patch. We monitored bamboo development and aboveground production, and its impact on soil moisture and species diversity to assess the recovery process of snow meadow species after its removal. In control plots, bamboo density consistently increased and accumulated biomass from year to year. In the removal treatment, bamboo culm density, height and biomass decreased through time at all locations. Furthermore, soil moisture increased in the removal plots and remained consistently higher than controls throughout the growing season. Dwarf bamboo strongly suppressed alpine plants and reduced species diversity. However, alpine snow meadow species rapidly recovered and diversity increased through time in the removal treatment.

These data were used to assess variability in microbial community structure and diversity along in the Fenghe River, China. The relationship between bacterial diversity and environmental parameters was statistically analyzed. An average of 1682 operational taxonomic units was obtained. Microbial diversity increased from the headstream to downstream and tended to be greater in sediment compared with water. The water samples near the headstream endured relatively low Shannon and Chao1 indices. These diversity indices and the number of observed species in the water and sediment samples increase downstream. The parameters also differ in the two river tributaries. Community structures shift based on the extent of nitrogen pollution variation in the sediment and water samples. The four most dominant genera in the water community were Escherichia, Acinetobacter, Comamonadaceae, and Pseudomonas. In the sediments, the most dominant genera were Stramenopiles, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Comamonadaceae. The number of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in the headstream water slightly differed from that in the sediment but varied considerably in the downstream sediments. Statistical analysis showed that community variation is correlated with changes in ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen. This study identified different microbial community structures in river water and sediments. Overall this study emphasized the need to elucidate spatial variations in bacterial diversity in water and sediments associated with physicochemical gradients and to show the effects of such variation on waterborne microbial community structures." .

Previous studies indicate that habitat discontinuities and geographic isolation are major drivers of population division in cetaceans. Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are distributed in all tropical oceans, but they are particularly common around islands and atolls. This species occurs in shallow waters at daytime to rest and socialise, and feeds on offshore mesopelagic prey overnight. Here, we investigated the genetic population structure of spinner dolphins in the Southwest Indian Ocean along a west–east geographic gradient, from eastern Africa to the Mascarene archipelago. We combined analyses of 12 microsatellite loci, mtDNA control region sequences, and sighting data to assess genetic differentiation and characterise habitat preferences of these populations. Significant genetic structure among the three sampled sites (Zanzibar, Mayotte and La Réunion) was observed using both types of molecular markers. Overall, our results indicate that geographic isolation and potentially other factors, such as shallow-water habitats to rest and socialise, may be important drivers of the genetic population structure of insular spinner dolphins in this region." .

However, due to the complexity of biodiversity, it is impossible to obtain complete information about the diversity of all species even for small areas, necessitating the selection of individual species or assemblages thereof as species surrogate. In parts of the world where taxonomic expertise is lacking, species identification has hindered progress in biodiversity conservation, and the only practical, relatively-accurate option, is the use of taxonomic minimalism. ObjectiveWe carried out a rapid biodiversity assessment based on three surrogates—land-use (driver-surrogate), terrestrial arthropods (species-surrogate) and morphospecies (taxonomic-surrogate)—to determine the impacts of land-use on biodiversity of the Western Region (Ghana), an area covering ~4 % of the West African biodiversity hotspot. MethodWe used diversity profiles to visualize the distribution of a total of 8848 arthropod individuals over seven land-use types which define the complete heterogeneity of the landscape. ResultsHere, we present both sample and asymptotic diversity profiles of arthropod morphospecies for each land-use type and the potential of each land-use type for conserving arthropods. ConclusionsWe conclude that (1) the morphospecies approach is useful for detecting differences in species diversity of land-use types; (2) the concept of asymptotic diversity may not be necessary for land-use based biodiversity comparison; and (3) maximum diversity profiles are useful for determining the land-use conservation values in cases where pristine areas are not available." .

However, the extent to which land trusts explicitly focus on wildlife conservation remains largely unknown. We used content analysis to assess land trust involvement in wildlife and habitat conservation, as reflected in their mission statements, and compared these findings with an organizational survey of land trusts. In our sample of 1358 mission statements, we found that only 17 % of land trusts mentioned “wildlife,” “animal,” or types of wildlife, and 35 % mentioned “habitat” or types. Mission statements contrasted sharply with results from a land trust survey, in which land trusts cited wildlife habitat as the most common and significant outcome of their protection efforts. Moreover, 77 % of land trusts reported that at least half of their acreage protected wildlife habitat, though these benefits are likely assumed. Importantly, mission statement content was not associated with the percentage of land reported to benefit wildlife. These inconsistencies suggest that benefits to wildlife habitat of protected land are recognized but may not be purposeful and strategic and, thus, potentially less useful in contributing toward regional wildlife conservation goals. We outline the implications of this disconnect, notably the potential omission of wildlife habitat in prioritization schema for land acquisition and potential missed opportunities to build community support for land trusts among wildlife enthusiasts and to develop partnerships with wildlife conservation organizations." .

Accordingly, we assessed the ecologically relevant (1 or 2 generations) connectivity of two broadcast spawning coral species, Acropora austera and Platygyra daedalea, on reefs in the region, using two types of hyper-variable genetic markers viz. microsatellites and nuclear introns. Analysis of genetic diversity and differentiation provided evidence for the existence of four discrete genetic populations of A. austera and five of P. daedalea in the sampled area. We found higher genetic diversity on northern South African reefs, which suggests these reefs play a role as sinks for putative migrants. Assignment tests that identified migrants to the South African reefs left some individuals unassigned, but assigned the largest proportion of putative recruits to their source reef, providing evidence of high levels of self-seeding and also of an unsampled source reef. Together, the data indicate that South African populations are, at ecological time scales, independent of gene flow from northern coral populations. The findings suggest that the scope of management needed for the protection of the reefs in the region should not be broad in outlook; each reef should be managed as a single unit, part of the whole rather than representative of the whole." .

Aquaculture and related activities are recognized as one of the most important drivers of non-indigenous species in the Mediterranean. Grandidierella japonica Stephensen, 1938 is an aorid amphipod species native of Japan. This species had previously only been reported a few times outside the Pacific region, in particular from coastal waters of England and French Atlantic coasts. ResultsA population of the non-indigenous amphipod G. japonica, has been detected in the Sacca di Goro, a Po delta lagoon of the northern Adriatic Sea (Italy), representing the first record of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Adults of both sexes and juveniles were collected in muddy sediments reaching high densities. We examined 24 specimens: 8 adult males, 12 females, and 4 undifferentiated juveniles. Our specimens displayed a variability in the position of teeth of male gnathopod 1. Likely vectors for this introduction are the commercial shellfish transplants, mainly oyster farming. ConclusionsThe finding of a reproducing population of G. japonica suggests that the species has become well established in the Sacca di Goro. This finding also seems to be particularly relevant for the improvement on the knowledge of Mediterranean biodiversity and threats." .

However, the magnitude of the impact of the invasion depends not only on the characteristics of the invading species, but also on the inherent features of the receiving environment; managing the environmental matrix could therefore be the best option for preventing or reducing undesired effects. The objective of the present work was to develop a spatially explicit risk-based approach to evaluate the effectiveness of different management practices designed to mitigate the potential impacts of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in the Bahía Blanca estuary (38°50′S, 62°20′W). A Risk Index (RI) was constructed to assess the potential negative impact of oyster bed expansion on environmental values and human health. RI maps were built to compare the potential effects of different management options in terms of risk reduction. An integral sanitation program within the coastal zone produced the largest reduction in the areas previously ranked as under very low, low, medium, high, and very high risk. Treatment of domestic sewage produced a major reduction in the areas under high and medium risk, mainly in the inner zone of the estuary, but changes in the area under very high risk were negligible. Removal of oysters at specific locations had a modest effect on risk reduction in terms of the whole area, but produced significant improvements at a local scale." .

Sie bietet die einzigartige Möglichkeit, die Belastung der Umwelt und des Menschen über einen langen Zeitraum zu verfolgen. Die UPB wurde parallel zur Erarbeitung des ersten deutschen Chemikaliengesetzes in den 1970er-Jahren konzipiert. Im Jahr 1979 begann sie ihren Probebetrieb. Nachdem 1982 das Chemikaliengesetz in Kraft trat, begann die UPB 1985 ihren dauerhaften Regelbetrieb. Mit der europäischen Chemikalienverordnung REACH wurde 2007 die Verantwortung für die Sicherheit der vermarkteten Chemikalien und die Aufgabe der Risikobewertung maßgeblich der Industrie übertragen. Seitdem ist die UPB noch wichtiger geworden, um die eigenverantwortliche Bewertung der Industrie zu überprüfen, den Erfolg von Minderungsmaßnahmen zu evaluieren und damit letztlich den Schutz von Mensch und Umwelt vor schädlichen Umwelteinflüssen sicherzustellen. Dies geschieht durch regelmäßige Beobachtung der Belastungen und Analyse zeitlicher Trends. Die Ergebnisse der UPB dienen heute der Beratung der politischen Entscheidungsträger über die Notwendigkeit, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen. Informationen zur Belastungsprävention werden für die Allgemeinbevölkerung und den öffentlichen Gesundheitsdienst zur Verfügung gestellt. Die UPB ist somit ein wichtiges Monitoringinstrument des Bundesministeriums für Umwelt, Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit und kooperiert mit namhaften Forschungs- und Universitätsinstituten. Das Umweltbundesamt konzeptioniert und steuert die Arbeit der UPB, leitet die wissenschaftliche Auswertung der Daten und bereitet diese für die Umweltpolitik und die Öffentlichkeit auf." .

We propose a consultative process involving relevant stakeholders in invasive species management decisions. The process involves (1) the identification of relevant stakeholders, (2) assessing their perceptions, (3) enhancing interaction between stakeholders, (4) assessing changes in stakeholders’ perceptions following interactions with other stakeholders, and (5) developing management recommendations in collaboration with stakeholders. We demonstrate the application of the process using the family Cactaceae (‘cacti’) in South Africa. Many species of cacti have been introduced to the country over the past two centuries, mostly for horticulture, food and fodder, and hundreds of other species have been introduced in the past few decades (or are likely to be introduced soon) for horticulture. Using the proposed process enabled the negotiation and participation of all stakeholders in decision making and helped minimize contentious situations by clarifying stakeholder’s beliefs and exploring consensus solutions. Consequently, management objectives were broadly supported by all stakeholders. These results will be included in a national cactus management strategy for South Africa." .

Due to irrigation, natural automorphic soils have been transformed into irrigated hydromorphic soils. This resulted in the activation of salt-accumulation processes, even with a drainage of 2.5–3 m deep. In the 21st century, new issues arose in the region: a freshwater deficiency; increased eolic salt transfer; deteriorating climatic, environmental, and social conditions." .

However, little information exists on the influence of riparian vegetation on the fauna of intermittent or humic (coloured) streams. We examined the ecological condition of riparian vegetation and its influence on stream fauna amongst humic and non-humic intermittent and perennial stream reaches in the Ellen Brook catchment, south west Western Australia. Permutation-tests showed that flow regime (Global R = 0.444, P < 0.001) and the presence/absence of riparian vegetation (Global R = 0.407, P < 0.001) were the most influential factors associated with invertebrate assemblage composition. Riparian vegetation influenced invertebrate assemblages through the provision of organic matter for food and habitat, and by shading stream channels, thereby limiting light and algal growth. This was illustrated by a higher proportion of algal grazers (Chironominae and Physidae) in unvegetated streams and more detritivores (Leptoceridae, Gripopterygidae, Ceinidae) in vegetated streams. Humic intermittent streams showed different invertebrate assemblages to non-humic intermittent streams; having fewer Cladocera and Chironomidae and more grazing gastropods (Physidae and Lynceidae). A significant proportion of the variation in invertebrate assemblages was associated with stream width, salinity and NO x -N concentrations because intermittent streams were narrower, more brackish and less enriched than with nitrogen than perennial streams. Riparian vegetation benefited invertebrate assemblages in all stream types, showing that revegetation is as effective a restoration action in intermittent and humic streams as it is in perennial streams." .

Four heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, and Cd) in sedge and soil samples from ten lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) habitats in EDT were investigated. Results showed that negative effect of Cr and Pb on lesser white-fronted goose may occur while the concentrations of Cu and Cd are considered to be relatively safe. Prioritize threats were decreased in the following sequence: Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. Cr and Pb were considered to be the priority pollutants.

This amount to formulate a procedure for managing traces with more than one γ 5. The suggested procedure obeys Lorentz covariance and cyclicity, at variance with previous approaches (e.g. the celebrated ’t Hooft and Veltman’s where Lorentz is violated). The result of the present paper is a further step forward in the program initiated by a previous work on the traces involving a single γ 5. The final goal is an unconstrained definition of γ 5 in dimensional regularization. Here, in the evaluation of the anomaly, we profit of the axial current conservation equation, when radiative corrections are neglected. This kind of tool is not always exploited in field theories with γ 5, e.g. in the use of dimensional regularization of infrared and collinear divergences." .

They had average relative SSU rRNA abundance of 2.0% with a maximum of 9.4% among fungal SSU rRNAs. Network analysis revealed that they co-occur with arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomerales, which is in line with their previously suggested association with plant roots. Moreover, Archaeorhizomycetes ranked among the potential keystone taxa. This metatranscriptomic survey exemplifies the usage of non-targeted molecular approaches for the study of soil fungi.

By using eight recently developed microsatellite markers, genetic structure was compared between populations from the Danish Strait in the south to the Barents Sea in the north (56–79°N). Urchins are spread by pelagic larvae and may be transported long distances by northwards-going ocean currents. Two main superimposed patterns were identified. The first showed a subtle but significant genetic differentiation from the southernmost to the northernmost of the studied populations and could be explained by an isolation by distance model. The second pattern included two coastal populations in mid-Norway (65°N), NH and NS, as well as the northernmost population of continental Norway (71°N) FV. They showed a high degree of differentiation from all other populations. The explanation to the second pattern is most likely chaotic genetic patchiness caused by introgression from another species, S. pallidus, into S. droebachiensis resulting from selective pressure. Ongoing sea urchin collapse and kelp forests recovery are observed in the area of NH, NS and FV populations. High gene flow between populations spanning more than 22° in latitude suggests a high risk of new grazing events to occur rapidly in the future if conditions for sea urchins are favourable. On the other hand, the possibility of hybridization in association with collapsing populations may be used as an early warning indicator for monitoring purposes." .

To better understand the extent of APEs and BFRs contamination in the environment, this study reports on the concentration and distribution of APEs and BFRs in sediments samples collected from Vaal River, South Africa. Measurable concentrations of these contaminants were obtained using GC–MS after heptafluorobutyric derivatization. The concentrations range (ng g−1) for these pollutants were as follows: nd–46, 20–127, 24–38, 3–5, 14–28, 16–54 for octylphenol penta ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylates (mono- di), nonylphenol penta ethoxylates, PBB101, PBDEs, and HBCD; respectively.

Between 1977 and 2012, study specimens were obtained from 14 locations across the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean, with an external collection from the eastern Atlantic. The species were broadly sympatric across the region, though occurrence at the local level was variable, likely due to habitat partitioning. Albula vulpes appeared to be the primary contributor to the recreational fishery, which occurs predominantly in coastal flats habitats. Unexpected, non-geographic population partitioning was identified within all three species. Robust evidence for two genetic populations of A. vulpes was further supported by hypothesis testing for migration patterns between them. The potential existence of two quasi-discrete spawning groups (fall and spring) within species may explain the observed partitions. Patterns of interspecific hybridization were explored to further inform management and conservation efforts. Hybrids were observed at low frequency (40 individuals, equaling a 1.5 % hybridization rate), and most were collected from Florida and The Bahamas. Our results suggest that a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic semipermeable barriers to gene flow exists among these divergent species. These findings are congruent with previous studies that revealed substantial genetic divergence among these secondarily sympatric bonefishes. Further, clarification is provided on regional distributions and the composition of the economically and culturally important recreational fishery. On first order, management efforts would have the greatest impact if focused on A. vulpes populations and their preferred habitat." .

It has rapidly spread, becoming the dominant corixid in and around the Doñana protected area in SW Spain. Its high abundance and similar morphology to native corixids suggest that T. verticalis may impact them through competition for food. Here we used stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) and Bayesian analytical tools to investigate niche partitioning between T. verticalis and the native water boatman Sigara lateralis and Sigara scripta through a combination of experimental and field data. Species sampled from permanent ponds and laboratory aquaria could be separated based on their isotopic values (δ15N and δ13C). S. lateralis consistently showed higher δ15N values than T. verticalis, suggesting that the invasive species may be feeding at a lower trophic position and relying more on herbivory than its native competitors. This was particularly true for the T. verticalis nymph stage, which showed lower δ15N values compared to adults, indicating ontogenetic dietary shifts. In contrast, native corixids and the invasive species showed similar isotopic compositions in temporary habitats at different stages in the flooding-desiccation cycle, suggesting some degree of niche overlap and a slight reduction in trophic level for S. lateralis when inhabiting ephemeral systems. The combination of experimental and field data can help elucidate trophic interactions during a biological invasion. Stable isotopes provided insights into the trophic ecology of this invasive species and into the mechanisms facilitating co-existence with native species." .

A unique suite of in situ measurements coupled with state-of-the-art GCM simulations enables us to quantify the mitigation potential of the projected circulation change for three coral reef ecosystems under two future scenarios. Estimated historical trends indicate that over 100% of the large-scale warming to date has been offset locally by changes in circulation, while future simulations predict a warming mitigation effect of only 5–10% depending on the island.

However, while adaptive management has received significant uptake in theory, it remains elusively difficult to enact in practice. Proponents have blamed social barriers and have called for social science contributions. We address this gap by adopting a qualitative approach to explore the development of an ecological monitoring program within an adaptive management framework in a public land management organization in Australia. We ask what practices are used to enact the monitoring program and how do they shape learning? We elicit a rich narrative through extensive interviews with a key individual, and analyze the narrative using thematic analysis. We discuss our results in relation to the concept of ‘knowledge work’ and Westley’s (2002) framework for interpreting the strategies of adaptive managers—‘managing through, in, out and up.’ We find that enacting the program is conditioned by distinct and sometimes competing logics—scientific logics prioritizing experimentation and learning, public logics emphasizing accountability and legitimacy, and corporate logics demanding efficiency and effectiveness. In this context, implementing adaptive management entails practices of translation to negotiate tensions between objective and situated knowledge, external experts and organizational staff, and collegiate and hierarchical norms. Our contribution embraces the ‘doing’ of learning-by-doing and marks a shift from conceptualizing the social as an external barrier to adaptive management to be removed to an approach that situates adaptive management as social knowledge practice." .

Less frequently studied are interactions between butterflyfishes and soft corals, even though the latter represent significant habitat and energetic resources on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Changes to the benthic community structure of three disjunct back-reef communities on the leeward side of Guam were monitored over two decades, from 1994 to 2014. These communities include a reef that has remained stable and relatively pristine through time, a reef that is significantly impaired but has remained stable over time, and a reef that has experienced significant changes in response to anthropogenic and natural disturbances during this period. Density and behavior of six species of butterflyfishes, including an obligate hard corallivore, two soft corallivores, and three generalists of varied dietary breadth, were recorded at each of the sites in 1994, 2004, and 2014. The populations of butterflyfishes varied through time and space, and there were significant changes in foraging behaviors, largely associated with changes in the soft coral community. Moreover, the soft corallivores exhibited differential prey preferences, some of which were directly attributable to their ability to handle soft coral chemical defenses, while others appeared to be more opportunistic. Given this tight coupling between butterflyfishes and soft corals, this resource needs to be a focus of future studies." .

We evaluated their preference for forests near open-canopy areas (forest edge habitat) or more mature interior forests (interior-forest habitat) by tracking radio-collared civets in their activity and inactivity periods. We demonstrated that all three Paradoxurinae species occurred in the same area, and extensive range overlap indicated lack of interspecific territoriality. The binturong preferred neither forest edge nor interior-forest habitats. Meanwhile, both the common palm civet and the small-toothed palm civet showed a similar preference for forest edge habitats. Food distribution may affect their habitat use. We could not find clear habitat segregation among the three sympatric Paradoxurinae species, but vertical habitat use may also affect their coexistence. Further effort is needed to elucidate both the horizontal and vertical habitat segregation of sympatric Paradoxurinae species." .

Marinas are increasingly recognised as key reservoirs for invasive NNS. They provide submersed artificial habitat that unintentionally supports the establishment of NNS introduced from visiting recreational vessels. While ballast water and shipping vectors have been well documented, the role of recreational vessels in spreading NNS has been relatively poorly studied. Identification of the main physical features found within marinas, which relate to the presence of NNS, is important to inform the development of effective biosecurity measures and prevent further spread. Towards this aim, physical features that could influence the presence of NNS were assessed for marinas throughout the UK in July 2013. Thirty-three marine and brackish NNS have been recorded in UK marinas, and of the 88 marinas studied in detail, 83 contained between 1 and 13 NNS. Significant differences in freshwater input, marina entrance width and seawall length were associated with the presence of NNS. Additionally, questionnaires were distributed to marina managers and recreational vessel owners to understand current biosecurity practices and attitudes to recreational vessel biosecurity. The main barriers to biosecurity compliance were cited as cost and time. Further work identifying easily distinguished features of marinas could be used as a proxy to assess risk of invasion." .

Especially, uranium concentrations in water bodies are of great concern, as its radioactivity significantly affects the persistent diversity of microbiota. Recently, continuous application of pesticides in the agricultural lands and accumulation of quartz that enter the Cauvery River has significantly increased the concentration of uranium (U) and other heavy metals. To perceive the impact of uranium on bacterial diversity in Cauvery River, sediment samples collected from polluted (UP) site with 32.4 Bq/K of U concentration and control (UNP) site were scrutinized for bacterial diversity through metagenomic analysis of the V3 region of 16S rDNA by Illumina sequencing. Taxonomic assignment revealed that the unpolluted sample was dominated by Bacteroidetes (27.7 %), and Firmicutes (25.9 %), while sediment sample from the highly polluted site revealed abundance of Proteobacteria (47.5 %) followed by Bacteroidetes (22.4 %) and Firmicutes (14.6 %). Among Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria was the most prevalent group followed by alpha, delta, epsilon, and beta in the uranium-polluted sample. Rare and abundant species analysis revealed that species like Idiomarina loihiensis was abundant in the pollutant sample; however, it was rare (<0.1 %) in the sample from pristine environment. Similarly, the species distribution in both the samples varied, with the bacteria potentially active in redox activity and biosorption potential dominating in the polluted sample. Outcomes of the present study demonstrated the impact of uranium and metal accumulation on the bacterial communities and further confirmed the promising candidature of specific bacterial species as bioindicators of contamination." .

Local environmental conditions are often good predictors of species distribution and variations in habitat quality usually positively correlate to species richness. However, beside habitat limitation, species presence-absence may be constrained by dispersal limitation. We tested the relative importance of both limitations on saproxylic beetle diversity, using forest continuity as a surrogate for dispersal limitation and stand maturity as a surrogate for habitat limitation. Forest continuity relies on the maintenance of a forest cover over time, while stand maturity results in the presence of old-growth habitat features. Forty montane beech-fir forests in the French pre-Alps were sampled, under a balanced sampling design in which forest continuity and stand maturity were crossed. A total of 307 saproxylic beetle species were captured using flight-interception traps and Winkler–Berlese extractors. We explored the response of low- versus high-dispersal species groups to forest continuity and stand maturity. Saproxylic beetle diversity increased significantly with stand maturity and was mostly influenced by variables related to deadwood diversity at the stand scale and suitable habitat availability at the landscape scale. Surprisingly, no evidence of dispersal limitation was found, as diversity patterns were not influenced by forest continuity and associated variables, even for low-dispersal species. Our study demonstrates that in an unfragmented forest landscape, saproxylic beetles are able to colonize recent forests, as long as local deadwood resources are sufficiently diversified (e.g. tree species, position, diameter and/or decay stage)." .

Classical metacommunity models have recently explored how food web dynamics respond to patch loss, but the effects of patch fragmentation have largely been overlooked. Here we develop an extended patch-dynamic model that tracks the patch occupancy of the various trophic links subject to colonization-extinction-predation dynamics by incorporating species dispersal with patch connectivity. We found that, in a simple food chain, species at higher trophic level become extinct sooner with increasing patch loss and fragmentation due to the constraint in resource availability, confirming the trophic rank hypothesis. Yet, effects of fragmentation on species occupancy are largely determined by patch loss, with maximal fragmentation effects occurring at intermediate patch loss. Compared to the spatially explicit simulations that we also performed, the current model with pair approximation generates similar community patterns especially in spatially clustered landscapes. Overall, our extended framework can be applied to model more complex food webs in fragmented landscapes, broadening the scope of existing metacommunity theory." .

Despite their visibility and widespread occurrence in Atlantic Canada and elsewhere, the community influence and persistence of this disturbance remain undocumented. This study addressed this gap in our knowledge using two approaches. First, in both sandy and muddy habitats, we monitored fresh feeding pits (disturbed sediments) for up to 9–11 days after their formation, recording their sediment properties and diversity and density of invertebrate fauna, and comparing these characteristics to those of ambient (undisturbed) sediments in similar habitat. Second, we quantified local-scale invertebrate diversity and density in feeding pits and ambient sediments in muddy habitat only, at three other sites within a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Grain size did not differ between disturbed and ambient sediments and did not change over time within habitats. We also found no significant differences in invertebrate diversity and density between disturbed and undisturbed sandy sediments. In contrast, the invertebrate fauna differed significantly between disturbed and ambient muddy sediments, particularly during the first 4 days after disturbance. Feeding pits in muddy sediments also took twice longer to fill up than pits in sandy sediments. These results were consistent with the comparison of disturbed and undisturbed muddy sediments in the MPA: at least at the local scale, the foraging by this invader significantly altered community structure. Ambient sediments had a higher number of species and nearly twice as many invertebrates compared to disturbed sediments. Overall, our results suggest that visual evidence of green crab feeding pits in muddy sediments can be used as a fairly reliable predictor of local-scale changes in invertebrate communities. The persistence of these local-scale changes depends on the type of habitat in which the disturbance takes place." .

The aim of these tests is to describe the behavior of the soil–pile contact subjected to a large number of cycles due to environmental or anthropic loadings. These cycles (typically 104 or less due to an early rupture) are small (10, 20 and 40 kPa in terms of shear stress). A new interpretation of the direct shear tests is proposed. The sample of soil is schematically composed of a sheared interface and of a buffer under oedometric load. The problem of sand leakage between the shear box and the rough plate, classical phenomenon in this type of test, is focused. The effect of initial density, position of “center of cycles” in stress plane (mean cyclic variables) and cyclic amplitude is investigated. The cycles are defined by the initial mean cyclic normal stress, the level of initial mean cyclic stress ratio and the normalized cyclic amplitude. Under CNL condition, either dilation or contraction is exhibited, in agreement with the characteristic state developed by Luong (International symposium on soils under cyclic and transient loading, Swansea, 7–11 January, pp 315–324, 1980). The influence of a prescribed normal stiffness is especially considered. It can be highlighted that CNS cyclic paths are always contractive. This contraction results in a drop of mean cyclic normal stress often called degradation of friction." .

Easily measured plant functional traits (PFTs) may provide useful predictors of the response of plants to grazing. Understanding the response of PFTs to grazing and the relationship between PFTs and AGB is very important for effectively predicting the response of ecosystems to grazing and rangeland management. A grazing experiment was conducted in Gangcha County, Qinghai Province, in the northeastern part of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau in 2012 and 2013. We investigated the response of PFTs in three dominant species (Elymus nutans, Kobresia humilis, and Stipa purpurea) to grazing, using six stocking rates. Plant height (PH), plant weight, leaf area, and leaf dry biomass of these three dominant species had significantly negative relationships with stocking rate. Leaf thickness (LT) of these three species usually showed a unimodal response to grazing. Specific leaf area generally showed a quadratic relationship with grazing intensity. No consistent effects of grazing were observed on nitrogen content per unit mass (N mass) and nitrogen content per unit area (N area). PH, leaf area, and leaf dry mass (LDM) were positively associated with AGB, but LT, N mass, and N area had no statistically significant association with AGB. We thus conclude that PH, leaf area, and LDM best predict the effects of grazing on AGB. Finally, 2.87 sheep/ha is recommended as the optimal stocking rate in this region to maintain the health of this grassland ecosystem and to allow for sustainable development." .

The relationship between functional diversity and natural stressors has received less attention compared to anthropogenic stressors. In this study, we investigated how two natural stressors, water salinity and flow intermittence, affect functional richness and functional redundancy of aquatic invertebrate communities using seven biological traits and 39 modalities. For this purpose, we characterized these functional diversity measures in 22 Mediterranean streams with a gradient of natural salinity and flow intermittence. Our findings showed that both functional richness and functional redundancy decreased with increased stress by water salinity and flow intermittence for all the studied traits but more rapidly for the former, suggesting that water salinity is a stronger environmental stressor than flow intermittence. Our study also described an antagonistic interaction of the two study stressors, in which the net effect of both is less than the sum of their independent effects. This study emphasizes that in saline streams, characterized by lower functional richness and functional redundancy, the loss of any taxon can have a huge impact on community functioning. In particular, the functional singularity of saline intermittent streams makes them extremely sensitive to additional anthropogenic impacts. In the context of future global change scenarios, which predict higher flow intermittence and water salinity, this study gives a better understanding of the functional features of these types of ecosystems." .

As a generalist predator, beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) consume a variety of prey; however, differences in lipid content and the presence of inorganic carbon in prey may cause variability in the δ13C signal that is not related to food sources. We examined the effects of carbonate and/or lipid removal in beluga and potential prey and tested whether the C:N ratio was a valid indicator of lipid content. The C:N ratio was a good predictor of the change in δ13C after lipid removal in capelin (Mallotus villosus), octopus (Cirroteuthis muelleri), green shrimp (Argis dentata), and circumpolar eualid (Eualus gaimardii). Despite relatively low C:N ratios, lipid removal significantly increased δ13C values, but also affected δ15N. Removal of carbonates from invertebrate samples significantly decreased δ13C values and had variable effects on δ15N. Overall, the variability in δ13C within a species decreased after removing lipids and carbonates. Variability in δ15N did not change for species requiring only lipid removal, but increased after acidification. We also evaluated the effect of these sample preparation methods on niche dispersion metrics. After lipid and carbonate treatments, centroid locations differed significantly in all species except beluga muscle, and niche breadth and mean distance to the centroid decreased. Failure to remove lipids and carbonates for δ13C values may lead to incorrect interpretations for isotopic niche, which may have major ecological implications, such as predicting the impacts of invasive species or determining the dietary linkages of beluga whales." .

Warming stimulated the abundance of genes responsible for degrading recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM) and reduced SOM content by 13%. Watering, and warming plus watering also increased the abundance of recalcitrant SOM catabolism pathways, but concurrently promoted plant growth and increased labile SOM content, which somewhat offset SOM loss. The treatments also increased microbial biomass, community complexity and metabolic potential for nitrogen and sulfur assimilation. Both microbial and plant community composition shifted with the treatment conditions, and the sample-to-sample compositional variations of the two communities (pairwise β-diversity distances) were significantly correlated. In particular, microbial community composition was substantially correlated with the dominant plant species (~0.54 Spearman correlation coefficient), much more than with measured soil indices, affirming a tight coupling between both biological communities. Collectively, our study revealed the direction and underlying mechanisms of microbial feedbacks to warming and suggested that semiarid regions of northern steppes could act as a net carbon source under increased temperatures, unless precipitation increases concurrently." .

This establishment success depends on high propagule pressure and successful recruitment of seedlings following propagule dispersal into receptive environments. This study aimed to investigate interactions between propagule pressure and environmental resistance to seedling recruitment of the invasive shrub, glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus Mill.), over a range of wetland habitat types. We measured propagule deposition using seed traps and recruitment success using sown plots, while characterizing vegetation and abiotic environmental conditions in five adjacent wetland habitat types. Drier habitats, which included Cedar Swamp, Shrub Carr, and String, had lower resistance to buckthorn establishment than the wetter Flark and Cattail Marsh. The drier habitats supported more woody species and provided more raised hummock surfaces essential for successful buckthorn recruitment and establishment. Propagule pressure was also higher in dry habitats that supported higher densities of adult glossy buckthorn, while long-distance dispersal into areas with low adult density was uncommon. Natural recruitment was highest in sites with intense propagule pressure, but experimental sowing of seeds demonstrated that buckthorn establishes in wet sites with higher resistance if propagule pressure is increased and seeds are deposited on hummocks. This study demonstrates the affinity of glossy buckthorn for drier wetland sites, and provides empirical evidence that environmental resistance can be overcome by higher propagule pressure." .

The objective of the present study is “determination of the stability constants and the thermodynamic parameters of Cd-DTPA and Cd-EDTA complexes at different pH and temperatures at the soil-water interface”. Complex formation of soil Cd with DTPA and EDTA at the soil-water interface was studied under different ligand-to-metal ratios, pHs and temperatures. Apparent conditional stability constants (log k´) were calculated from the concentrations of Cd chelates and free Cd2+, estimated by solid phase extraction with an ion exchanger. Standard Gibbs energy (ΔG°), standard enthalpy (ΔH°) and standard entropy (ΔS°) of formation were calculated at three different temperatures. The higher stability constants of Cd-DTPA than Cd-EDTA indicated longer persistence of Cd-DTPA at the soil solution interface than Cd-EDTA complex. Increase of ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° with progress of temperature revealed that Cd-complex formation was facilitated by temperature. Highly negative ΔG° and positive ΔH° for Cd-complex formation indicated the reaction spontaneous and exothermic. In general, both ligands complexed high percentages of cadmium signalling their role in enhancing remobilization of Cd present in soil and preventing exchange of contaminated Cd from external source with soil mineral matrix; these phenomena may greatly reduce hazard for environment and human health. The result of this study support that DTPA increases solubility and more persistence of Cd in acidic soils within the range of temperature and mole fraction (MF = moles of Cd2+ / sum of the moles of Cd2+ and chelating agent) than that of EDTA due to higher capability of complex formation with Cd2+. Therefore, DTPA enhanced Cd toxicity in acid soils and groundwater. Complex formation in the presence of DTPA at acidic pH decreases with temperature and increases with pH. The higher per cent of Cd complexed in the presence of DTPA revealed that DTPA is a stronger chelating agent than EDTA at acidic pHs. Whereas, the capability of complex formation by EDTA is lower at lower pH but higher at higher pH." .

Results showed that the N2O emission from paddy soil at 100 % WHC (water-holding capacity) was higher than that at 40, 65, 80, 120, and 160 % WHC, indicating that 100 % WHC was the optimum soil moisture content for N2O emission under the incubation experiment. Small peak of N2O flux appeared when the soil moisture content from 250 % WHC decreased near to 100 % WHC, lower than that triggered by nitrogen (N) fertilization, which was mainly owing to the low NH4 + concentration at this period. Nitrification dominated the emissions of N2O from paddy soil at 250 % WHC (54.96 %), higher than that of nitrification-coupled denitrification (6.74 %) and denitrification (38.3 %). The contribution of denitrification to N2O emissions (44.10 %) was equivalent to that of nitrification (44.45 %) in soil at 100 % WHC, which was higher than that of 250 % WHC treatment. In conclusion, the finding suggested that the peak of N2O in paddy soils during midseason aeration could be attributed to the occurrence of optimum soil moisture under sufficient N availability, favorable for the production and accumulation of N2O." .

Recently, a trophic interaction among invasive green crabs (Carcinus maenas) and native dogwhelks (Nucella lapillus) foraging on mussels (Mytilus spp.) in Atlantic Canada was reported, in which a mussel initially attacked by a dogwhelk was then eaten by a crab. This was interpreted as kleptoparasitism, but alternatively could be scavenging of abandoned mussel prey. In this paper, mathematical models of kleptoparasitism and scavenging among these species were developed and used to generate predicted feeding rates, which were then compared to observations from previous work. The available evidence for kleptoparasitism by green crabs on dogwhelks was also considered and compared to hypothesized outcomes of these different foraging modes. The evidence considered does not definitively suggest that scavenging was previously misidentified as kleptoparasitism; in fact, model simulations were only able to match observed foraging when they included kleptoparasitism. Effects of crab kleptoparasitism on whelks were shown to be negative, while crab scavenging had effectively no impact on whelks; therefore, while these two foraging interactions appear superficially similar, they have very different implications and should be carefully distinguished in future studies." .

Aiming to support the application of lichen as ecological surrogates of the effects of air pollution in the subtropics, we hypothesized that urbanization was an important driver of changes on lichen diversity, composition, and vitality. For that, we quantified several lichen diversity metrics (richness, cover, and community composition) and photobiont vitality in relation to atmospheric pollution or its surrogates (modeled pollutant gases, pollutants in lichen thallus, and land cover). We confirmed that air pollution was a key driver for lichen diversity. Changes in lichen community composition and vitality were very significantly related to air pollution and integrated the effect of multiple stressors (particulate matter, NOx, and Cu), thus being powerful ecological indicators of air pollution in the subtropics." .

They have been ubiquitously detected in the aquatic environment, but information on their joint toxicity to aquatic organisms is scarce. In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of copper and these two phthalates to Daphnia magna and Photobacterium phosphoreum by quantifying the acute toxicity expressed by the EC50 (the concentration causing 50 % of maximal effect) value. The toxicity order was DEHP + Cu(II) > DBP + Cu(II) > Cu(II) > DEHP > DBP for both test species. Antagonism effects were found in the joint toxicity of Cu(II) combined with DBP or DEHP using the toxic unit method. These findings have important implications in environmental risk assessment for phthalates in the aquatic environment in the presence of heavy metals." .

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet of Adélie and gentoo penguins in all three studied stages (pre-breeding, breeding and post-breeding). Nevertheless, only in gentoo penguins a shift in the diet was evident from mainly krill during the breeding stage to mixed diet (i.e. krill and fish/squids) during the pre- and post-breeding stages. Results from stable isotopes suggest that Adélie penguins might be foraging in southern localities compared to their congener during the inter-breeding period. Moreover, Adélie penguins showed a large individual variability in foraging habitat during the post-breeding stage. However, our model has predicted that both species exploited similar areas during the breeding season. The results obtained during the chick-rearing stage were compared with the stomach contents of both species obtained during the same season (2011/2012). Our findings provide new knowledge on the feeding ecology and foraging habitats of pygoscelid penguins. They confirm the importance of Antarctic krill during the annual cycle and improve the understanding of life strategies and predator–prey interactions essentially out of the reproductive period, in which the information is very limited. These results can help to establish new management strategies, particularly considering the potential overlap between predators and fisheries." .

Use of appropriate tools to measure both the level and value of that function is critical to expand use of this approach. For these sites, amendment mixtures must reduce metal availability in situ and restore ecosystem function. Combinations of mixtures, typically consisting of a material with high metal binding capacity (cyclonic ashes, municipal biosolids, or other materials rich in Fe, Al, or Mn oxides), material to adjust soil pH (sugar beet lime, cement kiln dust, dolomitic limestone), and an organic residual to provide soil structure and nutrients (composts, animal manures, municipal biosolids) have been tested in multiple lab and field trials on metal-contaminated sites. This review focuses on field tests of this approach with the goal of providing methods to quantify reduction of hazard and restoration of functional systems. Methods to evaluate success of amendments including extractions to measure changes in metal availability, microbial function and diversity, phytoavailability of metals, and earthworm and small mammal assays are discussed. In most cases, measures of metal availability and ecosystem function are related. For example, surveys of small mammals on restored sites provide information on metal availability as well as suitability of restored habitat. Additional measures of ecosystem function including soil fertility, physical properties, and diversity of habitat are described. Finally, measures of the value of this approach for restoring ecosystems are detailed." .

GH dissociation leads to, for example, decreases in soil strength, engineering failures such as wellbore instabilities, and marine landslides. The FLAC3D software was used to analyze the deformation of the soil stratum and vertical wells with GH dissociation. The effects of Young’s modulus, internal friction angle, cohesion of the GH layer after dissociation, and the thickness of the GH layer on the deformation of soils were studied. It is shown that the maximum displacement in the whole soil stratum occurs at the interface between the GH layer and the overlayer. The deformation of the soil stratum and wells increases with decreases in the modulus, internal friction angle, and cohesion after GH dissociation. The increase in thickness of the GH layer enlarges the deformation of the soil stratum and wells with GH dissociation. The hydrostatic pressure increases the settlement of the soil stratum, while constraining horizontal displacement. The interaction between two wells becomes significant when the affected zone around each well exceeds half the length of the GH dissociation zone." .

Materials and methodsTwo long-term field experiments (sites A and B) were performed in 1984 (site A) and 1979 (site B) in the North China Plain. The soil samples were collected in 2006 and separated for clay, silt and sand size particle fractions and then determined for SOC and SIC. Results and discussionThe long-term fertilization significantly increased SOC in 0–20 cm soil layer by 9–68% but significantly decreased or had no effect on SIC. In total, soil carbon storage was little affected by NP, but significantly increased by NPM application (p < 0.05). Fertilization affected both SOC and SIC in sand- and silt-sized particles but not in clay-size fraction. Both NP and NPM increased SOC in sand- and silt-sized particles by 8.7–123.9% in the 0–20 cm layer but decreased SIC up to 80.4% in the 40–60 cm layer. The SOC concentration in the particle-size fractions was negatively correlated with SIC concentration, which may imply an antagonistic interaction between organic and inorganic carbon levels. ConclusionsThese results illustrate the importance of soil inorganic carbon pool in evaluating soil total carbon pool in semi-arid farmlands. Previous assessments of the effects of fertilizers on the soil carbon pool, using only SOC determinations, require re-evaluation with the inclusion of SIC determinations." .

Most previous studies have focused on the potential spatial extent of invasive species populations at regional scales, but little is known on how species successfully recruit and establish at more local scales. In this study, we examined how recruitment of the green alga Codium fragile ssp. fragile (hereafter Codium) can vary spatially and the environmental factors associated with Codium establishment in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds. Standardized recruitment blocks (65 blocks in a 720 × 240 m2 grid) were used to monitor the number of Codium recruits, juveniles and adults over 2 years. Environmental factors (depth, relative water flow, light and temperature) and attributes of the surrounding macrophyte assemblage (eelgrass density, eelgrass length, Codium biomass) were also measured. Recruitment occurred on all blocks or nearby artificial structures (i.e. buoys) and mainly originated from button stages (i.e. female gametes or utricles). Contrary to other studies, the abundance of Codium (recruits, juveniles and adults) was best predicted by the density of the native canopy-forming species, Z. marina, which highlights a positive interaction between native and non-native canopy-forming species. Seasonal variation in recruitment was observed; it was lower during the summer. Recruitment did not show any distinct spatial pattern (e.g. gradient or patch), but the same spatial pattern of recruitment was observed every sampling date, suggesting that there are “hotspots” for recruitment. In general, the total number of Codium fronds observed on a block at the end of the experiment was positively correlated with the cumulative number of recruits. However, recruitment occurred on some blocks but recruits never grew, suggesting that some environmental factors limit Codium distribution and abundance in eelgrass beds. Overall, the assessment of Codium recruitment over 2 years showed that the colonization of suitable locations by Codium within seagrass beds may take several years and that some factors may not only limit, but also inhibit Codium expansion within eelgrass beds." .

Building sustainable food systems has become a predominating endeavor aiming to redirect our food systems and policies towards better-adjusted goals and improved societal welfare. Food systems are complex social-ecological systems involving multiple interactions between human and natural components. Policy needs to encourage public perception of humanity and nature as interdependent and interacting. The systemic nature of these interdependencies and interactions calls for systems approaches and integrated assessment tools. Identifying and modeling the intrinsic properties of the food system that will ensure its essential outcomes are maintained or enhanced over time and across generations, will help organizations and governmental institutions to track progress towards sustainability, and set policies that encourage positive transformations. This paper proposes a conceptual model that articulates crucial vulnerability and resilience factors to global environmental and socio-economic changes, postulating specific food and nutrition security issues as priority outcomes of food systems. By acknowledging the systemic nature of sustainability, this approach allows consideration of causal factor dynamics. In a stepwise approach, a logical application is schematized for three Mediterranean countries, namely Spain, France, and Italy." .

A map of risk of soil erosion at a basin scale was also produced. The study was conducted at 12 sites along the Percy River system, where physicochemical parameters, riparian ecosystem quality, habitat condition, plants, and macroinvertebrates were investigated. While livestock and wood collection, the dominant activities at upper and mean basin sites resulted in an important loss of the forest cover still the riparian ecosystem remains in a relatively good status of conservation, as do the in-stream habitat conditions and physicochemical features. Besides, most indicators based on macroinvertebrates revealed that both upper and middle basin sections supported similar assemblages, richness, density, and most functional feeding group attributes. Instead, the lower urbanized basin showed increases in conductivity and nutrient values, poor quality in the riparian ecosystem, and habitat condition. According to the multivariate analysis, ammonia level, elevation, current velocity, and habitat conditions had explanatory power on benthos assemblages. Discharge, naturalness of the river channel, flood plain morphology, conservation status, and percent of urban areas were important moderators of plant composition. Finally, although the present land use in the basin would not produce a significant risk of soil erosion, unsustainable practices that promotes the substitution of the forest for shrubs would lead to severe consequences. Mitigation efforts should be directed to protect headwater forest, restore altered riparian ecosystem, and to control the incipient eutrophication process." .

Combined, these factors increase the state’s vulnerability to biological invasion, which can have acute negative impacts on ecological integrity and subsistence practices. Of growing concern is the spread of Alaska’s first documented freshwater aquatic invasive plant Elodea spp. (elodea). In this study, we modeled the suitable habitat of elodea using global and state-specific species occurrence records and environmental variables, in concert with an ensemble of model algorithms. Furthermore, we sought to incorporate local subsistence concerns by using Native Alaskan knowledge and available statewide subsistence harvest data to assess the potential threat posed by elodea to Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and whitefish (Coregonus nelsonii) subsistence. State models were applied to future climate (2040–2059) using five general circulation models best suited for Alaska. Model evaluations indicated that our results had moderate to strong predictability, with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values above 0.80 and classification accuracies ranging from 66 to 89 %. State models provided a more robust assessment of elodea habitat suitability. These ensembles revealed different levels of management concern statewide, based on the interaction of fish subsistence patterns, known spawning and rearing sites, and elodea habitat suitability, thus highlighting regions with additional need for targeted monitoring. Our results suggest that this approach can hold great utility for invasion risk assessments and better facilitate the inclusion of local stakeholder concerns in conservation planning and management." .

However, the sensory mechanisms by which fishes locate these habitats remain unclear for many species, especially when environmental conditions (such as increased turbidity) are unfavorable for visual identification of habitats. Here, a series of laboratory experiments test whether three species of adult fish (golden topminnow Fundulus chrysotus Günther 1866, sailfin molly Poecilia latipinna Lesueur 1821, and western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard 1853) use plant chemical cues to orient to one of two habitats [hydrilla Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle or water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms]. First, experiments in aquaria were conducted offering fish a choice of the two habitats to determine preference patterns. Next, a two-channel flume, with each side containing flow originating in one of the two habitats, was used to determine whether preferences were still exhibited when fish could only detect habitats through olfactory means. While patterns among the three fish species tested here were variable, results did indicate consistent habitat preferences despite the lack of cues other than olfactory, suggesting that these organisms are capable of discriminating habitats via chemical exudates from plants. As such, olfactory mechanisms likely provide vital information about the surrounding environment and future work should be directed at determining how anthropogenic inputs such as eutrophication and sediment runoff affect the physiology of these sensory capabilities." .

Unauthorized, “arson” fires are common in the southeastern United States where a legacy of agrarian cultural heritage persists amidst an increasingly forest-dominated landscape. This paper reexamines unauthorized fire-setting in the state of Georgia, USA from a historical ecology perspective that aims to contribute to historically informed, disturbance-based land management. A space–time permutation analysis is employed to discriminate systematic, management-oriented unauthorized fires from more arbitrary or socially deviant fire-setting behaviors. This paper argues that statistically significant space–time clusters of unauthorized fire occurrence represent informal management regimes linked to the legacy of traditional land management practices. Recent scholarship has pointed out that traditional management has actively promoted sustainable resource use and, in some cases, enhanced biodiversity often through the use of fire. Despite broad-scale displacement of traditional management during the 20th century, informal management practices may locally circumvent more formal and regionally dominant management regimes. Space–time permutation analysis identified 29 statistically significant fire regimes for the state of Georgia. The identified regimes are classified by region and land cover type and their implications for historically informed disturbance-based resource management are discussed." .

A rationale is provided for the need to carry out a geoecological monitoring as well as comprehensive measures for maintaining stability of the Lake Balkhash level, preventing the water bodies from pollution, the protection of the lakes’ floodplains, the preservation of tugai forests and saxaul vegetation, and a monitoring of desertification processes. Based on studying and analyzing the spatiotemporal physical-geographical characteristics of the territory of the Balkhash region, we constructed a fragment of the geoecological regionalization map. A study into the spatialregular distribution revealed the region’s dominant plant communities. The main pollution sources have been identified: mining industries, housing and communal facilities, influences from settlements, and agrocenoses, specifically irrigated agriculture. As a result of our investigations, it was found that all landscapes of the region have been undergoing changes due to anthropogenic impacts to become anthropogenic modifications of natural landscapes.

Some widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) revealed that both chub and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small and large chub at invaded sites. This study provides evidence that invasive species can have both positive and negative effects on different life stages of a native species, with the net impact likely to depend on responses at the population level." .

Perhaps the greatest barrier to implementing flow policies is the framework for water management. An alternative management approach is needed when legal rights for environmental flows do not exist, or are ineffective at protecting ecosystems. The research presented here, conducted in the U.S. state of Arizona, provides an empirical example of engagement to promote social learning as an approach to finding ways to provide water for the environment where legal rights for environmental flows are inadequate. Based on our engagement process we propose that identifying and then building common ground require attention to the process of analyzing qualitative data and the methods for displaying complex information, two aspects not frequently discussed in the social learning or stakeholder engagement literature. The results and methods from this study can help communities develop an engagement process that will find and build common ground, increase stakeholder involvement, and identify innovative solutions to provide water for the environment that reflect the concerns of current water users." .

We examined the genetic structure of Vaccinium vitis-idaea, a common alpine species in Japan, in eight lowland wind-hole and five surrounding alpine populations. We collected leaf samples and genotyped seven microsatellite loci. Clonal patches (genets) were common in almost all populations. An analysis of annual shoot growth suggested that individuals in the wind-hole populations were long-lived (>500 years old). Genetic diversity (allelic richness) and differentiation (F ST) of the wind-hole populations were lower and higher than those of the alpine populations, respectively. No significant isolation-by-distance trend in the genetic structure was detected for the wind-hole or alpine populations. All wind-hole populations had negative inbreeding coefficients (F IS), suggesting no tendency toward homozygosity due to inbreeding, regardless of the small populations geographically isolated from the large alpine populations. Therefore, wind-holes may harbor genetically isolated but stable populations due to clonal growth, limited gene flow, and abortion of selfed seeds by early acting inbreeding depression. Analysis of molecular variance demonstrated that genetic variations among and within populations contributed more to regional genetic diversity than those between wind-hole and alpine populations, suggesting that the wind-hole and alpine populations are important for maintaining the genetic diversity of midlatitude V. vitis-idaea populations. On the other hand, Bayesian clustering showed that some wind-hole populations geographically close to the alpine populations had mixed genetic compositions of the alpine and wind-hole populations." .

Long-term fertilization treatments including chemical fertilizer (NPK), NPK plus manure (NPKM), and no fertilization over 23 years altered soil properties resulting in significant shifts in AOA and AOB community composition and abundance. NPK exhibited a strong influence on AOA and AOB composition while the addition of manure neutralized the community change induced by NPK. NPK also led to significant soil acidification and enrichment of Nitrosotalea. Nitrosospira cluster 9 and 3c were the most abundant AOB populations with opposing responses to fertilization treatments. NPKM had the largest abundance of ammonia-oxidizers and highest potential nitrification activity (PNA), suggesting high N loss potential due to a doubling of nutrient input compared to NPK. PNA was strongly correlated to AOA and AOB community composition indicating that both were important in ammonium oxidization in this Mollisol soil. Total N and organic C were the most important factors driving shifts in AOA and AOB community composition. The AOA community was strongly correlated to the activities of all sugar hydrolysis associated soil enzymes and was more responsive to C and N input than AOB." .

However, the ability of BMPs to improve riverine systems continues to be questioned due to equivocal empirical evidence linking BMP use with improved stream conditions, particularly in regard to ecological conditions. Explicitly viewing BMP location in relation to hydrological pathways may, however, assist in establishing stronger ecological linkages. The goal of this study was to assess the association between water chemistry, benthic macroinvertebrate community structure, and the number and location of agricultural BMPs in a catchment. Macroinvertebrate and water samples were collected in 30 small (<12 km2) catchments exhibiting gradients of BMP use and location in the Grand River Watershed, Southern Ontario, Canada. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that concentrations of most stream nutrients declined in association with greater numbers of BMPs and particularly when BMPs were located in hydrologically connected areas. However, BMPs were significantly associated with only one metric (%EPT) describing macroinvertebrate community structure. Furthermore, variance partitioning analysis indicated that less than 5 % of the among site variation in the macroinvertebrate community could be attributed to BMPs. Overall, the implemented BMPs appear to be achieving water quality improvement goals but spatial targeting of specific BMP types may allow management agencies to attain further water quality improvements more efficiently. Mitigation and rehabilitation measures beyond the BMPs assessed in this study may be required to meet goals of enhanced ecological condition." .

Surface water samples were collected daily or every other day from the discharge point for the watershed beginning May 15, 2001, through August 15, 2002. Of 457 samples collected, aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide, and aldicarb sulfone were detected in 6, 1, and 13, respectively. Aldicarb was detected from February through May 2002, corresponding to the legal application season of January 1 through April 30 in Florida. Aldicarb concentrations ranged from <0.16 to 4.97 ng ml−1. A single detection (0.99 ng ml−1) of aldicarb sulfoxide occurred in March 2001. The majority of aldicarb sulfone detections occurred during June and July, 2001, after the application season, and ranged from <0.22 to 0.89 ng ml−1. The half-life for aldicarb in fortified, native surface water ranged from 1.86 to 3.64 days depending on the source of water and the presence of sediments. These results demonstrated the utility of sampling on a frequent basis (compared with monthly or quarterly) for better characterizing pesticide discharges, especially in flashy systems such as canal-drained watersheds within South Florida." .

We analyzed a series of soil samples from different elevations at three locations along the Beardmore Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains (in order of increasing elevation): Ebony Ridge (ER), Cloudmaker (CM), and Meyer Desert (MD). Geochemical analyses show the MD soils, which were exposed during the LGM, were the least weathered compared to lower elevations, and also had the highest total dissolved solids (TDS). MD soils are dominated by nitrate salts (NO3/Cl ratios >10) that can be observed in SEM images. High δ17O and δ18O values of the nitrate indicate that its source is solely of atmospheric origin. It is suggested that nitrate concentrations in the soil may be utilized to determine a relative “wetting age” to better assess invertebrate habitat suitability. The highest elevation sites at MD have been exposed and accumulating salts for the longest times, and because of the salt accumulations, they were not suitable as invertebrate refugia during the LGM." .

This study explored the relationships between plant riparian communities and two major environmental variables (land cover, soil characteristics) and analyzed the floristic change along an urbanization gradient. Fifteen sites were surveyed on both riverbanks of two riparian corridors characterized by contrasting water regimes in Strasbourg, North Eastern France. Data of spontaneous species abundance was collected from 180 quadrats using (i) all plant species, (ii) herbaceous stratum and (iii) ligneous stratum (bush and tree). The diversity and compositional patterns of riparian plant species were analyzed within each corridor according to three levels of urbanization (urban, suburban, peri-urban). Relationships between riparian communities, land cover and soil chemical properties (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, moisture) were established by between-class co-inertia analyses. Land cover emerged as the main factor explaining changes in riparian communities along the rural–urban gradient while soil chemical properties discriminate water stress and fluvial dynamics of the two corridors. Similar compositional patterns were found within the most urbanized sites with the establishment of ubiquitous species. The herbaceous stratum is best linked to the level of urbanization, whereas the tree stratum is primarily correlated with corridor attributes (hydrological regime, soil properties). Although riparian species and communities are mainly determined by land cover, urban riparian corridors maintain native biodiversity up to the urban center." .

In our work the transgenic alfalfa plants with the rhlA gene, responsible for the biosynthesis of biosurfactant–rhamnolipids, were obtained. Rhamnolipids help reduce the surface tension of the hydrocarbon oil and its desorption from soil particles, thereby facilitating its recycling by microorganism. Cultivation of the control and the transgenic alfalfa plants in soil polluted with 4% oil showed the advantage of plants emitting rhamnolipids: oil utilization was 20% higher than with the control plants. When used together, the transgenic plants and Candida maltosa microorganism increased the degree of degradation of the oil to 86%. The results suggest bright prospects for the application of transgenic plants and the complex of transgenic plants and microorganisms to increase the efficiency of bioremediation." .

Inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) at an early stage of development [12 days posthatch (dph)] were exposed to waters from two estuarine wastewater-treatment outfall locations in a tidal estuary, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta (California, USA) that had varied hydrology and input volumes. The genomic response caused by endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these waters was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a suite of hormonally regulated genes. Relative androgenic and estrogenic activities of the waters were measured using CALUX reporter bioassays. The presence of bifenthrin, a pyrethroid pesticide and known EDC, as well as caffeine and the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen, which were used as markers of wastewater effluent input, were determined using instrumental analysis. Detectable levels of bifenthrin (2.89 ng L−1) were found on one of the sampling dates, and caffeine was found on all sampling dates, in water from the Boynton Slough. Neither compound was detected at the Carquinez Strait site, which has a much smaller effluent discharge input volume relative to the receiving water body size compared with Boynton Slough. Water samples from both sites incubated in the CALUX cell line induced estrogenic and androgenic activity in almost all instances, though the estrogenicity was relatively higher than the androgenicity. Changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts of endocrine-responsive genes and indicators of general chemical stress were observed after a 96-h exposure to waters from both locations. The relative levels of endocrine response, changes in gene transcript abundance, and contaminant concentrations were greater in water from the Boynton Slough site despite those effluents undergoing a more advanced treatment process. The availability of a widely geographically distributed estuarine model species (M. beryllina) now allows for improved assessment of treated effluent impacts across brackish, estuarine, and marine environments." .

With respect to aquatic ecosystems, interactions between climate warming and the elevated runoff of humic substances (brownification) may strongly affect ecosystem functions and services. However, we hitherto lack the adaptive management tools needed to counteract such global-scale effects on freshwater ecosystems. Here we show, both experimentally and using monitoring data, that predicted climatic warming and brownification will reduce freshwater quality by exacerbating cyanobacterial growth and toxin levels. Furthermore, in a model based on long-term data from a natural system, we demonstrate that food web management has the potential to increase the resilience of freshwater systems against the growth of harmful cyanobacteria, and thereby that local efforts offer an opportunity to secure our water resources against some of the negative impacts of climate warming and brownification. This allows for novel policy action at a local scale to counteract effects of global-scale environmental change, thereby providing a buffer period and a safer operating space until climate mitigation strategies are effectively established." .

Coastal saline-alkali soil represents a type of desert and a key system in the network of ecosystems at the continent-ocean interface. Tamarix chinensis is a drought-tolerant plant that is widely distributed in the coastal saline-alkali soil of Bohai Bay, China. In this study, we used 454 pyrosequencing techniques to investigate the characteristics and distribution of the microbial diversity in coastal saline-alkali soil of the T. chinensis woodland at Bohai Bay. A total of 20,315 sequences were obtained, representing 19 known bacterial phyla and a large proportion of unclassified bacteria at the phylum level. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the predominant phyla. The coverage of T. chinensis affected the microbial composition. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of γ-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes decreased whereas Actinobacteria increased with the increasing coverage of T. chinensis. At the genus level, the proportions of Steroidobacter, Lechevalieria, Gp3 and Gp4 decreased with the increase of the vegetation coverage whereas the proportion of Nocardioides increased. A cluster analysis showed that the existing T. chinensis changed the niches for the microorganisms in the coastal saline-alkali soil, which caused changes in the microbial community. The analysis also distinguished the microbial community structure of the marginal area from those of the dense area and sparse area. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the distance to the seashore line could also affect certain groups of soil bacteria in this coastal saline-alkali soil, such as the family Cryomorphaceae and class Flavobacteria, whose population decreased as the distance increased. In addition, the seawater and temperature could be the driving factors that affected the changes." .

We investigated growth, photosynthesis and calcification of early epilithic algal community assemblages exposed for 6 months to four temperature profiles (−1.1, ±0.0, +0.9, +1.6 °C) that were crossed with four carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) levels (360, 440, 650, 940 µatm), under flow-through conditions and natural light regimes. Additionally, we compared the cover of heavily calcified crustose coralline algae (CCA) and lightly calcified red algae of the genus Peyssonnelia among treatments. Increase in cover of epilithic communities showed optima under moderately elevated temperatures and present pCO2, while cover strongly decreased under high temperatures and high-pCO2 conditions, particularly due to decreasing cover of CCA. Similarly, community calcification rates were strongly decreased at high pCO2 under both measured temperatures. While final cover of CCA decreased under high temperature and pCO2 (additive negative effects), cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased at high compared to annual average and moderately elevated temperatures. Thus, cover of Peyssonnelia spp. increased in treatment combinations with less CCA, which was supported by a significant negative correlation between organism groups. The different susceptibility to stressors most likely derived from a different calcification intensity and/or mineral. Notably, growth of the epilithic communities and final cover of CCA were strongly decreased under reduced-pCO2 conditions compared to the present. Thus, CCA may have acclimatized from past to present-day pCO2 conditions, and changes in carbonate chemistry, regardless in which direction, negatively affect them. However, if epilithic organisms cannot further acclimatize to OW and OA, the interacting effects of both factors may change epilithic communities in the future, thereby likely leading to reduced reef stability and recovery." .

Metals have been dispersed heterogeneously throughout the District in the form of milled mine waste (“chat”), as flotation tailings and from smelters as aerial deposition or slag. This study was conducted to determine if the habitat has been contaminated to the extent that the assessment populations of wild birds are exposed to toxic concentrations of metals. American robins (Turdus migratorius), northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and waterfowl had increased Pb tissue concentrations (p < 0.05) compared with Pb tissue concentrations from reference birds, and the exposure of songbirds to Pb was comparable with that of birds observed at other sites severely contaminated with Pb. Mean activities of the Pb-sensitive enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) were decreased by >50% in red blood cells in these birds (p < 0.05). Several birds had tissue concentrations of Pb that have been associated with impaired biological functions and external signs of poisoning. Cadmium was increased in kidneys of songbirds (p < 0.05), but no proximal tubule cell necrosis associated with Cd poisoning was observed. Zinc concentrations in liver and kidney of waterfowl were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than reference values. The increased environmental concentrations of Zn associated with mining in the District accounted for the pancreatitis previously observed in five waterfowl from the District. The District is the first site at which free-flying wild birds have been found to be suffering severe effects of Zn poisoning." .
