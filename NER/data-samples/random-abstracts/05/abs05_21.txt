Abstract For a Navier–Stokes–Nernst–Planck–Poisson system we construct global weak solutions in a three-dimensional bounded domain. A special feature of our approach is that we allow for nonconstant diffusion coefficients which may vary from species to species as well as for $${L^2}$$ L2 -initial data without any further constraints. Our approach is based on the intrinsic energy structure, Aubin–Simon compactness arguments, and maximal $${L^p}$$ Lp -regularity.
