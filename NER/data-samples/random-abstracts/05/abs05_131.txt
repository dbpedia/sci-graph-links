Abstract This study assessed the contamination extent and potential ecological and human health impacts for chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in sediments and indigenous benthic organisms along the coastal area of Huludao, China. We analyzed a total of eight species: two benthic fish species, two bivalves, two snails, and two decapod crustaceans. Cu, Zn, and Cd levels in sediment exceeded the Chinese marine sediment quality criteria. The geoaccumulation index was highest for Cd followed in a decreasing order by Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Cr. Metal levels were highest in the four mollusk species. The oyster and veined rapa whelk had the highest bioaccumulation factors, indicating that these two species would be well suited for monitoring the metal pollution in this area. Our comparison of estimated daily intake values for human consumption of the seafood species to the Food and Agricultural Organization-recommended daily dietary allowances indicate potential health risks from the intake of Cd from all shellfish other than our crab species and Zn intake from oyster consumption. An analysis of target hazard quotients identified noncarcinogenic health risks from Cd (in all shellfish analyzed except for our crab species), Cu, and Zn (in oysters and veined rapa whelks). Moreover, an analysis of cancer risk from Pb ingestion detected an increased risk for consumption of all shellfish except for the crab species. Health risks seem especially pronounced for the consumption of oysters and the veined rapa whelks; a seafood advisory may be warranted for these mollusks.
