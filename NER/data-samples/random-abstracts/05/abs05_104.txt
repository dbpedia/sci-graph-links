Abstract Above-ground biomass (AGB) is an important indicator of grassland ecosystem performance. Easily measured plant functional traits (PFTs) may provide useful predictors of the response of plants to grazing. Understanding the response of PFTs to grazing and the relationship between PFTs and AGB is very important for effectively predicting the response of ecosystems to grazing and rangeland management. A grazing experiment was conducted in Gangcha County, Qinghai Province, in the northeastern part of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau in 2012 and 2013. We investigated the response of PFTs in three dominant species (Elymus nutans, Kobresia humilis, and Stipa purpurea) to grazing, using six stocking rates. Plant height (PH), plant weight, leaf area, and leaf dry biomass of these three dominant species had significantly negative relationships with stocking rate. Leaf thickness (LT) of these three species usually showed a unimodal response to grazing. Specific leaf area generally showed a quadratic relationship with grazing intensity. No consistent effects of grazing were observed on nitrogen content per unit mass (N mass) and nitrogen content per unit area (N area). PH, leaf area, and leaf dry mass (LDM) were positively associated with AGB, but LT, N mass, and N area had no statistically significant association with AGB. We thus conclude that PH, leaf area, and LDM best predict the effects of grazing on AGB. Finally, 2.87 sheep/ha is recommended as the optimal stocking rate in this region to maintain the health of this grassland ecosystem and to allow for sustainable development.
