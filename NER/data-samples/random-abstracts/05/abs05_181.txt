Abstract The possibility of using transgenic plants and their complexes with microorganisms to clean up soil from pollution is a topical research area. In our work the transgenic alfalfa plants with the rhlA gene, responsible for the biosynthesis of biosurfactantâ€“rhamnolipids, were obtained. Rhamnolipids help reduce the surface tension of the hydrocarbon oil and its desorption from soil particles, thereby facilitating its recycling by microorganism. Cultivation of the control and the transgenic alfalfa plants in soil polluted with 4% oil showed the advantage of plants emitting rhamnolipids: oil utilization was 20% higher than with the control plants. When used together, the transgenic plants and Candida maltosa microorganism increased the degree of degradation of the oil to 86%. The results suggest bright prospects for the application of transgenic plants and the complex of transgenic plants and microorganisms to increase the efficiency of bioremediation.
