Abstract Key message K fertilization led to a significant increase in fine root biomass, fine root length, and root tip number in the mineral soil layer but does not affect the ecomycorrhizal community structure in the organic horizon. Context Potassium (K) deficiency is common in Picea abies in the European Alps. Fertilization with other nutrients often influences fine root biomass and ectomycorrhizas, but less is known about the effects of K-fertilization. Aims The aim of the investigation was to determine the effects of K-fertilization on stem growth and fine root biomass of Picea abies, as well as the influence on ectomycorrhizal community structure of the fine roots. Methods Eight years after a single fertilization of K-deficient Picea abies with 200 kg K ha−1, fine roots were collected from 7 control and 6 K-fertilized plots. Fine root biomass and morphology were determined. The identification of ectomycorrhizal taxa was determined by morphotyping and by amplification of the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results K-fertilization did not affect the amount of fine root biomass and ectomycorrhizal community structure in the Oi + Oe and Oa layers but led to a significant increase in fine root biomass, fine root length, and root tip number in the mineral soil layer. Conclusion An increase in growth due to K-fertilization leads to great exploration of the mineral soil by fine roots but does not affect the ectomycorrhizal community structure in the organic horizons.
