Abstract AimsOur study aimed to determine whether, and to what extent, stand characteristics and topography affected spatial variations in soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in subtropical forests. MethodsSoil samples were taken from a Choerospondias axillaris deciduous broadleaved forest and a Lithocarpus glaber–Cyclobalanopsis glauca evergreen broadleaved forest. Spatial variations in SOC, TN and TP concentrations and the factors affecting them were investigated using geostatistical analysis and stepwise linear regression, respectively. ResultsThe L. glaber–C. glauca forest exhibited higher coefficients of variation (CVs) of SOC (35 %) and TN (34 %) concentrations than the C. axillaris forest (27 % for SOC and 21 % for TN), but the CV of TP concentration in the L. glaber–C. glauca forest (17 %) was lower than that in the C. axillaris forest (24 %). Stand characteristics contributed the most to spatial variations in SOC and TP, while soil texture made the greatest contribution to variations in TN. Topography contributed the least to variations in SOC, TN and TP. ConclusionsStand characteristics, together with topography and soil texture, contributed to spatial variations in SOC, TN and TP concentrations. The contributions of stand characteristics differed in SOC, TN and TP due to their different cycling characteristics.
