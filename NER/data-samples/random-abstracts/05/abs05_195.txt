Abstract Soil filamentous fungi play a prominent role in regulating ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems. This necessitates understanding their responses to climate change drivers in order to predict how nutrient cycling and ecosystem services will be influenced in the future. Here, we provide a quantitative synthesis of ten studies on soil fungal community responses to elevated CO2. Many of these studies reported contradictory diversity responses. We identify the duration of the study as an influential parameter that determines the outcome of experimentation. Our analysis reconciles the existing globally distributed experiments on fungal community responses to elevated CO2 and provides a framework for comparing results of future CO2 enrichment studies.
