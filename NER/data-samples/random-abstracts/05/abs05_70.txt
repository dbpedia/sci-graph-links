Abstract The fertilizing potential of various agro-industrial wastes [compost (C), dehydrated manures (DM) and digestate (D)] on soil and crops growth were investigated. Soil properties as pH, electrical conductivity, water retention capacity and soil organic matter (SOM) were modified. Hence, SOM increase from 1.1 % in unamended soil to 2.3 and to 3.5 % in soils amended with (DM) and with (C) respectively. Also, microbial and respirometric soil activities were strongly improved, mainly in presence of DM and D. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), Alfalfa (Medicago sativa), Wheat (Triticum durum) and Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) were tested for the germination index and growth evolution in soil amended by various wastes. Plants grown in amended soils explained an improvement in crops growth, biomass and better productivities than crops grown in unamended soil and irrigated with water.
