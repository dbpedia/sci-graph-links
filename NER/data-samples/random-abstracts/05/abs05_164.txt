Abstract The dietary uptake of Cd and Pb may contribute to the decline of migratory red-crowned cranes (Grus japonensis) on the Asian mainland. To uncover the relevance of this hypothesis, we determined the concentrations of Pb and Cd as well as further macro and trace elements (Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Hg and As) in the gastric contents, gastric wall, intestinal wall, liver, kidney, muscle, and feathers of two individuals found dead in Zhalong Wetland in Northeastern China. Indeed, the Pb concentrations in the liver and kidney tissues was with 31.4 and 60.3 mg kg−1 dry weight (dw), respectively, above concentrations considered as potentially toxic level in common birds (i.e. 30 mg kg−1). These Pb concentration may have possibly been associated with lethal toxicosis in this endangered species suggesting Pb as major threat for G. japonensis populations. Thus, the inputs of Pb into Zhalong Wetland should be reduced to maintain and reestablish environmental conditions supporting the population development of these migratory red-crowned cranes in the Zhalong Wetland, a critical crane habitat for the long-term sustainability of this species.
