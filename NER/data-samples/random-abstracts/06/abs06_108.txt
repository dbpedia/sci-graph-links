Abstract Assessing carbon (C) capture and storage potential by the agroforestry practice of windbreaks has been limited. This is due, in part, to a lack of suitable data and associated models for estimating tree biomass and C for species growing under more open-grown conditions such as windbreaks in the Central Plains region of the United States (U.S.). We evaluated 15 allometric models using destructively sampled Pinus ponderosa (Lawson & C. Lawson) data from field windbreaks in Nebraska and Montana. Several goodness-of-fit metrics were used to select the optimal model. The Jenkins’ et al. model was then used to estimate biomass for 16 tree species in windbreaks projected over a 50 year time horizon in nine continental U.S. regions. Carbon storage potential in the windbreak scenarios ranged from 1.07 ± 0.21 to 3.84 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 year−1 for conifer species and from 0.99 ± 0.16 to 13.6 ± 7.72 Mg C ha−1 year−1 for broadleaved deciduous species during the 50 year period. Estimated mean C storage potentials across species and regions were 2.45 ± 0.42 and 4.39 ± 1.74 Mg C ha−1 year−1 for conifer and broadleaved deciduous species, respectively. Such information enhances our capacity to better predict the C sequestration potential of windbreaks associated with whole farm/ranch operations in the U.S.
