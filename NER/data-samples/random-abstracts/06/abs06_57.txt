Abstract The wheat cultivar Shanrong no. 3 (cv. SR3) tolerates both salinity and drought stress more effectively than does its progenitor cultivar Jinan 177 (cv. JN177). When the cultivars are subjected to stress, a number of genes encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSRs) are known to be upregulated in SR3. Here, a set of 12 full length Triticum aestivum MSR (TaMSR) cDNAs have been isolated from cv. SR3. The genes were transcribed in the wheat root, stem, and leaf in plants sampled at various developmental stages. Those induced by salinity and drought harbored known stress-responsive cis elements in their promoter region. The constitutive expression in Arabidopsis thaliana of four MSRs which were induced by salt and drought in microarray assay showed that the product of one (TaMSRA2) heightened the plantâ€™s tolerance to NaCl, methylviologen (MV), and abscisic acid, that of the second (TaMSRA5) enhanced salinity tolerance, that of the third (TaMSRB1.1) increased tolerance to salinity, MV and H2O2, and that of the fourth (TaMSRB5.1) increased tolerance to both salinity and mannitol. The effect of the presence in A. thaliana of TaMSRB1.1 was to suppress the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and to increase the intracellular content of soluble sugars.
