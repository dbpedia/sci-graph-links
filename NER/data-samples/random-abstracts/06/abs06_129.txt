Abstract Different criteria are used by human populations around the world in the selection of preferred natural resources. In this study, the following hypotheses were tested: 1) the preference for food native species is related to the number of uses for which the species are cited; 2) the categories of food and medicinal use equally influence the selection of a species as preferred; 3) the preference among native food species is related to its frequency and abundance in the areas of collection. Data collection on species preference was conducted in communities located near the Araripe National Forest (FLONA) in Cear√°, Northeastern, Brazil. Both the hypothesis that the preference would relate to the number of uses attributed to species and the hypothesis that food and medicinal categories equally influence the selection of species as preferred ones were corroborated. It was concluded in this study that people optimize both use and collection of native resources using criteria such as the versatility of uses for species and the abundance of the resource in the preferred collection areas. It is believed that this trend may be an adaptive strategy adopted by local communities for the exploitation of native resources.
