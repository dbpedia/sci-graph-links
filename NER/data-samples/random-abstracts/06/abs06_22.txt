Abstract Metal-resistant endophytic fungi from roots improved phytoremediation efficacy of host plants; however, the effects of endophytic fungi from plant aerial parts on host plants are unknown. The aim of this study was to develop a feasible method to screen fungal endophytes from stems and roots of Brassica napus and to investigate effects of the endophytic fungi on growth and phytoremediation efficiency of the plant. Endophytic Fusarium sp. CBRF44, Penicillium sp. CBRF65, and Alternaria sp. CBSF68 with different traits were isolated from roots and stems of rapes grown in a metal-contaminated soil. Fusarium sp. CBRF44 (resistant to 5 mM Cd and 15 mM Pb, isolated from roots) and Alternaria sp. CBSF68 (resistant to 1 mM Cd and 10 mM Pb, isolated from stems) could produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore; Penicillium sp. CBRF65 (tolerate 2 mM Cd and 20 mM Pb, isolated from roots) could not produce IAA and siderophore but showed the highest phosphate-solubilizing activities. Fusarium sp. CBRF44 and Penicillium sp. CBRF65 significantly increased the rape biomass and promoted the extraction efficacy of Pb and Cd, while Alternaria sp. CBSF68 did not show similar results. Penicillium sp. CBRF65 and Fusarium sp. CBRF44 could be frequently recovered from inoculated rape roots, while Alternaria sp. CBSF68 was scarcely recovered. The results indicate that the colonizing capacity of endophytic fungi in roots is important to improve phytoremediation efficacy of host plants.
