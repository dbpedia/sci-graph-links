Abstract Legumes in the genus Adesmia are wild species with forage and medicinal potential. Their nitrogen fixation efficiency depends on their association with soil bacteria known as rhizobia. The aim of this work was to assess the diversity and symbiotic effectiveness of root nodule bacteria from Adesmia boronioides, Adesmia emarginata and Adesmia tenella from different regions of Chile. Adesmia spp. nodules were collected from seven sites obtaining 47 isolates, which resulted in 19 distinct strains. The diversity of the strains was determined via partial sequencing of the dnaK, 16srRNA and nodA genes. The strains were authenticated as root nodule bacteria on their original host and assessed for symbiotic effectiveness on A. emarginata and A. tenella. The strains from Adesmia tenella clustered within the Mesorhizobium clade. Adesmia boronioides nodulated with Mesorhizobium sp., Rhizobium leguminosarum and Bradyrhizobium sp. The rhizobia from A. emarginata were identified as Burkholderia spp, which was symbiotically ineffective on this species and on A. tenella. Strains isolated from Adesmia emarginata nodules, but unable to induce nodulation, were identified as Labrys methylaminiphilus. Labrys strain AG-49 significantly increased root dry weight in A. emarginata. The nodA genes from Adesmia strains were unique and correlated to legume host. A. emarginata was effectively nodulated by Bradyrhizobium AG-64 and A. tenella by Mesorhizobium strains AG-51 and AG.52. It is concluded that Adesmia emarginata, A. tenella and A. boronioides are associated to diverse bacterial symbionts and selection of an effective inoculant is a key step to assist Adesmia spp. adaptation and restoration.
