Abstract Given a compact Lie group G with Lie algebra $${\mathfrak{g}}$$ g , we consider its tangent Lie group $${TG\cong G\ltimes_{\rm Ad}\mathfrak{g}}$$ TG≅G⋉Adg . In this short note, we prove that TG admits a left-invariant naturally reductive Riemannian metric g and a metric connection with skew torsion $${\nabla}$$ ∇ such that $${(TG,g,\nabla)}$$ (TG,g,∇) is naturally reductive. An alternative spinorial description of the same connection on the direct product $${G \times \mathfrak{g}}$$ G×g generalizes in a rather subtle way to $${TS^7}$$ TS7 , which is in many senses almost a tangent Lie group.
