Two-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a subfamily (TPC1–3) of eukaryotic voltage- and ligand-gated cation channels1,2 with two non-equivalent tandem pore-forming subunits that dimerize to form quasi-tetramers. Found in vacuolar3 or endolysosomal4 membranes, they regulate the conductance of sodium5 and calcium3,6 ions, intravesicular pH5, trafficking7 and excitability8,9. TPCs are activated by a decrease in transmembrane potential1,3,9,10 and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations1,10, are inhibited by low luminal pH and calcium11, and are regulated by phosphorylation12,13. Here we report the crystal structure of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana at 2.87 Å resolution as a basis for understanding ion permeation3,4,10, channel activation1,5,10, the location of voltage-sensing domains1,9,10 and regulatory ion-binding sites11,14. We determined sites of phosphorylation3,4 in the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains that are positioned to allosterically modulate cytoplasmic Ca2+ activation. One of the two voltage-sensing domains (VSD2) encodes voltage sensitivity and inhibition by luminal Ca2+ and adopts a conformation distinct from the activated state observed in structures of other voltage-gated ion channels15,16. The structure shows that potent pharmacophore trans-Ned-19 (ref. 17) acts allosterically by clamping the pore domains to VSD2. In animals, Ned-19 prevents infection by Ebola virus and other filoviruses, presumably by altering their fusion with the endolysosome and delivery of their contents into the cytoplasm7.
