Abstract Dynamics of the composition of the microbial community was studied during start-up of a single-stage completely mixed constant flow laboratory setup for ammonium removal by the nitritation/anammox process from the filtrate of digested sludge of the Kuryanovo wastewater treatment plant (KWTP), Moscow. To decrease the period of the start-up, the setup was initially inoculated with two types of activated sludge (nitrifying sludge from a KWTP aeration tank and sludge from a sequencing batch reactor enriched with anammox bacteria). The start-up and adjustment stage was therefore decreased to 35–40 days, and nitrogen removal efficiency reached 80% after 120 days of the setup operation. Taxonomic analysis of the composition of the microbial community was carried out by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA fragments obtained using the universal and planctomycetes-specific primers. In the course of adaptation of activated sludge to increasing nitrogen load, microbial community of the setup became less diverse and more specialized. The contribution of anammox bacteria of the family Brocadiaceae, closely related to Candidatus “Brocadia caroliniensis,” increased gradually. Members of the order Nitrosomonadales were involved in ammonium oxidation to nitrite. While nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira were also detected, their share decreased with accumulation of the activated sludge. The contribution of other bacteria varied as well: the shares of the phyla Ignavibacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria increased significantly (up to 13, 12, and 10%, respectively of the total number of reads), while relative abundance of the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Synergistetes, Aminicenantes, Thermotogae, and Cloacimonetes decreased. Thus, application of pyrosequencing made it possible to monitor succession of the bacterial community involved in nitrogen removal by nitritation/anammox process.
