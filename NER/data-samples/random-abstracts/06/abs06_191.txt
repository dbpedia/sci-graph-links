Abstract The materials for studying the development of muscle tissue and particular skeletal muscles at the anatomical regions of the body in the red steppe young stock are presented in comparative aspects. Agerelated changes in the muscle tissue growth rates in different periods of rearing and fattening the animals were caused by both the unequal intensities of its development in different body parts and the increasing process of lipogenesis associated with aging.
