Abstract Leptomastidea angulipennis sp. nov. is described as new to science from Yunnan, China. It can be easily separated from all the other species of the genus by the triangular shape and infuscate pattern of the forewing. Brief diagnoses and new distributional data of L. herbicola and L. rubra are also provided, and a key to the females of all the Chinese species is given.
