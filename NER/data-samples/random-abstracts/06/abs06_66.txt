Abstract The European sturgeon is critically endangered and the French ex-situ conservation approach involves developing a captive stock to produce offspring for release to boost natural populations. The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of rearing environment before stocking on the survival, growth, and behavior of three-month-old sturgeons from two different crossings. Enriched rearing was designed to mimic the variability of the natural environment using river water, natural photoperiod, substrate, variable water current and depths. Traditional rearing was carried out with bare tanks, underground water, dark conditions, without current and at constant depth. Fish survival was determined monthly and growth was estimated weekly. Behavior was assessed with exploration and novel prey tests in solitary using video tracking. Results demonstrated that enriched condition resulted in bigger fish from the first month. Growth curve analysis revealed that enriched environment made both fish crossings grow in a similar manner. In contrast, crossings growth differed in traditional rearing which may reflect a genotype-environment interaction. Behavioral data highlighted that enriched-reared fish were slower to explore a new environment but more individuals engaged on doing so than traditional-reared fish. Results also showed that survival was high (>80Â %) during all the trial. However, survival was lower during the second month in enriched environment. Our findings advocate for the integration of enriched rearing practices within the juvenile production for release in order to boost the performance linked to fitness. Stocking practices and life history research must work together to favor adaptive aquaculture approaches, which support species conservation.
