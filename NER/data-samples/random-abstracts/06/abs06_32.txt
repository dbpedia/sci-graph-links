Abstract Biomass equations are a helpful tool to estimate the tree and stand biomass production and standing stock. Such estimations are of great interest for science but also of great importance for global reports on the carbon cycle and the global climate system. Even though there are various collections and generic meta-analyses available with biomass equations for mature trees, reports on biomass equations for juvenile trees (seedlings and saplings) are mainly missing. Against the background of an increasing amount of reforestation and afforestation projects and forests in young successional stages, such equations are required. In this study we have collected data from various studies on the aboveground woody biomass of 19 common tree species growing in Europe. The aim of this paper was to calculate species-specific biomass equations for the aboveground woody biomass of single trees in dependence of root-collar-diameter (RCD), height (H) and the combination of the two (RCD2 H). Next to calculating species-specific biomass equations for the species available in the dataset, we also calculated generic biomass equations for all broadleaved species and all conifer species. The biomass equations should be a contribution to the pool of published biomass equations, whereas the novelty is here that the equations were exclusively derived for young trees.
