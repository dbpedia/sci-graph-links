Abstract The interferon alpha-responsive gene (Ifrg15) mRNA is highly expressed in various stages during preimplantation mammalian embryo development. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated the effect of Ifrg15 in this process. In mammals, the fusion of male and female pronuclei generates a diploid zygote, and is an important step for subsequent cleavage and blastocyst formation. Here, by using RNA interference, rescue experiments, immunofluorescence staining and live cell observations, we found that preimplantation embryo development was arrested at the 1-cell stage after knocking down Ifrg15 expression. This induced DNA damage and prevented the cleavage of embryos. Furthermore, the effect of Ifrg15 deficiency in arresting preimplantation embryo development produced by specific short interfering RNA microinjection was concentration-dependent. Using transcriptome expression profiles, gene ontogeny functional annotation and enrichment analysis, we gained 197 enriched pathways based on 1445 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Of these, 12 pathways and about one third of the DEGs were involved in DNA damage, DNA repair, cell cycle, and developmental processes. Thus, the IFRG15 protein might be an important molecule for maintaining genomic integrity and stability through upregulating or downregulating a cascade of genes to permit normal preimplantation embryo development.
