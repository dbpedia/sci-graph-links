Abstract Quevedo’s political literature was particularly successful in England. This country shared with other European countries their fascination about his two most widespread burlesque writings, the Buscón and the Sueños, translated into the main European languages since their publication in the 17th century. Together with some political works, also published in English—Marco Bruto or lucianesque prose like Discurso de todos los diablos and La Fortuna con seso—, his Política de Dios, which became a best-seller, was well known: its first part was translated in 1715, transformed in a sort of antidote against Whig and Tory parties; and the second one, in 1720, turned into an allegation against “tyrant and atheist” politicians, disciples of the Satanic Machiavelli. This article examines the strategies of the English translation of the second part in order to increase the anti-Machiavellism of Quevedo’s work, and to adapt it to the peculiar political and religious circumstances in England during the first decades of the 18th century. This analysis is preceded by a triple contextualization of the English version: the wide circulation of the Spanish writer’s literature in Europe, Machiavelli’s reception in the English culture, and Quevedo’s own position, always fluctuating and ambiguous when facing the Florentine theorist. This paper allows for getting to know the unsuspected “anti-Machiavellian instant” that Quevedo’s work experienced through Christian Politicks, slanted English version of his Política de Dios against the “state outrage”.
