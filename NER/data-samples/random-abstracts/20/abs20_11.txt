Abstract In this paper we introduce a new general class of multi-valued Lipschitz hemicontractive mappings. We then prove strong convergence theorems for finding a fixed point of the mapping using a new two steps averaged algorithm. The method used in the proof is new and enables us to systematically avoid so many strong assumptions in the contemporary literature. The theorems obtained generalize and improve many results in the literature.
