Abstract Impressed names, letters, or symbols on construction bricks produced from the 1880s to the 1940s may be useful data for analytical or interpretive aspects of historical archaeology and sister disciplines. As an artifact having wide range of type, impressed “brands,” geographical distribution, and cultural use, such bricks were manufactured by now-obsolete methods. Primary documentary sources for the identification of manufacturing companies, duration of specific “brands,” and past distribution systems are industry publications, government documents, and business directories.
