I take omissions to be fictional entities and claim that the way in which sentences about fictional characters are true parallels the way in which sentences about omissions are true. I develop a pragmatic account of fictional reference and argue that my fictionalist account of omissions implies a plausible account of the metaphysics of omissions." .

This poem was published in London, England by William Shakespeare in the year 1593 It is worth noting that William Shakespeare (1564-1616) has also been cited twice before in the journal SILICON since its introduction in 2009. One such citation to Shakespeare was under the sub-header of the journal that is entitled POETS’ CORNER. The idea behind this series of articles that are given under POETS’ CORNER is to have a place where the artistic aspects of the element silicon (Si) and its chemical compounds can be described. Hopefully, this collection of articles will build, and it will serve to show just how broad the field of silicon-based materials and silicon-based technologies is. Indeed one already sees this broadness reflected in the growing content of the journal SILICON. This is article is the third in the ongoing series of articles that are entitled POETS’ CORNER. It was written during 2016 when the world was celebrating the 400 th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare (d. 23 rd April 1616)." .

Two SNPs, rs4236601 (odds ratio [OR] = 6.25; P = 0.0086) and a tagging-SNP rs3801994 (OR = 1.32; P = 0.042), were associated with POAG in the Hong Kong Chinese cohort after age and gender adjustments.

This essay analyzes Yu Hua’s ghost fiction The Seventh Day (2013) and argues that it not only evokes familiar elements of the zhiguai genre, such as issues of rites, boundary and time, but also reworks these elements responding to a new historical context and addressing new concerns. Ghosts in The Seventh Day neither abide to the historical time of development nor enter the cyclical time of reincarnation. Their final place of rest, the land of the unburied, evinces a utopian impulse, which must be understood in connection with the dystopian vision of the mundane world." .

That claim prima facie conflicts with his commitment to the cognitive transparency of sense, and the determination of reference by sense. Resolving this tension compels us to recognize that fiction for Frege is a special kind of force, and that words express a sense capable of picking out a referent only in the presence of the appropriate assertoric force. In effect, Frege’s theory of fiction reveals his commitment to an act-centered rather than an expression-centered semantics." .

Finally, following Heil’s and Lowe’s characterization of modes as particular properties that ontologically depend on their “bearers”, I introduce relational modes in order to define a new solution to the problems of the ontological status of both external, non-symmetrical relations and O-Roles.

This has led to the development of a reading tradition that permits numerous different vocalisations to be made upon the basic skeletal text of the established ʿUthmānī codex. Ibn al-Jazarī (d. 833/1429) chose ten early readers whom he felt were most representative of this tradition and whose readings are treated as canonical up until this day. One of these, the Kufan linguist al-Kisāʾī (d. 189/805) has been characterised in the literature as more focused on the grammar of the Qur’an than his reader peers. This article explores al-Kisāʾī’s process of ikhtiyār (preference) when deciding between various possible readings. The sample for analysis consists of Kisāʾī’s tafarrudāt, the approximately fifty cases in which his reading differs from the other nine readers. By comparing his reading with the comments of early scholars of Qur’anic linguistics, especially his near-contemporary al-Farrāʾ (d. 208/822), it is possible to construct a typology of the suspected principal reasons for al-Kisāʾī’s tafarrudāt. Not only are many of these based on grammatical preferences, but they demonstrate a significant degree of consistency. Furthermore, analysis of a cluster of readings with implications for the interpretation of the sharīʿa (divine law and moral code) provides evidence for a subtle exegetical dimension to al-Kisāʾī’s work as a reader-grammarian." .

In the novel, Erpenbeck looks back at the history of European socialism in the twentieth century by depicting the life of a female protagonist patterned after Hedda Zinner, her own paternal grandmother. In its historical dimension, the novel is ultimately intended as a literary demonstration of not only the demise of utopian socialist thought after 1990, but also of the loss of philosophic idealism of the European Enlightenment. Erpenbeck’s refutation of the teleological dialectic of history as posited by Hegelian and Marxist concepts is achieved through the narrative structure of her novel. The author’s notion of the history of philosophy relies strongly on postmodernist ideas of accidental nature [Zufälligkeit] and the essential open-endedness of history." .

The author makes the following conclusions: (a) the ethnic fragmentation of the population and language diversity of the countries in the world do not correlate directly with their levels of democracy, presence of conflicts, and economic success and (b) widely publicized predictions about the quick extinction of most languages in the world have turned out to be a myth, and international campaigns and declarations in support of endangered languages were excessively politicized. The process of revitalization of languages is under way; they are acquiring a higher status, acknowledgment, and support on the territory of the former Soviet Union, including the minority languages of the peoples of Dagestan, the North, and Siberia. The state policy of providing an official status for regional languages and the ethnic component of the federative system as ethnocultural autonomy for individual regions and ethnic communities play a key role. A list of endangered languages is given; motives and factors of assimilation in favor of the Russian language in Russia are explained. Categories and social practices based on them, such as 1 and 1 are revised in favor of multiply and mutually nonexclusive approaches." .

As a result, contemporary phenomenologists lack a clear framework within which to articulate the aims and results of their research, and cannot easily engage each other in constructive and critical discourse. Examining the literature on phenomenology’s identity, I show how the question of phenomenology’s subject matter has been systematically neglected. It has been overshadowed by an unending concern with phenomenology’s methodological identity. However, an examination of recent contributions to this literature reveals that a concern with articulating phenomenology’s subject matter has gradually increased, although such articulations remain preliminary. In light of this, I delineate, define, and illustrate three layers of phenomenological research, which I term “existentials,” “modes,” and “prejudices.” While the delineation of these layers is drawn primarily from classical phenomenological texts, they are defined and illustrated through the use of more contemporary literature. Following the articulation of this subject matter, I briefly consider some of the debates—both foundational and applied—that can be facilitated by the adoption of this framework." .

Their dependency relationship is a form of queer kinship, an early version of the caring relations between lesbians and gay men that HIV/AIDS would demand over the next two decades as chosen families emerged to nurture gay men and lesbians rejected by their families of origin. The representation of queer kinship offers an alternative to more traditional portrayals of care in literature that focus on the heteronormative family, a site of care that feminist dependency theory also paradoxically privileges. This article synthesizes insights from queer theory and critical disability studies in order to expand our understanding of the roles participants in care can play, the ways they can feel, and the outcomes they can achieve. Myles and Schuyler’s dependency relationship was sustaining for both of them and also critical for her development as a pioneering lesbian poet in an art world still dominated by men." .

Given the influence of US media on perspectives of Muslims (Jackson, 2010), and the pervasive use of children’s literature in American schools, it is important to investigate what viewpoints about Islam are being communicated to children through these texts. In this qualitative study, the author uses inductive content analysis to examine the depiction of Muslims in picturebooks written for young children and in English, an area of study in which very little research has been conducted. Themes that emerged within and across texts are discussed and illustrated with examples from the books in the sample. Perspectives about Islam communicated through these themes are described. The author discusses the implications of the findings for Muslims and non-Muslims, making suggestions to enhance the depiction of Muslims and make them more visible in the literature, benefitting all readers in the process." .

Yet, she remains understudied and virtually unknown, except among a few scholars who have examined, briefly, a few of her most prominent texts.

However, little scholarly attention has been paid to the question of what is actually happening in classrooms as a result of this rapid influx of FPs and the associated proliferation of English-only courses. The aim of this study is to understand internationalization’s real impacts on teaching and learning by examining professor-student interactions and instructional practices in a so-called “internationalized” university course (i.e., an English-speaking Canadian professor’s computer architecture course for domestic Korean students). I adopt the theoretical lens of sustainability framed within an ecological perspective and focus on languages and cultures in the HEI context, while resisting market-based HEI internationalization driven by economic considerations. This study finds that Prof. Dave’s course was characterized by linguistic and cultural reciprocity and equitable relations among the participants, revealing its vast potential for sustainable internationalization. Further, the course acknowledged and empowered various funds of student knowledge, including content knowledge, English capability, and Korean capability, which led to fun and effective learning. Although this successful symbiosis suggests a promising future for sustainable internationalization in Korean HEIs, I also highlight the pressing need for institution-level programs or services to assist both FPs and domestic students in FP courses." .

The articles were selected from the EBSCO and Google Scholar databases regarding the definitions and dimensions of RRI. The results of the study indicated that while administrative definitions were widely quoted in the reviewed literature, they were not substantially further elaborated. Academic definitions were mostly derived from the institutional definitions; however, more empirical studies should be conducted in order to give a broader empirical basis to the development of the concept. In the current study, four distinct conceptual dimensions of RRI that appeared in the reviewed literature were brought out: inclusion, anticipation, responsiveness and reflexivity. Two emerging conceptual dimensions were also added: sustainability and care." .

This improves the performance of the construction via generators studied earlier." .

Moreover, the article shows that conspiracies are located at the upper-end of the social spectrum in these novels. Unlike other contemporary writers of detective fiction in Spanish, then, Vázquez Montalbán stops short of imagining society as a productive battlefield between opposing complots." .

Since the simplest extensions of the standard model cannot accommodate the observation, many alternatives have been considered to explain the excess. Here we focus on several proposed renormalisable weakly-coupled models and revisit results given in the literature. We point out that physically important subtleties are often missed or neglected. To facilitate the study of the excess we have created a collection of 40 model files, selected from recent literature, for the Mathematica package SARAH. With SARAH one can generate files to perform numerical studies using the tailor-made spectrum generators FlexibleSUSY and SPheno. These have been extended to automatically include crucial higher order corrections to the diphoton and digluon decay rates for both CP-even and CP-odd scalars. Additionally, we have extended the UFO and CalcHep interfaces of SARAH, to pass the precise information about the effective vertices from the spectrum generator to a Monte-Carlo tool. Finally, as an example to demonstrate the power of the entire setup, we present a new supersymmetric model that accommodates the diphoton excess, explicitly demonstrating how a large width can be obtained. We explicitly show several steps in detail to elucidate the use of these public tools in the precision study of this model." .

In 1995, Roos pointed out that the elements $$S_N[y]$$ SN[y] of the permutation $$S_N$$ SN after the key scheduling algorithm for the first few values of y are biased to certain combinations of secret key bytes. These correlations were theoretically studied by Paul and Maitra (SAC, 2007). The formula for the correlation probabilities provided by them gives a wrong impression that the probabilities decrease as the value of y becomes larger, which is not true. In this paper, we point out some gaps in their analysis and present a detailed analysis of Roos bias. We provide a more accurate formula for the correlation probabilities. We further study nested Roos type biases and present comparison results. These types of biases are used to reconstruct key from the permutation $$S_N$$ SN for better success probability." .

Owing to the scarcity of literature that explicitly highlights the link between human rights, citizenship and violence against women, the current analysis highlights some of the existing literature on a situated understanding of citizenship through a women’s human rights lens, while the discussion on violence against women as a barrier to realising all human rights that enable the exercise of effective citizenship is largely underpinned by the work of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences." .

To bring out the implications of neoliberalism on language education, we explore how language learning is increasingly constructed as a form of linguistic entrepreneurship, or an act of aligning with the moral imperative to strategically exploit language-related resources for enhancing one’s worth in the world. To critically examine the political conditions that promote such an ethical regime, we focus on how linguistic entrepreneurship can be indexed through two distinct aspects, the motivation for and the mode of language learning. We then discuss under what circumstances the notion of linguistic entrepreneurship might be invoked and what kind of contradictions this entails.

The initial responses supplied information on lengthy projects said to be advancing toward completion in favorable writing conditions, away from usual constraints for some and deadlines for others. After the Intransigeant’s publication of a quatrain Apollinaire sent by postcard, the format of the submissions changed and poets began a friendly contest to outdo one another in verse composition ostensibly related to monuments or sites of literary history encountered over the summer, while also anchored in the language of the game and its participants. The seasonal rhymesters included André Billy, Roger Allard, Louis de Gonzague Frick, Gaston Picard, Jacques Dyssord, Fagus, Lucien Rolmer, Fernand Divoire (founder of Les Treize), and Paul Fort who devised a patchwork from the poetic heritage; even the fictitious Georges-Merize entered the fray with a quatrain in Gil Blas that mirrored Apollinaire’s summer sky. The vacation stanzas from 1913 may be read in contrast to the impending wartime lives and writings of the poets, a blue horizon of a different hue." .

More specifically, the role of internalized sexual stigma and perceived masculinity were considered to explain emotive reaction toward gay men with gender conforming and non-conforming behaviors. Results showed that effeminate gay men, that is those who enact gender non-conforming behaviors, elicited more negative emotions compared to masculine gay men both in gay and heterosexual respondents with no difference in intensity. Moreover, such negative reactions toward effeminate gay men were more extreme among gay men with high internalized sexual stigma and among heterosexuals with high self-perception of feminine traits. Implications and limitations are discussed." .

The 18.000 line poem lends itself, we believe, to a literary reading which highlights what Jacques Lacan calls the “polyphony” of poetry, its Real otherness. Basically, this article, using Lacan’s theory of the Real, will investigate how Clarel attempts to depict Real otherness, the inaccessible dimension of human experience; and how it, as all human productions, succeeded only in hinting at its presence. The article will consider, as well, the significance of gaps whether physical or linguistic in demonstrating the impossibility of comprehending the Real. Additionally, it draws on possible interpretations of the various instances of silence in the poem, and how these instances of the unspoken highlight the dumbness of the Real and its threatening nature." .

In “¿Modas o modelos?, el dandi en El extraño y La raza de Caín de Carlos Reyles,” I study Reyles’ fiction and establish that, contrary to Valera’s perception, the dandy in Reyle’s works is not a copy, but rather a genuine representation of a Spanish-American type whose formulation allows Reyles to portray an accurate representation of fin de siècle Uruguayan society." .

Departing from Walter Bagehot’s insistence on the reality and realism of finance, and surveying examples of how novels by Dickens, Balzac, Trollope, or Zola represented, or avoided representing, financial realities, I deal with the various notions of money seen either as a neutral or abstract medium facilitating wealth-creating commodity exchange or as an active but mystical agent blurring the division of fiction and fact (Mill, Marx, Simmel). After that the paper gives an overview of economic oriented literary criticism with regard to its investment in relating and/or distinguishing monetary and literary notions of fiction. The essay ends by returning to Bagehot’s argument and raises the question of the appropriation of reality by an increasingly fictitious finance, problematizing the distinction between expedient fictions and deceitful lies." .

Historically, the law has been one of the structures that has reinforced gender inequality and legitimized male seizure of women’s sexuality within and outside marriage: legally, married women had no right to sexual freedom regarding their husbands and, at the same time, non-wed women who pressed charges against white men were accused of lying and faced victim-blaming judicial practices. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Portuguese rape legislation has changed in order to recognize that sex crimes offend someone’s right to sexual self-determination. The Criminal Code has abandoned expressions like modesty and decency when referring to sex crimes, and a controversial mitigating penalty norm based on a victim’s provocative behaviour or on the relation between the accused and the plaintiff was repealed in 1995. In addition, criminal law has evolved to a gender-neutral formulation and expanded the definition of rape adopting the “all penetration” formula. Nevertheless, the discourses of Portuguese jurisprudence and doctrine reveal stereotyped images about rape victims’ behaviour and biased evaluations against women. Therefore, the ‘law in books’ must be analysed in its relation with ‘law in action’, which is unescapably influenced by doctrine and by magistrates’ individual beliefs. This paper aims to capture judicial representations of rape, rape victims and offenders. Qualitative data are used based on 20 semi-structured interviews with 18 judges and prosecutors and two attorneys. The interviews were analysed through critical discourse analysis using a feminist approach. This article is published as part of a collection on gender studies.\n" .

While texts featuring gender-variant male characters engage in topics that are far too often shoved into the proverbial closet, what is yet to be determined is the degree to which they adequately reflect the complexity of (gender) identity and to what extent such picture books can counter narratives related to traditional “masculinity.” The purpose of this paper is to critically examine picture book representations of gender variance, as exhibited by male characters, in order to determine the books’ potential for exploring issues of social justice with elementary-age students. This study utilizes a critical multiculturalist lens to challenge the ways in which gender variance is represented in children’s literature and the reasons that young gender-variant male protagonists achieve—or do not achieve—communal acceptance." .

Dieser Teil von Parsons’ Schriften wurde bisher fast vollkommen vernachlässigt — sowohl in der Sekundärliteratur zu Parsons wie in der Religionssoziologie. Ich trenne in der vorliegenden Interpretation Parsons’ spätes systemtheoretisches „human condition paradigm“ von seinen quasistrukturalistischen Analysen jüdischer und christlicher Mythen ab. Der Kern dieser Mythen ist, Parsons zufolge, die Idee des Lebens als einer Gabe. Der vorliegende Artikel analysiert die Bedeutung dieser Idee für drei Aspekte: Erstens für ein soziologisches Verständnis des Christentums; zweitens im Hinblick auf einige Aspekte zeitgenössischer Moraltheorie, insbesondere die Frage, wie die jüdischchristliche Tradition unter Bedingungen hoch entwickelter autonomer Individualität angeeignet werden kann, und drittens hinsichtlich eines verdeckten protestantischen Bias in Parsons’ Theorie sozialen Wandels." .

Medical manuals often present deafness as a physical defect, yet they also suggest how social conditions for deaf people can be transformed in lieu of treatment protocols. Fictional narratives tend to associate deafness with sin or social stigma, but they can also imagine deaf experience with a remarkable degree of sympathy and nuance. Autobiographical writing by deaf authors most vividly challenges diagnostic models of disability, exploring generative forms of perception that deafness can foster. In tracing the disruptive force that deaf experience exerts on perceived notions of textual authority, this essay reveals how medieval culture critiqued the diagnostic power of medical practitioners. Deafness does not simply function as a symptom of an individual problem or a metaphor for a spiritual or social condition; rather, deafness is a transformative capacity affording new modes of knowing self and other." .

Community members deliberately incorporated ideologies of social reform into the planning and organization of their society. Material culture served as an active medium to both reflect and reinforce utopian ideals, and community members were often keenly aware of the symbolic meanings represented in artifacts. In this way, material culture can be seen as simultaneously constituted and constitutive as well as a central focus in maintaining social cohesion. This article examines one such group, the Oneida Perfectionists, that created a socially and financially stable community that endured for more than 30 years. Their use of material culture purposefully reflected their religious ideology and functioned as a means of fostering and maintaining communitas." .

Within the study period, 324 patients had undergone 4332 procedures in which 62 of them had developed anaphylaxis. ResultsDuring the procedures, the rate of anaphylaxis was found to be 1.43 %. The rate of HA among the anaphylaxis patients was 12.9 % (8 of 62 patients). During treatments, 2 patients received adrenaline injections without any adverse reaction.

However, we can still find some Romantic poets of great importance, which illustrates the revival of Romanticism in contemporary China. Haizi, a talented poet who has been exerting great influence on contemporary and younger poets since his death, is a great example which profoundly suggests the opportunity Romanticism has and the dilemma it confronts in the cultural context of contemporary China. The intimacy between Haizi and Romanticism lies mainly in the self-positioning and self-fashioning. Haizi’s emphasis on ego, subjectivity and will, his claim of poets to be “kings,” is a quite unique phenomenon in the contemporary Chinese scene where poets are marginalized and their subjectivities are weakened by the society and even themselves. Therefore, Haizi’s poetry not only reveals its connection with Romanticism, but also the tension between the ideals of Romantic poetics and the reality of contemporary Chinese society." .

This in turn contributed to reconstitute the state as an abstract notion that nevertheless was real through the allegiance owed to it by its subjects. Addressing the making of subjecthood in relation to state formation helps fill an important lacuna in the literature on state formation, namely the double oversight of subjecthood. Either studies of state formation have taken both territory and subjecthood—the two objects of state power—for granted, or, more recently, they have assumed that changes in subjecthood were a function of changes in territoriality. I propose to address this by inquiring into early modern subjecthood in its own right, through a historical exploration of the emergence of political subjecthood in English statutes during the Tudor period (1485–1602). Through gradual yet incremental changes in the relation between subject/king and subject/state, the political subject’s allegiance to the state changed and acquired a “taken-for-grantedness”—maintained and reinforced through constant legal reiteration." .

Responding to the demands of his time, he considered such indispensable concerns as salvation, justice, community, and love, and the issue of the vernacular was undoubtedly one of the fundamental questions. He proposed, in both theoretical and creative writings, that the Italian vernacular was the most crucial problem in his contemporary culture and successfully suggested his conception of the “illustrious vernacular (vulgare illustre)”. His choice of the vernacular instead of Latin in his writings was mainly for the purpose of making his language a tool for communication with the world in which he was situated. Dante’s project for the Italian vernacular can be characterized as giving stability to the vernacular without transforming it wholly into a grammatical language. Interestingly Dante’s project starts from his consciousness of the nature of the ‘dead’ language (Latin), which is unalterable and perpetual; ironically, this is possible only through the living, organic cycle of ‘death and rebirth’, which originally belongs to the vernacular rather than Latin. Dante’s vernacular is not so much the mother tongue, if that indicates the language that a human acquires in his or her childhood at home, as a social language that is circulated and reforged as a refined literature through education and learning. The Babelic diaspora is the environment in which the so-called cosmopolitan vernacular appears and degenerates. If translating Latin into the regional vernacular does not end up by returning to the origin-Latin and deconstructing the regional vernacular itself, and if the life of the regional vernacular can last in such way as to maintain its relationship with the origin-Latin horizontally, then this vernacular can be called a cosmopolitan vernacular. Using this term is among the most persuasive ways to explain Dante’s vernacular. My aim is not so much to define Dante’s vernacular in terms of the cosmopolitan as to trace up the symptom of cosmopolitanism in it. Therefore, even if I use the term ‘cosmopolitan vernacular’, I do it only as a point to take further, implying the whole process of vernacularization or bilingual writing, which was predominant in Dante’s theoretical and creative writings." .

While text length and story content of narratives did not increase with age, syntactic complexity of narratives showed a clear developmental progression. Results from path analyses revealed that later syntactic complexity of narrative writing was, in addition to initial syntactic complexity, predicted by oral grammar, inhibition, and planning. These results are discussed in light of the changes that characterize writing development in the upper elementary grades. More specifically, this study emphasizes the relevance of syntactic complexity as a developmental marker as well as the importance of executive functions for later writing development." .

Drawing upon Jean-Jacques Lecercle’s notion of nonsense, this essay is a small attempt to examine three of Dr. Seuss’s beginner books—The Cat in the Hat, One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, and Green Eggs and Ham—along with Mikhail Bakhtin’s ideas. It argues that Bakhtin’s concepts of chronotope, carnivals and dialogism offer themselves as toolkits to illuminate the nonsensical chronotopes prevalent in Seuss’s books, including multiple mini-chronotopes, narratorial voices, and mixing of the everyday and fantasy in a dialogic way. The Seussian world in the three books is read as a collection of nonsensical chronotopes in which everyday scenes are converted into carnivalesque mini-chronotopes, parallel to the real world but having their own logics. The Seussian rhymes are also far from being monologic in nature, but are woven and constructed as a dialogic mode of discourse. Seussian nonsense texts partake in the invention of a genre by demonstrating a radical pedagogy of priming that sees a word more than a concept but also endowed with certain physicality and dialogicity. The nonsensical chronotopes also demonstrate a dialogic demand on readers, inviting them to engage with books, have fun reading, and see the world in an alternative way." .

Whereas the former primarily regards the coupling as a bad romance, the latter presents the idea that it is unequivocally harmful. This discrepancy between the two discourses surrounding sexual relationships between brothers and sisters speaks to literary fiction’s need for thwarted romances for the purposes of the literary market. A more detailed look into three novels from the corpus, Tabitha Suzuma’s Forbidden (2010), Donna Tartt’s The Secret History (1992) and Pauline Melville’s The Ventriloquist’s Tale (1997) shows how this logic of sibling incest as a bad romance works in practice." .

Nahezu unbekannt ist ihr Schrifttum, noch weniger bekannt sind ihre öffentlichen, politischen Einflussnahmen u. a. durch ihre Bücher über Prostitution oder streitbare Friedensideale. Diese werden im Rahmen dieses Artikels „wiederentdeckt“ und zeigen, wie Jane Addams den Zusammenhang zwischen Gesellschafts- bzw. Machtstruktur und Kultur aufzudecken versuchte, was sie zu einer Begründerin „kritischer Professionalität“ macht. Sie schrieb nicht nur über gesellschaftliche Missstände, sondern begründete den Internationalen Frauenkongress in Den Haag mit, in dem sie zusammen mit anderen Frauen, ihre Vorstellungen über die Beendigung von Kriegen nicht aufgrund der Sieg-versus-Niederlage-Logik, sondern durch Verhandlungen zu beenden, praktisch umzusetzen versuchte. Dies trug Jane Addams nach einem Vortrag in Carnegie Hall, New York, den Ruf als „gefährlichste Frau Amerikas“ und „Rote Gefahr“ sowie 10 Jahre Verbannung aus der Öffentlichkeit ein." .

This article considers a selection of tales about sexual relationships from her 1998 anthology of short stories, Amantes y enemigos, drawing some comparisons with her accounts of historical love affairs in Pasiones (1999). It concludes that, in these exceptionally well-crafted stories, the writer exploits the resources of the genre—its open-endings and epiphanies—both to expose romantic delusions as well as to fashion fleeting moments of transcendence. Her treatment of the theme of love in these stories is significantly more miscellaneous (and sometimes more optimistic), than in her novels and essays." .

Everything and More: A compact history of Infinity has proven difficult to reconcile with both Wallace’s fiction and non-fiction alike. This interview article aims to shed some light on the nature and construction of Everything and More. First introducing the book in context by reconstructing from Wallace’s personal letters its production, it then benefits from the unique insight of Wallace’s technical adviser on the project, mathematician-turned-philosopher Erica Neely. Over the course of the interview, Wallace’s motivations as well as his research and compositional strategy are exposed as Neely reflects on her time working with the author. This unique exposition and reflection paves the way for future dialogue about Everything and More that we may fully appreciate and understand this complex ‘oddity’ at the centre Wallace’s oeuvre." .

However, there are certain missing links in the implication-diagram among all these. The aim of this paper is to fill up these gaps by introducing three new types of covering properties in terms of semiopen and preopen sets, thereby providing a balanced and complete diagram in respect of the hierarchy of the existing and the introduced types of properties. The latter types of covering properties are characterized, and studied to some extent, and a number of non-trivial examples are given to justify non-implications. Finally, certain conditions are worked out under which such reverse implications may hold." .

Sex and sexual orientation differences in self-reported adulthood and recalled childhood indicators of depression and anxiety and their association with current and retrospectively reported gender (a)typicality were examined in a non-clinically recruited community sample of Canadian heterosexual men (n = 98), heterosexual women (n = 142), gay men (n = 289), and lesbian women (n = 69). Indicators of depression and anxiety were constructed based on diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and specific phobias. Factor reduction analyses yielded three factors: (1) indicators of childhood separation anxiety, (2) indicators of childhood depression and anxiety, and (3) indicators of adulthood depression and anxiety. Lesbian women scored higher on childhood separation anxiety than all other groups. Heterosexual men scored lower on indicators of childhood separation anxiety than gay men and lower on indicators of childhood and adulthood depression and anxiety than all other groups. No other significant group differences were observed. Correlational analysis suggested that for men, but not for women, gender-atypical behavior was associated with negative mental health. The current study indicated that childhood should be considered a critical time period during which the noted sexual orientation-related mental health discrepancies manifest and that childhood gender atypicality is a key factor for understanding the emergence of such discrepancies." .

More specifically, starting from a reinterpretation of the concepts of utopia and counter-utopia, focused on their political, literary and ethical-existential implications, this article—theoretically supported by recent reflections of Nancy, Jameson, Žižek, Vattimo and Agamben, among others—presents a critical narrative analysis of El lugar (1982) and Caza de conejos (1986), ontological novels never before read in parallel that we here propose to describe as utopias of evil. In contrast to the narrative spaces generated by classical and modern utopias and counter-utopias, which are conceived from an optimistic or ironic-satiric perspective, the narrative spaces generated in Mario Levrero’s utopias of evil shape, at the limits of nihilism, perfect and perverse kafkian representations designed for a single and radical purpose: a total, definitive, and meaningless destruction of experience. Compelled by an irrepressible death/destruction drive, this fictional mechanism operates in the construction of two different types of destruction: El lugar, marked by a movement of escape, represents the destruction of experience by means of the destruction of the subject as character in the novel; Caza de conejos, marked by a movement of persecution, represents the destruction of experience by means of the destruction of the subject as reader of the novel." .

Limited research has compared contexts of use and behaviors viewed in Internet SEM by sexual identity. The current study examined differences in recent SEM use (past 6 months) by sexual identity among an ethnically diverse sample of 821 men who completed an online survey in 2015. Both gay and bisexual men reported significantly more frequent use of Internet SEM compared to heterosexual men. Although most participants reported viewing SEM at home (on a computer, tablet, or smartphone), significantly more gay men reported SEM use at a sex party or commercial sex venue than either heterosexual or bisexual men. Sexual identity predicted viewing of high-risk and protective behaviors in separate logistic regression models. Specifically, compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men had increased odds of viewing condomless anal sex (gay OR 5.20, 95 % CI 3.35–8.09; bisexual OR 3.99, 95 % CI 2.24–7.10) and anal sex with a condom (gay OR 3.93, 95 % CI 2.64–5.83; bisexual OR 4.59, 95 % CI 2.78–7.57). Compared to gay men, heterosexual and bisexual men had increased odds of viewing condomless vaginal sex (heterosexual OR 27.08, 95 % CI 15.25–48.07; bisexual OR 5.59, 95 % CI 3.81–8.21) and vaginal sex with a condom (heterosexual OR 7.90, 95 % CI 5.19–12.03; bisexual OR 4.97, 95 % CI 3.32–7.44). There was also evidence of identity discrepant SEM viewing as 20.7 % of heterosexual-identified men reported viewing male same-sex behavior and 55.0 % of gay-identified men reported viewing heterosexual behavior. Findings suggest the importance of assessing SEM use across media types and contexts and have implications for research to address the potential influence of SEM on sexual behavior (e.g., investigate associations between viewing condomless vaginal sex and engaging in high-risk encounters with female partners)." .

Building upon recent work of feminist political ecology, I uncover a number of dualisms attached to the gender-nature nexus and put forward that gender roles are constituted by social relations which need to be analysed with regard to the transformative potential of gender-nature relations. Three main themes are at the centre of the empirical inquiry: gender subjectivities, rural off-farm employment and the human-nature nexus. I seek to show that, first, the production of gendered subjectivities cannot be simplified through essentialist assumptions that romanticise women’s relationships with nature; second, off-farm employment strategies both reinforce the social hierarchy in gender and contradict the Kuruma’s moral economies; and, finally, environmental and agrarian change redefine the use of agrobiodiversity and are related to ideas on progressive versus nonprogressive cultivation practices. The research is informed by qualitative research methods and offers a conceptual approach to the deconstruction of gender-nature relations from a poststructuralist feminist perspective." .

Case presentationWe present a case of 5-year-old Moroccan boy, who presented with torticollis for 1 month. Computed tomography scan and Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed an extradural, dumbbell-shaped mass with extra-spinal extension at the left C1–C6 level. Multiple biopsy specimens were obtained. Histological examination revealed a highly cellular neoplasm composed of diffuse sheets of tumor cells having monomorphic, round to oval, finely vesicular nuclei. Immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of intraspinal peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor. ConclusionAfter this illustrative case, we review the literature on clinicopathological and therapeutic aspects.

Even less addressed it within the Chilean educational system. The specific objective of this study was to characterize, using a comprehensive set of indicators, the quality of the vocabulary produced by Chilean 4th grade students. Based on a national writing survey, a sample of 2056 texts written by 685 students was collected (narrative, persuasive, and informative texts). Current literature defines lexical quality as a composite of diverse factors that, while distinct, are interrelated. To represent the properties of the vocabulary, a set of indicators were selected: (a) lexical diversity; (b) lexical sophistication; and (c) lexical density. Using multilevel modeling (students and schools as levels 1 and 2) to explain a global writing score we found that diversity was a significant determinant for narrative and persuasive texts, density was a significant determinant for the three genres and sophistication was a significant determinant for narrative and expository text. In addition, indicators related to gender and socioeconomic conditions were only significant determinants of narrative stories. The parts of speech most often used also varied according to the purpose of each text. In all genres, words had a short extension and were very sensitive to the input presented in the stimuli. These results imply a significant challenge to this education system: how to promote the development of vocabulary in all children in order to support language learning." .

One reason for this is that storytelling is culturally important to us, but another is that general narrative formulae have been honed over millennia and that a derived but specific filmic form has developed and has been perfected over the last century. The result is a highly effective format that allows rapid processing of complex narratives. Using a corpus analysis I explore a physical narratology of popular movies—narrational structure and how it impacts us—to promote a theory of popular movie form. I show that movies can be divided into 4 acts—setup, complication, development, and climax—with two optional subunits of prolog and epilog, and a few turning points and plot points. In 12 studies I show that normative aspects in patterns of shot durations, shot transitions, shot scale, shot motion, shot luminance, character introduction, and distributions of conversations, music, action shots, and scene transitions reduce to 5 correlated stylistic dimensions of movies and can litigate among theories of movie structure. In general, movie narratives have roughly the same structure as narratives in any other domain—plays, novels, manga, folktales, even oral histories—but with particular runtime constraints, cadences, and constructions that are unique to the medium." .

With contemporary Chinese time travel fiction as its central concern, this article pursues four major goals: (1) to uncover its dominant unnatural patterns and means of time travel, (2) to reveal its unnaturalness from such perspectives as metalepsis, prolepsis, self-contradictory narration, and multiperson narration, (3) to examine its consequences and values of being unnatural, and (4) to offer a way of naturalizing it by suggesting the intersection of unnatural narratology with ethical narratology." .

We also present a simple condition that implies the backward instability of the barycentric formula used to implement extended interpolants. Our experiments show that extended interpolants mentioned in the literature satisfy this condition and, therefore, the formula used to implement them is not backward stable. Finally, we explain that the extrapolation step is a significant source of numerical instability for extended interpolants based on extrapolation." .

His plays are read, interpreted, and performed throughout the United States and the world, and from the early seventeenth century onward, the praise bestowed on him is hyperbolic, as if he were superhuman, even divine. Biographies of Shakespeare abound and often are informative, but not about Shakespeare himself, for we know very little about his day to day activity. Biographers thus imagine and invent the life, using speculation and conjecture as substitutes for evidence and fact. We do know much about the Elizabethan and Jacobean theater and about London acting companies. We know too that for his company, Shakespeare was an actor and a sharer (an investor who shared in the profits) as well as a playwright. But none of the original scripts that Shakespeare wrote or co-wrote has survived. There are no manuscripts in Shakespeare’s hand, nor did he prepare and authenticate any of the published texts we possess. Hence we do not know for certain what the world’s greatest writer actually wrote. Shakespeare’s plays are a supreme fiction, and this more than anything explains his astonishing longevity and renown." .

Building on the work of critics like Bernard Paris, it examines Marlow as an autonomous ‘invented author’ who develops throughout his various appearances in Conrad’s work. By fusing Jérôme Meizoz’s theories on author postures with Algirdas Julien Greimas’ pragmatic semiotic square, this article investigates the construction of Marlow’s author posture in relation to the dichotomous theme Solidarity–Solitariness in Conrad’s ‘Youth’, Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance. The author argues that Marlow continually takes up a posture that is not ‘fixed’, a posture of in-betweenness with which he tries to avoid rigid socio-political structures, actively using this posture not only to locate himself in the novel’s world, but also to influence those around him. Conrad uses Marlow to examine the workings of authorship, the function and place of language in society and its effectiveness in conveying particular philosophical attitudes." .

The debate revolves around two main considerations: firstly, to what extent and how (if so) Cortázar managed to reconcile his aesthetic ideas with his ethical views; secondly, whether this reconciliation attempt meant a paradigm change in his poetics or not. These deliberations reached a culmination point and appeared in its most illuminating form in Cortázar’s last three short story compilations; particularly in those stories where the need for political and ethical engagement articulates with the fantastic, one of the predominant narrative modes in his poetics. This article examines four of these short stories as prime examples of Cortázar’s attempt to reconcile the individual metaphysical search typical of his early writings with his later political pledges. The hypothesis is that these stories actually represent an excellent instance of how he was able to achieve a harmonic symbiosis between his poetics and his politics in the last years of his life." .

These authors appeared to be more interested in internal and infectious diseases rather than in musculoskeletal disorders and orthopaedics. François Rabelais (1490–1553) was one of the most renowned humanists and philologists of the sixteenth century. He was also a physician with an interest in translating ancient texts of medical authors. Rabelais rediscovered a device for treating femoral fracture originally described by the Roman physician Galen and named as glossocomion. Since the original apparatus had some imperfections, Rabelais redesigned and modified it. This new, improved version became a model for new devices for treating femoral fracture, as also reported by the great French surgeon Ambroise Paré. For this contribution, Rabelais deserves major consideration in the history of orthopaedics and traumatology." .

In both cases, albeit in different ways, madness is regarded as a form resistance to communism (Stalin’s and Brezhnev’s), as a particular kind of sanity, and finally as a creative vocation. The relationship between madness and sanity is seen as reversible and can change depending on different perspectives—which are mostly political in the two novels. As illustrated by the two authors, the modern literary discourse on madness can be metaphorically shaped by the writer, as a generic category which can refer to various forms of resistance and deviation from the established social, political and cultural norms." .

The cemetery gives the outward appearance of rapid change in burial mode, grave goods, and grave monuments, coincident with increasing acculturative pressures. When considered within the context of written records of the Kimsquit people’s attitude to Euro-Canadian culture, the use of manufactured goods evident at associated domestic sites, and the ideology behind mortuary practices, it can be argued that there was a continuance of attitudes towards death, wealth, and descent in the mortuary complex. The patterns observed here support the position that creative changes may occur under conditions of intense colonial pressure, and they are directed by underlying structures of long-term history, such that change can be a more effective strategy towards cultural survival than extreme conservatism." .

With this in mind, it is worthwhile to examine some of the earliest literary depictions of the supernatural, and those fantastic elements whose origins are more firmly rooted in the imagination than in the observable world. The twelfth-century literary blossoming in the langue d’oïl region produced notable examples of such works, with the Alexander the Great saga among those works that were the most widely reproduced. Indeed, the Macedonian conqueror became a source of fascination for medieval clerics, his imagined deeds serving both as a model of conduct as well as a moralizing lesson on the dangers of unbridled ambition. The Roman’s unusual treatment of Alexander is striking, and the text itself is a blend of portrait, detailed travel narrative, and chanson de geste. More importantly however, the juxtaposition within the text of realistic imagery and odd, inexplicable dreamscape creates a text that mirrors the human consciousness upon awakening, trapped between the fleeting realm of night and the solid world of the senses. The goal of this study will be to show how certain passages of Alexandre de Paris’s Roman d’Alexandre mirror a dream narrative. If Alexander’s dream before adventuring east is premonitory as his dream interpreters indicate, then how should one read the adventures that follow?" .

Young men in particular are adapting to very mobile forms of existence. Navigating complex and unfamiliar urban landscapes, they must constantly interpret and adapt to changing circumstances in order to survive. Living in shifting informal urban environments, they have of necessity developed survival strategies and new behaviours, drawing on traditional beliefs combined with new urban experiential knowledge. However, while women and children are generally considered most vulnerable to the growing levels of risk associated with everyday life in densely-settled informal urban settlements, the particular vulnerabilities of the itinerant young men who live there have generally been disregarded or at best are poorly understood. This presents a critical gap in our understanding of urban risk in South Africa. Answering to a research imperative that seeks to understand the nature of the mobility of young black South African men living in informal settlements, and the vulnerabilities associated with their fluid and generally insecure livelihoods, this paper contributes a new perspective to current understandings of urban risk, presenting a review of key bodies of literature and relevant theoretical debates drawn from disparate disciplinary perspectives." .

Similarly, editors and publishers who fail to revise erroneous literature when claims are factually correct, independent of the volume of claims, are also in violation of their codes of conduct and professional responsibilities towards the scientific community and society. This essay provides a critical outlook on this issue which has begun to plague the post-publication movement in science, and which deserves urgent attention and focus." .

The tendency to reconsider parental functions can be observed in texts from different genres, but it appears most overtly in modern fairy tales which, on the one hand, link modernity with the national folkloric code but, on the other, aim to overcome the code. Unlike many contemporary Russian authors for children, who leave little narrative space for parents, Sergey Sedov makes the mother central to his “Fairy Tales About Mums.” He describes various situations in which this figure regains the depth and comprehensiveness of a Jungian Great Mother Archetype. The author combines different fairy tales, cultural stereotypes and literary themes to create the image of a new mother who possesses various roles, some of which place her in opposition to the gender stereotype of patriarchal Russian folklore. This article uses structural, typological and motive methods of analysis to trace the transformation of the mother’s image from the traditional folktale canon to determine its activity-related and axiological aspects and to analyse various manifestations of the mother in terms of the tales’ semantic and aesthetic integrity." .

Using Ingold’s notion of the “weather-world,” I consider early modern perceptions of air, temperature, and the body in order to address the various ways in which colonial landscapes were defined and shaped. Employing an analytical method known as buildings information modeling (BIM), I investigate the implications of 17th-century pit-house construction in an attempt to understand the ways in which individuals engage with an environment, constructing and dwelling through a particular way of knowing the world. This analysis ultimately demonstrates how archaeological evidence speaks to the material ways in which people manipulate their experience of place, not only to experience their surroundings, but to shape them to fit the epistemological context that creates a knowledge of place." .

Historical novels played a role in the process, especially in encouraging the development of national identity by looking for the national essence in the past, or rather creating ideas about a national essence in the medium of history. This paper analyses several late-nineteenth-century historical novels from the region (by Alois Jirásek, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Ferenc Herczeg, and Géza Gárdonyi) to show the ways fictitious traits of a supposedly reliable historical background served contemporary political and ideological needs. These traits, which can also be described as anachronisms or author’s mistakes, both contribute to characterising national ancestors as us and also historical enemies as the other." .

But despite invocations of its contemporary ‘global’ context, very few commentators engage the current crisis through the provocations of postcolonial studies. A key element of postcolonial critique draws attention to the ways in which the modern humanities and social sciences are colonially inflected traditions of knowledge production. Taking this critique as a point of departure, I aim to show that the critical response to the crisis prompted by the neoliberal agenda is inadequate in so far as there has been insufficient acknowledgement that modern liberal education wishes to suture and save a public culture that is racially exclusionary. To open up this space of inquiry, I focus on the thought and practice of Edward Blyden. Born in St Thomas, Danish West Indies, Blyden migrates to Liberia. A prolific writer and educator, Blyden delivers, in 1881, his inaugural address as President of Liberia College entitled ‘The Aims and Methods of a Liberal Education for Africans’. What lessons for the present crisis might we draw from a nineteenth century Pan-Africanist advocate of liberal education?" .

The Kallikak Family, for instance, went through eight editions between 1913 and 1931. This essay argues that the current scholarship has missed important ways that the architects of the eugenic family studies theorized and described the subjects of their investigation. Using one sparsely interrogated work (sociologist Frank Wilson Blackmar’s “The Smoky Pilgrims”) and one previously unknown eugenic family study (biologist Frank Gary Brooks’ untitled analysis of the flood-zone Oklahomans) from the Southern Plains, this essay aims to introduce “environment” as a schema that allows for how the subjects of the eugenic family study were conceptualized with respect to their surroundings. Geospatially and environmentally relevant constructions of scientific knowledge were central to the project of eugenics during its formative years, but remain largely and conspicuously absent from the critical literature which engages this project to separate the fit from the unfit in American society. The dysgenic constituted a unique human geography, giving us significant insight into how concatenations of jurisprudence as well as cultural and social worth were tied to the land." .

Our assumptions on envy levels and outside opportunities allow us to characterize a richer set of bargaining outcomes than that identified by the prior literature, which includes a novel agreement equilibrium which we label Type I agreement. As this novel agreement solution is delivered by a negotiation resembling a one-shot ultimatum game, only characteristics of the second-moving player shape the sources of bargaining power. This property contrasts with that of Type II agreement—an agreement solution previously reported by related literature—in which characteristics of both players influence negotiating strengths. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the interplay between envy, impatience rates and outside opportunities as well as the degree of inequity generated by each agreement type." .

To properly compare the results of different studies, it is necessary to conduct a systematic review of the chronological and cultural context of the skeletal series used and identify the most appropriate method to calculate stature values, since stature reconstruction formulae are specific for certain times and places. Stature variations in the population of Sardinia (a Mediterranean island now part of the Italian Republic but considered separately given its unique genetic structure) from the Neolithic to the Modern Period were studied to evaluate the intensity of millennial changes. The results were then compared with the values of coeval skeletal series reported in the literature for other Southern European countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal). We used Sardinian skeletal series with radiocarbon dates or from culturally well-defined archeological contexts. The osteometric measurements were taken on femora of adults who had completed growth and who did not present evident pathological conditions. The data we collected and analyzed indicate that the conditions are lacking to reliably identify a common trend in millennial changes among the considered populations of southern Europe." .

The philosophers of the Enlightenment freed it of the historic wrappings of Christian eschatology and the notion of Providence itself by rationalising the idea of progress, the possible improvement of Mankind and the terrestrial city that stemmed from it. Making use of the Renaissance, the utopian authors transformed spiritual preparation for the end of time into a view of material, earthly delight made possible by science and scientific research. This ideal was certainly embodied in Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, although Thomas More was the first of all. In passing from work on consciousness to that of the spirit, the utopians of the eighteenth century espoused Reason and soon turned the future into something much more than critical discourse: It became social opportunity, a new political framework. Audaciously shifting the utopia of “elsewhere” (u-topos) to “the future” (u-chronos) in the manner of Louis-Sébastien Mercier or Marquis de Condorcet, the utopians pursued a programme relying on scientific promise: Identify the technological processes of the transformation of reality and spread the word, an aim which would give birth to a new, less discursive, more popular genre—science fiction." .

The last analog terrestrial broadcast is expected to be switched off in the early 2020s. This transition presents huge energy savings opportunities that have thus far been ignored. Digital TV switchovers have likely increased energy consumption as countries have completed transitions by providing digital TV converters to analog TV users, which increase energy consumption and extend the life of energy-inefficient analog TVs. We find that if analog TVs were retired at the time of a digital switchover and replaced with super-efficient flat-panel TVs, such as light-emitting diode (LED) backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs, there is a combined electricity savings potential of 32 terawatt hours [TWh] per year in countries that have not yet completed their digital TV transition. In view of these findings as well as the dramatic drops of super-efficient TV prices and the unique early-retirement opportunity resulting from cessation of terrestrial analog broadcasts, TV-exchange programs would easily and substantially advance energy efficiency." .

Voice command usually appears as a popular human–machine interface for communication. Unfortunately, deaf people cannot exchange information from robots through vocal modalities. To interact with deaf people effectively and intuitively, it is desired that robots, especially humanoids, have manual communication skills, such as performing sign languages. Without ad hoc programming to generate a particular sign language motion, we present an imitation system to teach the humanoid robot performing sign languages by directly replicating observed demonstration. The system symbolically encodes the information of human hand–arm motion from low-cost depth sensors as a skeleton motion time-series that serves to generate initial robot movement by means of perception-to-action mapping. To tackle the body correspondence problem, the virtual impedance control approach is adopted to smoothly follow the initial movement, while preventing potential risks due to the difference in the physical properties between the human and the robot, such as joint limit and self-collision. In addition, the integration of the leg-joints stabilizer provides better balance of the whole robot. Finally, our developed humanoid robot, NINO, successfully learned by imitation from human demonstration to introduce itself using Taiwanese Sign Language." .

MethodsAfter a PubMed/Medline search with “atretic cephalocele” in April 2016, we retrieved 42 articles, 41 of which were relevant with the topic. Full texts of accessible articles and abstracts of inaccessible articles were read comprehensively. References of retrieved articles were manually searched. Additional 29 articles reporting the cases of atretic, rudimentary, occult, or sequestered cephaloceles were accessed, since these terms have been used interchangeably in the literature. ResultsMedian age and mean age of the patients were 1 and 6.69 years, respectively. Female/male ratio was 1.03:1. Atretic cephaloceles were located in different regions, in decreasing order of frequency: parietal (55 %; n = 105), occipital (37 %; n = 71), parieto-occipital (n = 8), frontal (n = 4), asterion (n = 1), and sincipital (n = 1). Concomitant central nervous system (CNS) anomalies were present in 73.3 % of patients with parietal atretic cephaloceles and in 32.4 % of patients with occipital atretic cephaloceles (p < 0.0001). We realized that all patients with worse outcomes had concomitant CNS anomalies (100 %), whereas only 48 % of those with good clinical outcomes had concomitant anomalies (p = 0.0248). ConclusionsAtretic cephaloceles present as nodular extrusions on the parietal and occipital regions. Concomitant CNS anomalies, which impair the clinical outcomes, are more common in patients with parietal ACs. Observation-only approach is enough in patients with asymptomatic ACs. However, life-long follow-ups are required, because of recurrence after the surgery." .

We have applied a non-invasive, rapid, high definition X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping technique to a French Impressionist painting using a synchrotron radiation source, and show how this technology can advance scholarly art interpretation and preservation. We have obtained detailed technical understanding of a painting which could not be resolved by conventional techniques. Here we show 31.6 megapixel scanning XRF derived elemental maps and report a novel image processing methodology utilising these maps to produce a false colour representation of a “hidden” portrait by Edgar Degas. This work provides a cohesive methodology for both imaging and understanding the chemical composition of artworks, and enables scholarly understandings of cultural heritage, many of which have eluded conventional technologies. We anticipate that the outcome from this work will encourage the reassessment of some of the world’s great art treasures." .

Prenant appui sur les affinités ludiques entre texte et vampire, notre analyse comparée explore d’abord le poids de la tradition littéraire du motif, et ce depuis les auteurs de l’Antiquité aux écrivains modernes, par l’entremise de l’intertextualité. Ensuite, c’est la topographie imaginaire qui retient notre attention: l’histoire de la Hongrie au XXe siècle s’articule autour de deux grands axes vampiriques qui s’inscrivent dans une démarche de déconstruction identitaire. Enfin, l’interrogation tourne autour de la question de l’immortalité: quelle que soit la teneur idéologique des œuvres, la principale préoccupation du vampire hongrois consiste à soigner sa postérité. L’émergence tardive du vampire dans les lettres magyares résulte de la forte intellectualisation d’un monstre érotique." .

While censorship is practiced across the political spectrum, the greatest threat to free expression comes from the Theocratic Right, The largest category of material targeted by this movement is queer expression. Present censorship efforts are rooted in a long-standing American tradition of hostility to art and to dissenting voices. The five principal areas in which queer expression is censored are: (I) state and federal cultural agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts; (II) public education, school curricula, and public libraries; (III) higher education; (IV) print, broadcast, and digital media; (V) arts and entertainment. The progress the Theocratic Right is making in narrowing the limits to speech is often abetted by unholy alliances with the Left. Anti-censorship organizations exist, but have thus far been insufficient to turn the tide." .

This country shared with other European countries their fascination about his two most widespread burlesque writings, the Buscón and the Sueños, translated into the main European languages since their publication in the 17th century. Together with some political works, also published in English—Marco Bruto or lucianesque prose like Discurso de todos los diablos and La Fortuna con seso—, his Política de Dios, which became a best-seller, was well known: its first part was translated in 1715, transformed in a sort of antidote against Whig and Tory parties; and the second one, in 1720, turned into an allegation against “tyrant and atheist” politicians, disciples of the Satanic Machiavelli. This article examines the strategies of the English translation of the second part in order to increase the anti-Machiavellism of Quevedo’s work, and to adapt it to the peculiar political and religious circumstances in England during the first decades of the 18th century. This analysis is preceded by a triple contextualization of the English version: the wide circulation of the Spanish writer’s literature in Europe, Machiavelli’s reception in the English culture, and Quevedo’s own position, always fluctuating and ambiguous when facing the Florentine theorist. This paper allows for getting to know the unsuspected “anti-Machiavellian instant” that Quevedo’s work experienced through Christian Politicks, slanted English version of his Política de Dios against the “state outrage”." .

Since then, its poor and working-class citizens have struggled for power in a variety of ways. A relational view of the paternalist system posits that power structures are composed of relationships between people, classes, and the means of production. Written statements from the past are important sources of information about class and poverty, but the authors of such statements tend to be from the middle or upper classes. The archaeological record provides another line of evidence for understanding poverty. Artifacts and features from the Mackey site (18BC164) illustrate some of the material strategies that people used to navigate the complex and changing class system at the turn of the 20th century. Understanding these strategies has implications for the contemporary community, which bases many planning decisions on its understanding of Hampden’s past." .

In this sense it is equated with metafiction, and regarded as a sophisticated and highly self-conscious use of narrative; here, however, I offer a contrary view of reflexiveness, one which sees it as elementary, pervasive, and constitutive of fictionality. In this view, there is a continuity between the basic logic of mimesis and the self-conscious “baring of the device” that, for the Russian Formalists, defines the literary. I begin by clarifying the nature of (fictive) representation as an act, and identify its intrinsic reflexiveness, and go on to compare this perspective with both the metafictional notion of reflexiveness and the theoretical discourse on reflexiveness around “mirror neurons” in cognitive literary studies. I then situate reflexiveness within a broader interdisciplinary environment, framed by complex systems science and the conceptualization of emergence in terms of representational recursiveness, which allows the two sides of the discussion so far to be understood as complementary aspects of reflexiveness, one of which aligns with the cultivation of (self-) consciousness, the other with the simple enactment of systemic relations. Finally I address the conceptual challenge presented by an account of narrative, and fiction, based upon reflexiveness, and suggest some ways in which it can be understood." .

They claim that in unlikely circumstances these fictions can turn out to be accidentally true. On the contrary, I argue in this paper that fictionality and truth are incompatible.

MethodsA 15-week quasi-experimental design was conducted to investigate the learning outcomes. After conducting cluster algorithms, heterogeneous learning clusters (experimental group; n = 43) and non-heterogeneous learning clusters (control group; n = 43) were derived for a medical humanities literature study. Before and after the intervention, an Empathy Scale in Patient Care (ES-PC), a critical thinking disposition assessment (CTDA-R), and a reflective writing test were administered to both groups. ResultsThe findings showed that on the empathy scale, significant differences in the “behavioral empathy,” “affective empathy,” and overall sections existed between the post-test mean scores of the experimental group and those of the control group, but such differences did not exist in “intelligent empathy.” Regarding critical thinking, there were significant differences in “systematicity and analyticity,” “skepticism and well-informed,” “maturity and skepticism,” and overall sections. As for reflective writing, significant differences existed in “ideas,” “voice and point of view,” “critical thinking and representation,” “depth of reflection on personal growth,” and overall sections, but not in “focus and context structure” and “language and conventions.” ConclusionThis study outlined an alternative for using heterogeneous cluster grouping in reflective writing about medical humanities literature to facilitate interdisciplinary cooperation to provide more humanizing medical care." .

Numerous indications suggest that indifference about the mixing of exact history and imaginary facts becomes a more and more dated attitude at the end of sixteenth century. I will examine three different cases: an epic by Luis de Zapata, Carlo famoso (1566), The Agatonphile by Jean-Pierre Camus (1620) and Gilles Ménage’s annotations of Tasso’s Aminta. The question of distinguishing fact from fiction in these works appears as particularly urgent and interacts with interpretation on several levels. The question is if one identifies, in more or less explicit ways, the criteria of the fictitious in the texts; furthermore, all three authors would like to impose on their readers a proper interpretation of their work, or the work of Tasso in the case of Ménage. What are the motivations, the conceptual means and the results of these three authors’ attempts to highlight the status of their work, and consequently, the very nature of fiction?" .

However, spine extra-osseous chordoma (SEC) with a better prognosis than the classic type has been neglected. According to our literature review, only several case reports have been published in English literatures. Here in this article, three cases of SEC, plus a literature review, are presented. Case presentationThree cases of SEC were presented from our center. Surprisingly, neurologic tumors were considered as the first diagnosis. Thereafter, en bloc resection was performed in all the three cases. Especially, the dumbbell-shaped one in the cervical spine was removed by en bloc through the combined anterior and posterior approach for the first time. Follow-up within 12–58 months after surgeries proved no recurrence or metastasis. ConclusionsSpine extra-osseous chordoma, commonly located in the cervical and epidural region, is extremely rarely met. SEC is characterized with less aggressiveness, the lower rate of recurrence and metastasis, and better prognosis than those of the osseous origin. Though complete excision can be achieved generally, differential diagnosis of spine neurogenic tumors and the following en bloc resection should be made as carefully as possible." .

Pharmacoeconomic analyses offer one method of demonstrating a product’s value, yet there is a lack of resources specific to US drug costs relevant to each stakeholder. The aim of this study was to review current US drug costs (post-ACA). A literature review aimed at finding evidence on outpatient prescription drug costs was performed using the following sources: PubMed, governmental agencies, news websites, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) website, and Google Scholar. Articles were limited to those published in the years “2010–2016” and the “English” language, and those that described drug acquisition costs, reimbursement costs, and rebates or discounting for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payors. The Drug Cost Focus Group (DCFG) was convened to supplement the literature review; the DCFG provided their expertise on US drug costs and emerging issues affecting drug costs. ACA legislation increased drug rebates for manufacturers participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Acquisition costs commonly referred to in the literature include the wholesale acquisition cost and average manufacture price. Drugs reimbursed by Medicaid are currently based on the actual acquisition cost and ACA-Federal Upper Limit. Evidence suggests that reimbursement methods in the public market are varied. Current gaps in the literature regarding commercial insurers’ drug costs (post-ACA) present barriers to the application of relevant drug costs to pharmacoeconomic analyses." .

Results from Experiment 1 showed that the interference effect of size and shape on word naming accuracy and latency was robust for all readers. Likewise, results from Experiment 2 showed a broad interference effect of scrambled letters on word naming; however, scrambled letters appeared less disruptive to word naming among Chinese readers compared to their Korean and native English speaking counterparts. Taken together, Chinese speakers were less efficient in recognizing atypical words at the sublexical level, but more efficient at the lexical level." .

Pierre’s Vernon God Little (2003) has been characterized by comparisons with two canonical literary antecedents: J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye (1991/1951) and, at a greater remove, Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884). The three novels capitalize on the subversive potential of disaffected teenage narrators, whose compelling vernacular voices, and distinctive position as outsiders in the adult world, are powerful tools for social critique. This article offers an analysis of the continuities and discontinuities in the narrative tradition that links Vernon Little to Huckleberry Finn via the pivotal figure of Holden Caulfield, who is widely considered as the original, unsurpassed model of adolescent rebelliousness in modern literature. Grounded in an extensive exploration of the history of reception of the three texts, this study proceeds to highlight and explore the wider implications of Pierre’s provocative twist on his predecessors’ narrative template. Significantly, this deliberate departure is overlooked in most reviews of Vernon God Little—an omission which testifies to our deep investment in the idea of teenagers as liminal figures between childhood and adulthood, and thus still relatively untainted by worldly corruption. Paradoxically, the persistence of this romanticized view of adolescence coexists with much less idealized representations of young people, especially in the media. This particular contradiction is tentatively teased out in a brief coda to the main argument, with reference to another idiosyncratic adolescent narrator who has managed to capture the popular imagination in recent years: Christopher Boone in Mark Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time (2003). Although his connection with Salinger’s text is less immediately obvious than Vernon’s, in some ways Christopher is a more legitimate heir to Holden Caulfield than Pierre’s protagonist." .

The goal of the present study was to explore source credibility as one such text factor. In Experiment 1, we established the utility of a set of refutation texts in influencing knowledge revision. Participants read ten refutation and ten control texts. The participants had faster reading times and higher posttest scores for the refutation than for the control texts, providing evidence for knowledge revision. In Experiment 2, we examined the influence of source credibility under normal reading conditions. Participants read 20 refutation texts, ten with high-credibility and ten with low-credibility sources. The reading times and posttest scores suggested that knowledge revision unfolded successfully, independent of credibility. Using the same texts, in Experiment 3 we examined the influence of direct instructions that made the credibility of the source of information more salient. When the credibility of the source was made salient, the revision process was disrupted in the low-credibility condition, as evidenced by slower reading times and lower posttest scores than in the high-credibility condition. The results add to our understanding of the factors that constrain knowledge revision during the reading of refutation texts, and are discussed in the context of the extant literature and KReC." .

These identities are those of the ‘bad’, ‘mad’, or ‘sad’ woman. Drawing upon and critiquing statutes, case law, and sentencing remarks from England and Wales, I explore how singular narrative identities emerge for the female defendants concerned. Using examples from selected cases, I highlight how the judiciary interpret legislation, use evidence, and draw upon gender stereotypes in carefully constructing macro-narratives which produce gendered identities for filicidal women, thus nullifying the challenge these women pose to appropriate femininity and the motherhood mandate. Each of the narrative identities discussed deny the agency of the female defendants that they are attached to, albeit in subtly different ways, by denying their ability to make any degree of choice in relation to their filicidal actions. Although such identity construction and agency denial may not always be damaging to these filicidal women per se, its pervasiveness within legal discourse reinforces and reproduces damaging gender stereotypes surrounding women and femininity." .

It attempts to get at larger questions of method in pastoral theology through the concrete subject matter of how I (and others) go about writing, illustrating in both content and procedure key methodological assumptions that guide work in pastoral theology, such as reflexivity, concern for the daily, demand to perform well the practice we study, and commitment to deeper transformation. I argue, among other things, that writers (in pastoral theology and beyond) manage the challenge and lure of writing through intentional crafting of everyday patterns in time and space. Ultimately, the material disciplines of writing open up into important vocational and spiritual questions and habits." .

The present content analysis examines the literature to which children are being exposed in six preschools in southern Sweden, focusing on the prevalence of female versus male main and title characters in the literature that both children and teachers are choosing to read in group story times. Chi-square tests of the data (618 times that books were read in class) reveal a significant under-representation of female main and title characters in the books being read. A correlation is also found between the gender of the child and the gender of the main and title characters of the books that children choose to read. These results are consistent with previous research from other countries. Despite Sweden being hailed as one of the most gender equal countries in the world and gender equality being one of the core values of the Swedish preschool curriculum, stories about the lives of girls are significantly under-represented. The results have important implications for children and those who work with them. Literature can influence identity formation because it provides insights into society’s values as well as the gendered social world. The under-representation of females in cultural products reinforces the idea that girls and their stories are less important than boys and their stories." .

Specifically, it argues that from an early Confucian perspective, resentment (yuan 怨) is a frustration or anger that occurs when those close to us withhold their care or when they otherwise injure us. Stated succinctly, resentment is a result of frustrated desire for affection. It is a sign that we require the care of significant others, and that we are vulnerable to their concern or neglect. When understood appropriately, resentment signals genuine recognition of meaningful relationships; it is a sign that we are affected by those that ought to matter to us. Importantly, resentment has a creative dimension in that it can lead to the production of literature aimed to channel frustrated desire toward realizing the Confucian dao 道. These texts work to connect the author’s resentment with the reader’s possibility of remaking the world in a way desired by the author." .

The coupling method was developed to be active according to literature, however further work and investigation is needed to be applicable for NBJ discharged into other ambient environments and especially in cases where the background values of ambient flow and concentrations affect the NF values and vice versa. The integrated model was validated with data from the literature as well as with data from experiments conducted in this study showing a good agreement. The coupling algorithm was also compared to other coupling techniques used in the literature for NBJ discharges showing better estimations of the experimental data." .

For Anderson, the novel and the newspaper narrate worlds readers can easily locate in the extratextual world. Yet this world is itself partly created by the two genres. Using shifters such as we and today, the genres designate their own reception, which depends on their circulation: the nation is comprised of whoever uptakes the shifters.

Such a combined approach allows for a rigorous investigation into this field of research in a more scientific and objective way. Based on this approach, we identify (1) distinctive features of ethical sourcing studies such as growth trends and content issues; (2) important articles that have played a significant role in developing this field; (3) evolutionary paths that show how its knowledge has been created and transferred; (4) emerging trends that have received growing attention in the recent literature; (5) main research areas that underlie the entire ethical sourcing studies; and (6) major implications that need to be pursued in future research.

His distanced, calm sketches of the front—he served as a solider there—matched the trend of the time toward realism. The Cossacks (1863), on which Tolstoy spent ten years, disappointed the realist critics, however, with its Romantic love story and naive admiration of nature. In later years, Boris Eikhenbaum altered this prevailing view of Tolstoy’s novel, arguing that it was essentially a parody of Romanticism. Exploring ground between these two poles of interpretation of The Cossacks, this paper attempts to clarify how Tolstoy rejected the clear demarcation between Romanticism and realism, falsehood and reality. His novel demonstrates that “realism” need not be reduced to mimetic relationship between representation and object; false fancy also has its own reality, which influences and manipulates the protagonist." .

The problems that firms have with regard to managing cultural diversity have been abundantly studied in recent decades from the perspectives of management theory and moral philosophy, but there are still open questions that require deeper reflection and broader empirical analysis. Managing cultural diversity in organisations is of prime importance because it involves harmonising different values, beliefs, credos and customs, and, in essence, human identity. Taking into consideration these cultural differences and harmonising them is a human rights issue (UNDP, Cultural liberty in today’s diverse world, 2004) and a central dimension of corporate social responsibility. Here we are going to focus on theoretical reflection about the ideas that lie behind corporate policies and organisational initiatives that deal with cultural diversity. The aim of our paper is twofold: to present a critical reflection on the ideology of tolerance, and propose an ideology of respect for dealing with cultural diversity. We start by presenting the plurality of interpretations of the concept of ideology, and justify its applicability to the field of cultural diversity. We then reflect on the differences between “tolerance” and “respect” and identifying the practical implications for managing cultural diversity. And finally, we propose a culture of respect that goes beyond tolerance and complements and legitimizes the “business case” perspective for managing cultural diversity in companies. The ideology of respect is based on the Kantian tradition and on the discursive approach where rational dialogue and argumentation are considered the legitimate process for creating a culture of intercultural respect. From this theoretical discussion of the key philosophical concepts we can suggest some general principles for managing cultural diversity in organisations." .

It examines these primary texts not only to see how such characters are represented but also to see whether they either bolster or challenge the idea of the female being viewed as the male's ‘Other’. A brief historical and cultural contextualisation of the relationship between mentally ill females and the male-centric profession of modern psychiatry is followed by a close analysis of four primary texts, analysing visual narratives of mentally ill female characters in two picture books, an illustrated book and a graphic novel, noting how contemporary visual depictions contrast with early ideas and images supporting the nineteenth-century feminisation of madness. The conclusion is that, from the limited selection of texts analysed, contemporary children’s visual texts represent a clear contrast to the historical image of the frail and winsome madwoman. The findings are that they do not uphold the image of the female madwoman as Other." .

Literarische Texte lassen sich unter ganz verschiedenen Blickwinkeln betrachten. Der vorliegende Beitrag skizziert eine Geschichte der Epilepsie in der deutschsprachigen Literatur seit der Epoche der Aufklärung. Schriftsteller haben die verschiedensten Gründe, Epilepsie zu erwähnen, denen aber immer künstlerische und keine medizinischen Absichten zugrunde liegen. Zu den Besonderheiten der deutschsprachigen Literatur gehört, dass sich anders als in einigen Nachbarliteraturen die Realisten des 19. Jh.s kaum für Epilepsie interessiert haben, während sich ausgehend von Lichtenberg und Jean Paul eine satirische Tradition entwickelt hat, die es in anderen Literaturen so nicht gibt. Das Dritte Reich ist ein eigenes Thema sowohl wegen der Schicksale der jüdischen Autoren Georg Hermann, Joseph Roth und Ernst Weiß als auch der Bedrohung von Epilepsiekranken durch Zwangssterilisation und Mord. In der deutschen und den meisten Literaturen der Gegenwart gibt es ein großes Interesse an Epilepsie, wobei erfreulicherweise an die Stelle von Schwächemetaphern zunehmend attraktive und selbstständige Romanfiguren treten. Meistens wird heute von Autoren, die nicht aus eigener Anschauung schöpfen können, Epilepsie angemessen recherchiert, aber weiterhin nur selten als behandelbare Krankheit dargestellt, mit einer medikamentösen Behandlung, die überwiegend als sinnloser, von Nebenwirkungen behafteter medizinischer Selbstzweck erscheint." .

Among her major projects, she has published several volumes of poetry, a number of music albums, and most recently Daher applied an innovative method of ‘sampling,’ reminiscent of HipHop producers such as DJ Shadow or The Avalanches to produce a volume of text and picture collages entitled Und auch nun, gegenüber dem Ganzen – dies (2014). Each collage relies on the textual (and pictorial) material of just one literary review taken from the literary supplement of the most recent edition of a German weekly newspaper. Although Daher is aware of each text as the most recent part of sequence that stretches back through the literary review, the reviewed novel, and the novelist’s source material, she recognises that this structure is mere illusion. To describe the completed collage, I invoke the theoretical framework of the palimpsest, for the collage is less a succession of parts than it is a structure of co-existence. Like the influential cut-up artist, William S. Burroughs, Lydia Daher further recognises that the surface structure closely mirrors the palimpsest of human perception." .

It dubs his method “ethical anthropology” because his most important contribution is to problematize our understanding of goods, treating them as cultural products that acquire whatever meaning they have via social construction and so must be interpreted. This suggests that political theorists must base their arguments for distributive principles on contestable social inquiry into meaning. In demonstrating this, the paper argues that critics have blurred Walzer’s claim that societies share an understanding of the meaning of particular goods with the argument that social meaning should determine distribution. It concludes that Walzer’s method is a powerful challenge to universalistic theories of justice and to analytic political theory more broadly." .

Yizhar, one of the canonical writers of Modern Hebrew literature, published six books of non-fiction and numerous articles. These writings, which deal mainly with education and literature, are barely mentioned in the diverse and extensive research on Yizhar, which focuses on his fictional works. Through an investigation of his non-fictional writings, this article will seek to shed new light on Yizhar’s position as a cultural critic and on a central issue in his works in general: the tension between the individual and society. The article will suggest three main arguments: 1) There is a significant parallelism between Yizhar’s view on education and his view on literature — namely, just as the internal world of the individual student is constantly threatened by outer forces, so, too, a work of fiction is threatened constantly from without by critics, academic researchers, etc; 2) His claims and the nature of his analysis testify to the fact that he perceives society as an uncontrollable entity that can be neither changed nor understood; 3) Yizhar’s perception of society (and, accordingly, his relation to it) is more complex than what seems to be reflected in his fictional works, at least according to the common readings of them. Yizhar’s world contains not only a vast and impenetrable social framework, but also an interpersonal and intimate sphere, and the distinction between the two is at the foundation of all of his thinking." .

Problem statementEbola was first identified in Sudan and Zaire in 1976. Since then, there have been sporadic episodes, but the recent outbreak in West Africa, officially declared on March 22, 2014, has been the worst ever. In the three countries most affected (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), Sierra Leone has recorded the most cases. In February 2015, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that nearly 9729 people died from the Ebola virus disease in six countries; Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the USA, and Mali, with more than 23,943 cases identified. Little has been done to examine the role of traditional and cultural practices in the spread of Ebola in these regions. MethodThis research uses the case study approach of a small group of community leaders in Sierra Leone and secondary data to arrive at thematic inferences. ConclusionThe study proposes that traditional and cultural methods of caring for loved ones infected by Ebola enhance the spread of the virus. ImplicationsThe study recommends that changing these practices will significantly reduce the spread of future Ebola outbreaks." .

Therefore the relationship of literature to the social and political change promoting racial equality has to be elastic in the boundaries that critical scholarship formulates. Black identity and the struggle beyond formal civic rights therefore serve as markers for how fiction and poetry might be understood and appreciated in reflecting, if not necessarily promoting, a more just American society." .

Some journals specifically ask that the authors list their contributions on the title page. However, whether this requirement is useful remains unclear. The present study was to elucidate the author number trend over the past 10 years in four major gastroenterology journals. Four major journals in gastroenterology (Gastroenterology, Gut, Journal of Hepatology and Hepatology) between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2014 were searched. We limited the papers to basic research. The average number of authors of papers published in each journal were calculated and any changes in author numbers over the search period were compared. We found that Gastroenterology and Gut began to require the authors to list contributions in 2010 and Journal of Hepatology and Hepatology did the same in 2012. We therefore also investigated whether authorship numbers changed in studies published in Gastroenterology and Gut before and after 2010, and before and after 2012 in Journal of Hepatology and Hepatology. There has been an increase in author numbers over the past 10 years. This number was significantly increased in the papers published between 2010 and 2014 compared with those between 2005 and 2009 (p < 0.05 in all of the four journals). Author contribution requirements have not deterred the trend of increasing author numbers. The number of authors in basic science papers are increasing; the new requirement of listing authorship contributions has not affected this trend." .

We then translate their theory into concrete propositions and thereby bring it closer to empirical testing. Taking a subsidiary-network perspective, we expand the authors’ work by combining network and entrepreneurship literature and theoretically deducting positive effects of networks on subsidiary entrepreneurial orientation. This yields entirely new insights and a more holistic view of the effects of subsidiary networks." .

We show that most of the current thinking regarding sexual desire is founded upon these previous models and that, in reality, the development of this construct has progressed little over the past quarter century. The relatively recent notion of low sexual desire as being a problem or even dysfunction is considered, as we, in the final section, attempt not only to synthesize the many perspectives of this construct but also to discuss its future direction." .

Appearing as a “short story” but in the form of a schoolboy’s spontaneous scripts and absent-minded scratches, it presents everything naturalistically in a non-fictional mode. By presenting trivial characters and uneventful happenings in random pieces that constitute a new form of narrative, its author artfully shows rather than tells that life is more realistic in the eyes of a child and is richer, more colorful and meaningful in fragments. With newness on almost all levels of linguistic and narrative presentation, the story practices eventful narration in process narration by interweaving fragments into a highly coherent discourse of fictional narrative. While there is hardly a theme or obvious message in most of the individual pieces, the story as a whole implies undertones of the satire on many aspects of school and family life. This avant-garde literary experiment not only refreshes the reader’s schema of literature and adds to their experience of literary reading, but also contributes to the making of postmodern fiction by enriching the concept of narrative, the definition of narrativity, and ultimately the notion of literature." .

In this paper, we introduce a general class of nonlinear augmented Lagrangian functions for constrained optimization problem. In two different cases, we present sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of global saddle points. Moreover, as corollaries of the two results above, we not only obtain sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of global saddle points of some special types of augmented Lagrangian functions mentioned in the literature, but also give some weaker sufficient conditions than the ones in the literature. Compared with our recent work (Wang et al. in Math Oper Res 38:740–760, 2013), the nonlinear augmented Lagrangian functions in this paper are more general and the results in this paper are original. We show that some examples (such as improved barrier augmented Lagrangian) satisfy the assumptions of this paper, but not available in Wang et al. (2013)." .

But what are the entities that serve as such instances? According to the orthodox view, these entities are primarily inscriptions—concrete texts written or printed on something or displayed on the screen of some electronic device. In this paper, I argue that this view is misguided, since (a) well-formed instances of a novel must manifest certain sonic properties, but (b) such properties cannot be manifested by inscriptions. As an alternative, I put forward the view that the entities that serve as well-formed instances of novels are readings and sums of readings and graphic elements." .

At the same time an acknowledgement of episodes such as slavery and colonialism are asked for. This article investigates the tension that results with those two appeals to history in the literary representation of the black pages of history in children’s books. It analyses the strategies used to allow children to identify with a contemporary view on this aspect of history. The Netherlands serves as a case study. Five literary strategies are discerned, placing the books on a scale from national heroization to national alienation: monophonic accounts of Western superiority, child protagonists as mediators between past and present, polyphony, multitemporality and narrative alienation." .

In many parts of Africa, private sector investment is concentrated in the extractive industries, especially oil and gas projects. Africa’s emerging oil economies entail new institutional configurations, or what Michael Watts called an “oil complex,” that challenge antecedent norms and forms of identity. In this article, I describe the expectations, desires, and experiences of three distinct groups of men—those who found temporary employment on the project, those who continued to make a living from farming while contending with land expropriation, and those who migrated to oil field towns in search of work—to make three general points about the oil complex and masculinities in Chad. The structure of the global oil industry meant that local men who found jobs on the project could act as breadwinners and patriarchs, but only temporarily; local workers struggled post-employment with their exclusion from the possibilities associated with the project. Men who never found jobs continued to eke out a living from the land, but state-of-the-art policies governing land expropriation led simultaneously to conflict in families and greater economic interdependence among family members. Finally, in the low-media environment of the oil field region, ideas and images about sex, sexuality, and love emanating from the transient and hyper-masculine global oil industry workforce served as models for landless young men who migrated to oil field towns and who, in the absence of work, sought to transform themselves into objects of desire through the mediation of pharmaceuticals." .

Commonly overshadowed by its more recent and more popular 1942 version—known as The Boxcar Children—this earlier edition calls attention to the original cultural context of Warner’s classic text. Initially written in and for a different era, The Box-Car Children invites a reconsideration of the book’s aim, intent, and original audience. While the narrative is now routinely viewed through the lens of the Great Depression, it was actually a product of the Jazz Age. This alternative historical backdrop alters the socio-political issues that were bearing upon The Box-Car Children while it was being written and, as a consequence, with which it was originally engaging. An awareness of the role that these topics play in the conception and construction of Warner’s classic American story changes the way we view, discuss, and teach the text." .

Analyses were based on a national probability sample of 563 Māori (355 women, 208 men) who participated in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. Results showed that Māori with a higher level of cultural efficacy were less likely to be enrolled in KiwiSaver (a State sponsored savings initiative designed to encourage New Zealanders to save for their retirement). At the same time cultural efficacy was linked to an increased positive expectation of future financial security. We propose that this demonstrates resilience of collectivist cultural values among some Māori despite a history of British colonisation. It is proposed that the Māori world view remains holistic, and understandings of economic well-being for Māori need to be expanded to recognise these cultural orientations. The role of Māori identity for economic behaviour is discussed." .

However, in the past few decades, an increasing number of Irish women writers have articulated their grievances against the inferiority of women and the disempowerment of female writing. This paper aims to probe the marginalized female voice by reading Eavan Boland’s poetry. Textual analysis aside, Boland’s critical essays on the lives of Irish women, collected in Object Lessons (1994), will be discussed. The aim of the study is to help shed light on the plight of Irish women and the efforts made by Boland to unsettle the poetic tradition in ever-changing contemporary Ireland." .

French humanist poets Clément Marot and Joachim Du Bellay exploit this ambivalent and topical figure to emulate and displace as authors Virgil and Ovid (Aeneid III–IV; Heroides VII). Beyond translation as transcription (traductio), the poetic, political and ethical appropriations penned by Marot and Du Bellay reveal clear ties to translatio studii et imperii. In Marot’s Epistre de Maguelonne (1532) and Du Bellay’s verse triptych centred on Dido (1552), traditional points of praise and blame are subverted and displaced, while conflicting themes and ends surround the polysemy of translatio and the related question of poetic authority in the French sixteenth century. Pagan love, the locus of strong ambivalence (mad vs. virtuous), is transmuted. A dynamic of conversion (Marot) and compensation (Du Bellay) emerges. It bolsters a new French appropriation of ancient models driven by fantasies of moral superiority, political autonomy, literary legitimacy (minors/auctores), and individual mastery. More generally, the interplay between poetic creation, power, and displacement, offers a glimpse into how ambitious vernacular translations frame and appropriate major works." .

Parallel Stories (2005) promises and delivers even more; at the expense, though, of challenging its readers even further. In this article I concentrate on the novel’s poetic structure; its representation of the individual versus the communal; and one of its deepest organizing principles, human sensuality. One of the characteristics that sets this novel apart from contemporary literature is Nadas’s use of spatiality. What readers of Western narratives are accustomed to is a kind of unity that is anchored in the principle of the causal and the temporal. Both are important for Nádas, too, but they simply structure the novel thematically. On a poetic level, the novel’s characteristic features are the parallels it contains, and those “structural principles” through which the ingredients interact. It is the tension resulting from the metonymic interconnectedness of the (parallel) stories in the book that provides the base of its most fundamental structural coherence. The question and the representation of individuality is another key concern of the novel. Nádas represents the significant dates of 1938, 1960–1961, and 1989 as historical watersheds; at the same time he makes us better understand those aspects of life that are less obviously affected by these historical changes, including the question of individuality. What we find as the core of the individual Nádas calls “the human consistency.” Its vessel is the individual human body, sensuality, psyche and memories. The individual is pitted against the communal very effectively in the novel. Its tragic worldview, however, is not due to its view or philosophy of history: it results from its anthropology. The body is the epicenter of the novel: it is by means of writing the body, or more precisely the human flesh, that Nádas shows what it means to be a human animal. The shift of focus from body to flesh is one of the senses in which Nádas breaks with the European humanist tradition. What he calls to our attention is that there is not even the slightest chance to completely comprehend what we, as sensual beings, are nonetheless capable of perceiving. He does not answer the question of whether the world and life are knowable or not. What he does do—in an idiosyncratic and innovative way—is to represent both and make us realize that they are perceivable. The result is a very peculiar kind of knowledge: it is both rational and irrational, sensual and intellectual, personal and interpersonal, conscious and unconscious, male and female, mythic and scientific, bodily and spiritual, worldly and unworldly." .

However, in Spanish-language literature the poetic litany of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was not very productive: various types of repetitiveness are common devices in the literature but they are seldom of a litanic nature. Nevertheless, from the beginning of Modernism it was a creative inspiration to many poets. The main objective of this article is to present various interpretive options that litanic poetics brings in poems by Juan Ramón Jiménez based on an analysis of stylistic devices. The Spanish poet transforms the centuries-old tradition of poetic litany as a genre deeply rooted in the Christian tradition. It serves as a way to express subjective and sensual meanings: if God (or a god) is its addressee, he does not correspond to Christian images; to express the disintegration of one’s own identity; to attribute divine features to the human and poetic art; or to express the uniqueness of a moment, place, feeling. It is only when the continuity in the litany genre development is noticed it is possible to see modifications of the meaning and function of the litanic genre, departure from a prayer-like nature, the closest one to the genre pattern, for the sake of expressing what is human and individual." .

The two studies presented here were designed to contribute basic knowledge regarding self-presentation of sexual orientation among bisexual people. In Study 1, bisexual participants (N = 147) were less likely than their lesbian and gay (LG) peers (N = 191) to present their actual orientation to others, and more likely to present themselves as having a sexual orientation different from their actual orientation. These sexual orientation differences were explained by gender of romantic partner and uncertainty about one’s sexual orientation. Sexual orientation differences also emerged in links between self-presentation and outness level. For example, bisexual participants who presented themselves as LG had relatively high everyday outness levels; in contrast, LG participants who presented themselves as bisexual had relatively low everyday outness levels. In Study 2, 240 bisexual women and men indicated their levels of outness as a sexual minority person (potentially including identification as gay, lesbian, queer) and specifically as bisexual. Outness was higher with respect to status as a sexual minority compared to status as bisexual; the magnitude of this difference was predicted by gender of romantic partner and uncertainty about one’s sexual orientation. Moreover, even controlling for outness as a sexual minority person, well-being was predicted by outness as bisexual to family members." .

Although translation has made a vital contribution to her international success, Potter’s work remains relatively under-researched from a translation studies perspective. This article aims to provide a clearer picture of Potter’s work in translation over the last hundred years. It identifies early translated editions and discusses Potter’s involvement in their preparation, before examining the appearance of her stories in translation around the world and outlining particular trends in Potter translation. This study is based on extensive research using numerous databases, Potter’s published biographies and correspondence, and on an analysis of the first French editions of her tales. The study reveals that the first published translations of Potter’s works are both of an earlier date and more numerous than is recognised in existing scholarship. It also shows that Potter’s preferred approach in the translation of her stories into French was to adapt the tales to their new French readership, rather than staying close to the originals. Her works are found to have been extensively translated during the last century, especially into European languages, as well as into a significant number of Asian languages. Other matters discussed include the involvement of Potter’s official publisher, Warne, in the publication of international editions; the existence of translations based on American editions with new illustrations; and the posting of online translations by Potter enthusiasts." .

The analysis is based on diachronic website data and interviews with state employees concerning the presence or absence of different languages on the websites of three central state institutions. The article reveals a linguistic homogenization of the VLL of the public sector in Norway, which is mostly due to the removal of immigrant languages from state websites. The analysis also shows an increased linguistic presence of Nynorsk (the less used written standard of Norwegian), of the indigenous Sámi language, and of English, which performs a ‘hypercentral’ function. The virtual linguistic ethnography and follow-up interviews show that the websites of the three institutions in focus exist more or less fully only in two language versions: Bokmål (the more widespread written standard of Norwegian) and English. The translations into Nynorsk and Sámi are mainly done to comply with official regulations. Furthermore, immigration, rather than leading to an increased visibility of language diversity in the VLL, can also put pressure towards homogenization. One could perhaps even go so far as to see Norway as the harbinger of change: once multilingual provision has reached a notional peak, there is a chance that more and more state institutions will cut down on ‘less than necessary’ languages online, opting instead for ‘commonsense’ English together with the respective official language(s)." .

This paper reports on an exploratory study that investigated learners’ perceptions and preferences of WCF in an EFL setting. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 64 intermediate, advanced-intermediate, and advanced English learners across three proficiency levels (intermediate, advanced-intermediate, and advanced) in a major provincial university of Mainland China. Through extensive written questionnaires, the study explored these learners’ perceptions and preferences of the various dimensions of WCF. The results showed that although the participants tended to have a neutral opinion on the role of explicit grammar instruction, overall they expressed a favourable attitude towards error correction. In particular, they held a strong preference for extended comments on both content and grammar of their written work. The qualitative data further indicated that the participants wanted to take more initiatives in the revision process of their writing with less interference from teachers. Overall, the findings confirm the value of WCF for EFL learners outside English-speaking countries. The findings also highlight the significance of individual and contextual factors in the ongoing debate over the effectiveness of WCF." .

But even though literary protagonists travel on a regular basis and thus experience themselves and the reality around them quite dramatically, space remained a rather vague dimension far throughout the Middle Ages. By the fifteenth century, however, we recognize a noteworthy paradigm shift regarding the perception and relevance of space as a relevant entity determining the individual’s life, as reflected by poets and writers across Europe. After reviewing how most medieval poets dealt with space, this phenomenon is then discussed particularly in light of Eleonore of Austria’s Pontus und Sidonia (ca. 1450–1460), where the western world of Europe in its geo-political dimension emerges perhaps more clearly than ever before and where space in concrete geo-political terms matters significantly, setting a new tone which would lead over to the early modern age and facilitated an astounding popularity of this novel far into the eighteenth century." .

By far the least studied of Italy’s ‘big three’ mafias, socio-historical research on the earlier stage of the organisation’s history has tended to make extensive use of literary and journalistic texts as source material (see Arlacchi (1983); Ciconte (1992); Paoli (2003)). This paper will present a cautionary example of the importance of interrogating literary and journalistic representations of Italian organized crime sensitively and within context, taking an article written by celebrated Calabrian writer Corrado Alvaro as a case study. It argues that academic perceptions of the early ‘Ndrangheta are, through their reliance on cultural products, impacted by the narratives contained within such texts; a phenomenon which merits further investigation. Further, drawing on cultural memory studies, it argues that, while the accuracy of the representations of the ‘Ndrangheta contained within these texts may be called into question, they do, through their ability to both reflect and shape public opinion, have a valuable contribution to make to our understanding of perceptions of Calabrian organized crime in its native region." .
