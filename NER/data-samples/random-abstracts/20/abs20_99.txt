Abstract The diagnosis and management of injuries of the heart or the great vessels continues to be a major surgical challenge in the past and now. This case study introduces the conservative management of a patient who developed a venous bullet embolus after being shot in the lower extremities. In this case report, we aim to review some of the literature on bullet emboli and to raise awareness of its existence. It was concluded that for bullets left in the limbs, bullet position in relation with peripheral vessels should be evaluated carefully to treat and avoid the bullets moving along with the bloodstream.
