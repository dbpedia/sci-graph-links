Abstract Recurrent and chronic rectal prolapse might lead to irreducibility and ultimately gangrene of the rectum if neglected. Gangrenous rectal prolapse is a surgical emergency and needs urgent surgical management. In view of irreducibility and gangrenous bowel, it is not advisable to attempt manual reduction of rectal prolapse. The only safe option that remains is perineal rectosigmoidectomy (Altemeierâ€™s operation). Here, we present our experience of five such cases operated in our institute from 2000 to 2015 with available literature review.
