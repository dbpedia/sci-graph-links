Abstract The aim of this study is to explore how the social, religious, and cultural phenomenon of medieval heresy has been presented in the historical romance Plameni inkvizitori by Marija Jurić Zagorka: from the concept itself to its literary appropriation in the novel. Through a careful examination of the given textual evidence, the essay also attempts to prove the accuracy and authenticity of the novel’s historical background and, by extension, Zagorka’s literary work—a fact that has frequently been contested.
