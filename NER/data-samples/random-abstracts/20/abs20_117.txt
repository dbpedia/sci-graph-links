A brief literature review is given of studies concerning the method of standard electrospinning, which is used for producing long nanofibers. Experimental setups — the first version and the new, modified pulse electrospinning setup — are described. The results of works on producing short fibers using pulse electrospinning are reported in the present article. Data on short fibers produced experimentally from such polymers as polymethyl methacrylate and cellulose acetate are presented.
