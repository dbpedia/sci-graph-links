Abstract We report a rare case of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a primary thyroid tumor. To our knowledge, there are only two prior unequivocal cases of primary thyroid epithelioid hemangioendothelioma reported in the English literature. This is the first case in the thyroid with molecular confirmation.
