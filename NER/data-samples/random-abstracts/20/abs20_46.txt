Abstract RC4 is one of the most popular stream cipher with wide industrial applications, it has received serious attention in cryptology literature in the last 2 decades. In 1995, Roos pointed out that the elements $$S_N[y]$$ SN[y] of the permutation $$S_N$$ SN after the key scheduling algorithm for the first few values of y are biased to certain combinations of secret key bytes. These correlations were theoretically studied by Paul and Maitra (SAC, 2007). The formula for the correlation probabilities provided by them gives a wrong impression that the probabilities decrease as the value of y becomes larger, which is not true. In this paper, we point out some gaps in their analysis and present a detailed analysis of Roos bias. We provide a more accurate formula for the correlation probabilities. We further study nested Roos type biases and present comparison results. These types of biases are used to reconstruct key from the permutation $$S_N$$ SN for better success probability.
