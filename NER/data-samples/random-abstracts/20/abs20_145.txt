Abstract In this paper we discuss how to derive the non polyhedral convex envelopes for some functions, called 1-convex throughout the paper, over boxes. The main result is about n-dimensional 1-convex functions, but we get to it by first discussing in detail some special cases, namely functions $$xyz^\delta $$ xyzδ , $$\delta >1$$ δ>1 , and, next, more general trivariate functions. The relation between the class of functions investigated in this paper and other classes investigated in the existing literature is discussed.
