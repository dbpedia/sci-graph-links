Summary The asymptotic λ behavior of the analytically continued partial-wave amplitude is commonly given (incorrectly) asO(λ −1/2 exp [−Γλ]. This result is exorcised by a careful study of the past Regge literature. The original (correct) result ofO(λ −1/2 exp [−Γλ] is resurrected, and the conditions under which it is valid, as well as its implications, are carefully discussed.
