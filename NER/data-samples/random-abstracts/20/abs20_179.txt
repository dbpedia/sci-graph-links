Abstract This essay explores the academic writing life through narrative and practical strategy. It attempts to get at larger questions of method in pastoral theology through the concrete subject matter of how I (and others) go about writing, illustrating in both content and procedure key methodological assumptions that guide work in pastoral theology, such as reflexivity, concern for the daily, demand to perform well the practice we study, and commitment to deeper transformation. I argue, among other things, that writers (in pastoral theology and beyond) manage the challenge and lure of writing through intentional crafting of everyday patterns in time and space. Ultimately, the material disciplines of writing open up into important vocational and spiritual questions and habits.
