Mexican Indigenous im/migrants are a growing community made invisible at the margins of multiple racial, cultural and linguistic spaces in Mexico and the United States. This article addresses the need for a nuanced understanding of the adaptation of Mexican Indigenous im/migrant children and families that encourages Indigenous communitiesâ€™ cultural and linguistic knowledge to be recognized and valued, rather than silenced and stigmatized. We critically examine the existing literature on the adaptation of Mexican Indigenous im/migrants in the United States from the perspective of socio-ecological systems theory, incorporating insights from the theory but also pointing out its limitations for understanding Mexican Indigenous identities and experiences in diaspora. We propose integrating language-ecological approaches to provide a more complete picture of Indigenous ecologies of adaptation in the United States. We conclude that it is critical to expand research on Mexican Indigenous im/migrant adaptation within the field of Latino studies and identify possible directions for future research.
