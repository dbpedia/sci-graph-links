Abstract Within colleges and universities, and academic circles generally, as in other fields, a certain jargon or distinguishable language has developed. There are those who assert that this academic jargon is used to add precision in the transmission of ideas, or to provide a certain degree of legitimacy to a comparatively young academic discipline, while others contend that this “academise” is needlessly dense and exclusionary setting up a hierarchy of knowledge. Three individuals with varying relationships to the “academy” discuss this ongoing controversy within queer studies. The discussants include Paul B. Franklin, a doctoral candidate in the Fine Arts Department at Harvard University. He is currently writing a dissertation on the place of homosexuality in modern art. Adrien Saks is a Boston activist, writer, and publicist. He is the coeditor of Revelations: Gay Men’s Coming Out Stories and the former Marketing Director of Alyson Publications. This is his third year on the planning committee of OutWrite: The National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Writing Conference. Amanda Udis-Kessler is a bisexual sociologist with an interest in race, class, and gender inequality. Her work has appeared in eight books and a number of journals. An acquisitions editor for the journal Empathy, she is currently writing a social history of the bisexual movement/identity.
