Abstract This paper serves to qualify the present form of the e-book as one of many different kinds of digital compositions, or voluntarily consumed digital media. This paper also aims to show how future e-books, by virtue of its responsive nature and higher text-to-nontext ratio compared to other digital compositions, may only iterate into simpler formats (emphasis on textual components) as opposed to more complicated formats (emphasis on audiovisual components). This is due in part to consumer and market expectations of the e-book as well as limitations for the e-book as a medium. Because of this, I predict the next iteration for the e-book—the web book—will exist almost entirely in web applications.
