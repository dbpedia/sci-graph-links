Abstract This report and review of the literature describes a case of benign intraoral lesions of perineurial origin in a patient with symptomatic hemimandibular hyperplasia causing partial denture soreness. Perineuriomas are a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor composed of perineurial cells. Intraoral perineuriomas are an extremely rare entity. Two main types of perineuriomas have been described: intraneural and extraneural perineuriomas. A third, similar entity, called an intraneural pseudoperineuriomatous proliferation, has recently been proposed in the literature as a separate and distinctive diagnosis. This report describes the histologic and clinical presentation of intraneural pseudoperineuriomatous proliferations in a patient with hemimandibular hyperplasia.
