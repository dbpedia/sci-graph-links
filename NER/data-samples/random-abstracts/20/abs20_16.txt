Abstract Data available from the literature are used to calculate the enthalpic contribution from the trinitromethyl group for a number of C-trinitromethyl derivatives of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds and to recalculate the enthalpies of formation of these compounds in the condensed phase. The calculated data are used to estimate the efficiencies of these compounds as oxidizers in energetic compositions.
