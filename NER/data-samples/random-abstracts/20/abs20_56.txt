Summary A theoretical calculation of the ratio of the form factorsH 1 andH 1(5) of the vector and axialN-N* vertices is presented, based on once-subtracted dispersion relations in the nucleon mass. The subtraction constants are evaluated using Ward identities. The absorptive parts of the form factors are calculated with the soft-pion technique and a cut-off procedure is necessary, but the cut-off value can be calculated by consistency, without any further assumptions. The result obtained isH 1H1(5)=âˆ’4.2, which is consistent with other values quoted in the literature.
