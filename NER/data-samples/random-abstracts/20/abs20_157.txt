Abstract The general method for calculating the current density in two parallel conductors of arbitrary cross section is used to calculate the current density in two solid conductors of circular cross section that does not change along the conductors. The conductors are supplied from a source of sinusoidal voltage in steady state. Based on the calculated current density, the impedance of a segment of two conductors is examined. The calculated exact inductance values are compared with the values obtained via calculation using formulae published in the literature.
