Abstract The literature on the foaming of electrofurnace slag is reviewed. On that basis, recommendations for improvement in slag foaming are formulated. Inconsistencies in the published data are noted, and some principles are elaborated. It is evident that two key factors have been ignored in the existing research: the temperature of the slag; and its content of small gas bubbles.
