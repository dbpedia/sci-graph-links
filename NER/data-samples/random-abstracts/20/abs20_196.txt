Abstract As Putin’s Russia tries to change its image in international politics, Russia also attempts to re-establish the country’s importance and exceptionality. The second component involves communication efforts that are based on certain ideological narratives. This article offers a discourse analysis approach to those ideological novelties and an understanding of underlying perceptions, which it connects with historical and literary contexts. Effective communication with Russian leadership and Russia’s public sphere may not be achieved unless those narratives are addressed through political communication, even though this idea may sound irrational. These phenomena replicate, in obscure ways, traditional beliefs that are rooted in Russian culture, literature and philosophy and, though Putin did “renovate” them, such constructs will overshadow East-West relations regardless of which political regime is in power in Russia.
