Standard samples constitute one of the key elements in the medicines standardization system. In pharmacopeia analysis in the Russian Federation and many foreign countries, the use of standard samples is regulated by the corresponding normative documents and pharmacopeia monographs. There are different classifications for standard samples and, depending on purpose, certification programs. Standard samples used in compliance with the requirements of pharmacopeia articles or monographs in international, regional and national pharmacopeias are generally termed pharmacopeia standard samples.
