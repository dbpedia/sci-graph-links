Abstract This paper illuminates the experiences of sexuality of disabled women in Zimbabwe, from a standpoint where the women challenge the myth that they are asexual beings. Sixteen women with disabilities participated in this study and a number of themes emerged from an analysis of their narratives. A discussion of all the themes that emerged in the broad study is beyond the scope of this article; hence, in this paper, we focus on four themes that illuminate the active sexuality of participants: (1) dynamic engagement in intimate partner relationships, (2) drawing feminine strategic power from cultural practices of sexual initiation, (3) enhancing eroticism through vaginal modification, and (4) reproduction and motherhood. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that while disabled women may acknowledge the oppression they perceive as being characteristic of their experiences of sexuality, they are not passive recipients of disability and sexuality stereotypes. Disabled women construct their own understanding of what it means to be sexual and they assert their sexuality in ways that challenge the dominant, restrictive, and ableist constructions of sexuality. The themes that we discuss in this article highlight the intersectional nature of the experiences of sexuality of participants within a critical feminist disability studies theoretical framework.
