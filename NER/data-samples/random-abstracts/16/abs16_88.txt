Abstract This paper examines whether the parcelization of land through easement as a result of the construction of pipelines in rural areas in Turkey has any negative effects on productive land use. The current legislation in Turkey does not allow the division of land in most rural areas into parcels smaller than 5000 m2. Therefore, the smallest parcel that can be productively used was considered as 5000 m2. On the basis of the analysis of the data pertaining to the easement rights having two different widths and collected from three different regions having different parcel sizes, the research aims to find out the number of parcels with an area less than 5000 m2 (excluding the easement) that were created by the construction of pipelines and to investigate whether a significant number of areas less than 5000 m2 remain. This study also demonstrates a method that can be used in studies on this subject according to the various parcel sizes that were created by the allotment of parcels due to the easement of the construction of pipelines.
