Abstract The goal of this study is to examine the association between location-sharing in location based social networking (LBSN) services and social capital, such as trust, reciprocity, and network resources. A cross-sectional survey (n = 491) was conducted by adopting a simple random sampling method in 2014. The findings showed that intensity of LBSN services is positively associated with all social capital aspects. In general, compared to a group of non-users of LBSN services, those groups of users with low and high intensity of LBSN services were higher in trust, reciprocity, and network resources. Therefore, this study proposes theoretical and practical implications of location-sharing to scholars in social sciences demonstrating how use of LBSN services influences accumulation of social capital.
