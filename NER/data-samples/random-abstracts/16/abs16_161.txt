Abstract World over the traditional knowledge has always formed the foundation for development of modern medicines as a result of scientific follow up of the traditional knowledge. Andaman archipelago represents one of the greatest emporia of ethno botanical wealth in India where aboriginal native tribes of ancient culture remain in their virginity and possess abundant ethnic knowledge. The Jarawas of Andaman Island are one such primitive and dwindling community. Jarawas inhabit the Jarawa Reserve located along the western parts of the South and Middle Andamans. A brief account of anthropology of the tribe is given. Results of ethnobotanical studies of Jarawa tribe have been enumerated which revealed interesting plants which can be further prioritized for scientific evaluation and Bioprospection for product development. The species like Alpinia manii, Amomum aculeatum, belonging to Zingiberaceae and Pseuduvaria prainii, Orophea katschallica of Annonaceae are shown to have effective insect and bee repellent properties. Such leads should be subjected to further scientific scrutiny for development of global level products having mosquito and other disease causing insect repellent properties. While this achieves the human welfare aspects, at the same time boosts the economy of the region. The Jarawas possess extensive knowledge of the plants of the surrounding forests and use them in their daily life for food, medicine, shelter, fibres, ornaments, bows and arrows and for many other needs. Such plants are enumerated with correct botanical names, family, Jarawa names, plant parts used along with details of use.
