Abstract Following lines first laid out by Montesquieu and Tocqueville, sociologist Dominique Schnapper argues that egalitarian societies derive their authority from the principle of consent, which entails problems earlier, tradition-bound societies did not face. These include a sense of boundless desire, difficulties transmitting moral and political standards between generations, and an intellectual inability to make clear distinctions.
