Abstract Whilst the issue of urban greenery has received considerable research attention in many individual African countries in recent years, little has been done to explore and document the influence and the management implications of urbanisation on urban greenery across Africa. To address this gap, this paper reviews the state of urban greenery across African cities by analysing urbanisation pressures on the preservation and management of urban greenery. Drawing from published literature, policy documents and international reports, the study findings indicate an increasing depletion of urban greenery across major cities in Africa owing to urbanisation-induced anthropogenic influences. This paper advocates for an urban resilience model to management of urban greenery.
