Abstract This case commentary considers relational psychoanalytic treatment with a marginalized, traumatized client. It illustrates the centrality of a mutually developed, psychoanalytically informed generative relationship in clinical practice with oppressed clients. Such relationships promote the freedom to think, to reflect, and to make sense of oneâ€™s experience. Treatment aims to help clients bear traumatic experiences, to deepen their subjectivity and to claim a sense of agency in their lives. Development of these capacities is especially important for work with oppressed clients since their histories and living conditions militate to strip them of their dignity, integrity and fundamental humanity. The author asserts that in this way psychoanalytically informed clinical practice promotes social justice and empowerment.
