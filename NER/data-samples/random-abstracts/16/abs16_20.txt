Abstract Recently the construction of various integral transforms for slice monogenic functions has gained a lot of attention. In line with these developments, the article at hand introduces the slice Fourier transform. In the first part, the kernel function of this integral transform is constructed using the Mehler formula. An explicit expression for the integral transform is obtained and allows for the study of its properties. In the second part, two kinds of corresponding convolutions are examined: Mustard convolutions and convolutions based on generalised translation operators. The paper finishes by demonstrating the connection between both.
