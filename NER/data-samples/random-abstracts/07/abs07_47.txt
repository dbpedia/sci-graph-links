Abstract Somatic cloning, also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), is a promising technology which has been expected to rapidly extend the population of elaborately selected breeding boars with superior production performance. Chinese Guike No. 1 pig breed is a novel swine specialized strain incorporated with the pedigree background of Duroc and Chinese Luchuan pig breeds, thus inherits an excellent production performance. The present study was conducted to establish somatic cloning procedures of adult breeding boars from the Chinese Guike No. 1 specialized strain. Ear skin fibroblasts were first isolated from a three-year-old Chinese Guike No. 1 breeding boar, and following that, used as donor cell to produce nuclear transfer embryos. Such cloned embryos showed full in vitro development and with the blastocyst formation rate of 18.4 % (37/201, three independent replicates). Finally, after transferring of 1187 nuclear transfer derived embryos to four surrogate recipients, six live piglets with normal health and development were produced. The overall cloning efficiency was 0.5 % and the clonal provenance of such SCNT derived piglets was confirmed by DNA microsatellite analysis. All of the cloned piglets were clinically healthy and had a normal weight at 1 month of age. Collectively, the first successful cloning of an adult Chinese Guike No. 1 breeding boar may lay the foundation for future improving the pig production industry.
