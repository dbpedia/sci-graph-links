Abstract By the discussion of division in $$F_{^{^{^{_2 m} } } } \left[ u \right]/\left\langle {u^4 } \right\rangle $$ F2m[u]/〈u4〉 , the minimal spanning set and the rank of a (1 + u + u 2) - constacyclic code with an arbitrary length N = 2 e n over $$\Phi $$ F2m[u]/⟨u4⟩ are determined based on the factorization of (x n - 1) over $${F_{{2^m}}}$$ F2m .
