Abstract Once abundant in the Americas, the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (L.) has gradually declined in numbers. Until the 1990s, it was considered the main pest of major crops such as soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill, particularly in southern Brazil and southern USA, as well as Argentina, Uruguay, and other countries. In the past 15+ years, a dramatic population decrease was observed to the point of now being considered a secondary pest in these referred countries. In this article, we list and discuss possible reasons which explain the decline in N. viridula population in the Americas. These factors include the following: (1) the steady increase of herbicides used in no-tillage/multiple cropping systems affecting potential hosts such as weeds in crop fields and nearby natural vegetation; (2) the change in cultivation systems, mostly in the Neotropics, favoring other species more adapted to exploit crops in modern day agriculture; (3) competition among several species of stink bugs that colonize major crops; (4) the growing impact of several species of egg parasitoids, some of them laboratory reared and released in crop fields, and other natural enemies (parasitoids and predators); and (5) the impact of global climate change affecting its distribution and biology.
