Abstract This study investigated the possibility of using a finishing feeding strategy and to apply a dilution model for the calculation of the content of fatty acids (FA) in farmed brook char (Salvelinus fontinalis). Four duplicate groups of fish with an initial weight 153.3 ± 4.9 g−1 were kept in a flow-through system for 135 days, during which they more than triplicated their weight. Control groups were fed the same unmodified commercial diet with 100 % fish oil (FO) or with 60 % fish oil and 40 % rapeseed oil (RO) mixture. Two groups were fed by RO diet followed by 45 (RO:45FO) and 90 (RO:90FO) days of FO diet, respectively, at the end of the growing period. The fillet FA composition at the end of the experiment corresponded with the FA composition of the lipid source in the diet for the tested groups. A significant (p < 0.05) impact on FA composition with a decreasing tendency in the representation of n-3 HUFA with a prolonged feeding period with the RO diet was observed. The application of a dilution model enabling the prediction of the content of a given fatty acid in a given time was successfully performed.
