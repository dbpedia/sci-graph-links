Here, we have examined the functions of an Mdj1 orthologue (56.68 kDa) in Beauveria bassiana, a filamentous fungal insect pathogen widely applied in biological control of insect pests. Deletion of mdj1 in B. bassiana resulted in significant growth defects on a variety of complex and minimal media. The Δmdj1 mutant exhibited not only a drastic reduction (92 %) in aerial conidiation during optimal cultivation but also a remarkable decrease (77 %) in submerged blastospore production. Compared to wild-type, the deletion mutant was significantly more sensitive to the stresses of cell wall perturbation, high osmolarity, oxidation, carbendazim fungicide, several metal ions, and acidic/alkaline pH during conidial germination and/or colony growth. In the mutant, conidial thermotolerance and UV-B resistance decreased by 61 and 25 %, respectively, and virulence to Galleria mellonella larvae was largely attenuated. Transcript levels of many phenotype-related genes were drastically suppressed in the absence of mdj1, accompanied with impaired cell walls and reduced intracellular anti-stress molecules, including superoxide dismutases, catalases, glycerol, trehalose, and mannitol. These data indicate that Mdj1 plays a vital role in normal fungal development and contributes significantly to the biological control potential of B. bassiana against insect pests." .

Wilted Italian ryegrass (IR), whole crop corn (WC), and wilted alfalfa (AL) silages stored for 2 months were examined. All silages contained lactic acid as a predominant fermentation product. Across the three crop species, DGGE detected 36 and 28 bands, and NGS identified 253 and 259 genera in the pre-ensiled crops and silages, respectively. The NGS demonstrated that, although lactic acid bacteria (LAB) became prevalent in all silages after 2 months of storage, the major groups were different between crops: Leuconostoc spp. and Pediococcus spp. for IR silage, Lactobacillus spp. for WC silage, and Enterococcus spp. for AL silage. The predominant silage LAB genera were also detected by DGGE, but the presence of diverse non-LAB species in pre-ensiled crops was far better detected by NGS. Likewise, good survival of Agrobacterium spp., Methylobacterium spp., and Sphingomonas spp. in IR and AL silages was demonstrated by NGS. The diversity of the microbiota described by principal coordinate analysis was similar between DGGE and NGS. Our finding that analysis of pre-ensiled crop microbiota did not help predict silage microbiota was true for both DGGE and NGS." .

Phosphorus efficiency and grain yield can be improved simultaneously in breeding. AbstractAn important breeding goal for many crop species is improved phosphorus (P) efficiency. As in many other crops, selection for P efficient barley varieties has been slow because of inconsistent definitions of P efficiency and unknown genetic controls of P efficiency. We used two criteria to assess P efficiency in a doubled haploid Commander/Fleet population: P responsiveness (estimated as the deviation from the regression of yield with added P against yield with no added P treatment) and PUE (relative yield). Phosphorus responsiveness, PUE and grain yield were phenotyped at 0 and 30 kg P/ha in five environments. Lines consistently responsive to 30 kg P/ha across environments had the highest yield at the two P rates, and P responsiveness showed significantly higher broad sense heritability than PUE in the materials we studied. Genotyping of the population was subjected to a 9,000 single nucleotide polymorphism array and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for P responsiveness were mapped with yield at 30 kg P/ha, which are common QTLs for yield when P was not limiting growth. The largest QTL for P responsiveness was mapped to 7HL in 2 years. PUE varied from 31 to 124 % across environments and one of the QTLs for PUE was mapped with yield at 0 kg P/ha. Our results demonstrate P responsiveness and grain yield can be improved simultaneously under high-input agricultural systems, but breeding for high PUE varieties may need to explore landrace or wild barley germplasm for low P tolerant alleles." .

Transcriptome analysis of grapevine fruits can help understanding these interactions to consciously cope with conditions leading to detrimental effects for viticultural purposes. However, considering the grapevine characteristic ripening asynchrony, which can be intensified by contrasting conditions, accurate grape sampling may be essential for molecular comparisons. In this study, berry density sorting according to floatability in NaCl solutions was transcriptomically assessed as a grape ripening staging strategy. The transcriptome was compared between three density classes collected near commercial maturity using grapevine whole-genome NimbleGen microarrays. Expression profiles clearly related with ripening progression were detected in a density series simultaneously collected from a vineyard of Albariño. By contrast, considerable differences were detected when the same density series was sampled on two different dates from the same vineyard of Tempranillo. Functional analysis indicated that environmental differences between both sampling moments determined most of these expression differences. Ripening degree-dependent responses to the environment were also detected. Finally, the effect of the sorting procedures on the grape transcriptome showed negligible when it was directly tested. Altogether, these findings evidence the convenience of homogenizing the developmental stage and the sampling time conditions for transcriptome comparisons. Berry density sorting proved useful to this end, although this method could be limited when berry sugar concentration increases through dehydration." .

The transgenic maize expressing Cry1Ie might be commercially used in the near future and it is urgent to develop a method to detect Cry1Ie protein in transgenic plants and their products. To develop an ELISA method, Cry1Ie protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Transetta DE3, purified with the Ni-NTA spin columns, and then validated by sequencing. Bioassay results showed that the purified Cry1Ie protein was highly toxic to the Asian corn borer. The polyclonal antibody (pAb) and the specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1G42D6 were generated from rabbit and mice which were immunized with Cry1Ie protein, respectively. Western blotting of crude Cry1Ie protein extracts was established by employing mAb 1G42D6, whereas the mAb 1G42D6 negligibly recognized other Bt proteins. Sandwich ELISA against Cry1Ie protein was established by coating with pAb and detecting with mAb 1G42D6. The limit of detection (LOD), the limit of quantification (LOQ), and the quantification range of the assay in different matrices of maize plant were determined as 0.27–0.51, 0.29–0.78, and 0.45–15.71 ng/mL, respectively. Recoveries of Cry1Ie protein spiked in different maize tissues ranged from 75.1 to 99.5 %. The established sandwich ELISA was verified using transgenic maize overexpressing Cry1Ie.

The aim of this study was to investigate the brewing potential of 100 % unmalted barley, wheat, oat and rye in comparison with 100 % malt. To address this, identical brewing methods were adopted at 10-L scale for each grain type by applying a commercial mashing enzyme blend (Ondea® Pro), and selected quality attributes were assessed for respective worts and beers. Different compositions of fermentable wort carbohydrates were observed in the worts (all at ca. 12°P), and in particular oat wort had lower concentration of maltose compared to the others, resulting in the lowest concentration of alcohol in final beer. Moreover, wort made from unmalted grains also showed lower free amino nitrogen and higher viscosity than malt wort. Furthermore, the use of 100 % unmalted grains resulted in a decrease in the levels of colour and brightness, as well as higher alcohols and esters in the final beers. Consequently, the study provides valuable information for exploring beer brewing with 100 % unmalted barley, oat, rye or wheat using exogenously added enzymes. It also helps to understand the process ability by revealing specific needs when manufacturing different type of beers from unmalted grains, potentially paving the way to process optimisation and development of future products." .

One of them represents a novel partial adult plant resistance gene, named Lr75. AbstractLeaf rust caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina is a damaging disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The combination of several, additively-acting partial disease resistance genes has been proposed as a suitable strategy to breed wheat cultivars with high levels of durable field resistance. The Swiss winter wheat cultivar ‘Forno’ continues to show near-immunity to leaf rust since its release in the 1980s. This resistance is conferred by the presence of at least six quantitative trait loci (QTL), one of which is associated with the morphological trait leaf tip necrosis. Here, we used a marker-informed strategy to introgress two ‘Forno’ QTLs into the leaf rust-susceptible Swiss winter wheat cultivar ‘Arina’. The resulting backcross line ‘ArinaLrFor’ showed markedly increased leaf rust resistance in multiple locations over several years. One of the introgressed QTLs, QLr.sfr-1BS, is located on chromosome 1BS. We developed chromosome 1B-specific microsatellite markers by exploiting the Illumina survey sequences of wheat cv. ‘Chinese Spring’ and mapped QLr.sfr-1BS to a 4.3 cM interval flanked by the SSR markers gwm604 and swm271. QLr.sfr-1BS does not share a genetic location with any of the described leaf rust resistance genes present on chromosome 1B. Therefore, QLr.sfr-1BS is novel and was designated as Lr75. We conclude that marker-assisted combination of partial resistance genes is a feasible strategy to increase broad-spectrum leaf rust resistance. The identification of Lr75 adds a novel and highly useful gene to the small set of known partial, adult plant leaf rust resistance genes." .

The two datasets formed the basis for several analyses in the fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5), and thus represent a critical source of information for emissions inventories at national, regional and global level. The two databases differ in their level of computational complexity in estimating emissions. While both use the same burned area information from remote sensing, estimates of available biomass are computed in GFED3 at tier 3 using a complex dynamic vegetation model, while they are computed in FAOSTAT using default, tier 1 parameters from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Over the analysis period 1997–2011, the two methods were found to produce very similar global GHG emissions estimates for each of the five GFED aggregated biomass fire classes: i) Savanna; ii) Woodland; iii) Forest; iv) Deforestation; v) Peatlands; with total emissions ranging 6–8 Gt CO2eq yr-1. The main differences between the two datasets were found with respect to peat fires, with FAOSTAT showing a lower 1997–1998 peak in emissions compared with GFED3, within an otherwise good agreement for the rest of the study period, when limited to the three tropical countries covered by GFED. Conversely, FAOSTAT global emissions from peat fires, including both boreal and tropical regions, were several times larger than those currently estimated by GFED3. Results show that FAOSTAT activity data and emission estimates for biomass fires offer a robust alternative to the more sophisticated GFED data, representing a valuable resource for national GHG inventory experts, especially in countries where technical and institutional constraints may limit access, generation and maintenance of more complex methodologies and data." .

In this paper we assess individual Parties’ expected reduction of emissions/removals from land use, land use change, and forest (LULUCF) sector for reaching their INDC target, and the aggregate global effect on the INDCs on the future development of emission and removals from the LULUCF sector. This has been done through analysis Parties’ official information concerning the role of LULUCF mitigation efforts for reaching INDC targets as presented in National Communications, Biennial Update Reports, and Additional file 1. ResultsOn the aggregate global level, the Parties themselves perceive that net LULUCF emissions will increase over time. Overall, the net LULUCF emissions are estimated to increase by 0.6 Gt CO2e year−1 (range: 0.1–1.1) in 2020 and 1.3 Gt CO2e year−1 (range: 0.7–2.1) in 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. On the other hand, the full implementation of the INDCs is estimated to lead to a reduction of net LULUCF emissions in 2030 compared to 2010 levels. It is estimated that if all conditional and unconditional INDCs are implemented, net LULUCF emissions would decrease by 0.5 Gt CO2e year−1 (range: 0.2–0.8) by 2020 and 0.9 Gt CO2e year−1 (range: 0.5–1.3) by 2030, both compared to 2010 levels. The largest absolute reductions of net LULUCF emissions (compared to 2010 levels) are expected from Indonesia and Brazil, followed by China and Ethiopia. ConclusionsThe results highlights that countries are expecting a significant contribution from the LULUCF sector to meet their INDC mitigation targets. At the global level, the LULUCF sector is expected to contribute to as much as 20% of the full mitigation potential of all the conditional and unconditional INDC targets. However, large uncertainties still surround how Parties estimate, project and account for emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector. While INDCs represent a new source of land-use information, further information and updates of the INDCs will be required to reduce uncertainty of the LULUCF projections." .

Economic losses is due to decreasing of productivity potential and leather quality. The disease is caused by two parasitic fly species in cattle, Hypoderma bovis and lineatus. Diagnosis of the parasites has crucial importance because of treatment and eradication plannings. Basically diagnosis is based on parasitological methods but recently serological methods were used in some countries. In the present study, a total of 3716 cattle were investigated in Industrial Slaughter house of Ardebil, Northwest of Iran. In this study, the prevalence of H. lineatus and H. bovis was 0.32 % (12 larva) and 1.07 % (40 larva), respectively. Low prevalence of hypodermosis could be caused by cold climate of studied region also shows efficacy of controlling programs. Unlike low prevalence of Hypoderma spp. in the studied regions, antiparasitic agents such as organophosphates and avermectins should be used to reduce the prevalence." .

The following results are obtained: (1) The gross output value of planting industry in China was increased by 995.31 billion Yuan during 1990–2012; during those nine crops, rice had the maximum increment in gross output value, while peanut increased at the fastest rate; the output value of rice, wheat and maize occupied an important position, but showed overall downward trend with fluctuation. (2) The cumulative contributions of total sown area of farm crops, planting structure, per hectare output of crop and price level of crop on the gross output value were 88.64, −24.18, 228.22 and 702.63 billion Yuan, respectively. Price level of crop and per hectare output of crop were the main contributors to the rapid increase in gross output value of planting industry; from the view of respective crops, the effects of price level of crop and per hectare output of crop in those nine crops were positive; the rapid rise in the price of rice, maize, wheat, cotton and peanut, superimposed with the significant increase in the per hectare output of cotton and the planting proportion of maize, obviously promoted gross output value of planting industry during 1990–2012. (3) The gross output value of planting industry in China was closely related to national macroeconomic policies. The rise of crop price was the major contributor to increase in gross output value of planting industry during 1990–1996; the overall decline in the price of crop and the planting proportion led to significant decline in gross output value during 1997–2003; the rebound rise in the price of crop and the rapid increase in per hectare output of crop resulted in significant increase in gross output value of planting industry during 2004–2012." .

A total of 50 bruised carcasses were sampled from 1000 young bulls (Brown Swiss X Zebu) of 18–24 months old and an average live weight of 450 ± 66 kg. The results showed significant differences between packaging systems and bruised vs non-bruised meat. The bruised meat caused higher biogenic amine concentrations than did non-bruised meat. We conclude that bruised meat favoured increments of biogenic amine concentrations, even more than did non-bruised meat. The plastic bag + vacuum system limited the increments of BA concentration during storage time therefore it improved shelf life of meat. These results emphasized the importance of implementing best management practices during pre-slaughter operations of cattle in order to reduce a possible risk factor for bruised meat." .

Many different antimicrobials are approved for beef cattle, and are used judiciously for animal welfare, and controversially, to promote growth and feed efficiency. Antimicrobial administration provides a powerful selective pressure that acts on the microbial community, selecting for resistance gene determinants and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria resident in the bovine flora. The bovine microbiota includes many harmless bacteria, but also opportunistic pathogens that may acquire and propagate resistance genes within the microbial community via horizontal gene transfer. Antimicrobial-resistant bovine pathogens can also complicate the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in beef feedlots, threatening the efficiency of the beef production system. Likewise, the transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes to bovine-associated human pathogens is a potential public health concern. This review outlines current antimicrobial use practices pertaining to beef production, and explores the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in major bovine pathogens. The effect of antimicrobials on the composition of the bovine microbiota is examined, as are the effects on the beef production resistome. Antimicrobial resistance is further explored within the context of the wider beef production continuum, with emphasis on antimicrobial resistance genes in the food chain, and risk to the human population." .

We isolate, fine map, and physically anchor Rps6 to chromosome 7H in barley. AbstractA plant may be considered a nonhost of a pathogen if all known genotypes of a plant species are resistant to all known isolates of a pathogen species. However, if a small number of genotypes are susceptible to some known isolates of a pathogen species this plant may be considered an intermediate host. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an intermediate host for Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. We wanted to understand the genetic architecture underlying resistance to Pst and to determine whether any overlap exists with resistance to the host pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh). We mapped Pst resistance to chromosome 7H and show that host and intermediate host resistance is genetically uncoupled. Therefore, we designate this resistance locus Rps6. We used phenotypic and genotypic selection on F2:3 families to isolate Rps6 and fine mapped the locus to a 0.1 cM region. Anchoring of the Rps6 locus to the barley physical map placed the region on a single fingerprinted contig spanning a physical region of 267 kb. Efforts are now underway to sequence the minimal tiling path and to delimit the physical region harboring Rps6. This will facilitate additional marker development and permit identification of candidate genes in the region." .

Mice that were genetically engineered to overexpress Fst specifically in muscle had at least twice the amount of skeletal muscle mass as controls; these findings are similar to earlier results obtained in myostatin-knockout mice. However, the role of follistatin in skeletal muscle development has yet to be clarified in livestock. Here, we describe transgenic Duroc pigs that exogenously express Fst specifically in muscle tissue. The transgenic pigs exhibited an increased proportion of skeletal muscle and a reduced proportion of body fat that were similar to those reported in myostatin-null cattle. The lean percentage of lean meat was significantly higher in the F1 generation of TG pigs (72.95 ± 1.0 %) than in WT pigs (69.18 ± 0.97 %) (N = 16, P < 0.05). Myofiber hypertrophy was also observed in the longissimus dorsi of transgenic pigs, possibly contributing to the increased skeletal muscle mass. Western blot analysis showed a significantly reduced level of Smad2 phosphorylation and an increased level of AktS473 phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle tissue of the transgenic pigs. Moreover, no cardiac muscle hypertrophy or reproductive abnormality was observed. These findings indicate that muscle-specific Fst overexpression in pigs enhances skeletal muscle growth, at least partly due to myofiber hypertrophy and providing a promising approach to increase muscle mass in pigs and other livestock." .

Despite the importance of sheep and goat production in Brazil, little it is known about the Sarcocystis species that infect small ruminants in the country and their potential impact on meat condemnation due to the presence of macroscopic cysts of the parasite. The aims of the present study were to determine the frequency of infection by Sarcocystis spp. in goats and sheep intended for human consumption in Bahia State, Brazil, as well as to identify the parasite species in selected samples. The entire tongue, esophagus, and heart were collected from 120 goats and 120 sheep. Tissues were examined for Sarcocystis spp. by macroscopic evaluation, light microscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular tests. Microscopic cysts of Sarcocystis spp. were detected in 95.8 % of sheep and 91.6 % of goats. Using either transmission electron microscopy or partial sequencing of the 18S region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) for species identification, Sarcocystis tenella and Sarcocystis arieticanis were observed in sheep and Sarcocystis capracanis in goats. Macroscopic cysts were not detected in the analyzed samples. We concluded that goats and sheep destined for human consumption in Bahia possess high frequencies of Sarcocystis infection. Carcass condemnation due to Sarcocystis macrocysts seems to be rare in the studied region. S. arieticanis and S. capracanis were confirmed for the first time by electron microscopy or by molecular tests in small ruminants from Brazil." .

This is reflected in increasing public and political focus on a more sustainable use of pesticides, as well as a reduction in diffuse pollution. Climate change will likely to lead to an even more intensive use of pesticides in the future, affecting agriculture in many ways. At the same time, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and associated EU policies called for a “good” ecological and chemical status to be achieved for water bodies by the end of 2015, currently delayed to 2021–2027 due to a lack of efficiency in policies and timescale of resilience for hydrosystems, especially groundwater systems. Water managers need appropriate and user-friendly tools to design agro-environmental policies. These tools should help them to evaluate the potential impacts of mitigation measures on water resources, more clearly define protected areas, and more efficiently distribute financial incentives to farmers who agree to implement alternative practices. At present, a number of reports point out that water managers do not use appropriate information from monitoring or models to make decisions and set environmental action plans. In this paper, we propose an integrated and collaborative approach to analyzing changes in land use, farming systems, and practices and to assess their effects on agricultural pressure and pesticide transfers to waters. The integrated modeling of agricultural scenario (IMAS) framework draws on a range of data and expert knowledge available within areas where a pesticide action plan can be defined to restore the water quality, French “Grenelle law” catchment areas, French Water Development and Management Plan areas, etc. A so-called “reference scenario” represents the actual soil occupation and pesticide-spraying practices used in both conventional and organic farming. A number of alternative scenarios are then defined in cooperation with stakeholders, including socio-economic conditions for developing alternative agricultural systems or targeting mitigation measures. Our integrated assessment of these scenarios combines the calculation of spatialized environmental indicators with integrated bio-economic modeling. The latter is achieved by a combined use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling with our own purpose-built land use generator module (Generator of Land Use version 2 (GenLU2)) and an economic model developed using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) for cost-effectiveness assessment. This integrated approach is applied to two embedded catchment areas (total area of 360,000 ha) within the Charente river basin (SW France). Our results show that it is possible to differentiate scenarios based on their effectiveness, represented by either evolution of pressure (agro-environmental indicators) or transport into waters (pesticide concentrations). By analyzing the implementation costs borne by farmers, it is possible to identify the most cost-effective scenarios at sub-basin and other aggregated levels (WFD hydrological entities, sensitive areas). Relevant results and indicators are fed into a specifically designed database. Data warehousing is used to provide analyses and outputs at all thematic, temporal, or spatial aggregated levels, defined by the stakeholders (type of crops, herbicides, WFD areas, years), using Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) tools. The aim of this approach is to allow public policy makers to make more informed and reasoned decisions when managing sensitive areas and/or implementing mitigation measures." .

Numerous studies suggest that fungal chemicals can affect insects in many different ways. Here, we apply the terminology established by insect-plant ecologists for categorizing the effect of fungal allelochemicals on insects and for evaluating the application potential of these chemicals in insect pest management. Our literature survey shows that fungal volatile and non-volatile chemicals have an enormous potential to influence insect behavior and fitness. Many of them still remain to be discovered, but some recent examples of repellents and toxins could open up new ways for developing safe insect control strategies. However, we also identified shortcomings in our understanding of the chemical ecology of insect-fungus interactions and the way they have been investigated. In particular, the mode-of-action of fungal allelochemicals has often not been appropriately designated or examined, and the way in which induction by insects affects fungal chemical diversity is poorly understood. This review should raise awareness that in-depth ecological studies of insect-fungus interactions can reveal novel allelochemicals of particular benefit for the development of innovative insect pest management strategies." .

In addition, the continuous fragmentation of the forest holdings has increased the threat of the passiveness related to forest management. To decrease the tendency towards passiveness, new policy tools and initiatives have been suggested. In the Finnish context, the idea of an investor-based jointly owned forest has been introduced as facilitating the effective utilization of the forest resource. However, collective ownership has faced prejudice and scepticism among private forest owners. In order to expand, the forest owners need to see the idea of jointly owned forests as a socially legitimate. Thus, by adopting Van Leeuwen’s framework for analyzing the legitimation of new social practices, we examine how Finnish forest owners legitimate their participation in jointly owned forests. The qualitative data of the study consist of 20 in-depth interviews with private forest owners who have joined a jointly owned forest. Our study contributes to the recent discussion on jointly owned forests. We show how a change in the type of ownership results in moral, authoritative and rational justifications over the decision while simultaneously renewing the identity of the forest owner. Accordingly, we suggest that forest ownership is not only driven by rational prospects, but the moral and emotional nature of ownership should be better taken into account at the policy level and in structural designs when discussing the promotion of new types of forest ownership." .

Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera L. cv.) dry white wines were bottled under six types of stoppers and stored for 18 months. The composition of phenolic compounds was analyzed, and the sensory attributes of these wines were evaluated by professional panel. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that bottle aging period exhibited a more important effect on phenolic compound evolution than stopper type. Most of the phenolic compounds disappeared after 18 months of bottle storage, whereas the wine sensory attributes were significantly improved after 15-month of bottle aging. No strong correlation existed between the phenolic variation and the dissolved oxygen content. Wine color characteristics developed towards better quality accompanying with the reduction of detectable hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavan-3-ols, while the wine mouth-feel was related mainly to gallic acid and ferulic acid ester. This work provided some references for wine producers to select appropriate storage duration for bottled white wine." .

The quality trait sedimentation volume but not protein content is mainly controlled by the Glu - A1, Glu - B1, Glu - D1, Gli - B1 , and Pinb - D1 loci which are differentially used in varieties from different European origins. AbstractProtein content and sedimentation volume are two important quality traits in wheat breeding. In this study, we used a panel of 407 European winter wheat cultivars to dissect the genetic architecture of both traits and to assess the potential of genomics-assisted breeding. All lines were phenotyped in multi-location field trials, genotyped by a genotyping-by-sequencing approach, and assessed for the alleles at the Glu-A1, Glu-B1, Glu-D1, Gli-B1, and Pinb-D1 candidate loci. Our analyses revealed no effect of the candidate loci on protein content, but a strong effect on sedimentation volume, with Glu-B1 and Gli-B1 explaining 24.6 and 19.5 % of the genotypic variance, respectively. The genome-wide scan identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for protein content which jointly explained only 18.5 % of the genotypic variance. In contrast, four QTL were detected for sedimentation volume most likely identifying the Glu-B1 and Gli-B1 candidate loci and explaining approximately 60 % of the genotypic variance. We observed differences for both traits between countries of origin of the cultivars, accompanied by corresponding geographic differences in QTL allele frequencies. Furthermore, a genome-wide prediction approach resulted in a higher predictive ability for both traits as compared to marker-assisted selection based on the identified QTL. Taken together, our results illustrate a different genetic architecture of the two quality traits and show the potential of their genomics-assisted improvement." .

To increase crop yield in dry cereal systems, vast farmland areas of high conservation value are being converted into irrigation, especially in Mediterranean countries. We analyze the effect of irrigation-driven changes on the farm biota by comparing species diversity, community composition, and species traits of arable plants within crop fields from two contrasting farming systems (dry and irrigated) in Spain. We sampled plant species within 80 fields of dry wheat, irrigated wheat, and maize (only cultivated under irrigation). Wheat crops held higher landscape and per field species richness, and beta diversity than maize. Within the same type of crop, irrigated wheat hosted lower plant diversity than dry wheat at both field and landscape scales. Floristic composition differed between crop types, with higher frequencies of perennials, cosmopolitan, exotic, wind-pollinated and C4 species in maize. Our results suggest that irrigation projects, that transform large areas of dry cereal agro-ecosystems into irrigated crop systems dominated by maize, erode plant diversity. An adequate planning on the type and proportion of crops used in the irrigated agro-ecosystems is needed in order to balance agriculture production and biodiversity conservation." .

Few systematic studies have been undertaken investigating farmers’ local knowledge related to this issue. Ethnoveterinary medicine (EVM) is a discipline focusing on local knowledge and folk methods in veterinary medicine, however most ethnoveterinarian studies primarily address the treatment of animal diseases. Very few studies have explored prophylactic methods. MethodsAn ethnoveterinary research project in Eastern Tyrol (Austria) was conducted in 2004 and 2005 to gather information about local knowledge of animal husbandry from 144 informants, with the emphasis on plants that maintain livestock health and welfare. ResultsInformants mentioned a total of 87 plants and 22 plant-based generic terms in the context of maintaining and improving livestock health and welfare. The most important preventive measures for maintaining and improving animal health and welfare were practices related to “fodder” and “feeding”. In this category the plants mentioned could be grouped according to three different perceptions about their effect on animals: “Good or bad fodder”, “Functional fodder” and “Fodder medicine”. In addition to fodder, environmental management, the human-animal relationship, household remedies and cultural/religious activities were also mentioned. When asked about practices in the past that maintained animal health and well-being, interviewees mentioned, for example, the importance of the diversity of sources that used to be available to obtain feed and fodder. ConclusionsThe informants’ approach that feeding is central to livestock welfare is in line with the standard scientific literature on animal health, including in organic farming. Various scientific studies into common fodder evaluate the nutritive and dietary value, efficiency and safety of fodder. Future studies also have to consider the evaluation of traditional, local fodder resources. In fact, the value of ‘food as medicine’ for humans in the context of local knowledge has been widely assessed, but the potential health benefits of fodder and nutraceuticals in local and traditional ethnoveterinary methods require further attention." .

AbstractCadmium (Cd) is a widespread and potentially toxic environmental pollutant, originating mainly from rapid industrial processes, the application of fertilizers, manures and sewage sludge, and urban activities. It is easily taken up by plants, resulting in obvious toxicity symptoms, including growth retardation, leaf chlorosis, leaf and root necrosis, altered structures and ultrastructures, inhibition of photosynthesis, and cell death. Therefore, alleviating Cd toxicity in plants is a major aim of plant research. Salicylic acid (SA) is a ubiquitous plant phenolic compound that has been used in many plant species to alleviate Cd toxicity by regulating plant growth, reducing Cd uptake and distribution in plants, protecting membrane integrity and stability, scavenging reactive oxygen species and enhancing antioxidant defense system, improving photosynthetic capacity. Furthermore, SA functions as a signaling molecule involved in the expression of several important genes. Significant amounts of research have focused on understanding SA functions and signaling in plants under Cd stress, but several questions still remain unanswered. In this article, the influence of SA on Cd-induced stress in plants and the potential regulation mechanism for alleviating Cd toxicity are reviewed." .

Five irrigation treatments were imposed: fully irrigated treatment (FIT), 25 % FIT, 50 % FIT, 75 % FIT, rainfed and an over-irrigation treatment (125 % FIT). There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference between irrigation frequencies regarding the maximum grain yield; however, at lower deficit irrigation regime, medium irrigation frequency resulted in lower grain yield. There was a decrease in grain yield with the 125 % FIT as compared to the FIT, which had statistically similar yield as 75 % FIT. Irrigation rate significantly impacted grain yield in 2005, 2006 and 2007, while irrigation frequency was only significant during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons (two dry years) and the interacting effect was only significant in the driest year of 2005 (P = 0.006).

The experimental area consisted of 32 paddocks with 0.25 ha of Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça. The experiment consisted of 96-day experimental periods, with three periods of 32 days. The strategies studied were P = exclusively on pasture and without concentrate supplementation (control), ES = pasture and supplemented with a concentrate low in protein, PS = pasture and supplemented with high protein content, and PES = pasture and supplementation with balanced protein-energy. There was reduced intake of DM in animals of the treatment P in relation to supplemented pasture, regardless of supplementation. Animals fed on ES showed an intake of more nutrients than the animals on PS. The CP and TDN were also lower in P than in pastures where animals received the additional types of concentrate, and the PS animals showed greater digestibility of CP and TDN than the ES animals. However, the animals exhibited similar weight gains. Animals on P ingested smaller amounts of N and had lower fecal excretion compared to the supplemented animals, but there was no difference between treatments in nitrogen balance. Urea nitrogen and urea from the blood were higher in the supplemented animals than in animals fed on pasture; these levels were also higher in PS animals compared to animals receiving ES.

We evaluated the importance of catchment land use, land cover, and local stream variables for macroinvertebrate community and functional trait diversity in 18 boreal headwater streams. Variation in macroinvertebrate metrics was often best explained by in-stream variables, primarily water chemistry (e.g. pH). However, variation in stream variables was, in turn, significantly associated with catchment-scale forestry land use. More specifically, streams running through catchments that were dominated by young (11–50 years) forests had higher pH, greater organic matter standing stock, higher abundance of aquatic moss, and the highest macroinvertebrate diversity, compared to streams running through recently clear-cut and old forests. This indicates that catchment-scale forest management can modify in-stream habitat conditions with effects on stream macroinvertebrate communities and that characteristics of younger forests may promote conditions that benefit headwater biodiversity." .

Several candidate genes and associated genetic markers were identified that could potentially be useful for alfalfa breeding to more efficiently develop improved cultivars. AbstractAlfalfa is one of the most widely cultivated forage legumes worldwide and improving alfalfa forage yield and nutritive value is a major global breeding goal. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) provides cost-effective molecular marker genotyping for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using more than 15,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified from GBS, we conducted a GWAS to investigate forage yield and nutritive value-related traits. We have detected a number of associations for all the traits evaluated and a number of associations detected were located on the Medicago truncatula genome. The SNP in a coding region of a cell wall biosynthesis gene was associated with several cell wall-related traits, and we suggest that it may be the causative polymorphism. Two other SNPs residing in meristematic development and early growth genes were found to associate with the total biomass yield. None of the SNPs associated with regrowth after harvest or with spring regrowth were mapped to the M. truncatula genome, possibly reflecting the fact that M. truncatula is an annual species related to alfalfa that typically has limited ability to regrow. The alleles we identify with the major impact on forage yield and nutritive value can be rapidly incorporated into our breeding program." .

Eggs from hens fed Camelina and Flax had the higher IgY concentration than those hens fed Control diet when expressed on a mg/g of yolk basis (P < 0.05). Although the egg weight was significantly lower in Camelina-fed hens, the total egg content of IgY was highest in eggs from hens fed Camelina (P < 0.05). ConclusionsThe egg n-3 fatty acid and IgY enhancing effect of dietary camelina seed warrants further attention into the potential of using camelina as a functional feed ingredient in poultry feeding." .

Cases of infanticide have rarely been reported in Neotropical carnivores. The objective of this study was to provide empirical evidence of infanticide in a local jaguar (Panthera onca) population in the Brazilian Pantanal. We present infanticide data from opportunistic sampling. Each month, from 2013 to 2015, we monitored pastures for evidence of livestock carcasses. A remotely triggered camera trap was placed at encountered fresh cattle carcasses. Through this monitoring, two cases of infanticide were recorded. Both cases occurred in close proximity to a cattle carcass, a large prey item that may attract multiple jaguars—including females with cubs around age of weaning—and increase the risk of infanticide. Our observations provide new empirical evidence of jaguar social behavior and intraspecific competitive interactions, potentially driven by locally high population density and resource provision." .

Semen samples of breeding bulls are collected and closely examined immediately after collection at artificial insemination centers. Only ejaculates without anomalous findings are retained for artificial insemination. Although morphological aberrations of the spermatozoa are a frequent reason for discarding ejaculates, the genetic determinants underlying poor semen quality are scarcely understood. ResultsA tail stump sperm defect was observed in three bulls of the Swedish Red cattle breed. The spermatozoa of affected bulls were immotile because of severely disorganized tails indicating disturbed spermatogenesis. We genotyped three affected bulls and 18 unaffected male half-sibs at 46,035 SNPs and performed homozygosity mapping to map the fertility disorder to an 8.42 Mb interval on bovine chromosome 13. The analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data of an affected bull and 300 unaffected animals from eleven cattle breeds other than Swedish Red revealed a 1 bp deletion (Chr13: 24,301,425 bp, ss1815612719) in the eleventh exon of the armadillo repeat containing 3-encoding gene (ARMC3) that was compatible with the supposed recessive mode of inheritance. The deletion is expected to alter the reading frame and to induce premature translation termination (p.A451fs26). The mutated protein is shortened by 401 amino acids (46 %) and lacks domains that are likely essential for normal protein function. ConclusionsWe report the phenotypic and genetic characterization of a sterilizing tail stump sperm defect in the Swedish Red cattle breed. Exploiting high-density genotypes and massive re-sequencing data enabled us to identify the most likely causal mutation for the fertility disorder in bovine ARMC3. Our results provide the basis for monitoring the mutated variant in the Swedish Red cattle population and for the early identification of infertile animals." .

Primary data were collected through a quantitative survey (structured questionnaire) with livestock farmers in the region. The analysis of the survey data was carried out with the use of descriptive statistics, Friedman’s test and factor analysis. The results indicate that strategies for livestock development in the region should take into account the great dissatisfaction that exists towards public authorities and the level of satisfaction as regards the non-governmental bodies. Furthermore, the economic objectives are of primary importance for livestock farmers, whereas they stress their interest in training and know-how. Particularly on issues pertaining to dairy livestock management, improving sanitation conditions and enhancing the quality, digestibility and production of animal feed." .

On-farm gain in grain yield (32 %) exceeded gain in trials, but at yield level about 25 dt ha −1 lower. Breeding progress was very successfully transferred into both progress in grain yield and on-farm baking quality. AbstractLong-term gains in grain yield and baking quality of 316 winter wheat varieties from German official trials were evaluated. We dissected progress into a genetic and a non-genetic part to quantify the contribution of genetic improvement. We further investigated the influence of genotype and environment on total variation by estimating variance components. We also estimated genetic and phenotypic correlation between quality traits. For trial data, we found a large gain in grain yield (24%), but a strong decline in protein concentration (−8.0%) and loaf volume (−8.5%) relative to 1983. Improvement of baking quality could be achieved for falling number (5.8%), sedimentation value (7.9%), hardness (13.4%), water absorption (1.2%) and milling yield (2.4%). Grain yield, falling number and protein concentration were highly influenced by environment, whereas for sedimentation value, hardness, water absorption and loaf volume genotypes accounted for more than 60% of total variation. Strong to very strong relations exist among protein concentration, sedimentation value, and loaf volume. On-farm yields were obtained from national statistics, and grain quality data from samples collected by national harvest survey. These on-farm data were compared with trial results. On-farm gain in grain yield was 31.6%, but at a mean level about 25 dt ha−1 lower. Improvement of on-farm quality exceeded trial results considerably. A shift to varieties with improved baking quality can be considered as the main reason for this remarkable improvement of on-farm baking quality." .

This review summarizes the information on the modern trends in dairy cattle genomic selection and the use of reproductive technologies allowing for the increase of breeding efficiency. The main trends in the advance of genomic selection are the improvement of the accuracy of breeding value estimations by pooling the reference populations; use of female genotyping in breeding programs; imputation of genotypes based on lower marker density SNP arrays; and prediction of animal genotypes from the genotyped relatives. Genomic selection can be even more profitable in combination with the state-of-the-art reproductive biotechnologies, such as semen sexing, multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, ovum pick-up followed by in vitro fertilization, embryo genotyping, and cloning of the best breeders. In dairy cattle genomic selection programs, biotechnological manipulations with gametes and embryos allow for the improvement of many factors determining breeding efficiency, namely, selection intensity, accurate breeding value assessment, and the generation interval. Successful embryo genotyping methods for numerous markers after biopsy at the morula or blastocyst stage are based on the whole-genome amplification of the embryo’s DNA. Eventually, these achievements will provide the grounds for new approaches to reducing the generation interval, selecting elite cows, reducing the inbreeding rate, etc." .

However, their productivity has only been done under conventional methods without an evaluation of their performance at varied soil moisture conditions. This information is needed for making sustainable management of irrigation water and also increased pasture productivity at the current intensification of the production systems. MethodsAboveground biomass of six rangeland grasses (Chloris roxburghiana, Eragrostis superba, Enteropogon macrostachyus, Cenchrus ciliaris, Chloris gayana, and Sorghum sudanense) in pure and mixed stands at 80, 50 and 30 % soil moisture field capacity (FC), and control under rainfed as main plots. The main plots were divided into 30 subplots and randomly allocated ten grass species in three replicates. The moisture content was monitored by gypsum blocks which aided in irrigation times and levels. Seeds were sown by broadcast method in tractor ploughed and harrowed to fine tilt land. Biomass and growth morphometric characteristics were measured at phenological growth stages of 10, 12 and 14 weeks, representing vegetative stage, flowering and seed setting and mature with ripened seed stages for the studied range grasses. ResultsAll the irrigated treatment yielded significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher above ground dry matter than the rainfed. S. sudanense had the highest yields at 80 % FC (13.7 t ha−1), though not significantly different from the 50 and 30 % FC (11.6 and 7.7 t ha−1), respectively. C. gayana and C. roxbhurghiana yields were not significantly affected by changes in soil moisture content with yields ranging between 10.1 and 10.8 t ha−1. C. ciliaris performed better at 50 % FC (9.1 t ha−1). Differences in tiller numbers across the watering treatments and grass species were not significant, but very low under rainfed conditions. The tiller heights in all the species were lower under rainfed than irrigated treatments. S. sudanense had the highest tiller height and biomass followed by C. gayana and E. Macrostachyus, respectively. ConclusionHere we demonstrate that the production of range pastures under irrigation in the arid environments should consider individual species’ responses to different soil moisture content for better yields and water conservation. The results show the species of importance for consideration under irrigation systems are S. sudanense and C. gayana." .

The concentration of REE in samples of soil and juice or solid residues of grape berries was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the index of bioaccumulation was calculated to define the specific assimilation of these elements from soil to grape berries. The concentration of REE in soil samples allowed an identification of each locality examined, and REE were mostly detected in solid grape berry residues in comparison to juice. These data may be useful to associate REE distribution in soil and grape berries to a specific geographical origin, in order to prevent fraudulent use of wine denomination labels." .

However, most of the binary vectors used in this technique, especially cloning based, contain antibiotic genes as selection marker that raise serious consumer and environmental concerns; moreover, they could be transferred to non-target hosts with deleterious effects. Therefore, the goal of this study was reconstruction of the widely used pBI121 binary vector by substituting the harmful antibiotic selection marker gene with a less-harmful selection marker, Basta (herbicide resistance gene). The generated vectors were designated as pBI121NB and pBI121CB, in which Basta gene was expressed under the control of Nos or CaMV 35S promoter, respectively. The successful integration of the new inserts into both the vectors was confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing. Both these vectors were used in transforming Arabidopsis, Egyptian wheat and barley varieties using LBA4404 and GV3101 Agrobacterium strains. The surfactant Tween-20 resulted in an efficient transformation and the number of Arabidopsis transformants was about 6–9 %. Soaked seeds of wheat and barley were transformed with Agrobacterium to introduce the bacteria to the growing shoot apices. The percentage of transgenic lines was around 16–17 and 14–15 % for wheat and barley, respectively.

Bovine besnoitiosis is considered to be a reemerging disease in Central and Western Europe. In addition, infection by Besnoitia spp. has been reported in reindeer from Sweden and Finland. Recently, the parasite was also detected in roe deer and red deer from Spain, where an interconnection between the domestic and sylvatic cycles of B. besnoiti has been presumed. In contrast, caprine besnoitiosis seems to be enzootic to Kenya and Iran. The presence of Besnoitia spp. in small domestic ruminants has never been explored in Europe, and the role that these species might play in the epidemiology of bovine besnoitiosis, as intermediate hosts or reservoirs of B. besnoiti, remains unknown. Herein, the first serosurvey conducted in European sheep and goats from areas in Spain where bovine besnoitiosis is endemic is described. Convenience sampling was conducted of 1943 sheep and 342 goats close to cattle from the Pyrenees and Central Spain that were infected with endemic Besnoitia spp. Serum samples were first analyzed by ELISA and then by confirmatory Western blot. Specific antibodies were not found in any sampled animal. Thus, sheep are unlikely to play a role in the epidemiology of bovine besnoitiosis, at least in the sampled areas. A larger serosurvey is necessary to determine whether goats might be a putative reservoir. To confirm the results of this study, sheep and goats should be further studied in other European countries and regions where their numbers are high and where bovine besnoitiosis is spreading." .

The study objective were to estimate the frequency of BTB, examine genetic diversity of the M. bovis population in cattle from five regions in Mali and to determine whether M. bovis is involved in active tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Samples from suspected lesions on cattle at the slaughterhouses were collected. Mycobacterial smear, culture confirmation, and spoligotyping were used for diagnosis and species identification. Mycobacterium DNA from TB patients was spoligotyped to identify M. bovis. ResultsIn total, 675 cattle have been examined for lesions in the five regions of Mali. Out of 675 cattle, 79 specimens presented lesions and then examined for the presence of M. bovis. Thus, 19 (24.1 %) were identified as M. bovis; eight (10.1 %) were non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM). Nineteen spoligotype patterns were identified among 79 samples with five novel patterns.

AbstractTuber yield (TY), starch content (TSC), and starch yield (TSY) are complex characters of high importance for the potato crop in general and for industrial starch production in particular. DNA markers associated with superior alleles of genes that control the natural variation of TY, TSC, and TSY could increase precision and speed of breeding new cultivars optimized for potato starch production. Diagnostic DNA markers are identified by association mapping in populations of tetraploid potato varieties and advanced breeding clones. A novel association mapping population of 282 genotypes including varieties, breeding clones and Andean landraces was assembled and field evaluated in Northern Spain for TY, TSC, TSY, tuber number (TN) and tuber weight (TW). The landraces had lower mean values of TY, TW, TN, and TSY. The population was genotyped for 183 microsatellite alleles, 221 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in fourteen candidate genes and eight known diagnostic markers for TSC and TSY. Association test statistics including kinship and population structure reproduced five known marker–trait associations of candidate genes and discovered new ones, particularly for tuber yield and starch yield. The inclusion of landraces increased the number of detected marker–trait associations. Integration of the present association mapping results with previous QTL linkage mapping studies for TY, TSC, TSY, TW, TN, and tuberization revealed some hot spots of QTL for these traits in the potato genome. The genomic positions of markers linked or associated with QTL for complex tuber traits suggest high multiplicity and genome wide distribution of the underlying genes." .

Nitrogen losses through surface runoff were measured for five treatments, including CK without N application, C200, C300 simulating the conventional practices, CO200, and CO300. Optimum N rate was applied for C200 and CO200, and 30% of chemical fertilizer was substituted with organic fertilizer for CO200 and CO300 with respect to C200 and C300, respectively. Rice season had higher runoff coefficients than wheat season. Approximately 52% of total N was lost as NH4 +-N in rice season, ranging from 21 to 83%, and in wheat season, the proportion of NO3 −-N in total N averaged 53% with a variation from 38 to 67%. The N treatments lost less total N in rice season (1.67–10.7 kg N ha−1) than in wheat season (1.72–17.1 kg N ha−1). These suggested that a key to controlling N runoff losses from rice-wheat rotation was to limit NO3 −-N accumulation in wheat season. In both seasons, N runoff losses for C200 and CO300 were lower than those for C300. CO200 better cut N losses than C200 and CO300, with 64 and 57% less N in rice and wheat seasons than C300, respectively.

MethodsCattle selected from herds with a history of Hypoderma infestation were grouped into blocks of three (Italy, 33 cattle; Germany, 30 cattle) or two (USA, 16 cattle) animals each, on the basis of positivity at the pre-treatment anti-Hypoderma antibody titres. Within each block, animals were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment regimens: saline (control); IVM LAI, administered at the predicted time of occurrence of first-instar larvae (Italy, Germany, USA); IVM LAI, administered at the predicted time of occurrence of second- and/or third-instar larvae (Italy, Germany). All treatments were administered by subcutaneous injection in correspondence of the area anterior to the shoulder at 1 ml/50 kg body weight, which corresponds to 630 mcg IVM/kg for IVM LAI. ResultsNo Hypoderma larvae emerged from animals treated with IVM LAI, whereas live H. lineatum (Italy) or H. bovis (Germany, USA) larvae were collected from saline-treated animals (P < 0.01). No adverse reactions to treatments were in any of the animals enrolled in the study. ConclusionsThe results from this study demonstrate that ivermectin in a long-acting formulation is 100 % efficacious in the treatment of cattle naturally infested by H. bovis and H. lineatum larvae at all stages of development. IVM LAI can, therefore, be used as ‘prophylactic’ treatment for Hypoderma spp. infestations in absence of external evidence of their presence and thus prior to skin and carcass damage, and as ‘therapeutic’ treatment, when warbles are already present." .

In this study, we analyzed interspecific associations of eleven dominant tree populations of varying development stages in an old-growth oak forest stand in the Qinling Mountains, China. We examined overall interspecific associations (multiple species) and pairwise interspecific associations (two species). ResultsInterspecific competition was intense during forest development and was the main factor driving succession. Community structure appears to become more stable over time which supports the harsh-benign hypothesis that interspecific competition is more common in stable sites. ConclusionOld growth oak (Quercus spp.) forests are distributed widely around the world in part due to oak being a typical K-selected species. K-selected species produce fewer, high-quality offspring with higher survival rates, strong competitive ability, and longevity. The resulting distribution shifted from clumped to random, likely as a result of intense interspecific competition creating ecological niche differentiation." .

On the day of sponge insertion, ewes were assigned to three treatments: the bST-100 treatment (n = 156) received 100 mg bST at the start of synchronization (d 0) and at the time of insemination (d 14), the bST-50 treatment (n = 159) received 50 mg bST in the same schedule as the previous group, and the control (n = 165) did not receive any bST. Lambing rate and percentage of multiple births were analyzed using the GENMOD procedure of SAS. Prolificacy data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The IGF-1 and insulin concentrations were analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures. The bST application did not affect the lambing rate (P = 0.06). The proportion of ewes with multiple births (P = 0.01) and prolificacy (P = 0.04) were higher in the bST-50 (54.3 % and 1.57 ± 0.1) than the bST-100 (18.2 % and 1.25 ± 0.1) and control (33.3 % and 1.28 ± 0.1) groups. The IGF-1 and insulin concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in the bST-treated groups, but the insulin concentration was higher (P = 0.001) in the bST-100 group than in the bST-50 group. The administration of 50 or 100 mg bST at the start of synchronization and at the time of artificial insemination does not increase lambing rate. However, the dose of 50 mg increased the proportion of multiple births and prolificacy." .

The aim of this study was to investigate breed differences in live weight, conformation, carcass traits and economic values for meat production among Red Maasai and Dorper sheep and their crosses. In total, 88 ram lambs, which were reared at the ILRI experimental station, Kapiti plains Estate in Central Kenya, were used for the study. The lambs were slaughtered at Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) at about 1 year of age. Prior to slaughter, the lambs were weighed, measured and assessed by experienced evaluators, and at the abattoir carcass traits were recorded. Large breed differences were found for most traits. Dorper lambs were heavier at delivery for slaughter and had better carcass grade but lower dressing percentage and fat levels than Red Maasai. Crossbreds were generally better than the parental breeds. Evaluators were willing to pay more for the Dorper lambs for slaughter although carcass weights later were shown not to be higher than for Red Maasai. Evaluators undervalued Red Maasai lambs by 8–13 % compared to Dorper lambs according to the prices quoted per kilogramme live or carcass weight by KMC. Live weight was better than any other live measure in predicting carcass weight. Due to the overall higher ranking of the crossbred lambs for meat production, Dorper may be useful as a terminal sire breed for crossing with Red Maasai ewes." .

However, data and guidelines on irrigation water management for the short-season cotton cultivation are lacking. In order to determine optimal irrigation practices for transplanted cotton in the NCP, a field experiment with surface drip and border irrigation was conducted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons. Four irrigation treatments, namely full drip (DT), full border (BT), deficit drip (DDT) and deficit border (DBT) irrigation treatments, were evaluated on the basis of vegetative growth, evapotranspiration (ET), cotton yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and fiber quality. Results showed that the average seasonal ET ranged from 358 to 449 mm. Compared to the border irrigation, the drip irrigation improved vegetative growth, and the deficit irrigation inhibited vegetative growth compared with the full irrigation. DT produced the highest seed cotton yield of 3164 kg ha−1, while the minimum seed cotton yield of 2459 kg ha−1 was produced in the DBT. On average, DDT produced the largest WUE of 0.83 kg m−3, while the smallest in BT. On average, 33.4 % of the irrigation water was saved by DT compared to BT, and drip irrigation increased seed cotton yield by 11.5 %. In addition, drip irrigation tended to increase the fiber length and optimize the micronaire value. Deficit irrigation significantly decreased the fiber strength and reduced the fiber length. Overall, the DT is recommended as the optimal irrigation strategy for the short-season cotton in the NCP." .

Although traditionally understood to affect primarily sheep and goats, it is also the predominant Brucella species that affects cows in some endemic areas. Despite this, no licensed vaccine is available specifically for use against B. melitensis in cows. The mainstay of most control programs is vaccination of sheep and goats with a live vaccine, Rev-1. The aim of this study was to investigate how critical vaccination of cows might be, in order to control B. melitensis on a mixed sheep-and-cattle farm. MethodsA dynamic, differential-equation, age-structured, seasonal model with births and deaths, was used to investigate whether vaccination of both sheep and cattle had an impact on time to elimination of brucellosis on an individual mixed species farm, when compared to vaccination of sheep only. The model was a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) model with an additional compartment for Persistently Infected (PI) individuals. Transmission parameters were fit based on a nation-wide probabilistic seroprevalence survey in Jordan. ResultsThe model predicted that it would take 3.5 years to eliminate brucellosis (to less than 0.5 % of adult sheep seropositive as a result of infection) on a mixed-species B. melitensis-endemic farm with the median field-study seroprevalence, following vaccination of both sheep and cattle, assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 80 %. Limiting the vaccination to sheep only, increased the time to 16.8 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that the finding that vaccination of cattle was of significant importance, was robust. Vaccine effectiveness had a strong influence on time to elimination. ConclusionsIn the absence of further data, vaccination of cattle should be considered essential in Brucella-endemic settings where mixed small ruminant and cattle flocks predominate. Further evidence that Brucella melitensis predominates in cattle in Jordan, as opposed to Brucella abortus, is needed in order to validate this model. The results may be applicable to other mixed-species settings with similar livestock management practices. These methods may be applied to other pathogens affecting multiple livestock species or with seasonal transmission." .

Chrome-tanned leather solid waste is primarily chromium complex of collagen protein. The presence of chromium limits its protein application in animal feed industry. The purified protein hydrolysate with zero chromium could be used in poultry feed. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess performance of poultry with purified protein hydrolysate as a feed derived from chrome-tanned leather waste as partial replacement of soyabean meal as a sole source of protein for growing broiler chickens. Growth study was conducted to evaluate the effect of feeding protein hydrolysate on performance and physiochemical characteristics of meat of broiler chickens. Two experimental diets containing various levels of protein hydrolysate (EI—20 % and EII—30 %) were evaluated. The comparative study was performed as control with soyabean meal. Daily feed intake, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio were measured from day 8 to day 35. At the end of the study, birds were randomly selected and slaughtered to evaluate for physiochemical characteristics of meat. Diet had significant effects on feed intake and body weight gain. Birds fed with 20 and 30 % protein hydrolysate consumed 9.5 and 17.5 % higher amount of feed and gained 6.5 and 16.6 % higher than soyabean meal-fed birds. The current study produced evidence that protein hydrolysate can replace up to 75 % of soyabean meal in broiler diets without affecting either growth performance or meat characteristics." .

Therefore, a greater understanding of the interaction of rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus during legume growth in saline soil is required. We investigated the efficiency of salt tolerance conferred by rhizobia in mycorrhizal Sesbania cannabina. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in which S. cannabina plants inoculated with Glomus mosseae BGC NM03D (GM), and two rhizobia strains Agrobacterium pusense YIC4105 (4105) and Neorhizobium huautlense YIC4083 (4083), were exposed to 100 and 200 mM NaCl. Under 200 mM NaCl stress, plants inoculated with 4105, rather than 4083, showed significant increases in shoot and root dry mass compared with non-inoculated plants. Simultaneously, a significant increase over GM-inoculated plants in mycorrhizal colonization and dependency was recorded for 4105 + GM-inoculated plants compared with 4083 + GM-inoculated plants. In addition, under NaCl stress, significant increases in the number and mass of nodules, nitrogenase activity, and leghemoglobin content of nodules occurred in 4105 + GM-inoculated plants compared with 4083 + GM-inoculated plants. Furthermore, the activities of antioxidant enzymes in rhizobia-inoculated plants were significantly higher in the GM + 4105 group than the 4083 + GM group. The malondialdehyde content of plants from the 4105 + GM group was significantly lower than in the 4083 + GM group. Thus, the results revealed a synergistic relationship among the 4105 and GM in alleviating salt stress in S. cannabina. Salt-tolerant rhizobia might improve the salinity tolerance of S. cannabina by enhancing the antioxidant system." .

In experiment 1, a total of 120 weaned piglets (Yorkshire × Landrace) (7.3 ± 1.9 kg) were allocated to five treatments, and four replications (pens) with six piglets/pen. In experiment 2, 40 male pigs (23.0 ± 2.2 kg) were allocated to five treatments and eight replications (individual pens). In both experiments, the control diet contained fish meal (FM) as the sole protein supplement (CPH0), while the experimental diets consisted of four different diets in which crude protein (CP) from FM in CPH0 was replaced by the CP from catfish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) by-product protein hydrolyzate (CPH) at four different levels: 100 % (CPH100), 75 % (CPH75), 50 % (CPH50) and 25 % (CPH25). The results in experiment 1 showed that the highest average daily gain (ADG) over the 5-week period after weaning was recorded for piglets on CPH100 (307 g/day), and the lowest for piglets fed CPH0 (287 g/day) (P < 0.01). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower in CPH100 (1.43 kg feed/kg gain) than in CPH0 (1.51 kg feed/kg gain) (P < 0.01). The piglets fed CPH100 were less affected by diarrhoea (6.55 %) than piglets fed the control diet CPH0 (17.3 %) after weaning, and faecal scores were also lower. In experiment 2, ADG was lowest in CPH0, and the cost/gain in pigs fed CPH100 was lowest in both weaning and growing pigs. In conclusion, it is possible to replace up to 100 % of the FM by CPH in diets for weaning and growing pigs, resulting in improved ADG and FCR, lower feed cost/gain as well as reduced diarrhoea incidence and improved faecal score." .

A study was conducted in Southwest Kansas to determine optimum limited irrigation strategies for grain sorghum. Objectives were to (1) calibrate and validate the AquaCrop model, (2) apply AquaCrop to assess the effect of varying climate, planting dates, and soil types on yield, and (3) evaluate water productivities and optimal irrigation needs. Experimental data of grain sorghum were used to calibrate and validate AquaCrop. Planting date was found to substantially affect biomass and grain yield, and hence, considerably affect water productivities. The highest grain water productivities were obtained with late planting in a wet season. Late planting was associated with lower irrigation requirements. Depending on local conditions, we recommend planting to occur between June 1st and June 10th. Grain sorghum yield was optimized on sandy soils of southwestern Kansas with irrigation of 100–275 mm for early, 150–275 mm for normal and 100–275 mm for late planting. The optimal irrigation on silt loam soils for the corresponding planting dates were 175–350, 175–250 and 125–250 mm, respectively, with the lowest and highest in the range being for the wet and dry climate season conditions. Fluctuations in grain sorghum prices had a substantial impact on economic water productivity. Overall planting grain sorghum under optimum conditions combined with deficit irrigation improved water productivity." .

AbstractHybrid wheat breeding has great potential to increase the global wheat grain yield level particularly in view of the increasing abiotic and biotic stress challenges as well as variable climatic conditions. For the long-term success of hybrid wheat breeding and the maximum exploitation of heterosis, high-yielding heterotic patterns must be established. Here, we propose a unified framework for hybrid breeding and the establishment of heterotic groups in autogamous crops and exemplify it for hybrid wheat breeding in Germany. A key component is the establishment of genetic distance between heterotic groups and in this context, we assessed genetic diversity in a global collection of 1110 winter wheat varieties released during the past decades in 35 countries but with a focus on European origin. Our analyses revealed the absence of major population structure but nevertheless suggest genetically distinct subgroups with potential for hybrid wheat breeding. Taking our molecular results and additional phenotypic data together, we propose how global genetic diversity can be used to accelerate and support reciprocal recurrent selection for the development of genetically distinct heterotic groups in hybrid wheat breeding." .

However, the overall development of aquaculture in India did not reach the levels as projected due to frequent disease outbreaks and related issues. Shrimp and fish are predominantly affected by viruses including white spot syndrome virus, monodon baculovirus, hepatopancreatic parvovirus, viral nervous necrosis, white tail disease, and hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis baculovirus that cause outbreaks across the countries. Owing to these viral pathogens, the production of aquaculture fishes and crustaceans has dramatically been dropped. There are no specific measures to control these viral infections since it causes mortality at all life stages of cultured aquatic organisms. Early detection of the diseases may be beneficial to prevent the spreading and mass mortality. In India, the Central Institute of Brackish Water Aquaculture has developed a non-invasive diagnostic tool for early and precise detection of monodon baculovirus infection in Indian tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon using SYBR Green-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. More than twenty-five cell lines from freshwater, brackish water, and marine fish have been developed, characterized, and stored in C. Abdul Hakeem College for research and viral diagnosis. This review reveals the distinctive tools that are being used in aquaculture for the detection of pathogens and preventive measures. Advanced molecular methods such as nested PCR and SYBR Green-based real-time PCR are found to be sensitive and effective for the quantitation. Simple and inexpensive methods such as microscopic evaluation and histopathological analysis detects the progression of the disease. These assays can be used as a diagnostic method for emerging diseases in addition to avoid forthcoming of another." .

Bias of within-cycle cross-validation and methods for improving the prediction accuracy were assessed. AbstractThe prospect of genomic selection has been frequently shown by cross-validation studies using the same genetic material across multiple environments, but studies investigating genomic selection across multiple breeding cycles in applied bread wheat breeding are lacking. We estimated the prediction accuracy of grain yield, protein content and protein yield of 659 inbred lines across five independent breeding cycles and assessed the bias of within-cycle cross-validation. We investigated the influence of outliers on the prediction accuracy and predicted protein yield by its components traits. A high average heritability was estimated for protein content, followed by grain yield and protein yield. The bias of the prediction accuracy using populations from individual cycles using fivefold cross-validation was accordingly substantial for protein yield (17–712 %) and less pronounced for protein content (8–86 %). Cross-validation using the cycles as folds aimed to avoid this bias and reached a maximum prediction accuracy of $$r_{\\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.51 for protein content, $$r_{\\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.38 for grain yield and $$r_{\\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.16 for protein yield. Dropping outlier cycles increased the prediction accuracy of grain yield to $$r_{\\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.41 as estimated by cross-validation, while dropping outlier environments did not have a significant effect on the prediction accuracy. Independent validation suggests, on the other hand, that careful consideration is necessary before an outlier correction is undertaken, which removes lines from the training population. Predicting protein yield by multiplying genomic estimated breeding values of grain yield and protein content raised the prediction accuracy to $$r_{\\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.19 for this derived trait." .

The oak chips were added before or after malolactic fermentation, and the analyses were performed after 12 months of aging. The treatment did not induce the expected increase in polymerization degree of anthocyanins and tannins because of the high tannins-to-anthocyanins ratio. No differences were found among control and treated wines in the color parameters. The contact with oak chips determined in all the treated wines the decrease in floral and fruity notes, the increase in the spicy and woody flavors, and the attenuation of vinous character. The Nero di Troia wines treated before malolactic fermentation showed softer oak and spicy characters, more fruity notes, and less ethereal character than the wines treated after malolactic fermentation." .

The biggest challenge for tea growers of India nowadays is to combat pests and diseases. Tea crop in India is infested by not less than 720 insect and mite species. At least four sucking pests and six chewing pests have well established themselves as regular pests causing substantial damage to this foliage crop. Various synthetic pesticides are widely used for the management of tea pests in India. Applications of such large quantity of pesticides could cause various problems such as development of resistance, deleterious effects on non-target organisms such as insect predators and parasitoids, upsetting the ecological balance, and accumulation of pesticide residues on tea leaves. There is a growing demand for organic tea or at least pesticide residue free tea in the international market which affects the export price. There is also a higher emphasis of implementation of new regulations on internationally traded foods and implementation of Plant Protection Code (PPC) for tea by the Government of India. This necessitates a relook into the usage pattern of synthetic pesticides on this crop. There are various non-chemical interventions which are being worked out for their sustainability, compatibility, and eco-friendly properties which can gradually replace the use of toxic chemicals. The application of plant extracts with insecticidal properties provides an alternative to the synthetic pesticides. Botanical products, especially neem-based products, have made a relatively moderate impact in tea pest control. Research has also demonstrated the potential of 67 plant species as botanical insecticides against tea pests. The majority of plant products used in pest management of tea in India are in the form of crude extracts prepared locally in tea garden itself, and commercial standardized formulations are not available for most of the plants due to lack of scientific research in the area. Apart from systematic research in this area, to facilitate the simplified and trade friendly registration procedures with quality assurance of the products, there is an increasing need of regulatory authority and national norms in India." .

Because of this these factors are considered as hazardous for crop production. Drought stress elicits a plethora of responses in plants resulting in strict amendments in physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes. Photosynthesis is the most fundamental physiological process affected by drought due to a reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate and disruption of primary photosynthetic reactions and pigments. Drought also expedites the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering a cascade of antioxidative defense mechanisms, and affects many other metabolic processes as well as affecting gene expression. Details of the drought stress-induced changes, particularly in crop plants, are discussed in this review, with the major points: 1) leaf water potentials and water use efficiency in plants under drought stress; 2) increased production of ROS under drought leading to oxidative stress in plants and the role of ROS as signaling molecules; 3) molecular responses that lead to the enhanced expression of stress-inducible genes; 4) the decrease in photosynthesis leading to the decreased amount of assimilates, growth, and yield; 5) the antioxidant defense mechanisms comprising of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and the other protective mechanisms; 6) progress made in identifying the drought stress tolerance mechanisms; 7) the production of transgenic crop plants with enhanced tolerance to drought stress." .

Tree felling and processing productivity were estimated at 8.64 m3 per productive machine hour (PMH−1) and 10.21 m3 PMH−1, respectively. Wood felling and processing times were strongly dependent on dbh and total tree volume. However, when manual debarking was also considered the productivity rates decreased to 1.96 and 1.43 m3 PMH−1, respectively. Skidding productivity was calculated to be 3.35 m3 PMH−1 for TL and 7.17 m3 PMH−1 for WA, respectively. Strong correlations have been found between the net skidding time and (a) the skidding distance and (b) the load per turn in both wood harvesting systems. Production costs varied greatly, from 19.38 € m−3 up to 44.81 € m−3 of roundwood depending on the harvesting system and the inclusion of debarking. The findings suggest that the WA system is more efficient in terms of productivity and production cost than TL, and that there is a substantial optimization potential. The optimization potential can be encoded in four suggestions: (a) opening up of more forest roads to reduce high skidding times, (b) replacement of manual debarking by mechanical debarking at the sawmill, (c) replacement of old pieces of equipment with newer ones and (d) training of the existing workforce." .

Investigations of naturally occurring respiratory infections in a herd setting are an opportunity for accurate estimates of the consequences. This article presents estimates based on individual monitoring of weight and concentrate intake of several hundred bulls previous to, during and after a respiratory infection outbreak with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) as the main pathogen. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between exposure to BRSV, weight gain and feed conversion rate, quantify any change in these parameters, and estimate the duration of the change in production. ResultsA comparison of growth curves for the bulls that were present during the outbreak revealed that bulls with severe clinical signs had a clear and consistent trend of poorer growth rate than those with milder or no signs. The weight/age-ratio was 0.04–0.10 lower in the severely affected bulls, and evident throughout the study period of 8 months. A comparison of growth rates between apparently healthy bulls being present during the outbreak and a comparable group of bulls exactly 1 year later (n = 377) showed a reduced growth rate of 111 g/day in the first group. The difference amounted to 23 extra days needed to reach the reference weight. Feed conversion was also reduced by 79 g weight gain/kilogram concentrate consumed in the outbreak year. ConclusionThis study indicates significant negative effects on performance of animals that develop severe clinical signs in the acute stage, and that the growth and production is negatively affected many months after apparent recovery. In addition, the performance of apparently healthy animals that are exposed during an outbreak are severely negatively affected. The duration of this decrease in production in animals after recovery, or animals that have not shown disease at all, has not previously been documented. These losses will easily be underestimated, but contribute significantly to the costs for the producer. The findings emphasize the importance of BRSV infection for profitability and animal welfare in cattle husbandry. The study also illustrates that utilising intra-herd comparison of health and production parameters is a productive approach to estimate consequences of an outbreak." .

This crop has a positive energy balance being irrigation water the largest energy consumer during the growing cycle. Thence, it is important to know the biomass sorghum water requirements, in order to minimize irrigation losses, thus saving water and energy. The objective of this study was to quantify the water use and crop coefficients of irrigated biomass sorghum without soil water limitations during two growing seasons. A weighing lysimeter located in Albacete (Central Spain) was used to measure the daily biomass sorghum evapotranspiration (ETc) throughout the growing season under sprinkler irrigation. Seasonal lysimeter ETc was 721 mm in 2007 and 691 mm in 2010. The 4 % higher ETc value in 2007 was due to an 8 % higher evaporative demand in that year. Maximum average K c values of 1.17 in 2007 and 1.21 in 2010 were reached during the mid-season stage. The average K c values for the 2 years of study were K c-ini: 0.64 and K c-mid: 1.19. The seasonal evaporation component was estimated to be about 18 % of ETc. The average basal K c (K cb) values for the two study years were K cb-ini: 0.11 and K cb-mid: 1.17.

Minimizing external inputs is especially challenging in feeding of piglets, because the high-quality protein feeds needed to meet their demand are usually not available on farm or at least not in sufficient quantity. In an experiment, 1509 piglets were allocated to six different feeding strategies before and shortly after weaning at 49 days. Each feeding strategy was a combination of one out of three 100 % organic concentrates differing in external input demand (bought in protein-rich feeds) and one out of two forages (grass-clover silage and straw). The type of forage had no influence on piglets’ performance before and after weaning, but the type of concentrate had: the lowest quality concentrate with the lowest amount of external inputs led to the lowest daily weight gain, while the medium- and high-external input demand concentrates did not differ. The higher the proportion of external inputs, the better the concentrate conversion ratio but also the higher the price. Despite slower growth, the time and amount of concentrate needed to raise a 20-kg piglet were not influenced by dietary treatment and neither was piglet health. Therefore, the use of the cheapest concentrate with the lowest proportion of external inputs can be recommended for piglets with a 49-day suckling period and under generally good management conditions." .

AbstractSeed dormancy can increase the probability of survival of at least some progeny under unstable environmental conditions. In wild emmer wheat, only one of the two grains in a spikelet germinates during the first rainy season following maturation; and this within-plant variation in seed dormancy is associated with both grain dimension differences and position within the spikelet. Here, in addition to characterizing these associations, we elucidate the genetic mechanism controlling differential grain dimensions and dormancy within wild tetraploid wheat spikelets using phenotypic data from a wild emmer × durum wheat population and a high-density genetic map. We show that in wild emmer, the lower grain within the spikelet is about 30 % smaller and more dormant than the larger, upper grain that germinates usually within 3 days. We identify a major locus on the long arm of chromosome 4B that explains >40 % of the observed variation in grain dimensions and seed dormancy within spikelets. This locus, designated QGD-4BL, is validated using an independent set of wild emmer × durum wheat genetic stocks. The domesticated variant of this novel locus on chromosome 4B, likely fixed during the process of wheat domestication, favors spikelets with seeds of uniform size and synchronous germination. The identification of locus QGD-4BL enhances our knowledge of the genetic basis of the domestication syndrome of one of our most important crops." .

Concerning the comparison among the studied durum wheat kernel cultivars, Sculptur was the one with the highest amount and variability of volatile compounds. This cultivar stood out for the highest level of alkanes and ketones, while Anco Marzio contained higher levels of aldehydes and alkenes.

The conditions for degrading of five selected pesticides including chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil, pyrimethanil, atrazine and isoproturon with the purified laccases from Trametes versicolor were optimized. The results showed that the optimum conditions for the highest activity were pH at 5.0 and temperature at 25 °C. The best mediators were violuric acid for pyrimethanil and isoproturon, vanillin for chlorpyrifos, and acetosyringone and HBT for chlorothalonil and atrazine, respectively. The laccase was found to be stable at a pH range from 5.0 to 7.0 and temperature from 25 to 30 °C. It was observed that each pesticide required a different laccase mediator concentration typically between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L. In the experiment, the degradation rates of pyrimethanil and isoproturon were significantly faster than those of chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil and atrazine. For example, it was observed that pyrimethanil and isoproturon degraded up to nearly 100% after 24 hours while the other three pesticides just reached up 90% of degradation after 8 days of incubation." .

Consumption of some fatty acids has been associated with human health traits such as blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to investigate genetic variation in content of fatty acids present in meat. Previously publications reported regions of the cattle genome that are additively associated with variation in fatty acid content. This study evaluated epistatic interactions, which could account for additional genetic variation in fatty acid content. ResultsEpistatic interactions for 44 fatty acid traits in a population of Angus beef cattle were evaluated with EpiSNPmpi. False discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at 5 % and was limited to well-represented genotypic combinations. Epistatic interactions were detected for 37 triacylglyceride (TAG), 36 phospholipid (PL) fatty acid traits, and three weight traits. A total of 6,181, 7,168, and 0 significant epistatic interactions (FDR < 0.05, 50-animals per genotype combination) were associated with Triacylglyceride fatty acids, Phospholipid fatty acids, and weight traits respectively and most were additive-by-additive interactions. A large number of interactions occurred in potential regions of regulatory control along the chromosomes where genes related to fatty acid metabolism reside. ConclusionsMany fatty acids were associated with epistatic interactions. Despite a large number of significant interactions, there are a limited number of genomic locations that harbored these interactions. While larger population sizes are needed to accurately validate and quantify these epistatic interactions, the current findings point towards additional genetic variance that can be accounted for within these fatty acid traits." .

For this purpose, we compared diversity and composition of understory vegetation in a managed desert plantation in Egypt with adjacent natural vegetation. In 126 stands, we estimated the diversity indices of the understory vegetation associated with five tree plantations inside and outside the forest. The results showed that therophytes had the highest contribution to the total flora of the study area (45.7 %), followed by chamaephytes (21.7 %). The weed species were the main components inside the forest (37 species). In the stands of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Khaya senegalensis, the agricultural weeds were the most abundant followed by natural weeds. Spring season was the main flourishing season for weeds followed by autumn. Dalbergia sissoo had the highest values for species richness (8.8) and the lowest for species turnover (2.5). On the contrary, Casuarina spp. had the lowest values of species richness (3.0) and the highest of species turnover (7.3) and Simpson index (12.3). Establishment of the forest leads to remarkable loss and changes in the biodiversity of natural desert vegetation and vegetation composition, respectively. Many ruderal weeds colonized the adjacent desert habitats. From this study, we concluded that forest managers should pay attention for the conservation and retention of existing native vegetation during their design for the desert plantations." .

The aim of the present study was the development of a standardized technique for adult Artemia production in small volumes (25–100 L), and the assessment of ongrowing and enrichment diets for enhancement of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) content. We firstly assessed the effect of initial nauplii density (1, 2, and 3 nauplii mL−1) and food dose (x1, x2, and x3 quantities of mixed Tisochrysis lutea, Spirulina, and Prolon) for production of Artemia. Intermediate nauplii densities and food doses yielded the best overall results (44–46% survival; 5.6–5.9-mm length; 365–456 μg Artemia −1). Secondly, four diets (mixtures of Tisochrysis lutea, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Spirulina sp., Prolon, and Red Pepper) were tested for ongrowing. Ten short-time enrichments (STEs; 30 h) and a long-time enrichment (LTE; 9 days) were also assayed for n-3 HUFA (Highly unsaturated fatty acids) enhancement. The improvement in n-3 HUFA was rather limited in STE. However, LTE on a mixture of P. tricornutum, Prolon, and Red Pepper (regardless of further STE) in ongrowing Artemia yielded the highest contents in total fatty acids and in 20:4n-6 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3, and 22:6n-3. The quality of LTE Artemia was based on an equilibrated dietary source of protein (Spirulina), 20:5n-3 (P. tricornutum), and 22:6n-3 (Red Pepper). STE Artemia had a quality similar or even higher than that of captured zooplankton, and its use in our laboratory for the feeding of seahorses significantly enhanced breeding and newborn quality." .

However, knowledge about how these two factors influence soil ecosystem functions is still lacking. Furthermore, in forest ecosystems tree genotypes co-occur and interact with each other, thus the effects of tree genotypic diversity on soil ecosystem functions merit attention. Here we investigated the effects of tree species, tree genotypes and genotypic diversity levels, alongside soil physicochemical properties, on the overall and specific soil enzyme activity patterns. Our results indicate that tree species identity, tree genotypes and genotypic diversity level have significant influences on overall and specific soil enzyme activity patterns. These three factors influence soil enzyme patterns partly through effects on soil physicochemical properties and substrate quality. Variance partitioning showed that tree species identity, genotypic diversity level, pH and water content all together explained ~30% variations in the overall patterns of soil enzymes. However, we also found that the responses of soil ecosystem functions to tree genotypes and genotypic diversity are complex, being dependent on tree species identity and controlled by multiple factors. Our study highlights the important of inter- and intra-specific variations in tree species in shaping soil ecosystem functions in a subtropical forest." .

The aim of the study was to compare the activity, functional diversity and community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) of soil microorganisms in Scots pine forests of the boreal and temperate climatic zones. The soil samples were taken from the O and A soil horizons in northern Finland (boreal pine forest, BP) and Poland (dry and mesic temperate pine forest, TDP and TMP, respectively) and measured for water-holding capacity, pH, organic C, dissolved organic C (DOC) and the total contents of N, P, Ca, Mg, K, Na and Mn. The microbial activity (multiple substrate-induced respiration rate) and functional diversification (community-level physiological profiles, CLPPs) were assessed using the MicroResp™ system with 22 different C substrates. The BP soils were finer textured and contained more Ca, K, Mg, Mn and Na but less N and P than the soils under the temperate forests. The pH values did not differ between the studied forests. The studied pine forests did not differ in the measured microbial properties in the O horizon. However, in the A horizon, the microorganisms from the BP soil were less active and less functionally diverse than those from the temperate forest soils. The CLPPs of the BP soils differed from those of the temperate forest soils, wherein the largest difference was from the use of carboxylic acids and amino acids. The microorganisms from the BP soils used carboxylic acids more efficiently but were much less efficient in decomposing amino acids than those from the temperate forest soils. These differences were related to the contents of DOC, N and P which are influenced by climate and bedrock properties. Our results indicate that soil microbial properties in the O horizon depend mainly on the vegetation, whereas in deeper layers, they depend to a larger extent on bedrock properties and climatic conditions." .

Merino, Damara and Dorper sheep breeds have been described as having different levels of tolerance to SWL. In this work, we assess their liver and muscle metabolomes, and compare the responses to feed restriction. Ram lambs from each breed were divided into growth and feed restricted groups, over 42 days. Tissue metabolomes were assessed by 1H-NMR. The Dorper restricted group showed few changes in both tissues, suggesting higher tolerance to nutritional scarcity. The Merinos exhibited more differences between treatment groups. Major differences were related to fat and protein mobilization, and antioxidant activity. Between the Damara groups, the main differences were observed in amino acid composition in muscle and in energy-related pathways in the liver. Integration of present results and previous data on the same animals support the hypothesis that, Dorper and Damara breeds are more tolerant to SWL conditions and thus, more suitable breeds for harsh environmental conditions." .

AbstractGenomic selection (GS) is a promising method for the selection of quantitatively inherited traits but its most effective implementation in routine hybrid breeding schemes requires further research. We compared five breeding strategies and varied their available budget, the costs for doubled haploid (DH) line and hybrid seed production as well as variance components for grain yield in a wide range. In contrast to previous studies, we included a nursery selection for disease resistance just before GS on grain yield. The breeding strategy GSrapid with moderate nursery selection followed by one stage GS and one final stage with phenotypic selection on grain yield had the highest annual selection gain across all strategies, budgets, costs and variance components considered and we, therefore, highly recommend its use in hybrid breeding of cereals. Although selecting on traits not correlated with grain yield in the observation nursery, this selection reduced the selection gain of grain yield, especially in the breeding schemes with GS and for selected fractions smaller than 0.3. Owing to the very high number of test candidates entering breeding strategies with GS, the costs for DH line production had a larger impact on the annual selection gain than the hybrid seed production costs. The optimum allocation of test resources maximizing annual selection gain in classical two-stage phenotypic selection on grain yield and for the recommended breeding strategy GSrapid is finally explored for maize, wheat, rye, barley, rice and triticale." .

Optimum contribution selection is a method that seeks the optimum way to select for genetic improvement while controlling the rate of inbreeding. MethodsA novel iterative algorithm, Gencont2, for calculating optimum genetic contributions was developed. It was validated by comparing it with a previous program, Gencont, on three datasets that were obtained from practical breeding programs in three species (cattle, pig and sheep). The number of selection candidates was 2929, 3907 and 6875 for the pig, cattle and sheep datasets, respectively. ResultsIn most cases, both algorithms selected the same candidates and led to very similar results with respect to genetic gain for the cattle and pig datasets. In cases, where the number of animals to select varied, the contributions of the additional selected candidates ranged from 0.006 to 0.08 %. The correlations between assigned contributions were very close to 1 in all cases; however, the iterative algorithm decreased the computation time considerably by 90 to 93 % (13 to 22 times faster) compared to Gencont. For the sheep dataset, only results from the iterative algorithm are reported because Gencont could not handle a large number of selection candidates. ConclusionsThus, the new iterative algorithm provides an interesting alternative for the practical implementation of optimal contribution selection on a large scale in order to manage inbreeding and increase the sustainability of animal breeding programs." .

We investigated the viability of this population by exploring farmer attitudes toward crane damage in two regions of the Western Cape, the Swartland and Overberg, using semi-structured interviews. Perceptions of cranes differed widely between regions: farmers in the Swartland perceived crane flocks to be particularly damaging to the feed crop sweet lupin (65 % of farmers reported some level of damage by cranes), and 40 % of these farmers perceived cranes as more problematic than other common bird pests. Farmers in the Overberg did not perceive cranes as highly damaging, although there was concern about cranes eating feed at sheep troughs. Farmers who had experienced large flocks on their farms and farmers who ranked cranes as more problematic than other bird pests more often perceived cranes to be damaging to their livelihoods. Biographical variables and crop profiles could not be related to the perception of damage, indicating the complexity of this human-wildlife conflict. Farmers’ need for management alternatives was related to the perceived severity of damage.

Controlling Se uptake, metabolism, translocation and accumulation in plants is important to decrease potential health risks and helping to select proper biofortification methods to improve the nutritional content of plant-based foods. The uptake and distribution of Se, changes in Se content, and effects of various concentrations of Se in two forms (sodium selenite and sodium selenate) on sunflower and maize plants were measured in nutrient solution experiments. Results revealed the Se content in shoots and roots of both sunflower and maize plants significantly increased as the Se level increased. In this study, the highest exposure concentrations (30 and 90 mg/L, respectively) caused toxicity in both sunflower and maize. While both Se forms damaged and inhibited plant growth, each behaved differently, as toxicity due to selenite was observed more than in the selenate treatments. Sunflower demonstrated a high Se accumulation capacity, with higher translocation of selenate from roots to shoots compared with selenite. Since in seleniferous soils, a high change in plants’ capability exists to uptake Se from these soils and also most of the cultivated crop plants have a bit tolerance to high Se levels, distinction of plants with different Se tolerance is important.

AbstractSoil salinity covers a large part of the arable land of the world and is a major factor for yield losses in salt-sensitive crops, such as rice. Different gene families that respond to salinity have been identified in rice, but limited success has been achieved in developing salt-tolerant cultivars. Therefore, 21 salt stress-responsive candidate genes belonging to different gene families were re-sequenced to analyse their genetic variation and association with salt tolerance. The average single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density was 16 SNPs per kbp amongst these genes. The identified nucleotide and haplotype diversity showed comparatively higher genetic variation in the transporter family genes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed significant associations of SNPs in BADH2, HsfC1B, MIPS1, MIPS2, MYB2, NHX1, NHX2, NHX3, P5CS1, P5CS2, PIP1, SIK1, SOS1, and SOS2 genes with the salt-tolerant phenotype. A combined analysis of SNPs in the 21 candidate genes and eight other HKT transporter genes produced two separate clusters of tolerant genotypes, carrying unique SNPs in the ion transporter and osmoticum-related genes. Haplotype network analysis showed all the major and few minor alleles distributed over distant geographic regions. Minor haplotypes may be recently evolved alleles which migrated to distant geographic regions and may represent recent expansion of Indian wild rice. The analysis of genetic variation in different gene families identified the relationship between adaptive variations and functional significance of the genes. Introgression of the identified alleles from wild relatives may enhance the salt tolerance and consequently rice production in the salinity-affected areas." .

The degradation of natural resources has been aggravated by several other factors: the actual lifestyle of consumer societies, the rapid growth of emerging countries, rising inequalities among regions, and the reduction of the life cycle time for each product requiring a high consumption of limited resources. Sustainable industrial practices can contribute to the development of more sustainable products and processes. It is critical to apply eco-design principles and develop greener products and production processes, reducing impacts associated with its production and consumption. An environmental impact assessment should be taken into account from the early design and production phases, through all the stages of a product’s life until disposal. As public interest in additive manufacturing grows, its increasing usage for the production of final parts can support a drive towards more sustainable manufacturing processes. To introduce sustainability awareness during extrusion-based additive manufacturing productions, a study of the production of a part in terms its building orientation and internal filling, regarding the production time, energy consumption and end-of-life scenarios is considered. By combining the additive processes with eco-design, a higher awareness is possible, which results in added value to the produced parts while maintaining the part’s objective performance." .

A total of 1826 bulls finished in feedlot conditions and slaughtered at 24 months of age on average were used. The following carcass and meat traits were analysed: subcutaneous fat thickness (BF), shear force (SF) and total intramuscular fat (IMF). The fatty acid (FA) profile of the Longissimus thoracis samples was determined. Twenty-five FAs (18 individuals and seven groups of FAs) were selected due to their importance for human health. The animals were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip and, after quality control for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), only 470,007 SNPs from 1556 samples remained. The model included the random genetic additive direct effect, the fixed effect of the contemporary group and the animal’s slaughter age as a covariable. The (co)variances and genetic parameters were estimated using the REML method, considering an animal model (single-step GBLUP). A total of 25 multi-trait analyses, with four traits, were performed considering SF, BF and IMF plus each individual FA. The heritability estimates for individual saturated fatty acids (SFA) varied from 0.06 to 0.65, for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) it varied from 0.02 to 0.14 and for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) it ranged from 0.05 to 0.68. The heritability estimates for Omega 3, Omega 6, SFA, MUFA and PUFA sum were low to moderate, varying from 0.09 to 0.20. The carcass and meat traits, SF (0.06) and IMF (0.07), had low heritability estimates, while BF (0.17) was moderate. The genetic correlation estimates between SFA sum, MUFA sum and PUFA sum with BF were 0.04, 0.64 and −0.41, respectively. The genetic correlation estimates between SFA sum, MUFA sum and PUFA sum with SF were 0.29, −0.06 and −0.04, respectively. The genetic correlation estimates between SFA sum, MUFA sum and PUFA sum with IMF were 0.24, 0.90 and −0.67, respectively. The selection to improve meat tenderness in Nellore cattle should not change the fatty acid composition in beef, so it is possible to improve this attribute without affecting the nutritional beef quality in zebu breeds. However, selection for increased deposition of subcutaneous fat thickness and especially the percentage of intramuscular fat should lead to changes in the fat composition, highlighting a genetic antagonism between meat nutritional value and acceptability by the consumer." .

AbstractWheat is one of the most widely grown food grain crops in the world. The construction of a genetic map is a key step to organize biologically or agronomically important traits along the chromosomes. In the present study, an integrated linkage map of einkorn wheat was developed using 109 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter sub-specific cross, KT1-1 (T. monococcum ssp. boeoticum) × KT3-5 (T. monococcum ssp. monococcum). The map contains 926 molecular markers assigned to seven linkage groups, and covers 1,377 cM with an average marker interval of 1.5 cM. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of five agronomic traits identified 16 stable QTL on all seven chromosomes, except 6A. The total phenotypic variance explained by these stable QTL using multiple regressions varied across environments from 8.8 to 87.1 % for days to heading, 24.4–63.0 % for spike length, 48.2–79.6 % for spikelet number per spike, 13.1–48.1 % for plant architecture, and 12.2–26.5 % for plant height, revealing that much of the RIL phenotypic variation had been genetically dissected. Co-localizations of closely linked QTL for different traits were frequently observed, especially on 3A and 7A. The QTL on 3A, 5A and 7A were closely associated with Eps-A m 3, Vrn1 and Vrn3 loci, respectively. Furthermore, this genetic map facilitated the anchoring of 237 T. urartu scaffolds onto seven chromosomes with a physical length of 26.15 Mb. This map and the QTL data provide valuable genetic information to dissect important agronomic and developmental traits in diploid wheat and contribute to the genetic ordering of the genome assembly." .

Besides direct defences, such as the production of toxins, plants may also indirectly protect themselves by emitting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that attract the natural enemies of herbivores. Parasitoid wasps are known to use these VOCs to localize hosts for their offspring. However, domestication and selective breeding of crop plants have reportedly led to the loss of such signals. The aim of this study was to identify possible differences in the attraction of parasitoid wasps by modern maize and its wild ancestors, the teosintes. In a six-arm olfactometer, we compared the capacity of teosintes and maize to attract the parasitoid wasps Cotesia marginiventris (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Campoletis sonorensis (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). We studied the attractiveness of plants in which VOC emission was induced by the application of artificial damage and caterpillar regurgitant, as well as the attractiveness of extracts of volatiles that we collected from plants exposed to herbivory. C. sonorensis did not distinguish between the odours of maize and teosintes, whereas C. marginiventris showed a significant preference for the odours of teosintes over the odours of maize. The fact that we obtained very similar results with extracts of collected volatiles implies that we could use these extracts to identify the key compounds that are responsible for wasp attraction. Restoring and/or enhancing such key parasitoid attractants in cultivated plants could be an effective way to increase natural pest control." .

Data on tongues from 12 healthy cattle-yaks were collected. The results show that five types of papillae were identifiable on the tongue surface of the cattle-yak. Among these, three types were mechanical papillae (filiform, conical, and lenticular), and two types were gustatory papillae (vallate and fungiform). Some morphological features of the cattle-yak tongue were similar to those of domestic ruminants, but the lingual prominence was higher and more developed. For example, more mechanical papillae were present and they were covered by a thicker, keratinized epithelium, the conical papillae possibly perform an immune function, the fungiform papillae have more mucussecreting pores, and the sublingual glands were more developed. This research will provide a further and detailed source of morphological information about the cattle-yak that is currently lacking in species-specific studies on the morphology of the Bovidae family." .

Since the data on the worldwide prevalence of R. equi in meat animals are scarce, the present study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of R. equi in swine, cattle and horse carcasses intended for human consumption in Poland. ResultsTotally 1028 lymph node samples were examined. R. equi was isolated from 26.6 % (105/395) swine and 1.3 % (3/234) bovine healthy submaxillary lymph nodes. In horses, R. equi was isolated only from 0.5 % (1/198) samples of middle tracheo-branchiales lymph node while no lymphocentrum retropharyngeum sample was positive (0/198). The purulent lesions were observed only in 0.8 % swine submaxillary lymph nodes samples (3/398) and in two of them R. equi was detected.All bovine and most of swine isolates (98.1 %) were vapB-positive. 87.9 % of swine isolates carried 95-kb type 5 plasmid, 3.7 % type 1 and plasmid types: 4, 7, 10, 11, 21, 31 were carried by a single isolate (0.9 %). All bovine isolates carried VAPB type 26. Single horse isolate was vapA-positive and carried plasmid VAPA 85-kb type I. ConclusionsThe prevalence of vapB-positive R. equi in investigated healthy swine intended for human consumption was very high.Not only swine, but also even apparently healthy cattle or horse carcasses should be considered as a potential source of R. equi for humans, especially in countries where undercooked or raw beef or horsemeat is traditionally consumed." .

The current food chain causes negative externalities and that creates the urgent need for remodelling the food chain activity. The approach is taken by proposing an alternative Activity theory (AT) framework model to be applied into the Finnish food chain supported by the theory from the Economy of Common Good (ECG) and Co-Creation (CC), and tools derived from these approaches. It is proposed that activity of the food chain actors be at the food chain level, including consumers, and to enable fairer division of power and interaction with the legislative processes. Sustainability and common good values are integrated into the rules for activity, and adapted to the tools for the activity, e.g. more environmental friendly agriculture needs new farming methods, the limited use of food additives in organic food needs new processing methods. The appropriate tools should make possible the sustainable activity from the production to the consumption and simultaneously enable the increase of volume and market share of organic production. Customer and consumer preferences regarding sustainable and organic produce are proposed to increase the market share of sustainability-conscious companies, generating financial profit and decreasing negative externalities in the food chain. Government interaction is needed through legislation, taxation and information. This approach is being proposed in order to open the path of overall change towards holistic implementation of mutually agreed principles of sustainability to the Finnish food chain and, in parallel, to open a path for certified organic production to flourish." .

The pigs were assigned randomly to two experimental rearing systems (indoors and outdoors). They were fed daily according to their respective feeding regimen (FR). The indoor pigs were fed ad libitum with chopped star grass forage (Cynodon nlemfuensis). The outdoor pigs had access during 16 h to a paddock of star grass.

Trans fatty acid intake has historically been associated with negative effects on health, generating an anti-trans fat campaign to reduce their consumption. The profiles and effects on health of PHVO and PUFA-BHP can, however, be quite different. Dairy products naturally enriched with vaccenic and rumenic acids have many purported health benefits, but the putative benefits of beef fat naturally enriched with PUFA-BHP have not been investigated. The objective of the present experiment was to determine the effects of beef peri-renal fat (PRF) with differing enrichments of PUFA-BHP on lipid and insulin metabolism in a rodent model of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (JCR:LA-cp rat). The results showed that 6 weeks of diet supplementation with beef PRF naturally enriched due to flaxseed (FS-PRF) or sunflower-seed (SS-PRF) feeding to cattle significantly improved plasma fasting insulin levels and insulin sensitivity, postprandial insulin levels (only in the FS-PRF) without altering dyslipidemia. Moreover, FS-PRF but not SS-PRF attenuated adipose tissue accumulation. Therefore, enhancing levels of PUFA-BHP in beef PRF with FS feeding may be a useful approach to maximize the health-conferring value of beef-derived fats." .

Weaned rabbits (age 35 days, weight 323 g) of four distinct phenotypes (white, black and white, brown and black) were fed four experimental diets: alfalfa hay (AH), berseem fodder (BF), BF supplemented with low-level concentrate (50 %; LLC) and high-level concentrate (75 %; HLC). Each experimental diet was fed to 48 rabbits, 12 of each phenotype, in a randomized complete block design. The duration of the experiment was 55 days, including 1 week of adaptation. Rabbits fed the BF and AH diets had poor body weight gain (P < 0.05) compared to rabbits fed the LLC and HLC diets. Feed conversion efficiency was best in the LLC (4.47) and HLC (4.58) groups. Average carcass yield (743 g) and carcass dressing percentage (56.2) were higher (P < 0.05) in LLC. Growth rate was not improved significantly by feeding HLC. Fat deposition in animals was higher (P < 0.05) in the groups supplemented with concentrate. Cost per kilogram of rabbit meat was lowest (P < 0.05) for BF, followed by AH, LLC and HLC. Brown phenotypes had the best (P < 0.05) feed conversion efficiency, body weight gain, carcass yield and carcass dressing. It was concluded that local rabbits do not necessarily need high levels of concentrates but can be well fattened with low-level concentrates along with forages." .

Maximum canopy coverage for the two lysimeter vines across years was in excess of 80 %. Seasonal (15 March–31 October) evapotranspiration for the lysimeter vines (ETLys) was 952 mm in 2007 (farmed as DOV raisins) and 943 and 952 mm (when farmed as table grapes).

If so, are the high-status households more benefited than the low-status households? What drives status differences, if any, in the appropriation of forest resources? To address these questions, we draw on a theory of status and resource use that defines one’s status as one’s relative position in a group on the basis of power, prestige, honor and deference. Following this perspective, we surveyed the heads of 341 forest-based rural households in India from 2009 to 2010. We find that collective actions themselves are status-driven and the high-status households are more interested and involved in status-maintaining collective actions such as decision-making and implementation, while the low-status households perform general tasks like forest patrol. Moreover, the high-status households derive benefits from local forest significantly more than the low-status households. Further, decomposition analysis shows that a household’s prestige and honor measured by its access to social resources, problem faced and useful contacts explain about 56 % of the status gap in forest benefits, while socioeconomic characteristics explain only 16 % of the gap. Thus, due emphasis on household status from a broader socioeconomic perspective is required to reduce inequality in participation and the distribution of forest benefits in co-management." .

Recently, whole genome sequences from two bivalves, the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, and the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have been decoded, making it possible to compare genomic sequences among molluscs, and to explore general and lineage-specific genetic features and trends in bivalves. In order to improve the quality of sequence data for these purposes, we have updated the entire P. fucata genome assembly. ResultsWe present a new genome assembly of the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata (version 2.0). To update the assembly, we conducted additional sequencing, obtaining accumulated sequence data amounting to 193× the P. fucata genome. Sequence redundancy in contigs that was caused by heterozygosity was removed in silico, which significantly improved subsequent scaffolding. Gene model version 2.0 was generated with the aid of manual gene annotations supplied by the P. fucata research community. Comparison of mollusc and other bilaterian genomes shows that gene arrangements of Hox, ParaHox, and Wnt clusters in the P. fucata genome are similar to those of other molluscs. Like the Pacific oyster, P. fucata possesses many genes involved in environmental responses and in immune defense. Phylogenetic analyses of heat shock protein70 and C1q domain-containing protein families indicate that extensive expansion of genes occurred independently in each lineage. Several gene duplication events prior to the split between the pearl oyster and the Pacific oyster are also evident. In addition, a number of tandem duplications of genes that encode shell matrix proteins are also well characterized in the P. fucata genome. ConclusionsBoth the Pinctada and Crassostrea lineages have expanded specific gene families in a lineage-specific manner. Frequent duplication of genes responsible for shell formation in the P. fucata genome explains the diversity of mollusc shell structures. These duplications reveal dynamic genome evolution to forge the complex physiology that enables bivalves to employ a sessile lifestyle in the intertidal zone." .

This paper presents a first nutritional analysis of the caterpillar species Imbrasia epimethea (Drury), which is widely collected and eaten in the Uíge Province, northern Angola. Major nutrients were analysed with focus on the impact of different traditional preparation techniques (evisceration, cooking and/or drying). The native larvae revealed similar nutritional values (protein and fat content, amino and fatty acid composition) as Gonimbrasia belina, another member of Lepidoptera, and a higher quality than mealworms and crickets. With respect to more “Western” diets, the protein content of I. epimethea was found to be similar to tuna, chicken and beef, while essential amino acid were lower, resulting in lower essential amino acid indices. Fat contents were lower than in chicken, tuna and beef. Its fatty acid profile, with high percentages of polyunsaturated fatty acids, makes it a valuable contribution to human nutrition. The different preparation methods had only limited impact on the nutritional composition of the caterpillars. The removal of the gut reduced carbohydrates originating from the leaves of the host plant, and thus significantly raised protein and (non-significantly) fat contents. Thermal processing had no significant negative effect on the nutritional value except for the decrease of monounsaturated fatty acids. Thus, I. epimethea represents a valuable traditional alternative to food from other animal sources, especially with regard to its fatty acid composition." .

AbstractTillering is one of the most important agronomic traits affecting biomass and grain yield potential in wheat. Wheat lines with very limited tillering capacity are more productive than free-tillering lines under severe drought conditions. In this study, three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were generated and used, having H461, a low-tillering genotype, as a common parent. A linkage map containing 7808 single nucleotide polymorphism loci was constructed on the basis of H461/CN16 RIL population. Three QTL controlling low tillering were identified on Chromosome (Chr.) 2D (Qltn.sicau-2D), Chr. 2B (Qltn.sicau-2B), and Chr. 5A (Qltn.sicau-5A). Qltn.sicau-2D, Qltn.sicau-2B, and Qltn.sicau-5A explained up to 19.1, 14.6, and 9.6 % of the phenotypic variance, respectively.

Genome-wide prediction approaches but also phenotypic recurrent selection appear promising to increase outcrossing ability required for hybrid wheat seed production. AbstractHybrid wheat breeding is a promising approach to increase grain yield and yield stability. However, the identification of lines with favorable male floral characteristics required for hybrid seed production currently poses a severe bottleneck for hybrid wheat breeding. This study therefore aimed to unravel the genetic architecture of floral traits and to assess the potential of genomic approaches to accelerate their improvement. To this end, we employed a panel of 209 diverse winter wheat lines assessed for male floral traits and genotyped with genome-wide markers as well as for Rht-B1 and Rht-D1. We found the highest proportion of explained genotypic variance for the Rht-D1 locus (11–24 %), for which the dwarfing allele Rht-D1b had a negative effect on anther extrusion, visual anther extrusion and pollen mass. The genome-wide scan detected only few QTL with small or medium effects, indicating a complex genetic architecture. Consequently, marker-assisted selection yielded only moderate prediction abilities (0.44–0.63), mainly relying on Rht-D1. Genomic selection based on weighted ridge-regression best linear unbiased prediction achieved higher prediction abilities of up to 0.70 for anther extrusion. In conclusion, recurrent phenotypic selection appears most cost-effective for the initial improvement of floral traits in wheat, while genome-wide prediction approaches may be worthwhile when complete marker profiles are already available in a hybrid wheat breeding program." .

To decipher environmental impacts on crop plants, the concept “envirotyping” is proposed, as a third “typing” technology, complementing with genotyping and phenotyping. Environmental factors can be collected through multiple environmental trials, geographic and soil information systems, measurement of soil and canopy properties, and evaluation of companion organisms. Envirotyping contributes to crop modeling and phenotype prediction through its functional components, including genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI), genes responsive to environmental signals, biotic and abiotic stresses, and integrative phenotyping. Envirotyping, driven by information and support systems, has a wide range of applications, including environmental characterization, GEI analysis, phenotype prediction, near-iso-environment construction, agronomic genomics, precision agriculture and breeding, and development of a four-dimensional profile of crop science involving genotype (G), phenotype (P), envirotype (E) and time (T) (developmental stage). In the future, envirotyping needs to zoom into specific experimental plots and individual plants, along with the development of high-throughput and precision envirotyping platforms, to integrate genotypic, phenotypic and envirotypic information for establishing a high-efficient precision breeding and sustainable crop production system based on deciphered environmental impacts." .

Für Patienten im prolongierten Weaning stellen spezialisierte Weaningzentren durch ihren multimodalen Therapieansatz unter Einbezug u. a. von Atmungstherapeuten, Physiotherapeuten und Logopäden eine Option für ein erfolgreiches Weaning dar. Etwa 50–60 % der als von einer Beatmung nicht entwöhnbar erklärten Patienten können letztlich doch erfolgreich entwöhnt werden. Im Fall eines Weaningversagens ist ein professionelles Überleitmanagement in die außerklinische Beatmung notwendig. Die kompetente ambulante ärztliche Betreuung ist durch die sektorale Trennung zwischen ambulantem und stationärem Bereich des deutschen Gesundheitssystems erschwert. Hier besteht dringendes Verbesserungspotenzial." .

AbstractPlants have developed a fairly complex stress response system to deal with drought and other abiotic stresses. These response systems often make use of transcription factors (TFs); a gene encoding a specific TF together with -its target genes constitute a regulon, and take part in signal transduction to activate/silence genes involved in response to drought. Since, five specific families of TFs (out of >80 known families of TFs) have gained widespread attention on account of their significant role in drought tolerance in plants, TFs and regulons belonging to these five multi-gene families (AP2/EREBP, bZIP, MYB/MYC, NAC and WRKY) have been described and their role in improving drought tolerance discussed in this brief review. These TFs often undergo reversible phosphorylation to perform their function, and are also involved in complex networks. Therefore, some details about reversible phosphorylation of TFs by different protein kinases/phosphatases and the co-regulatory networks, which involve either only TFs or TFs with miRNAs, have also been discussed. Literature on transgenics involving genes encoding TFs and that on QTLs and markers associated with TF genes involved in drought tolerance has also been reviewed. Throughout the review, there is a major emphasis on wheat as an important crop, although examples from the model cereal rice (sometimes maize also), and the model plant Arabidopsis have also been used. This knowledge base may eventually allow the use of TF genes for development of drought tolerant cultivars, particularly in wheat." .

Understanding how climate change is likely to alter the fisheries revenues of maritime countries is a crucial next step towards the development of effective socio-economic policy and food sustainability strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Particularly, fish prices and cross-oceans connections through distant water fishing operations may largely modify the projected climate change impacts on fisheries revenues. However, these factors have not formally been considered in global studies. Here, using climate-living marine resources simulation models, we show that global fisheries revenues could drop by 35% more than the projected decrease in catches by the 2050 s under high CO2 emission scenarios. Regionally, the projected increases in fish catch in high latitudes may not translate into increases in revenues because of the increasing dominance of low value fish, and the decrease in catches by these countries’ vessels operating in more severely impacted distant waters. Also, we find that developing countries with high fisheries dependency are negatively impacted. Our results suggest the need to conduct full-fledged economic analyses of the potential economic effects of climate change on global marine fisheries." .

The first of these conferences was held in 1997, which turned out to be a watershed year for the field, with two significant events occurring. One was the publication of the first transgenic livestock animal disease model, a pig with retinitis pigmentosa. Before that, the use of livestock species in biomedical research had been limited to wild-type animals or disease models that had been induced or were naturally occurring. The second event was the report of Dolly, a cloned sheep produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Cloning subsequently became an essential part of the process for most of the models developed in the last 18 years and is stilled used prominently today. This review is intended to highlight the biomedical modeling achievements that followed those key events, many of which were first reported at one of the previous nine Transgenic Animal Research Conferences. Also discussed are the practical challenges of utilizing livestock disease models now that the technical hurdles of model development have been largely overcome." .

This study explored the use of spectral information from high resolution (5 × 5 m) RapidEye satellite data at peak leaf area index (LAI) to estimate end-of-season cumulative N uptake of wheat (Triticum spp.) in a heterogeneous, rainfed system. The primary objectives were to evaluate the usefulness of simple, widely used vegetation indices (VIs) from RapidEye as a tool to map crop N uptake over three growing seasons, farms and growing conditions, and to examine the usefulness of remotely sensed N uptake maps for precision agriculture applications. Data on harvested wheat N was collected at twelve plots over three seasons at four farms in the Palouse region of Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington. Seventeen commonly used spectral VIs were computed for images collected during ‘peak greenness’ (maximum LAI) to determine which VIs would be most appropriate for estimating wheat N uptake at harvest. The normalized difference red-edge index was the top performing VI, explaining 81 % of the variance in wheat N uptake with a regression slope of 1.06 and RMSE of 15.94 kg/ha. Model performance was strong across all farms over all three seasons regardless of crop variety, allowing the creation of high accuracy wheat N uptake maps. In conclusion, for this particular agro-ecosystem, mid-season VIs that incorporate the use of the NIR and red-edge bands are generally better predictors of end-of-season crop N uptake than VIs that do not include these bands, thereby further enabling their use in precision agriculture applications." .

The majority of the nation’s beef is produced on smallholder farms where productivity is constrained by poor animal reproductivity reflected in the recent livestock population decline of approximately 13 % from 2009 to 2013. Farmers (n = 240) from 16 villages from five provinces were surveyed in mid-2015 to determine their baseline knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) associated with cattle reproduction. In addition, 16 case studies from three of these provinces were conducted to provide a more detailed assessment of current cattle reproductive husbandry practices. In order to assess the reproductive impact of previously implemented interventions, an endpoint KAP survey and longitudinal health and husbandry study from three Cambodian provinces conducted between 2008 and 2013 were also analysed. Three multivariable prediction models (two KAP and one longitudinal) identified the following significant factors associated with the reproductive outcomes ‘number of calves born’ or probability that cows ‘gave birth’: target feeding (P = 0.074), growing vegetables (P = 0.005), attitudes towards cattle vaccination (P = 0.010), improving bull selection (P = 0.032), local breed use (P = 0.005), number of joining attempts (P < 0.001), discontinuation of animal draught practices (P = 0.003) and retention of breeding animals (P < 0.001). The identification of significant factors and interventions in this study has led to intervention recommendations that can potentially improve reproductive efficiency, combat the declining cattle population and improve smallholder capacity to supply to expanding regional meat demand in South-East Asia and China." .

The experiment was performed in a 12 ha area divided into 12 paddocks of 1 ha each. Forty-eight, 2-year-old, non-castrated Nellore cattle with an initial body weight (BW) of 384 kg (SEM = 21) were used in this study. The following supplementation strategies were evaluated: (1) mineral supplement supplied once per week (MS), (2) energy and protein supplement with intake regulator (2 g/kg BW) supplied once per week (EPS1), (3) energy and protein supplement (7 g/kg BW) supplied daily (EPS2), and (4) energy and protein supplement (7 g/kg BW) supplied three times per week (EPS3). The average daily gain (ADG) of animals receiving EPS3 was 0.177 kg/day higher than those receiving EPS1 (p < 0.01), 0.233 kg/day higher than the MS group, and not significantly different from EPS2. Animals in MS and EPS1 groups exhibited the lowest ADG. The ADG was not significantly different between EPS1 and EPS2 animals, but was 0.203 kg/day higher for EPS2 animals than for MS. Animals receiving only mineral supplementation spent more time grazing than the other supplementation groups tested (p < 0.01). We therefore conclude that Tanzania guinea grass is nutritionally limited and can be amended using supplements, thereby increasing animal performance. Animal performance was higher with increased protein and energy supplementation (7 g/kg BW), independent of the frequency with which supplements were administered." .

Wild boar damage essentially decreases the economic benefit received for the cost of the grazing rights. This paper appears to be the first documentation of the very direct costs to livestock owners from significant wild boar rooting within rented pastures. The photographic method we present provides a quick and efficient means to quantify damage to alpine grazing pastures and may have broad application for mountainous areas where swine damage (or other disturbance) occurs and there is sufficient visibility of the damaged habitat." .

AbstractBlack point, discoloration of the embryo end of the grain, downgrades wheat grain quality leading to significant economic losses to the wheat industry. The availability of molecular markers will accelerate improvement of black point resistance in wheat breeding. The aims of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for black point resistance and tightly linked molecular markers, and to search for candidate genes using a high-density genetic linkage map of wheat. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross Linmai 2/Zhong 892 was evaluated for black point reaction during the 2011–2012, 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 cropping seasons, providing data for seven environments. A high-density linkage map was constructed by genotyping the RILs with the wheat 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Composite interval mapping detected nine QTL on chromosomes 2AL, 2BL, 3AL, 3BL, 5AS, 6A, 7AL (2) and 7BS, designated as QBp.caas-2AL, QBp.caas-2BL, QBp.caas-3AL, QBp.caas-3BL, QBp.caas-5AS, QBp.caas-6A, QBp.caas-7AL.1, QBp.caas-7AL.2 and QBp.caas-7BS, respectively. All resistance alleles, except for QBp.caas-7AL.1 from Linmai 2, were contributed by Zhong 892. QBp.caas-3BL, QBp.caas-5AS, QBp.caas-7AL.1, QBp.caas-7AL.2 and QBp.caas-7BS probably represent new loci for black point resistance. Sequences of tightly linked SNPs were used to survey wheat and related cereal genomes identifying three candidate genes for black point resistance.

The changes in dietary fat levels influence rumen chemistry that could modify manure nutrient composition along with odor and gaseous emissions from manure management facilities. MethodsA field experiment was carried out on beef cattle feedlots to investigate the effect of four levels of dietary fat concentrations (3 to 5.5 %) on the manure composition and gaseous emissions (methane-CH4, nitrous oxide-N2O, carbon dioxide-CO2 and hydrogen sulfide-H2S) from the feedlot pen surface. The experiment was carried out over a 5-month period from June to October during North Dakota’s summer-fall climatic condition. Air and manure sampling was conducted five times at a 20–30 day intervals. ResultsOverall, this research indicated that fat levels in diet have no or little effect on the nutrient composition of manure and gaseous emission from the pens with cattle fed with different diet. Though significant variation of gaseous emission and manure composition were observed between different sampling periods, no effect of high fat diet was observed on manure composition and gaseous emission. ConclusionsIt can be concluded that addition of fat to animal diet may not have any impact on gaseous emission and manure compositions." .

The aim is to increase food safety and to minimize economic losses due to the reduced grain yield and quality. However, recent papers indicate that the study of the BCA specialists with biotrophic lifestyle lags behind our understanding of the BCA generalists with necrotrophic lifestyle.

S. aureus secretes several leukocidins that target bovine neutrophils, crucial effector cells in the defence against bacterial pathogens. In this study, we investigated the role of staphylococcal leukocidins in the pathogenesis of bovine S. aureus disease. We show that LukAB, in contrast to the γ-hemolysins, LukED, and LukMF′, was unable to kill bovine neutrophils, and identified CXCR2 as a bovine receptor for HlgAB and LukED. Furthermore, we assessed functional leukocidin secretion by bovine mastitis isolates and observed that, although leukocidin production was strain dependent, LukMF′ was most abundantly secreted and the major toxin killing bovine neutrophils. To determine the role of LukMF′ in bovine mastitis, cattle were challenged with high (S1444) or intermediate (S1449, S1463) LukMF′-producing isolates. Only animals infected with S1444 developed severe clinical symptoms. Importantly, LukM was produced in vivo during the course of infection and levels in milk were associated with the severity of mastitis. Altogether, these findings underline the importance of LukMF′ as a virulence factor and support the development of therapeutic approaches targeting LukMF′ to control S. aureus mastitis in cattle." .

Chlamydia suis infection is associated with conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight in domestic swine. Chlamydial infections in humans and domesticated animals are generally controlled by antibiotic treatment—particularly macrolides (usually azithromycin) and tetracyclines (tetracycline and doxycycline). Tetracycline-containing feed has also been used to limit infections and promote growth in livestock populations, although its use has decreased because of growing concerns about antimicrobial resistance development. Because Sandoz and Rockey published an elegant review of chlamydial anti-microbial resistance in 2010, we will review the following: (i) antibiotic resistance in C. suis, (ii) recent evidence for acquired resistance in human chlamydial infections, and (iii) recent non-genetic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance that may contribute to treatment failure." .

Cry1A proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis form a typical bipyramidal parasporal crystal and their protoxins contain a highly conserved C-terminal region. A chimerical gene, called cry(4Ba-1Ac), formed by a fusion of the N-terminus part of cry4Ba and the C-terminus part of cry1Ac, was constructed. Its transformation to an acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis strain showed that it was expressed as a chimerical protein of 116 kDa, assembled in spherical to amorphous parasporal crystals. The chimerical gene cry(4Ba-1Ac) was introduced in a B. thuringiensis kurstaki strain. In the generated crystals of the recombinant strain, the presence of Cry(4Ba-1Ac) was evidenced by MALDI-TOF. The recombinant strain showed an important increase of the toxicity against Culex pipiens larvae (LC50 = 0.84 mg l−1 ± 0.08) compared to the wild type strain through the synergistic activity of Cry2Aa with Cry(4Ba-1Ac). The enhancement of toxicity of B. thuringiensis kurstaki expressing Cry(4Ba-1Ac) compared to that expressing the native toxin Cry4Ba, might be related to its a typical crystallization properties.

The reclaimed water irrigation increased wheat plant height (cm), chlorophyll, leaf area (cm2), leaf length (cm), grain yield (t ha−1) and the water productivity (kg grain m−3). It improved all cowpea growth parameters under study except the dry forage yield. Nitrogen was also higher under reclaimed water irrigation in wheat tissue, cowpea pods and maize cobs. Reclaimed water had no effect on the element concentrations in wheat, cowpea and maize except for nickel concentration in wheat plants, and Sodium and Manganese concentrations in maize plants. Using reclaimed water for irrigation increased the yield parameters of wheat, cowpea and maize.

Proper agricultural management practices such as selection of appropriate irrigation techniques, choosing proper irrigation rates, and application of optimum pesticide dosages are necessary to prevent leaching of pesticides to greater depths thus preventing groundwater contamination. A simulation study is conducted based on the one-dimensional numerical model considering Richard’s equation for unsaturated water flow and solute transport which takes into account the effect of both adsorption and biodegradation with inhibitory effect to understand pesticide transport in an unsaturated porous medium. The study addresses the influence of irrigation rate, type of irrigation, and pesticide dosage on soil moisture and pesticide concentration distribution. The numerical results suggest that higher water application rates can carry the pesticides to greater depths. Pulsed irrigation can slightly reduce water losses through the root zone when compared to continuous irrigation. The comparison of the wetting patterns and the pesticide distribution obtained in continuous and pulsed irrigation helps to decide the use of a particular irrigation strategy in order to achieve suitable goals. In addition, the results from this study bring out better understanding of the effect of pesticide concentration and dosage on the resultant pesticide distribution in the unsaturated zone and the pesticide potential to cause groundwater contamination.

Although β-glucanase supplementation in diet can help to eliminate the adverse effects, enzyme stability is substantially modified during the feed manufacturing process. To determine whether the expression of endogenous β-glucanase gene (GLU) in vivo can improve digestibility of dietary β-glucan and absorption of nutrients, we successfully produced transgenic pigs via nuclear transfer which express the GLU from Paenibacillus polymyxa CP7 in the parotid gland. In three live transgenic founders, β-glucanase activities in the saliva were 3.2, 0.07 and 0.03 U/mL, respectively, and interestingly the enzyme activities increased in the pigs from 178 days old to 789 days old. From the feed the amount of gross energy, crude protein and crude fat absorbed by the transgenic pigs was significantly higher than the non-transgenic pigs. Meanwhile the moisture content of the feces was significantly reduced in transgenic pigs compared with the non-transgenic pigs. Furthermore, in all positive G1 pigs, β-glucanase activity was detectable and the highest enzyme activity reached 3.5 U/mL in saliva. Also, crude protein digestion was significantly higher in G1 transgenic pigs than in control pigs. Taken together, our data showed that the transgenic β-glucanase exerted its biological catalytic function in vivo in the saliva, and the improved performance of the transgenic pigs could be accurately passed on to the offspring, indicating a promising alternative approach to improving nutrient availability was established to improve utilization of livestock feed through transgenic animals." .

These factors were considered: pressure in the GP equipment (0 = constant; 1 = increasing), incubation time (0 = 24; 1 = ≥ 48 h), time of rumen fluid collection (0 = before feeding; 1 = after feeding of donor animals), donor species of rumen fluid (0 = sheep; 1 = bovine), presence of N in the buffer solution (0 = presence; 1 = absence), and ratio between amount of buffered rumen fluid and feed sample (BRF/FS; 0 = ≤ 130 mL/g DM; 1 = 130–140 mL/g DM; 2 = ≥ 140 mL/g DM). The NDF content of feed sample incubated (NDF) was considered as a continuous variable. From an initial database of 105 papers, 58 were discarded because one of the above-mentioned factors was not stated. After discarding 17 papers, the final dataset comprised 30 papers (339 observations). A preliminary mixed model analysis was carried out on experimental data considering the study as random factor. Variables adjusted for study effect were analyzed using a backward stepwise analysis including the above-mentioned variables. The analysis showed that the extension of incubation time and reduction of NDF increased GP and CH4 values. Values of GP and CH4 also increased when rumen fluid was collected after feeding compared to before feeding (+26.4 and +9.0 mL/g DM, for GP and CH4), from bovine compared to sheep (+32.8 and +5.2 mL/g DM, for GP and CH4), and when the buffer solution did not contain N (+24.7 and +6.7 mL/g DM for GP and CH4). The increase of BRF/FS ratio enhanced GP and CH4 production (+7.7 and +3.3 mL/g DM per each class of increase, respectively). In vitro techniques for measuring GP and CH4 production are mostly used as screening methods, thus a full standardization of such techniques is not feasible. However, a greater harmonization of analytical procedures (i.e., a reduction in the number of available protocols) would be useful to facilitate comparison between results of different experiments." .

In Europe, rumen fluke is not regarded as a clinically significant parasite, recently however, the prevalence of rumen fluke has sharply increased and several outbreaks of clinical paramphistomosis have been reported. Gaining a better understanding of rumen fluke transmission and identification of risk factors is crucial to improve the control of this parasitic disease. In this regard, a national prevalence study of rumen fluke infection and an investigation of associated risk factors were conducted in Irish sheep flocks between November 2014 and January 2015. In addition, a molecular identification of the rumen fluke species present in Ireland was carried out using an isolation method of individual eggs from faecal material coupled with a PCR. After the DNA extraction of 54 individual eggs, the nuclear fragment ITS-2 was amplified and sequenced using the same primers. ResultsAn apparent herd prevalence of 77.3 % was determined. Several risk factors were identified including type of pasture grazed, regional variation, and sharing of the paddocks with other livestock species. A novel relationship between the Suffolk breed and higher FEC was reported for the first time. The predominant rumen fluke species found was C. daubneyi. Nevertheless, P. leydeni was unexpectedly identified infecting sheep in Ireland for the first time. ConclusionsAn exceptionally high prevalence of rumen fluke among Irish sheep flocks has been highlighted in this study and a more thorough investigation is necessary to analyse its economic impact. The isolation of individual eggs coupled with the PCR technique used here has proven a reliable tool for discrimination of Paramphistomum spp. This technique may facilitate forthcoming studies of the effects of paramphistomosis on livestock production. The most noteworthy finding was the identification of P. leydeni affecting sheep in Ireland, however further studies are required to clarify its implications. Also, a significant relationship between Suffolk breed and a heavier infection was found, which can be used as a starting point for future research on control strategies of rumen fluke infection." .

Hemolysis induced by these strains varied from strong to near absent. One weakly hemolytic B. hyodysenteriae strain showed sequence changes in five hemolysis associated genes (tlyA, tlyB, hemolysin III, hemolysin activation protein and hemolysin III channel protein) resulting in amino acid substitutions.

Twenty-four and 21 compounds were identified in volatiles of undamaged and insect feeding plants, respectively; whereas 22 compounds were detected in volatiles of mechanically damaged plants. Decanal and 1-dodecanol were unique to undamaged plants, and linalool was detected in volatiles of undamaged and mechanically damaged plants, but not in volatiles of insect damaged plants. However, the beetles are not attracted by none of these volatile components, when tested individually in Y-shaped glass tube olfactometer bioassays.

The overexpression of both Gly I and Gly II, either alone or in combination, has earlier been reported to confer tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the consequences of constitutive and stress-induced overexpression of Gly I on the performance and productivity of plants. Towards this end, several Gly I transgenic Brassica juncea lines (designated as R and S lines) were generated in which the glyoxalase I (gly I) gene was expressed under the control of either a stress-inducible rd29A promoter or a constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Both the R and S lines showed enhanced tolerance to salinity, heavy metal, and drought stress when compared to untransformed control plants. However, the S lines showed yield penalty under non-stress conditions while no such negative effect was observed in the R lines. Our results indicate that the overexpression of the gly I gene under the control of stress-inducible rd29A promoter is a better option for improving salt, drought and heavy metal stress tolerance in transgenic plants." .

AbstractLesion mimic (LM) refers to hypersensitive reaction-like (HRL) traits that appear on leaf tissue in the absence of plant pathogens. In a wheat line P7001, LM showed up on the leaves under the 0 g nitrogen (N) treatment, but disappeared when sufficient N was supplied, suggesting that LM is N-responsive and N dosage dependent. Using BSA strategy together with RNA-seq and DNA markers, we identified an N-dependent LM gene (Ndhrl1) and mapped it to the short arm of chromosome 2B using an F5 recombinant inbred population developed from the cross of P7001 × P216. The putative gene was delimited into an interval of 8.1 cM flanked by the CAPS/dCAPS markers 7hrC9 and 7hr2dc14, and co-segregated with the dCAPS marker 7hrdc2.

Several disturbance activities in tropical forests have reduced the biomass and net primary production (NPP) leading to climate change. Therefore, an accurate estimation of forest biomass and C cycling in context of disturbances is required for implementing REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) policy. MethodsBiomass and NPP of trees and shrubs were estimated by using allometric equations while herbaceous biomass was estimated by harvest method. Fine root biomass was determined from soil monolith. The C stock in vegetation was calculated by multiplying C concentration to dry weight. ResultsTotal stand biomass (Mg∙ha–1) in undisturbed forest stand (US) was 960.4 while in disturbed forest stand (DS) it was 449.1. The biomass (Mg∙ha–1) of trees, shrubs and herbs in US was 948.0, 4.4 and 1.4, respectively, while in DS they were 438.4, 6.1 and 1.2, respectively. Total NPP (Mg∙ha–1∙yr–1) was 26.58 (equivalent to 12.26 Mg C∙ha–1∙yr–1) in US and 14.91 (6.88 Mg C∙ha–1∙yr–1) in DS. Total C input into soil through litter plus root turnover was 6.78 and 3.35 Mg∙ha–1∙yr–1 in US and DS, respectively. ConclusionsSeveral disturbance activities resulted in the significant loss in stand biomass (53 %), NPP (44 %), and C sequestration capacity of tropical forest in eastern Nepal. The net uptake of carbon by the vegetation is far greater than that returned to the soil by the turnover of fine root and litter. Therefore, both stands of present forest act as carbon accumulating systems. Moreover, disturbance reflects higher C emissions which can be reduced by better management." .

The archaeobotanical remains from excavations at the Old Kingdom ‘Khentkawes town’ (2300–2100 bc) on the Giza plateau in Egypt contained an abundance of legumes, but also much wood charcoal, and preservation of many fragile and ‘green’ seeds and plant parts.

Likewise, Sheka-Tekli and Hadinet PAs were chosen for the purpose of focus group discussion (FGD). A total of 60 HHs (30 from each PA) were selected randomly for interview using semi-structured questionnaire. About 16 % of the respondents were female HHs. Two FGDs were held with key informants. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS (2013, version 21) statistical software procedures. The study area is characterized by mixed crop-livestock farming system with high interaction between crop and livestock. Livestock are the mainstay for the farm community with many benefits as sources of draught, meat, milk, income, and manures. Cattle are kept primarily for the purpose of draught power with meat and milk as secondary products, whereas shoats are kept mainly for cash income, manure, meat, and milk. The land holding size per HH was 1.44 ha while the herd size was 4.93 tropical livestock unit (TLU). Almost all the land holding (97 %) is allocated for crop cultivation with lesser for forage production (<1 %) indicating poor attention for fodder harvesting. The cattle herd is composed of local breeds (99 %) with less exotic/crossbred (1 %), indicating that the livestock rearing is practiced using local breed. Crop residues, natural pastures, stubble grazing, hay, and browsing are the main feed resources for animals. The availability and contribution of each feed vary with season and areas. Sorghum stover is the main feed source in the area and followed by maize stover, Eragrostis tef straw, and pulse straws. Crop residues are fed as basal diet with no or less supplementation using local concentrates like Attela and mill by-products. Industrial by-products are rarely used in the livestock feeding system for their high price and less availability. Likewise, improved forages are not widely utilized as feed sources." .

MethodsA cradle to gate study was undertaken in a beef cattle production system comprising two stages: calves production in one farm (farm 1) and cattle production in another farm (farm 2), both located in the central-southern meso-region of Bahia. The functional unit was 1 kg live weight. Impact assessment was performed using five impact categories from the ReCiPe method. Results and discussionWhen compared to calves, the cattle production had the greatest contributions in all of the five studied impact categories. The process pasture cultivation had expressive environmental impacts in all categories, with 70.05 % for climate change (CC), 82.01 % for terrestrial acidification (TA), 76.53 % for fossil depletion (FD), 86.14 % for freshwater eutrophication (FE) and 100 % for agricultural land occupation (ALO). In CC and TA, the principal elementary flow was the direct emissions due to the use of mineral fertilizers. In FE and FD, the dominant flow was related to the use of phosphate fertilizer. In ALO, the process pasture cultivation was predominant due to the physical area of the farms, which is a characteristic of pasture-based production systems. The processes breeding-rearing and fattening were second in the contribution analysis, with 29.95 % and 17.99 %, respectively, for CC and TA, due to the enteric methane (CH4) and the direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) volatilization from the animal excreta. ConclusionsThe cattle production is responsible for the greater part of impacts, compared to the calves production. The direct emissions from fertilizers used in the pastures, from enteric emissions and from animal wastes in the breeding-rearing and fattening processes were identified as the critical points of the analysed cattle production system. Measures aiming at the improvement of the feed conversion of the animals and at the substitution of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers by natural nitrogen fixation can considerably contribute to the reduction of environmental impacts of these production systems. Accordingly, the respective modifications should be considered in future studies on the potential of these measures to enhance the environmental performance of semi-intensive beef cattle production. These results will complement other similar studies conducted in other regions of the country, following the tendency of growing usage of the life cycle assessment methodology in Brazilian agricultural and livestock systems." .

The data suggest that when the animal welfare of land-based farm animals is compromised, there are resulting significant negative human health consequences due to environmental degradation, the use of non-therapeutic levels of antibiotics for growth promotion, and the consequences of intensification. This paper accepts that even if meat and fish consumption is reduced, meat and fish will be part of the diet of the future. Industrial production modified from the current intensified systems will still be required to feed the world in 2050 and beyond. This paper identifies the concept of sustainable intensification and suggests that if farm animal welfare is improved, many of the human health consequences of intensified industrial production can be eliminated or reduced. In water-based farm animal production, many new systems are resulting in a product that actually protects the environment and can be done at industrial levels without the use of antibiotics." .

Farm sizes were 9.3 ± 6.7 acres in tethering system and 4.3 ± 2.6 acres in zero-grazing. Fifty-four percent of the zero-grazing herds had animal housing facilities. All farmers in tethering system kept cows on earthen floors and calves without bedding. Hygiene level in existing farms was low. Majority of calves were fed once a day by restricted suckling (77 %). Seventy-four percent of tethered cows were only fed on natural grass, while cows under zero-grazing system had a more diversified diet but with 82 % feeding mainly Napier grass. Most farms (87 %) used bulls for breeding. Milk production was higher (P < 0.05) in zero-grazing (6.5 L/cow/day) than tethering system, and higher (P < 0.05) for Holstein-Friesian crossbred cows (5.2 L/cow/day) than local breed cows (2.6 L/cow/day). Less than 1 L of milk per farm per day on average was sold. Disease treatments were exclusively for helminths, East Coast fever, and trypanasomiasis. Spraying of ticks and deworming were important control measures of vector-borne diseases. There is potential to develop alternative feed resources for dairy cattle and biorational pesticides for control and treatment of vector-borne diseases." .

Here, we raised genotypes of Brassica rapa under well-watered and drought treatments in the field. Our primary goal was to understand the genetic architecture and yield effects of different drought-escape and dehydration-avoidance strategies. ResultsDrought treatments reduced soil moisture by 62 % of field capacity. Drought decreased biomass accumulation and fruit production by as much as 48 %, whereas instantaneous water-use efficiency and root:shoot ratio increased. Genotypes differed in the mean value of all traits and in the sensitivity of biomass accumulation, root:shoot ratio, and fruit production to drought. Bivariate correlations involving gas-exchange and phenology were largely constant across environments, whereas those involving root:shoot varied across treatments. Although root:shoot was typically unrelated to gas-exchange or yield under well-watered conditions, genotypes with low to moderate increases in root:shoot allocation in response to drought survived the growing season, maintained maximum photosynthesis levels, and produced more fruit than genotypes with the greatest root allocation under drought. QTL for gas-exchange and yield components (total biomass or fruit production) had common effects across environments while those for root:shoot were often environment-specific. ConclusionsIncreases in root allocation beyond those needed to survive and maintain favorable water relations came at the cost of fruit production. The environment-specific effects of root:shoot ratio on yield and the differential expression of QTL for this trait across water regimes have important implications for efforts to improve crops for drought resistance." .

We conducted an internet-based survey of commercial chicken and pig feed products officially approved for sale in Vietnam over the period March–June 2015. Information on the antimicrobial contents in feed products, alongside animal production data, was used to estimate in-feed antimicrobial consumption to produce one kilogram of live animal (chicken, pig), as well as to estimate country-wide antimicrobial consumption through animal feeds. A total of 1462 commercial feed formulations were examined. The survey-adjusted estimated antimicrobial contents were 25.7 and 62.3 mg/kg in chicken and pig feeds, respectively. Overall, it was estimated that 77.4 mg [95% CI 48.1–106.8] and 286.6 mg [95% CI 191.6–418.3] of in-feed antimicrobials were used to raise 1 kg of live chicken and pig, respectively. Bacitracin (15.5% feeds), chlortetracycline (11.4%), and enramycin (10.8%) were the most common antimicrobials present in chicken feed formulations, whereas bacitracin (24.8%), chlortetracycline (23.9%), and florfenicol (17.4%) were the most common in pig feed formulations. Overall, 57% of the total quantitative usage consisted of antimicrobials regarded by WHO of importance for human medicine, including amoxicillin, colistin, tetracyclines, neomycin, lincomycin, and bacitracin. These figures confirm a very high magnitude of in-feed consumption of antimicrobials, especially in pig production. Results from this study should encourage further monitoring of antimicrobials used in animal production, and foster discussion about existing policies on inclusion of antimicrobials in animal feed rations." .

AbstractSpecies from the Solanaceae family form integral parts of human civilizations as food sources and drugs since thousands of years, and, more recently, as ornamentals. Some Solanaceous species were subjects of classical and molecular genetic research over the last 100 years. The tomato was one of the principal models in twentieth century classical genetics and a pacemaker of genome analysis in plants including molecular linkage maps, positional cloning of disease resistance genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL). Besides that, tomato is the model for the genetics of fruit development and composition. Tobacco was the major model used to establish the principals and methods of plant somatic cell genetics including in vitro propagation of cells and tissues, totipotency of somatic cells, doubled haploid production and genetic transformation. Petunia was a model for elucidating the biochemical and genetic basis of flower color and development. The cultivated potato is the economically most important Solanaceous plant and ranks third after wheat and rice as one of the world’s great food crops. Potato is the model for studying the genetic basis of tuber development. Molecular genetics and genomics of potato, in particular association genetics, made valuable contributions to the genetic dissection of complex agronomic traits and the development of diagnostic markers for breeding applications. Pepper and eggplant are horticultural crops of worldwide relevance. Genetic and genomic research in pepper and eggplant mostly followed the tomato model. Comparative genome analysis of tomato, potato, pepper and eggplant contributed to the understanding of plant genome evolution." .

To test the accuracy of body linear measurements for predicting liveweight, crossbred dairy cattle of different genotypes were measured and weighed. A total of 352 mature cows and 100 heifers were weighed using an electronic weighing scale and measurements of HG, body length, height at withers were taken using an ordinary measuring tape and body condition scored (BCS) using a five-point scale. The animals were grouped according to genotype and age. Genotype classification was undertaken from farmer recall and by visual appraisal as 40–60, 61–80 or 81–100 % exotic (non-indigenous). Age classification was simply as mature cows or heifers. Liveweight of the animals ranged from 102 to 433 kg. Liveweight was strongly correlated with HG (r = 0.84) and body condition scores (r = 0.70) and moderately correlated with body length (r = 0.64) and height at withers (0.61). Regressing LW on HG measurements gave statistically significant (P < 0.01) equations with R2 ranging from of 0.53 to 0.78 and residual standard deviation ranging from 18.11 to 40.50 kg. The overall model developed (adjusted R2 = 0.71) had a prediction error of 26 kg (or 11 % of the mean) and predicted LW of over 95 % of crossbred dairy cattle in the range of 100–450 kg, regardless of age and breed group. Including BCS in the model slightly improved the model fit but not the prediction error. It was concluded that the model can be useful in making general management decisions in smallholder farms." .

BVDV is not necessarily species specific and is known to infect domesticated and wild ruminants. In the present study, BVDV infection was identified in two Saanen goats from one farm, and two different viral subtypes were found, BVDV-1a and BVDV-2a. Each isolate was closely related to cattle isolates identified in the Republic of Korea. The two sequences obtained in this study were not consistent with border disease virus (BDV). The incidence of BVDV in this farm apparently occurred in the absence of contact with cattle and may be associated with grazing. This study demonstrates that BVDV infection may be possible to transmit among goats without exposure to cattle. Therefore, this result indicates that Saanen goats may act as natural reservoirs for BVDV. This is the first report of BVDV-1a infection in a Saanen goat." .

The present study aimed to examine the potential effect of condensed tannins in sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and carob pods (Ceratonia siliqua) incorporated in sheep rations against lamb coccidiosis. The above tannin-rich sources were studied in three independent feeding trials in which the animals (naturally infected by Eimeria spp. ewes and their lambs) were allocated (i) in the control group and received a tannin-free diet (lucerne hay), or (ii) in the treatment groups and received a tannin-rich diet based on sainfoin hay (in trials 1 and 2), or in carob pod meal and a combination of carob pod meal and sainfoin hay (in trial 3). In total, 95 newborn lambs (and their 73 ewes) were enrolled in all trials which started a month before lambing and ended 8–10 weeks after lambs were born (at weaning). The course of coccidial infection was monitored in lambs by faecal oocyst counts and consistencies which were recorded at weekly intervals. Moreover, lambs total weight gain was evaluated at the end of each trial. During all trials, 100 % of the animals got naturally infected by Eimeria species and the infection burden was higher in trials 2 and 3 compared to trial 1 but in all cases, severe signs of diarrhoea were not observed. Tannin-rich diets were well accepted by the animals not affecting their feed intake and body weight gain when compared to the controls. The results suggest that incorporation of both tannin-rich resources (especially sainfoin) in sheep rations can reduce Eimeria oocyst excretion rates by the lambs, which can decrease subsequently the contamination of the farm environment with the parasite. However, the high variability noted on the results is not allowing us to draw any definite conclusions at least until the potential of those plants is further investigated." .

The overarching challenge is the deep uncertainty about the future direction of changes in climate denoted by representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Moreover, climate change poses new sources of risk from frequent, more intensive, and even novel disturbances in forest ecosystems. Adaptation strategies have been developed to guarantee resistance of forests to climate change and impacts, but they are mostly valid for a restricted set of climate outcomes in the future. Therefore, alternative decision-making approaches should be found to overcome the deep uncertainty about future climate development and adapt forests to future environmental conditions. We propose two decision-making approaches; portfolio diversification and robust decision-making (RDM) to solve both problems. Portfolio management is an established concept in forest utilization and requires diversification of forest structures by e.g., admixing new species, or applying different sets of silvicultural interventions. Robust decision-making is a unique approach to deal with the deep uncertainty in general, but has rarely been applied to forest management. Recent adaptations of RDM to risk management under climate change provide a good basis for application in forestry. We outline the details of RDM to this end with an example, and highly recommend its application. Finally, a consensus among politicians on a climate target, e.g., Paris agreement, may diminish the deep uncertainty about the degree of climatic change at the end of the century. However, actions pathways, i.e., scenarios to meet the climate target would stay deeply uncertain for long." .

Large populations of symbiotically effective rhizobia should be available in the rhizosphere for symbiotic BNF with host plants. The rhizobial populations should also be able to compete and infect host plants. However, the rhizosphere comprises large populations of different microorganisms. Some of these microorganisms naturally produce antibiotics which are lethal to susceptible rhizobial populations in the soil. Therefore, intrinsic resistance to antibiotics is a desirable trait for the rhizobial population. It increases the rhizobia’s chances of growth, multiplication and persistence in the soil. With a large population of rhizobia in the soil, infectivity of host plants and the subsequent BNF efficiency can be guaranteed. This review, therefore, puts together findings by various researchers on antibiotic resistance in bacteria with the main emphasis on rhizobia. It describes the different modes of action of different antibiotics, the types of antibiotic resistance exhibited by rhizobia, the mechanisms of acquisition of antibiotic resistance in rhizobia and the levels of tolerance of different rhizobial species to different antibiotics." .

AbstractGrowing concerns about the biosafety of genetically modified (GM) crops has currently become a limited factor affecting the public acceptance. Several approaches have been developed to generate selectable-marker-gene-free GM crops. However, no strategy was reported to be broadly applicable to hybrid crops. Previous studies have demonstrated that complementation split-Cre recombinase restored recombination activity in transgenic plants. In this study, we found that split-Cre mediated by split-intein Synechocystis sp. DnaE had high recombination efficiency when Cre recombinase was split at Asp232/Asp233 (866 bp). Furthermore, we constructed two plant expression vectors, pCA-NCre-In and pCA-Ic-CCre, containing NCre866-In and Ic-CCre866 fragments, respectively. After transformation, parent lines of transgenic Arabidopsis with one single copy were generated and used for hybridization. The results of GUS staining demonstrated that the recombination activity of split-Cre could be reassembled in these hybrid progeny of transgenic plants through hybridization and the foreign genes flanked by two loxP sites were efficiently excised. Our strategy may provide an effective approach for generating the next generation of GM hybrid crops without biosafety concerns." .

The acclimatory strategies depend on cell division/cell death control and altered cell wall composition. AbstractThe increase of plant tolerance towards environmental stresses would open much opportunity for successful plant cultivation in these areas that were previously considered as ineligible, e.g. in areas with poor irrigation. In this study, we performed functional analysis of proteins encoded by PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), LESION SIMULATING DISEASE 1 (LSD1) and ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) genes to explain their role in drought tolerance and biomass production in two different species: Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus tremula × tremuloides. Arabidopsis mutants pad4-5, lsd1-1, eds1-1 and transgenic poplar lines PAD4-RNAi, LSD1-RNAi and ESD1-RNAi were examined in terms of different morphological and physiological parameters. Our experiments proved that Arabidopsis PAD4, LSD1 and EDS1 play an important role in survival under drought stress and regulate plant vegetative and generative growth. Biomass production and acclimatory strategies in poplar were also orchestrated via a genetic system of PAD4 and LSD1 which balanced the cell division and cell death processes. Furthermore, improved rate of cell division/cell differentiation and altered physical properties of poplar wood were the outcome of PAD4- and LSD1-dependent changes in cell wall structure and composition. Our results demonstrate that PAD4, LSD1 and EDS1 constitute a molecular hub, which integrates plant responses to water stress, vegetative biomass production and generative development. The applicable goal of our research was to generate transgenic plants with regulatory mechanism that perceives stress signals to optimize plant growth and biomass production in semi-stress field conditions." .

The goals of the present work were 1) to describe reliable reference values for production parameters and pig production cost from 2010 to 2014, 2) to describe their temporal evolution and 3) to determine the influence of the pig company size on them. Between 61 and 107 pig production companies from Spain were included in this study from 2010 to 2014. These companies sent data on feed consumption, number of pig produced, expenses and census every month. Sip consultors SL standardized collected data and calculate cost and production parameters to obtain values comparables between the different pig production companies. The collected data each month were merged to obtain a yearly average value taking into account the pig production flow each month. A suitable statistical analysis was carried out to tackle the goals. ResultsThe production performance has been continuously improving in the piglet production and fattening phase from 2010 to 2014. Thus, the number of piglets by sow and year will increase 0.5 pigs by year and the total feed conversion rate will decrease approximately 0.03 kg feed/kg gain by year in the future if the same tendency continues. However, feed price has been steadily increasing from 2010 to 2012 and decreasing afterwards and the total cost per kilogram produced has followed a similar pattern. This result highlights the relevance of the feed price in the final cost in spite of continuous improvement in production performance across years. Finally, pig company size affected most of the production parameters studied. Thus, the best technical parameters were obtained for companies with less than 5000 sows. However, the opposite tendency is observed for feed price where the highest value was observed for the smallest companies. ConclusionsPig production parameters have generally improved in the last five years but this improvement did not directly imply a reduction in pig production cost due to the high feed prices during the period 2010–2013." .

Development of direct reprogramming technology offers an alternative approach for generation of pluripotent stem cells, applicable also in farm animals. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent practically limitless, ethically acceptable, individuum-specific source of pluripotent cells that can be generated from different types of somatic cells. iPSCs can differentiate to all cell types of an organism’s body and have a tremendous potential for numerous applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. However, molecular mechanisms behind the reprogramming process remain largely unknown and hamper generation of bona fide iPSCs and their use in human clinical practice. Large animal models are essential to expand the knowledge obtained on rodents and facilitate development and validation of transplantation therapies in preclinical studies. Additionally, transgenic animals with special traits could be generated from genetically modified pluripotent cells, using advanced reproduction techniques. Despite their applicative potential, it seems that iPSCs in farm animals haven’t received the deserved attention. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview on iPSC generation in the most important mammalian farm animal species (cattle, pig, horse, sheep, goat, and rabbit), compare protein sequence similarity of pluripotency-related transcription factors in different species, and discuss potential uses of farm animal iPSCs.

One major QTL for aerenchyma formation after 7 days of waterlogging treatment was identified and the newly developed markers explained 44 % of the phenotypic variance. This QTL can now be effectively used in barley breeding programs. AbstractWaterlogging is one of the important limiting conditions for crop yield and productivity. The main feature of waterlogged soils is oxygen deprivation, due to slow gas diffusion in water. Decreased oxygen content in waterlogged soils leads to the oxygen deficiency in plant tissues, resulting in reduced energy availability for plants. Rapidly induced aerenchyma formation is critical to maintaining adequate oxygen supply and overall waterlogging tolerance in barley. In this study, we have proved that quantifying aerenchyma formation after 7 days of waterlogging in commercial potting mixture can be a reliable, fast, and widely utilised approach for the selection of waterlogging tolerant barley genotypes, which is supported by measurements of redox potential (an indicator of anaerobic conditions). This protocol was also used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a doubled haploid population of barley from the cross between Yerong (tolerant) and Franklin (sensitive) genotypes. The QTL for aerenchyma formation and root porosity were at the same location as the waterlogging tolerance QTL. Seven new markers were developed and added onto this region on chromosome 4H. One major QTL for aerenchyma formation after 7 days waterlogging treatment explained 44.0 % of the phenotypic variance. This successful QTL for aerenchyma formation can be effectively used in the marker assisted selection to improve waterlogging tolerance in barley." .

In this paper, I defend the possibility against three such concerns. I suggest that worries about reinforcing ideas of flesh as food and worries about the use of nonhuman animals in the production of in vitro meat can be overcome through appropriate safeguards and a fuller understanding of the interests that nonhuman animals actually possess. Worries about the technology reifying speciesist hierarchies of value are more troublesome, however. In response to this final challenge, I suggest that we should be open not just to the production of in vitro nonhuman flesh, but also in vitro human flesh. This leads to a consideration of the ethics of cannibalism. The paper ultimately defends the position that cannibalism simpliciter is not morally problematic, though a great many practices typically associated with it are. The consumption of in vitro human flesh, however, is able to avoid these problematic practices, and so should be considered permissible. I conclude that animal ethicists and vegans should be willing to cautiously embrace the production of in vitro flesh." .

TLR4 is the receptor for LPS which can recognize Brucella and initiate antigen-presenting cell activities that affect both innate and adaptive immunity. Consequently, transgenic sheep over-expressing TLR4 are an suitable model to investigate the effects of TLR4 on preventing Brucellosis. In this study, we generated transgenic sheep overexpressing TLR4 and aimed to evaluate the effects of different seasons (breeding and non-breeding season) on superovulation and the imported exogenous gene on growth. ResultsIn total of 43 donor ewes and 166 recipient ewes in breeding season, 37 donor ewes and 144 recipient ewes in non-breeding season were selected for super-ovulation and injected embryo transfer to generate transgenic sheep. Our results indicated the no. of embryos recovered of donors and the rate of pronuclear embryos did not show any significant difference between breeding and non-breeding seasons (P > 0.05). The positive rate of exogenous TLR4 tested were 21.21 % and 22.58 % in breeding and non-breeding season by Southern blot. The expression level of TLR4 in the transgenic sheep was 1.5 times higher than in the non-transgenic group (P < 0.05). The lambs overexpressing TLR4 had similar growth performance with non-transgenic lambs, and the blood physiological parameters of transgenic and non-transgenic were both in the normal range and did not show any difference. ConclusionsHere we establish an efficient platform for the production of transgenic sheep by the microinjection of pronuclear embryos during the whole year. The over-expression of TLR4 had no adverse effect on the growth of the sheep." .

Specimens were collected monthly from commercial bottom trawl multispecies fisheries between February 2009 and February 2011 in three fishing grounds (North Galicia, West Galicia and North Portugal). Based on stomach analysis, E. cirrhosa ingested mainly crustaceans, followed by teleost fish, echinoderms, molluscs and polychaetes. Molecular analysis of 14 stomach contents confirmed the visual identification of prey items as well as cannibalistic events. Statistical tests found that sex and body weight did not significantly affect prey selection, while season, fishing ground and maturity stage of the animals had a significantly effect on the probability of selecting a particular prey.

Here we describe simple technological improvements to protect semen from inadvertent thermal fluctuations that occur when users mishandle semen using standard equipment. We show that when frozen semen is mishandled, characteristics of semen biology associated with fertility are negatively affected. We describe several design modifications and results from thermal performance tests of several improved prototypes. Finally, we compare semen that has been mishandled in standard and improved equipment. The data suggest that our canister improvements can better maintain characteristics of semen biology that correlate with fertility when it is mishandled." .

Sixteen growing Java thin-tailed male sheep (body weight (BW) 20.4 ± 1.9 kg) were fed one of the following dietary treatments: T0 (100 % forage); T1 (100 % chopped forage); T2 (80 % chopped forage + 20 % concentrate); and T3 (80 % chopped forage + 20 % CLS). Nutrient intake, production performance and rumen fermentation characteristics were measured. There was no significant effect on the consumption of dry matter, whereas there was a significant effect (P < 0.05) on the consumption of crude protein, fat, crude fibre and total digestible nutrients. Concentrate or CLS at a 20 % level could increase BW and feed efficiency. No significant difference was observed in total bacteria; however, concentrate could increase total protozoa (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids were higher in T2 than in T3, but ammonia concentration was higher in T3 than in T2. In conclusion, feeding 20 % cassava leaf silage greatly improved sheep performance, approaching that achieved by feeding concentrate." .

In the framework of a project aimed at the development of a biological life support system for manned missions in space, we investigated the effects of PGPMs on four common food crops (durum and bread wheat, potato and soybean) cultivated in recirculating hydroponic systems for a whole life cycle. Each crop was inoculated with a commercial PGPM mixture and the composition of the microbial communities associated with their root rhizosphere, rhizoplane/endosphere and with the recirculating nutrient solution was characterised through 16S- and ITS-targeted Illumina MiSeq sequencing. PGPM addition was shown to induce changes in the composition of these communities, though these changes varied both between crops and over time. Microbial communities of PGPM-treated plants were shown to be more stable over time. Though additional development is required, this study highlights the potential benefits that PGPMs may confer to plants grown in hydroponic systems, particularly when cultivated in extreme environments such as space." .

However, decades of pumping combined with minimal recharge has resulted in decreased well capacity in most areas. A calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to compare simulated yields, crop water use, and required irrigation for crop rotations of the region using measured long-term (90 years) historical weather data. Crop rotations included continuous corn and cotton, corn–cotton, sorghum–cotton, cotton–winter wheat, and corn–winter wheat. Results demonstrated that a calibrated SWAT model simulated crop water use and yields well for all listed crops except cotton. The plant growth algorithms in SWAT appear unable to simulate representative cotton yields typical of cotton management in the Texas High Plains. A work-around for a limitation of the auto-irrigate function in SWAT to be suspended during the dormancy period of winter wheat was also used. Summary statistics for crop yield, crop water use, and irrigation were presented for all rotations. Long-term water use of simulations and irrigation probability exceedance statistics are presented for all simulated crops. These data may serve as a decision support tool for producers considering crop rotation strategies." .

As part of multiannual management plans, an adjustment restriction on fish quota has been introduced. Its objective is to obtain an efficient fish stock and to reduce overcapacity for the fishing industry. We develop and apply a bi-level stochastic dynamic programming model to study the effect of a quota adjustment restriction on the net present value of resource rents, overcapacity and fish stock, when the system is recovering from a downward environmental shock. At level one, a policy maker sets the quota, considering fishermen behavior, stochastic fish stock dynamics, capital stock dynamics and a quota adjustment restriction. At level two, fishermen harvest myopically and make long-term investment decisions, assuming that fish stock and quota do not change over time. The two levels are linked by the quota, which is optimized by the policy maker at level one and becomes a restriction for myopic harvest and long-term investment decisions of fishermen at level two. Our analysis suggests that in the long run, overcapacity can be reduced by 54 % at modest costs, namely at a 1 % reduction in the net present value of resource rents. Long and short run sustainability of the fish stock is not affected." .

Targeted AM subset panels were instrumental in revealing interesting loci. AbstractLeaf rust is a common disease of wheat, consistently reducing yields in many wheat-growing regions of the world. Although fungicides are commonly applied to wheat in the United States (US), genetic resistance can provide less expensive, yet effective control of the disease. Our objectives were to map leaf rust resistance genes in a large core collection of spring wheat accessions selected from the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service National Small Grains Collection (NSGC), determine whether previously characterized race-nonspecific resistance genes could be identified with our panel, and evaluate the use of targeted panels to identify seedling and adult plant resistance (APR) genes. Association mapping (AM) detected five potentially novel leaf rust resistance loci on chromosomes 2BL, 4AS, and 5DL at the seedling stage, and 2DL and 7AS that conditioned both seedling and adult plant resistance. In addition, ten potentially novel race-nonspecific resistance loci conditioned field resistance and lacked seedling resistance. Analyses of targeted subsets of the accessions identified additional loci not associated with resistance in the complete core panel. Using molecular markers, we also confirmed the presence and effectiveness of the race-nonspecific genes Lr34, Lr46, and Lr67 in our panel. Although most of the accessions in this study were susceptible to leaf rust in field and seedling tests, many resistance loci were identified with AM. Through the use of targeted subset panels, more loci were identified than in the larger core panels alone." .

ZM is a plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterial strain isolated from the rhizospheric soil of Populus euphratica in northwestern China. In this study, low nitrogen supply significantly stimulated the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in Serratia sp.ZM. The inoculation of the bacterium to wheat seedlings improved plant growth compared with the uninoculated group, and the stimulating effect was more prominent under low nitrogen stress. Inactivation of the predicted key gene in the IAA biosynthesis pathway impaired IAA production and significantly hampered mutant growth in poor medium. Furthermore, the IAA-deficient mutant lost the PGP effect under either normal or low nitrogen conditions in plant experiments. This study revealed the significant impact of environmental nitrogen levels on IAA production in the PGP strain and the vital effect of IAA on resistance physiology of both the bacterium and host plant. The characteristics of Serratia sp. ZM also indicated its application potential as a biofertilizer for plants, especially those suffering from poor nitrogen soil." .

AbstractGenetically modified (GM) crops can act as powerful complement to the crops produced by laborious and time consuming conventional breeding methods to meet the worldwide demand for quality foods. GM crops can help fight malnutrition due to enhanced yield, nutritional quality and increased resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, several biosafety issues and public concerns are associated with cultivation of GM crops developed by transgenesis, i.e., introduction of genes from distantly related organism. To meet these concerns, researchers have developed alternative concepts of cisgenesis and intragenesis which involve transformation of plants with genetic material derived from the species itself or from closely related species capable of sexual hybridization, respectively. Recombinase technology aimed at site-specific integration of transgene can help to overcome limitations of traditional genetic engineering methods based on random integration of multiple copy of transgene into plant genome leading to gene silencing and unpredictable expression pattern. Besides, recently developed technology of genome editing using engineered nucleases, permit the modification or mutation of genes of interest without involving foreign DNA, and as a result, plants developed with this technology might be considered as non-transgenic genetically altered plants. This would open the doors for the development and commercialization of transgenic plants with superior phenotypes even in countries where GM crops are poorly accepted. This review is an attempt to summarize various past achievements of GM technology in crop improvement, recent progress and new advances in the field to develop improved varieties aimed for better consumer acceptance." .

Pigs can be infected with human pathogenic Brucella suis biovars 1 and 3 and can be a significant source of brucellosis for humans. Uganda has a rapidly growing pig population, and the pork consumption per capita is the highest in East Africa. The objective of this work was to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis in Ugandan pigs. A cross-sectional serosurvey of pigs was conducted in three of the major pig-keeping districts in Uganda (Masaka (n = 381 samples), Mukono (n = 398), and Kamuli (n = 414)). In addition, pigs originating from these districts were sampled in the major pig abattoir in Kampala (n = 472). In total, 1665 serum samples were investigated by serological and molecular tests. Only three putative brucellosis-positive samples were detected serologically using indirect ELISA. These sera were found negative for Brucella antibodies by CFT; however, two had antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica as determined by SAT. Presence of antibodies against Yersiniae was confirmed by Y. enterocolitica antibody-specific ELISA. The two Yersiniae ELISA-positive samples were brucellosis negative using real-time PCR. We tested additional 142 sera from the 1665 samples with real-time PCR. All tested negative. Under this type of production system, we expect a maximum B. suis prevalence of less than 1 % at 95 % confidence level, and therefore, the risk of acquiring brucellosis from the pigs or their products is negligible. However, pigs may harbor the zoonotic Y. enterocolitica. This is the first study to investigate the occurrence of brucellosis in pigs in Uganda and the first study to report Y. enterocolitica antibodies in swine in Uganda." .

The experiment was conducted at Embrapa Beef Cattle in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, from July to September 2013. The evaluations were conducted on four consecutive days, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., local time (GMT −4:00), with 1 hour intervals, recording the microclimate parameters: air temperature (°C), black globe temperature (°C), wet bulb temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and wind speed (m.s−1), for the subsequent calculation of the Temperature and Humidity Index, the Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index, and the Radiant Thermal Load. The largest changes in microclimate parameters were found in the full sun, between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m., in less dense eucalyptus system, followed by the scattered native trees system, resulting in a maximum Temperature and Humidity Index of 81, Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index of 88 and Radiant Thermal Load of 794 W m−2. Therefore, it is observed that with the presence of trees in pastures were possible reductions of up to 3.7 % in Temperature and Humidity Index, 10.2 % in the Black Globe Temperature and Humidity Index, and 28.3 % of the Radiant Thermal Load in the shade. Thus, one can conclude that the presence of trees and their arrangement in the systems provide better microclimate conditions and animal thermal comfort in pastures." .

The accuracy of biomass density maps depends on the availability of reliable allometric models used in combination with data derived from satellites images and forest inventory data. To reduce the uncertainty in estimates of carbon emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation, better information on allometric equations and the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass stocks in each land use/land cover (LULC) class is needed for the different ecological zones. Such information has been sparse for the West African Sudan Savannah zone. This paper provides new data and results for this important zone. The analysis combines satellite images and locally derived allometric models based on non-destructive measurements to estimate aboveground biomass stocks at the watershed level in the Sudan Savannah zone in Benin. ResultsWe compared three types of empirically fitted allometric models of varying model complexity with respect to the number of input parameters that are easy to measure at the ground: model type I based only on the diameter at breast height (DBH), type II which used DBH and tree height and model type III which used DBH, tree height and wood density as predictors. While for most LULC classes model III outperformed the other models even the simple model I showed a good performance. The estimated mean dry biomass density values and attached standard error for the different LULC class were 3.28 ± 0.31 (for cropland and fallow), 3.62 ± 0.36 (for Savanna grassland), 4.86 ± 1.03 (for Settlements), 14.05 ± 0.72 (for Shrub savanna), 45.29 ± 2.51 (for Savanna Woodland), 46.06 ± 14.40 (for Agroforestry), 94.58 ± 4.98 (for riparian forest and woodland), 162 ± 64.88 (for Tectona grandis plantations), 179.62 ± 57.61 (for Azadirachta indica plantations), 25.17 ± 7.46 (for Gmelina arborea plantations), to 204.92 ± 57.69 (for Eucalyptus grandis plantations) Mg ha−1. The higher uncertainty of agroforestry system and plantations is due to the variance in age which affects biomass stocks. ConclusionThe results from this study help to close the existing knowledge gap with respect to biomass allometric models at the watershed level and the estimation of aboveground biomass stocks in each LULC in the Sudan Savannah in West Africa. The use of model type I, which relies only on the easy to measure DBH, seems justified since it performed almost as good as the more complex model types II and III. The work provided useful data on wood density of the main species of the Sudan Savannah zone, the related local derived biomass expansion factor and the biomass density in each LULC class that would be an indispensable information tool for carbon accounting programme related to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and forests conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) initiatives." .

Ewes with similar age and weight, primiparas in the final stage of gestation, totaling 24 animals were selected. Sampling days were 10 and 2 for pre-partum and 2, 6, and 12 days for post-partum to evaluate total proteins, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and urea levels, in addition to thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Fecal examination by McMaster method was performed during bleeding, and based on the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG), the animals were divided into two groups: A (sheep with EPG <1000) and B (sheep with EPG >1000) to evaluate the effect of the parasitic load. Statistical analyses of biochemical parameters and EPG were performed taking into account groups, evaluated each time of sampling and over time, as well as without considering the groups, comparing pre- and post-partum and over time. It was possible to verify that the influence of time had a significant (P < 0.01) impact on cholesterol, triglycerides, total proteins, albumin, globulin, TBARS, and GST specifically among sampling time. When time of collection was considered, there were some differences between groups A and B for the variables: triglycerides (day 6 post-partum) and globulin (day 2 pre-partum). It is concluded that the parasitic load did influence seric levels of the urea, triglycerides, and globulins on a determined time." .

An increase in unsaturated FAs content or iodine value (IV) as a measure of the degree of unsaturation would help to open up new markets for the oil. One way to manipulate the fatty acid composition (FAC) in palm oil is through introgression of favourable alleles from the American oil palm, E. oleifera, which has a more unsaturated oil. ResultsIn this study, a segregating E. oleifera x E. guineensis (OxG) hybrid population for FAC is used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to IV and various FAs. QTL analysis revealed 10 major and two putative QTLs for IV and six FAs, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1 and C18:2 distributed across six linkage groups (LGs), OT1, T2, T3, OT4, OT6 and T9. The major QTLs for IV and C16:0 on LGOT1 explained 60.0 – 69.0 % of the phenotypic trait variation and were validated in two independent BC2 populations. The genomic interval contains several key structural genes in the FA and oil biosynthesis pathways such as PATE/FATB, HIBCH, BASS2, LACS4 and DGAT1 and also a relevant transcription factor (TF), WRI1. The literature suggests that some of these genes can exhibit pleiotropic effects in the regulatory networks of these traits. Using the whole genome sequence data, markers tightly linked to the candidate genes were also developed. Clustering trait values according to the allelic forms of these candidate markers revealed significant differences in the IV and FAs of the palms in the mapping and validation crosses. ConclusionsThe candidate gene approach described and exploited here is useful to identify the potential causal genes linked to FAC and can be adopted for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in oil palm." .

Owing to the limited availability of arable land resources, large areas of Cd-contaminated lands are inevitably being used for the production of vegetables, posing great risks to human health via the food chain. However, strategies to improve yield and reduce Cd concentration in crops grown in contaminated soils are being developed. In the present study, using pot experiments, we investigated the effects of two slow-release nitrogen fertilizers (SRNFs), resin-coated ammonium nitrate (Osmocote313s), and resin-coated urea (urea620), on the growth and Cd concentration of the Cd-contaminated pakchoi. The results showed that pakchoi grown in soil containing 5 mg kg−1 of Cd-induced oxidative stress (indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2, and O2 ·−) and photosynthesis inhibition, which in turn was restored with the application of SRNFs. However, pakchoi grown in Cd-contaminated soil supplied with Osmocote313s and urea620 showed 103 and 203 % increase in fresh weight and 51–55 % and 44–56 % decrease in Cd concentration, respectively, as compared with their controls (pakchoi treated with instant soluble nitrogen fertilizers). On the basis of an increase in their tolerance index (47–238 %) and a decrease in their translocation factor (7.5–21.6 %), we inferred that the plants treated with SRNFs have a stronger tolerance to Cd and a lower efficiency of Cd translocation to edible parts than those treated with instant soluble nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, in terms of both crop production and food safety, application of SRNFs could be an effective strategy for improving both biomass production and quality in pakchoi grown under Cd stress." .

AM fungal extraradical hyphal density was significantly higher in E. nutans than that in A. sativa and V. sativa in the unfertilized control and was significantly increased by urea and manure in A. sativa and by manure only in E. nutans, but not by either fertilizers in V. sativa.

Forty-eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of AM fungi were obtained through 454 pyrosequencing of 18S rDNA. The OTU richness and Shannon diversity index of AM fungi were significantly higher in E. nutans than those in V. sativa and/or A. sativa, but not significantly affected by any fertilizer in all of the three plant species. AM fungal community composition was significantly structured directly by plant identity only and indirectly by both urea addition and plant identity through soil total nitrogen content.

Treatments consisted of diets either containing a 1:1 ratio of cod liver oil (CLO) and soybean oil (SBO) (Diet 1) or thraustochytrid (Diet 2) as source of lipid and fatty acids at 2 % level. Natural diet Gracilariopsis heteroclada (Diet 3) served as the control. No significant difference in growth was observed in abalone fed Diet 3 (SGR: 5.3 % BW day−1; DISL: 265 μm day−1) and Diet 2 (SGR: 5.2 % BW day−1; DISL: 255 μm day−1). Survival ranged from 78 to 85 % for all treatments and was not significantly different from each other. A 96-h salinity stress test showed highest survival of 84 % in abalone fed Diet 2 compared with those fed diets 1 and 3 (42 %). The high growth rate of abalone fed Diet 2 and high tolerance to low salinity could be attributed to its high DHA content (8.9 %), which resulted to its high DHA/EPA ratio of 10.5 %. These fatty acids play a significant role in abalone nutrition. The fatty acid profile of abalone meat is a reflective of the fatty acid profile of the oil sources in the diet. The present study suggests that the use of Schizochytrium oil in lieu of CLO and SBO can support good growth of abalone which is comparable with abalone fed the natural seaweeds diet." .

MethodsWe measured nutrient resorption efficiency by trees, nutrient contents in leaf litterfall, decomposition rates of leaf litter, nutrient turnover in decomposing leaf litter, and plant-available nutrients in the soil in mono-species stands of beech, oak, hornbeam and lime and in mixed-species stands, each consisting of three of these species. ResultsCycling of nutrients through leaf litter input and decomposition were influenced by the types of tree species and not simply by tree species diversity. Trees and microbial biomass were competing strongly for P, less for K and only marginally for N. Such competition was most pronounced in mono-species stands of beech and oak, which had low nutrient turnover in their slow decomposing leaf litter, and less in mono-species stands of hornbeam and lime, which had high nutrient turnover in their fast decomposing leaf litter. ConclusionsThe low soil P and K availability in beech stands, which limit the growth of beech at Hainich, Germany, were alleviated by mixing beech with hornbeam and lime. These species-specific effects on nutrient cycling and soil nutrient availability can aid forest management in improving productivity and soil fertility." .

Intracellular plant immune receptors called nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins contain a central nucleotide-binding (NB) domain followed by a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and are key initiators of plant defense responses. However, recent studies demonstrated that NLRs with non-canonical domain architectures play an important role in plant immunity. These composite immune receptors are thought to arise from fusions between NLRs and additional domains that serve as “baits” for the pathogen-derived effector proteins, thus enabling pathogen recognition. Several names have been proposed to describe these proteins, including “integrated decoys” and “integrated sensors”. We adopt and argue for “integrated domains” or NLR-IDs, which describes the product of the fusion without assigning a universal mode of action. ResultsWe have scanned available plant genome sequences for the full spectrum of NLR-IDs to evaluate the diversity of integrations of potential sensor/decoy domains across flowering plants, including 19 crop species. We manually curated wheat and brassicas and experimentally validated a subset of NLR-IDs in wild and cultivated wheat varieties. We have examined NLR fusions that occur in multiple plant families and identified that some domains show re-occurring integration across lineages. Domains fused to NLRs overlap with previously identified pathogen targets confirming that they act as baits for the pathogen. While some of the integrated domains have been previously implicated in disease resistance, others provide new targets for engineering durable resistance to plant pathogens. ConclusionsWe have built a robust reproducible pipeline for detecting variable domain architectures in plant immune receptors across species. We hypothesize that NLR-IDs that we revealed provide clues to the host proteins targeted by pathogens, and that this information can be deployed to discover new sources of disease resistance." .
