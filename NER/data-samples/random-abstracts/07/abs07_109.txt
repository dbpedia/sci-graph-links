Abstract We study a quasilinear Schrödinger equation $$\{ \begin{array}{*{20}{c}} { - {\varepsilon ^N}{\Delta _N}u + V\left( x \right){{\left| u \right|}^{N - 2}}u = Q\left( x \right)f\left( u \right)\;\;\;in\;{\mathbb{R}^N},} \\ {0 < u \in {W^{1,N}}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^N}} \right),\;u\left( x \right)\xrightarrow{{\left| x \right| \to \infty }}0,} \end{array}$$ {−εNΔNu+V(x)|u|N−2u=Q(x)f(u)inℝN,0<u∈W1,N(ℝN),u(x)→|x|→∞0, where V,Q are two continuous real functions on ℝ N and ε > 0 is a real parameter. Assume that the nonlinearity f is of exponential critical growth in the sense of Trudinger–Moser inequality, we are able to establish the existence and concentration of the semiclassical solutions by variational methods.
