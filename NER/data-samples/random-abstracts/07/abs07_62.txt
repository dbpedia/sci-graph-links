Abstract Key message Key QTLs were identified for P efficiency in barley. Phosphorus efficiency and grain yield can be improved simultaneously in breeding. AbstractAn important breeding goal for many crop species is improved phosphorus (P) efficiency. As in many other crops, selection for P efficient barley varieties has been slow because of inconsistent definitions of P efficiency and unknown genetic controls of P efficiency. We used two criteria to assess P efficiency in a doubled haploid Commander/Fleet population: P responsiveness (estimated as the deviation from the regression of yield with added P against yield with no added P treatment) and PUE (relative yield). Phosphorus responsiveness, PUE and grain yield were phenotyped at 0 and 30 kg P/ha in five environments. Lines consistently responsive to 30 kg P/ha across environments had the highest yield at the two P rates, and P responsiveness showed significantly higher broad sense heritability than PUE in the materials we studied. Genotyping of the population was subjected to a 9,000 single nucleotide polymorphism array and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for P responsiveness were mapped with yield at 30 kg P/ha, which are common QTLs for yield when P was not limiting growth. The largest QTL for P responsiveness was mapped to 7HL in 2 years. PUE varied from 31 to 124 % across environments and one of the QTLs for PUE was mapped with yield at 0 kg P/ha. Our results demonstrate P responsiveness and grain yield can be improved simultaneously under high-input agricultural systems, but breeding for high PUE varieties may need to explore landrace or wild barley germplasm for low P tolerant alleles.
