Abstract The results are presented of assays carried out to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of several non-aerated compost teas obtained from four agricultural wastes (spent mushroom substrate, olive oil husk + cotton gin trash composted and mixed with rice husk, grape marc compost and cork compost) in controlling the mycopathogen Verticillium fungicola. Compost:water ratios of 1:4 and 1:8 (w/v) were used and extraction periods of 1, 7 and 14 days. The aqueous extracts obtained were used untreated, autoclaved or microfiltered and were assayed against three V. fungicola isolates. The results suggest that the non-aerated compost teas made with no prior sterilisation treatment obtained the same percentage of inhibition as the positive control using prochloraz. The compost teas obtained by autoclaving or microfiltration lost much of their activity and had little effect on mycelium growth of the isolates tested. As regards the extraction times, a period of 1 to 7 days can be considered adequate, while the 1:4 dilution provided slightly better results than the 1:8 mixture.
