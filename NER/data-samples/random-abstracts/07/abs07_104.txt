Abstract Rotenone is an active ingredient that has been widely used as pesticide. However, rotenone is poorly soluble in water. Therefore, a water-soluble carrier is needed. Here, we synthesised, characterised and applied oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan for the first time as a carrier agent for rotenone. Oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan is soluble in acidic, neutral and basic media. The critical micelle concentration of oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan is 0.096 mg/mL. Oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan formed self-aggregates and exhibited spherical shape with the values of 35.5–66.4 nm. We studied the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan micelles with different weight ratios of oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan to rotenone. We found an encapsulation efficiency of 97 % and a loading capacity of 0.97 % for oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan/rotenone 100:1 w/w. Oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan released 96.00 % of the rotenone loaded within 50 h. Overall, our findings show the feasibility of oleoyl-carboxymethyl chitosan as a novel water-solubilising agent for pesticide formulations.
