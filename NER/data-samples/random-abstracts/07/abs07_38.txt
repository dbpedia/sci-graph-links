Abstract Deficiency of boron (B), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn) is a major factor constraining crop production on acidic soils of Northeast India; yet these nutrients are conventionally not included in fertilizer recommendation for crop production. To assess the criticality of micronutrientsâ€™ application on these soils, we conducted a greenhouse experiment on an acid Alfisol where French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), a micronutrient-sensitive crop, was grown with seven combinations of macro- and micronutrients. The beneficial effect of micronutrients on crop yield was mediated mostly through their effect on seed and pod characteristics, and general improvement in crop health and nutrition as reflected by improved SPAD index.
