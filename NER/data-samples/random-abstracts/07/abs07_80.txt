Abstract AimsOur goals were (1) to determine whether tree species diversity affects nutrient (N, P and K) cycling, and (2) to assess whether there is competition for these nutrients between microbial biomass and trees. MethodsWe measured nutrient resorption efficiency by trees, nutrient contents in leaf litterfall, decomposition rates of leaf litter, nutrient turnover in decomposing leaf litter, and plant-available nutrients in the soil in mono-species stands of beech, oak, hornbeam and lime and in mixed-species stands, each consisting of three of these species. ResultsCycling of nutrients through leaf litter input and decomposition were influenced by the types of tree species and not simply by tree species diversity. Trees and microbial biomass were competing strongly for P, less for K and only marginally for N. Such competition was most pronounced in mono-species stands of beech and oak, which had low nutrient turnover in their slow decomposing leaf litter, and less in mono-species stands of hornbeam and lime, which had high nutrient turnover in their fast decomposing leaf litter. ConclusionsThe low soil P and K availability in beech stands, which limit the growth of beech at Hainich, Germany, were alleviated by mixing beech with hornbeam and lime. These species-specific effects on nutrient cycling and soil nutrient availability can aid forest management in improving productivity and soil fertility.
