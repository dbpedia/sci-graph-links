Abstract This study evaluated whether the administration of 50 and 100 mg bovine somatotropin (bST) at the start of estrous synchronization and at the time of artificial insemination improves lambing rate and prolificacy in hair sheep. Four hundred eighty adult hair ewes (Pelibuey, Blackbelly, Dorper, Katahdin, and their crosses) were synchronized with intravaginal sponge containing 40 mg of fluorogestone acetate. On the day of sponge insertion, ewes were assigned to three treatments: the bST-100 treatment (n = 156) received 100 mg bST at the start of synchronization (d 0) and at the time of insemination (d 14), the bST-50 treatment (n = 159) received 50 mg bST in the same schedule as the previous group, and the control (n = 165) did not receive any bST. Lambing rate and percentage of multiple births were analyzed using the GENMOD procedure of SAS. Prolificacy data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The IGF-1 and insulin concentrations were analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures. The bST application did not affect the lambing rate (P = 0.06). The proportion of ewes with multiple births (P = 0.01) and prolificacy (P = 0.04) were higher in the bST-50 (54.3 % and 1.57 ± 0.1) than the bST-100 (18.2 % and 1.25 ± 0.1) and control (33.3 % and 1.28 ± 0.1) groups. The IGF-1 and insulin concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in the bST-treated groups, but the insulin concentration was higher (P = 0.001) in the bST-100 group than in the bST-50 group. The administration of 50 or 100 mg bST at the start of synchronization and at the time of artificial insemination does not increase lambing rate. However, the dose of 50 mg increased the proportion of multiple births and prolificacy.
