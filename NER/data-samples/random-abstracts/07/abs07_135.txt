Abstract The glyoxalase system catalyzes the conversion of cytotoxic methylglyoxal to d-lactate via the intermediate S-d-lactoylglutathione. It comprises two enzymes, Glyoxalase I (Gly I) and Glyoxalase II (Gly II), and reduced glutathione which acts as a cofactor by anchoring the substrates in the active sites of the two enzymes. The overexpression of both Gly I and Gly II, either alone or in combination, has earlier been reported to confer tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the consequences of constitutive and stress-induced overexpression of Gly I on the performance and productivity of plants. Towards this end, several Gly I transgenic Brassica juncea lines (designated as R and S lines) were generated in which the glyoxalase I (gly I) gene was expressed under the control of either a stress-inducible rd29A promoter or a constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Both the R and S lines showed enhanced tolerance to salinity, heavy metal, and drought stress when compared to untransformed control plants. However, the S lines showed yield penalty under non-stress conditions while no such negative effect was observed in the R lines. Our results indicate that the overexpression of the gly I gene under the control of stress-inducible rd29A promoter is a better option for improving salt, drought and heavy metal stress tolerance in transgenic plants.
