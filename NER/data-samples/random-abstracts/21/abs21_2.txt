Abstract The Brigham Young University-New World Archaeological Foundation is developing an interdisciplinary research program focused on the upper Grijalva River basin which was occupied at the time of the Spanish conquest principally by indigenous Coxoh Mayan-speakers. Five important Coxoh villages have been identified and located in this region and excavtions are planned at all of them. During the spring of 1975, three months were spent mapping and excavating at Coneta, one of the five villages, in order to investigate the processes of Coxoh acculturation. Of particular interest to the investigations are changes in domestic and ceremonial architecture, community pattern, diet, ceramics, and other aspects of material culture. Such changes are important in understanding syncretic changes in the social systems including kinship, residency, land ownership, and agricultural techniques. A primary function of the archaeological and ethno-historic study of such Colonial sites is the establishment of a social and material culture base line of known linguistic affiliation (Coxoh Maya) to serve as a point of departure for comparisons in future investigations in the same region at purely pre-Hispanic sites. This paper explains the origin and purpose of the Coxoh Project, summarizes the results of the first field season and details some of the more important aspects of the accultivation process.
