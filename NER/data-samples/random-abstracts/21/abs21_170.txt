Erratum Judson Kratzer should be acknowledged as having prepared the “Topographical Map of Wye Hall Property” with Conrad M. Goodwin on the caption for Figure 5 (page 144) in the recent article “Perspective and Surveillance in Eighteenth-Century Maryland Gardens, Including William Paca’s Garden on Wye Island.” This article appeared in Historical Archaeology 39(4), co-authored by Mark P. Leone, James M. Harmon, and Jessica L. Neuwirth. The authors apologize for this inadvertent omission.
