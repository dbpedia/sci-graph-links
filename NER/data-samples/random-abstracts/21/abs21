At Lamto, Côte d’Ivoire, most of these lenticular mounds house nests of Odontotermes aff. pauperans which have to date been thought to have built them. However, repeated observations made in 2000 and 2015 supply several arguments in favour of another hypothesis, namely that after a nest of Macrotermes has been abandoned and eroded, it could be colonized by O. aff. pauperans and subsequently maintained, stabilized, by this latter species or possibly recolonized by another Macrotermes society." .

While recent decades have seen an increase in conceptual and scholarly interest in solidarity in North America and other parts of the Anglo-Saxon world, the concept is much more strongly anchored in Europe. Continental European politics in particular have given rise to two of the most influential traditions of solidarity, namely, socialism and Christian ethics. Solidarity has also guided important public instruments and institutions in Europe (e.g., welfare, healthcare, etc.). Despite the much stronger affinity of continental European societies to solidaristic thinking, we argue that solidarity has much to offer for addressing societal challenges on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. After proposing a working definition of solidarity that highlights its utility for guiding policy and practice, we give an example of how a solidarity-based perspective can shape instruments for the governance of data use." .

As dangerous places, underground mines exerted important holds over community life and shaped the formation of mining identities. Despite this centrality to the mining life, historical archaeological research underground remains limited because the hazards have never dissipated. This article establishes prospective ground for the archaeology of underground mines, taking its lead from several pioneering studies in order to better assess the nature of recoverable archaeological information. In particular, it is argued that the material evidence from the workplace enables localized insights into scalar transformations occurring in the industry, the cultures of work practice, and the mechanisms by which miners coped with uncertain environments. This article also considers strategies by which future investigations might safely proceed." .

This was particularly aimed at a modernisation project in order for the legacy of the Joseon dynasty, which had ruled Korea for five centuries to the end of the nineteenth century, to transform itself into a ‘modernized’ nation state. The ways in which Hangul, the Korean alphabet, was socially produced as the legitimate national writing system from one vernacular variety under the colonial regime are examined. The article contends that while the production of the national writing system functioned as a means for anti-colonial movements, it also naturalized differential socioeconomic resource distribution among Joseon people according to literacy skills in Joseon’s transformation into the modern Korean nation state. The article discusses the limitations of mobilizing linguistic nationalism as a means of political emancipation." .

Using the data generated by limited excavations at seven sites, combined with a study of store records from the1840s and travelers’ accounts, this paper provides an archaeological perspective of life on the Missouri Ozarks frontier. In particular, as in other frontier settings, status differences do not appear to be visible in the archaeological record. In this case, the explanation may be related to the Scotch-Irish cultural traditions of the inhabitants." .

While the arrival time of any putative Jewish ancestors of the community has been speculated to have taken place as far back as biblical times (King Solomon’s era), a Jewish community in the Malabar coast has been documented only since the 9th century CE. Here, we explore the genetic history of Cochin Jews by collecting and genotyping 21 community members and combining the data with that of 707 individuals from 72 other Indian, Jewish, and Pakistani populations, together with additional individuals from worldwide populations. We applied comprehensive genome-wide analyses based on principal component analysis, F ST, ADMIXTURE, identity-by-descent sharing, admixture linkage disequilibrium decay, haplotype sharing, allele sharing autocorrelation decay and contrasting the X chromosome with the autosomes. We find that, as reported by several previous studies, the genetics of Cochin Jews resembles that of local Indian populations. However, we also identify considerable Jewish genetic ancestry that is not present in any other Indian or Pakistani populations (with the exception of the Jewish Bene Israel, which we characterized previously). Combined, Cochin Jews have both Jewish and Indian ancestry. Specifically, we detect a significant recent Jewish gene flow into this community 13–22 generations (~470–730 years) ago, with contributions from Yemenite, Sephardi, and Middle-Eastern Jews, in accordance with historical records. Genetic analyses also point to high endogamy and a recent population bottleneck in this population, which might explain the increased prevalence of some recessive diseases in Cochin Jews." .

The complex anatomy of the lateral aspect of the knee has made it difficult to differentiate between various structures such as the iliotibial band, capsulo-osseous layer, Kaplan’s fibres and the anterolateral capsule. The “discovery” of a new anterolateral structure in 2013 was the culmination of many historical studies. In 1879, Paul Ferdinand Segond described a tibial plateau fracture in which he noted a pearly band reinforcing the joint capsule. Other anatomists had their suspicions about this ligament; it was described by Vallois in 1914 in his thesis and extensively studied by Jost in 1921. References to it can be found in comparative anatomy studies. This historical review serves as a reminder that understanding and treating knee sprains is not something new. Level of evidenceV." .

F. Otto Schrader in 1930 argued that the “Kashmir recension” of the Bhagavadgītā represented an older and more authentic tradition of the Gītā than the vulgate text (1930, 8, 10). In reviews of Schrader’s work, Franklin Edgerton (Journal of the American Oriental Society 52: 68–75, 1932) and S. K. Belvalkar (New Indian Antiquary 2: 211–51, 1939a) both thought that the balance of probabilities was rather on the side of the vulgate. In a trenchant critique, Edgerton took up Schrader’s main arguments for the originality of the variant readings or extra verses of the Kashmir version (2.5, 11; 6.7; 1.7; 3.2; 5.21; 18.8; 6.16; 7.18; 11.40, 44; 13.4; 17.23; 18.50, 78) and dismissed them out of hand (1932, 75). Edgerton’s assessment was reinforced by Belvalkar, who included a survey of various other “versions” of the Gītā in existence, either by hearsay or imitation. Belvalkar was especially hostile to the possibility of a Kashmir recension, because, as he noted, “once Schrader’s thesis is accepted as proved, it raises the possibility of other recensions of the Poem being current at different times in different parts of India” (1939a, 212). Belvalkar was consequent in following this assessment in the Critical Edition of the Bhagavadgītā, and the text reprinted there is essentially that of Śaṅkara’s eighth-century commentary. Yet, the publication of the Critical Edition has not sufficed to end the controversy, as witnessed by the latest spate of works (Vedavyas, E, 1990, Ancient Bhagavad Gita: Original Text of 745 verses, with Critical Introduction) (Bhattacharjya, Sunil Kumar, 2013, The Original Bhagavadgītā. Complete with 745 Verses) that claim to have discovered the “original” Gītā. In light of these attempts, we raise the question: why is there such interest in identifying versions of the text at variance from the normative one? And why do Indologists, in the name of “critical” scholarship, continue to welcome the creation of apocryphal versions of Indian texts? We suggest that there is a historical link between German Indology’s emphasis on creating new texts and German Protestantism." .

In particular, Chinese American historical books lack extensive analysis. It is important to reflect cultural accuracy in literature and to help children develop clear concepts of self and others by providing precise cultural and physical characteristics of people. While cultural authenticity allows children the opportunity to see a reflection of real experiences within a book instead of seeing stereotypes or misrepresentations, obtaining correct information about a certain time period can help children to see images of immigration accurately represented in literature. Using the Confucian delineation of interpersonal relationships as the major criterion of cultural authenticity, this article examines three currently available children’s picturebooks set in the historical period between 1848 and 1885. In addition to exploring how Chinese Americans’ interpersonal relationships are portrayed in these children’s historical books, this article argues for more proactive inclusion of the diversity in selection of picturebooks." .

Furthermore, a comparison is made with the corresponding characteristics of the population of surface cyclones passing over Crete during the same period. The Melbourne University Cyclone Tracking Algorithm was employed to examine the genesis and movement of these cyclones while their vertical profile was examined with the aid of the vertical tracing software, Vertical Tracking Scheme (VTS). The input data are based on ERA INTERIM reanalysis datasets with resolution 0.5° × 0.5° during the period 1990 to 2014. It was found that the vast majority originate mainly over the north African coasts, contrasting the preference of all cyclones passing over Crete to develop within the Southeast Mediterranean. Cyclones associated with the flood events are more intense than the cyclonic population, being mainly characterized by long duration and track length. Furthermore, they reveal characteristics of vertically organized baroclinic systems, suggesting that they are mainly driven by baroclinic processes at upper and lower levels." .

A main mover was the Labor Party politician Gro Harlem Brundtland who did not want to deal with unruly and highly vocal Deep Ecologists. Better then to start afresh with a different set of environmental scholars appealing to the technocratic tradition within the Labor Party. Instead of changing the ethical and social ways of dealing with environmental problems as the Deep Ecologists were advocating, she was looking for technological and economic solutions. And she mobilized an international regime of carbon capture storage (CCS), tradable carbon emissions quota (TEQs), and clean development mechanisms (CDMs), all of which eventually were approved in Kyoto in 1997. This move towards technocracy and cost-benefit economics reflects a post-Cold War turn towards utilitarian capitalism, but also a longing to showcase Norway as an environmental pioneer country to the world. The underlying question was how to reconcile the nation’s booming petroleum industry with reduction in climate gas emissions. Should the oil and gas stay underground and the country strive towards the ecologically informed zerogrowth society the Deep Ecologists were envisioning? Or could growth in the petroleum industry take place without harming the environment as the Labor Party environmentalists argued?" .

However, very little is known about how these events affected areas not incorporated into states, such as western Burkina Faso, which was likely home to diverse noncentralized societies. Previous archaeological work at the site of Kirikongo, in the Mouhoun Bend, Burkina Faso, examined the histories of these communities from ca. 100 to 1400 CE. This paper introduces the fifteenth-century (Red IV) ceramics from Kirikongo, exploring their form, function, and decoration and assessing their presence at other sites in the region. Based on these distributions, many communities in the Mouhoun Bend decreased in size or were abandoned during Red IV. During Red IV, potters also adopted new ceramic forms and decorations. These may be associated with new economic activities and with increasing entanglements with Mande and/or Dogon communities." .

Since the Roman period, the Tiber River flowed close to Ancient Ostia and its saltworks, Salinae Ostiensis. The Tiber meander was cut off during the Tiber River flood of 1557 AD and transformed into an oxbow lake. During the nineteenth century the Fiume Morto pond was reclaimed and at present the area is about 3 km distant from the present shoreline and intensely transformed by human settlements. According to radiocarbon dates, the pollen record, not continuous, spans from the fourth century BC to the nineteenth century AD. It shows first a riverine phase before the meander cut off of sixteenth century AD and probably only the last centuries BC were preserved from erosion. The river deposits record riparian vegetation (mainly tamarisk and alder) with mesophilous (mainly deciduous oaks) and Mediterranean (mainly evergreen oaks, heather and olive tree) elements. The human presence is clear, probably related to the development of Ancient Ostia and evidenced by synanthropic taxa. The second phase corresponds to the oxbow lake formed after the meander cut off. Several peaks of pine pollen are tentatively ascribed to Tiber flood events: the first peak is found just in correspondence with the meander cut off at 1557 AD. The numerous floods we interpret in the following part of the diagram could be linked to the increase in extreme events and precipitation that occurred during the Little Ice Age. The last phase, in which freshwater plants are present and chenopods decrease, shows the saltworks abandonment that occurred in nineteenth century. This study turned out to be of key relevance to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the ancient Holocene Tiber meander during the last two and a half millennia." .

It enables a re-evaluation of the procedures of the pioneers of mathematical analysis. Their procedures have been often viewed through the lens of the success of the Weierstrassian foundations. We propose a view without passing through the lens, by means of proxies for such procedures in the modern theory of infinitesimals. The real accomplishments of calculus and analysis had been based primarily on the elaboration of novel techniques for solving problems rather than a quest for ultimate foundations. It may be hopeless to interpret historical foundations in terms of a punctiform continuum, but arguably it is possible to interpret historical techniques and procedures in terms of modern ones. Our proposed formalisations do not mean that Fermat, Gregory, Leibniz, Euler, and Cauchy were pre-Robinsonians, but rather indicate that Robinson’s framework is more helpful in understanding their procedures than a Weierstrassian framework." .

Daily mean sea-level pressure and values of physical quantities provided the basis for distinguishing 27 circulation types, i.e., eight directional cyclonic, transitional, and anticyclonic types, and one non-directional cyclonic, anticyclonic, and an undefined type. Over the area of East-Central Europe, the highest frequency is recorded for air flow from the western sector, with a maximum in the period from December to January. In spring, a higher than average frequency of cyclonic and easterly circulation is observed, and in summer—anticyclonic and northerly. Increased zonal circulation was recorded in the years 1910–1930, and particularly after 1970, and eastern at the end of the nineteenth century and in the 1930s and 1940s. An increase in the frequency of days with non-directional anticyclonic type and westerly air flow, and a simultaneous decrease in frequency of days with south-easterly and easterly circulation were observed throughout the study period. Among the three classes of circulation types, the highest persistence (particularly in winter) was recorded for anticyclonic types, i.e., when the high pressure system occurred over the Scandinavian Peninsula or East Europe." .

The program is significant due to the current rapid marketization of East Asia’s higher education exchange. Accordingly, this study examines CAMPUS Asia as a top-down exchange and explains how the program enables the institutionalization of a trilateral relationship, promotion of mutual understanding, and identity change. It is hoped that the utilization of one-on-one interviews with participant students in particular will enhance the academic contribution of the paper. Moreover, the conclusion explains the current issues of political instability and imbalanced participation the program faces, and suggests measures to overcome these issues. Through this discussion, it is expected that a vision will be produced whereby the CAMPUS Asia program will go beyond its current pilot phase and develop into a stable program." .

Due to non-homogeneous problems, this period has been divided into two short separated periods (1941–1980 and 1995–2013), in order to compute temperature trends. In this context two statistical tests were used: linear regression and Mann-Kendall. The time series of mean annual temperature indicate the current warming period over Iraq identical with the global warming, which has started since the middle of seventh decade of the last century. The 2010 was the warmest year in all stations. Three distinct inter-annual temperature variation patterns were observed. These were probably the effects of micro-scale and meso-scale factors. The first one represents central and northern Iraq. The second represents the south of Iraq and Kirkuk station and the third one is a characteristic for eastern Iraq. Temperature trend analysis revealed that there are general upward trends with the strongest warming trends identified in the summer months which are around 89 % of the total significant monthly trends. Spatially, in both periods the southern region of Iraq is most affected by the warming trend in Tmean and Tmax. When considering Tmin, the southern and northern regions both are affected by warming with more pronounced trend intensity in the northern stations. No significant trend occurs Hai station in both periods and Baghdad has the still less trend value. In the first period the highest rise of Tmean and Tmax values are observed in July and June in Nasiriya station at 0.61 °C/decade and 0.63 °C/decade, respectively and in Mosul station for Tmin in August is 1.41 °C/decade. Moreover, in the period from 1995 to 2013, the highest warming trend of Tmean and Tmax were in Hai station for March at 1.48 °C/decade and at 1.85 °C/decade, respectively. Baghdad station experienced the highest significant trend for Tmin in August at 1.89 °C/decade." .

Many of them enrolled in American colleges, sponsored either by governmental grants or by private funds. As American physics advanced rapidly during the early twentieth century, Chinese physicists studying in top US institutions received first-class professional training. They later went on to become a main driving force in Chinese physics development. The study-in-America programs were apparently more successful than other study-overseas programs. Among other factors, the historical lessons learned from the aborted Chinese Educational Mission in the 1870s, the prevalent and long-time presence of American mission schools in China, and stable public and private funding contributed to their success. American-trained Chinese physicists not only advanced physics study in China but also played leading roles in the development of Chinese science and technology during the twentieth century. This fertile and far-reaching American influence has been embedded in all their accomplishments." .

The most ancient fragments of the construction, found in lacustrine deposits, date back to the first third of the 13th century. An analysis of the structural and textural peculiarities of these deposits made it possible to reconstruct types of hydrogeological regime in the Timerevo paleolake and a paleostrait between this paleolake and Lake Nero. Thus, the waterway between the central part of the Principality of Rostov and early Yaroslavl (the first Russian settlement at the Great Volga Waterway) was revealed. The probable reasons for a rapid warming event followed by a cooling one in the Middle Ages are discussed." .

I show that, for farmland to be turned into an asset, a whole range of conditions have to be fulfilled, presenting a typology of asset making in the context of farmland. Asset making, like commoditization, is a process of assemblage, and it is less straightforward and less stable than generally assumed. Further, I argue that ‘asset making’ is not a one-way process.

Using a Bourdieusian analytic lens, we analyse qualitative data from a small study conducted with ten parents and ten children from an urban school who visited a large science museum. Data includes pre- and post-interviews, audio recordings and visit fieldnotes. We characterised families’ experiences as falling into three discourses, as ‘disorientating’, ‘fun’ or ‘meaningful’ visits. Analysis identifies how the families’ experiences, and the likelihood of deriving science learning from the visit, were shaped through interactions of habitus and capital. Implications for improving equity and inclusion within ISLEs are discussed." .

Around that time, East African groups assimilated with local San groups and gave rise to the Khoekhoe herders. Subsequently, Bantu-speaking farmers, arriving from the north (~1800 years ago), assimilated and displaced San and Khoekhoe groups, a process that intensified with the arrival of European colonists ~350 years ago. In contrast to the western parts of southern Africa, where several Khoe-San groups still live today, the eastern parts are largely populated by Bantu speakers and individuals of non-African descent. Only a few scattered groups with oral traditions of Khoe-San ancestry remain. Advances in genetic research open up new ways to understand the population history of southeastern Africa. We investigate the genomic variation of the remaining individuals from two South African groups with oral histories connecting them to eastern San groups, i.e., the San from Lake Chrissie and the Duma San of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg. Using ~2.2 million genetic markers, combined with comparative published data sets, we show that the Lake Chrissie San have genetic ancestry from both Khoe-San (likely the ||Xegwi San) and Bantu speakers. Specifically, we found that the Lake Chrissie San are closely related to the current southern San groups (i.e., the Karretjie people). Duma San individuals, on the other hand, were genetically similar to southeastern Bantu speakers from South Africa. This study illustrates how genetic tools can be used to assess hypotheses about the ancestry of people who seemingly lost their historic roots, only recalling a vague oral tradition of their origin." .

From 1870 until the First World War, German medical research, teaching, and university organization served as a model for U.S. medical schools and practice. However, after World War I, medical education reforms were implemented in the U.S., and due also to radical economic and political changes at home, German medicine lost its pioneering role. Furthermore, many scientists and clinicians were forced to emigrate in the face of racial and political persecution in Germany and Austria. Since the Second World War, American medicine has grown further to become the world leader in research, training, and clinical practice. The earlier trend of American physicians studying abroad was thus reversed, with many of today’s foremost German physicians completing clinical and research training in the United States." .

This is supplemented by a review of documentary evidence on the political and social activities of corporations and reports published in national and international newspapers. We found that, in the banking companies over the period of study, apparently neutral, corporate, philanthropic activities disclosed and promoted in CSR reports are inextricably linked to powerful leaders’ personal projects and the ruling party’s agendas. We have demonstrated elements of traditional societies, including personal loyalty and the public display of loyalty, the master–servant relationship, and obedience to personal rather than formal authority, provide an understanding of why banks (with or without explicit political linkages with the ruling party) have employed politically charged CSR disclosure strategies. The paper contributes to disclosure studies where political motivations of corporate disclosure rarely discussed.

A marked increase in cannabis achene records from East Asia between ca. 5,000 and 4,000 cal bp might be associated with the establishment of a trans-Eurasian exchange/migration network through the steppe zone, influenced by the more intensive exploitation of cannabis achenes popular in Eastern Europe pastoralist communities. The role of the Hexi Corridor region as a hub for an East Asian spread of domesticated plants, animals and cultural elements originally from Southwest Asia and Europe is highlighted.

The main reason given by authorities for undertaking such huge urban works was the terrible water quality of the river. Filled with dirt and trash, the Senne was systematically associated with insalubrity, even danger. However, beyond the general opinion expressed at that time, it is hard to find any data that reflects the nature, extent, and origins of the pollution at the moment of covering, and in the years after. By addressing the question of water quality in the second half of the 19th century, this paper raises other issues related to the history of industrialisation and the silent transformation of environmental conditions. Reinterpreting an interdisciplinary study by hydro-biologists and historians on the pollution of the Senne, it also enhances the potential of such studies in renewing historical questions." .

Although almost 60 years have passed since the original description of the species in Italy, this parasite has been seldom found in domestic and wildcats in southern Europe. The present study aims to report a new case of patent A. chabaudi infection in a road-killed wildcat from Maramureș County in Northern Romania. The necropsy revealed the presence of parasites in the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle, and the fecal examination showed the presence of L1 larvae. Parasites were morphologically and morphometrically characterized as A. chabaudi, showing 100 % nucleotide similarity to an Angiostrongylus sp. originating from a wildcat from Germany and 99 % to A. chabaudi from Italy. This study reports A. chabaudi for the first time in Eastern Europe, expanding knowledge about the distribution range of this species." .

In historical archaeology, these historic contexts, which can be summarized as testable models, are generally developed through historical research. This article examines a number of contexts on the purchase and use of 19th-century ceramics. Each context is summarized as a model, and is then evaluated in terms of its applicability to ceramic assemblages typically recovered from archaeological sites in the eastern United States." .

The commercial rice economy of the Lowcountry was characterized by dispersed plantation production facilitated by riverine transportation. The urban functions of this largely rural landscape were centered on entrepôt of Charleston, a city whose size and material wealth reflected the region’s commercial success. The Backcountry initially lacked access to the entrepôt’s urban and export markets and its regional isolation fostered insular economic institutions dispersed among smaller nucleated settlements linked by overland routes. Commercial investment by Charleston interests eventually established the infrastructure of specialized production in the Backcountry and incorporated its resources in the larger export economy. The settlement system that emerged in the interior reflected these changes, but did not emulate the Lowcountry. Rather, it bore the imprint of the frontier landscape, components of which merely acquired new roles as regional nodes in South Carolina’s expanding economy, the focus of which remained the older entrepôt that emerged as the South’s major port in the post-frontier period." .

This perspective is closer in spirit and philosophy to the original (and richer) Darwinian idea developed by Darwin himself, and that animated much of the rich late nineteenth century debate about evolution, heredity, adaptation and development, a debate that was largely eclipsed by the early twentieth century emergence of the Neodarwinian synthesis. I will argue that a full realization of the promise of NCT turns on a full understanding of another intellectual revolution of the nineteenth century, Claude Bernard’s conception of homeostasis, a profound statement of the nature of life that has, through the twentieth century, come to be widely misunderstood and trivialized." .

Andean highlanders are known to have developed the most complex societies of pre-Columbian South America despite challenges to their health and reproductive success resulting from chronic exposure to hypoxia. While the physiological adaptations to this environmental stressor are well studied in contemporary Andean highlanders, the molecular evolutionary processes associated with such adaptations remain unclear. We aim to better understand how humans managed to demographically establish in this harsh environment by addressing a central question: did exposure to hypoxia drive adaptation via natural selection within Andean populations or did an existing phenotype –characterized by reduced susceptibility to hypoxic stress–enable human settlement of the Andes? We genotyped three variable loci within the NOS3 and EGLN1 genes previously associated with adaptation to high altitude in 150 ancient human DNA samples from Peruvian high altitude and coastal low altitude sites in a time frame between ~8500–560 BP. We compare the data of 109 successful samples to forward simulations of genetic drift with natural selection and find that selection, rather than drift, explains the gradual frequency changes observed in the highland populations for two of the three SNPs." .

Understandably, this past work has largely focused on the United Kingdom and the United States, the country of manufacture of most transfer prints and the largest market for British pottery exports, respectively. As the global British ceramics industry expanded over the course of the 19th century, however, British merchants were expanding into other markets. The second largest of these for pottery exports, after the United States, was South America. The ideological meanings that archaeologists ascribe to transfer-printed ceramics in the North Atlantic World often take on a very different ideological context once the ceramics are exported to South America. A ceramics assemblage from the coastal Venezuelan city of Barcelona provides an opportunity to study these shifting ideological meanings within one South American context." .

Hungarians moved into the Carpathian Basin from the Eurasian Pontic steppes in the year 895 AD as a confederation of seven tribes, but their further origin remains obscure. Here, we present 17 mtDNA haplotypes and four Y-chromosome haplogroups, which portray the genetic composition of an entire small cemetery of the first generation Hungarians. Using novel algorithms to compare these mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with other ancient and modern Eurasian data, we revealed that a significant portion of the Hungarians probably originated from a long ago consolidated gene pool in Central Asia-South Siberia, which still persists in modern Hungarians. Another genetic layer of the early Hungarians was obtained during their westward migrations by admixing with various populations of European origin, and an important component of these was derived from the Caucasus region. Most of the modern populations, which are genetically closest relatives of ancient Hungarians, today speak non-Indo-European languages. Our results contribute to our understanding of the peopling of Europe by providing ancient DNA data from a still genetically poorly studied period of medieval human migrations." .

Possible research topics might include the history of social relations, structures, labor, workers’ self-management, industrialization, social stratification, class conflict, housing, mass culture and consumption. In socialist Yugoslavia most of these topics inspired ongoing debates, especially in the fields of sociology and philosophy. Historians participated briefly in those debates during the 1980s, but as the country disintegrated in the brutal conflicts of the 1990s, institutionalized humanities developed a negative stance toward the recent socialist past. In the new millennium, with the revival of social history and the constant state of crisis in the existing system, a new generation of historians began to explore Yugoslav socialist society. This paper argues that if this research movement is to be placed on solid ground through the use of primary sources, the first task for archivists should be to identify these sources. Based on an analysis of records applying social history methodology as a structural approach to the broad spectrum of human experience and social processes, it identifies several major categories of records relating to government, local self-government, judiciary, economic enterprises, political organizations and the trade unions and attempts to determine their current state. It concludes with general observations on some possible solutions for preserving relevant records as well as for the change in the appraisal strategies." .

SEM/EDS analysis was conducted on some sections taken from a bronze artifact classifiable as an armilla or fibula fragment. Our aim was to elucidate the nature of the corrosion processes acting on the specimen. SEM investigation detected the segregation of tin towards the outer layer and a depletion of the copper content in the same region. Furthermore, the elemental distribution maps of the sections analyzed evidenced the presence of chloride ions in the border area between the corrosion patina and the metal alloy. Such anion migration of chloride ions into the interior of the alloy leads to a particular variant of the type of corrosion of structure that in the literature has been identified as structure I. A cavity electrode designed for electrochemical measurements of powders was used to perform cyclic voltammetry experiments devoted to explore the activity of the patina covering the surface of the bronze fragment. The surface layer consists mainly of tin and tin oxides; the layer immediately beneath it contains copper oxides. An increase of reactivity was shown in an acidic environment. The activity of the patina is greatly reduced at pH 5 and appears to be zero at neutral pH." .

This paper investigates the response in this region of mixed layer depth (MLD) and the spring bloom initiation to global warming using the output of 15 models from CMIP5. The models indicate that in the late 21st century the mixed layer will shoal, and the MLD reduction will be most pronounced in spring at about 33°N on the southern edge of the present deep-MLD region. The advection of temperature change in the upper 100 m by the mean eastward flow explains the spatial pattern of MLD shoaling in the models. Associated with the shoaling mixed layer, the onset of spring bloom inception is projected to advance due to the strengthened stratification in the warming climate." .

This content analysis focused on the ways in which various peritextual features (dust jackets, beginning endpapers, illustrations before title page, title pages, half title pages, dedication/copyright pages, final endpapers, and notes) contribute to the development of narratives in Caldecott award winning books published between 1938 and 2013. We found that in these quality picturebooks, peritextual features (particularly those appearing before the text of the story) contain rich character and setting information, as well as clues that often point to the genre of a story. In more recently published books especially, important plot elements may unfold only in the peritext. This analysis suggests that peritextual features frequently offer critical information that readers can use to build a framework for stepping into story worlds. Educators attuned to the potentially abundant information in the peritext may guide young readers in exploring these features, and thus foster in their students a richer understanding and fuller engagement with the narrative." .

It is unsurprising, therefore, that the region attracted pioneer prehistorians in the early twentieth century, including L. S. B. Leakey, E. J. Wayland and T. P. O’Brien, who created the first cultural framework for East African prehistory during the 1930s. Although aspects of this framework remain relevant today, others have become misunderstood relics of an old classification system that hinders current research. This is particularly evident in the classification of a Later Stone Age (LSA) culture – the Kenya (East African) Aurignacian, later known as Kenya (East African) Capsian. Although this cultural entity was redressed during the 1970s and 1980s and redefined as the Eburran industry, there is still mystique surrounding the current status of the Kenya Capsian, its original scope and definition, the relationship with the Eburran and its position within a modern understanding of the East African LSA. This is largely due to paradigmatic shifts in researcher attitudes, leading to the use of the Eburran as a false proxy. It is necessary now to completely remove the term Kenya Capsian as an indication of similarity among the different LSA technologies. However, there also needs to be less emphasis on the importance of the Eburran and recognition that it is just one example of a multitude of diverse localised LSA industries. This will open the way for future research into the LSA and facilitate our greater understanding of recent prehistory in East Africa." .

Four participants from a long-distance online forum were interviewed and asked to share their stories of long-distance dating. Their stories were then analyzed based on a narrative research method, and the following questions were explored with the participants: the impact of distance on the relationship, maintaining long-distance relationships, and reflections on long-distance dating. Findings suggested that distance had a large impact on couples, including thoughts of ending the relationship, loneliness, insecurity, and distrust. Themes the participants discussed included the importance of technology, face-to-face visitations, commitment, romantic beliefs, and diverse ways to maintain relationships. Participants also reported high expenses, time differences, and technological limitations as difficulties. Despite these difficulties, participants described creating meanings around the long-distance relationships by realizing the relationships were ultimately worthwhile, and for many couples, a necessary process to grow. Based on the results, the researcher proposes that therapists use narrative therapy in order to work with couples in long-distance relationships. By helping clients externalize the problem through opening up new possibilities for them to describe their difficulties, clients can begin to develop new ways of understanding themselves and others. A discussion with regards to how individuals in Chinese cultures manage conflicts in romantic relationships is included to remind therapists to be culturally sensitive when managing conflicts in collectivistic cultures, which have a tendency towards indirectness, unassertiveness, and lack of confrontation." .

In terms of holism, greater empirical and analytical attention needs be paid to the full range of interacting parties, including both settler and indigenous interlocutors, in order to better understand processes of mutual influence. Vantage-point analysis can be used to better capture the details of historical settings through attempts to understand the spatial dimensions of power relations and, also, to further the deployment of local indigenous concepts in scholarship.

Much evidence supports the idea that eastern carrots originated in Central Asia, while varying opinions exist on the origin of western carrots, especially orange varieties, and the origin of Chinese orange carrots remains unclear. In this study, we used 119 carrot accessions to investigate the relationship between Chinese carrots and western orange varieties (Western orange) using morphology and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The results demonstrate that Chinese carrots are eastern-type and maintain the primitive traits of strong and pubescent leaves, and early flowering. Despite being morphologically similar, the STRUCTURE and phylogenetic analysis based on SSR markers indicated that Western orange were clearly separated from Chinese carrots. These findings, in conjunction with historical documents suggesting that the first Chinese carrots seem to be yellow, suggest that Chinese orange were derived from Chinese red according to the mixed distribution of red and orange accessions. These results suggest that Chinese orange carrots may have undergone a specific, independent process different from that of Western orange." .

This dates back at least to the thirteenth century, with noteworthy developments in the four following centuries and again in the last century. Christian faith and reason intertwine to bring about principles, criteria, and guidelines for action and a set of virtues with relevance for economic activity. Christian spirituality, with 2000 years of history, has been embedded in Christianity from its beginning, but the application to modern business activity is relatively recent. This article introduces a special issue which, we hope, will make its own small contribution to the developments of both Christian ethics and spirituality in the leading business organizations. After a short historical overview and a consideration of the current situation of Christian ethics and spirituality in business, we introduce the papers selected for this issue." .

Under the leadership of Johann Georg Heine (1771–1831) the first German orthopaedic hospital, the Carolinum, was established in 1816. Johann Georg Heine’s legacy was continued by his son Joseph (1803–1877) and his nephew Bernhard Heine (1800–1846), before Albert Hoffa (1859–1907) put the clinical practice of orthopaedics on a strict scientific basis and further promoted a worldwide exchange of knowledge. In 1916, Albert Hoffa’s successor Jakob Riedinger (1861–1917) founded the Koenig-Ludwig-Haus, which hosts the Orthopaedic Hospital and the Centre for Musculoskeletal Research of the University of Wuerzburg. On the occasion of the bicentenary and centenary anniversaries of the founding of the two orthopaedic hospitals, we provide a short view on the development of orthopaedics in Wuerzburg." .

Four distinct reanalyses are considered, two of which cover the entire twentieth-century: NOAA-CIRES Twentieth Century Reanalysis v2 (NOAA-20C) and ECMWF ERA-20C. Calculations are done separately for the OND and JFM-season and, for comparison with previous studies, for the ONDJFM-season as a whole. Comparing the AR-counts from NOAA-20C and ERA-20C with a running 31-year window looping through 1900–2010 reveals differences in the climatological mean and inter-annual variability which, at the start of the twentieth-century, are much more pronounced in western North America than in Europe. Correlating European AR-counts with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) reveals a pattern reminiscent of the well-know precipitation dipole which is stable throughout the entire century. A similar analysis linking western North American AR-counts to the North Pacific index (NPI) is hampered by the aforementioned poor reanalysis agreement at the start of the century. During the second half of the twentieth-century, the strength of the NPI-link considerably varies with time in British Columbia and the Gulf of Alaska. Considering the period 1950–2010, AR-counts are then associated with other relevant large-scale circulation indices such as the East Atlantic, Scandinavian, Pacific-North American and West Pacific patterns (EA, SCAND, PNA and WP). Along the Atlantic coastline of the Iberian Peninsula and France, the EA-link is stronger than the NAO-link if the OND season is considered and the SCAND-link found in northern Europe is significant during both seasons. Along the west coast of North America, teleconnections are generally stronger during JFM in which case the NPI-link is significant in any of the five considered subregions, the PNA-link is significant in British Columbia and the Gulf of Alaska and the WP-link is so along the U.S. West Coast. During OND, these links are significant in the Gulf of Alaska only. If AR-counts are calculated upon persistent (instead of instantaneous) ARs, the link to the NAO weakens over the British Isles and western Iberia. For the experimental set-ups most closely mirroring those applied in Lavers et al. (J Geophys Res Atmos 117, 2012. doi:10.1029/2012JD018027) and Ramos et al. (J Hydrometeorol 16(2):579–597, 2015. doi:10.1175/JHM-D-14-0103.1), the NAO-links are completely or partly insignificant indicating that the inclusion of the persistence criterion notably alters the results.

Because African American children are literacy participants and consumers, they are not immune from experiencing this tension. This essay considers the effects and affective threads of racism and racialization connected to visuality (Foster, 1988), and how educators might support and nurture children’s roles as aesthetic critics and critical readers of books featuring racial imagery and representations. The young African American readers in this study resist a picturebook using colorist logic and macro-level social indexing of phenotypic traits. The author argues that negative social messages about blackness within the larger ethos of society, as well as the absence of diverse representations in children’s literature, contribute to such interpretations. She suggests explicitly teaching African American children about counter-visuality and the ways in which “art works” to shape and transform understandings about complex experiences like racism." .

Besides morphological assessments, the application of Fordisc® has become a useful tool within the last two decades, creating discriminant functions from morphometric data. Unfortunately, until now, white populations are mostly represented by measurements of American individuals. Therefore, classification rates are lower for European skulls than for Euro-Americans. The aim of this study was to show differences in sexual dimorphism between German and Euro-American crania. Furthermore, their secular change from the nineteenth to the twentieth century has been investigated. Analyses have been performed on glabella subtense (GLS), mastoid height (MDH), and bizygomatic breadth (ZYB). Fordisc® 3.1 was used to study sexual dimorphism and secular change, whereas SAS® was used to perform a two-level ANOVA to test for variation in sex dimorphism. Euro-Americans show greater dimorphism than Germans in all three measurements tested. This larger difference is even increasing from the late nineteenth through the late twentieth century in terms of GLS and MDH, while it stays almost the same in the present Europeans. These results explain the unsatisfying classification rates of German and other European crania on Fordisc®. Data collection for European Fordisc® samples is in progress and should improve the current situation." .

Using the known relation between black-box PIT and lower bounds, we obtain lower bounds for these models.

This implies a lower bound of exp$${(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/2}))}$$ (Ω~(n1/2)) for depth-3 multilinear formulas, for some explicit polynomial. For depth-4 multilinear formulas, of size exp$${(n^\\delta)}$$ (nδ) , we give a hitting set of size exp$${\\left(\\tilde{O}\\left(n^{2/3 + 4\\delta/3}\\right) \\right)}$$ O~n2/3+4δ/3 . This implies a lower bound of exp$${(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/4}))}$$ (Ω~(n1/4)) for depth-4 multilinear formulas, for some explicit polynomial. A regular formula consists of alternating layers of $${+,\\times}$$ +,× gates, where all gates at layer i have the same fan-in. We give a hitting set of size (roughly) exp$${\\left(n^{1- \\delta}\\right)}$$ n1-δ , for regular depth-d multilinear formulas with formal degree at most n and size exp$${(n^\\delta)}$$ (nδ) , where $${\\delta = O(1/{\\sqrt{5}^d})}$$ δ=O(1/5d) . This result implies a lower bound of roughly exp$${(\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/{\\sqrt{5}^d}}))}$$ (Ω~(n1/5d)) for such formulas. We note that better lower bounds are known for these models, but also that none of these bounds was achieved via construction of a hitting set. Moreover, no lower bound that implies such PIT results, even in the white-box model, is currently known. Our results are combinatorial in nature and rely on reducing the underlying formula, first to a depth-4 formula, and then to a read-once algebraic branching program (from depth-3 formulas, we go straight to read-once algebraic branching programs)." .

The used methodological approach constitutes a useful example for other early series. The analysis of this record shows that the temperature in Bologna was not different from the 1961–1990 reference period.

In this paper, a new data structure MVTree is developed based on geometric algebra to support the unified organization and computation of geometrical primitives. The MVTree is a tree-like data structure which has a dimensional hierarchical structure generated by outer product. Multidimensional geometrical primitives is represented as the combination of blades stored in the nodes of MVTrees. The geometric computation between different geometrical objects is operated with GA operators with a judgement-based hierarchical computation. Applications of the MVTree are demonstrated by a topological relation computation and a Delaunay-TIN intersection. The results suggest that the MVTree structure can support unified representation of arbitrary-dimensional geometrical primitives, and can integrate data organization and computation in a unitary structure as well. The application of the new MVTree data structure can not only reduce the complexity of data architectures but also inherit the power of geometric algebra computing to improve the processing ability of computer graphic software." .

Indeed, the sound and playing characteristics of historical instruments are often very different from those of the instruments we are used to. For example, in the case of the Viennese piano actions used by Mozart and his contemporaries, the so-called “escapement height” largely conditions the response of the instrument to the pianist’s touch. In this contribution, we aim to define how the Viennese action behaves when the escapement height, usually tuned by piano technicians, is changed. To do this, a multibody model containing the frame, the key, the hammer, the pawl, and the string has been developed. This paper describes how the model has been carried out; a special focus is put on the detection of the intermittent contacts between bodies, which may look easy in the real action, but is rather complex to model. The model is compared with high-speed imaging data and a parametric study of the escapement height is performed by adjusting the rest position of the pawl. The high sensitivity of this regulation is revealed as a shift of 1 mm of the pawl seems to induce a displacement of the escapement height of 20 mm. It is also shown that a strong but linear decrease of the maximal force between the hammer and the string appears when the escapement height increases." .

During the same period in Germany Friedrich Pauwels (1885-1980) founded an orthopaedic institute and an engineering workshop in Aachen in 1913 and rapidly developed a lifelong interest in biomechanical influences: Using these theories, he achieved in 1927 healing of a non-union of the femoral neck by a re-orientation osteotomy, a condition considered to be incurable until this osteotomy and created his famous classification of fracture angles at the hip into Pauwels types I, II and III.

This paper examines the history of ways of thinking about the monsoon and risk, focusing on India. The science of meteorology, and a growing interest in ways to mitigate monsoon risk, developed in response to major famines. Piecemeal interventions, including a series of canals and small dams, began India’s hydraulic transformation. By the middle of the twentieth century, massive hydraulic engineering emerged as the dominant solution to controlling the monsoon’s risks. Large dams account for the largest share of government expenditure in independent India, but since the 1960s, intensive and mostly unregulated groundwater exploitation has played a greater role in meeting irrigation needs. The expansion in India’s irrigated area and an expansion in food production.

Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s (commonly known as Millennials and iGen) were more likely to report having no sexual partners as adults compared to GenX’ers born in the 1960s and 1970s in the General Social Survey, a nationally representative sample of American adults (N = 26,707). Among those aged 20–24, more than twice as many Millennials born in the 1990s (15 %) had no sexual partners since age 18 compared to GenX’ers born in the 1960s (6 %). Higher rates of sexual inactivity among Millennials and iGen also appeared in analyses using a generalized hierarchical linear modeling technique known as age–period–cohort analysis to control for age and time period effects among adults of all ages. Americans born early in the 20th century also showed elevated rates of adult sexual inactivity. The shift toward higher rates of sexual inactivity among Millennials and iGen’ers was more pronounced among women and absent among Black Americans and those with a college education. Contrary to popular media conceptions of a “hookup generation” more likely to engage in frequent casual sex, a higher percentage of Americans in recent cohorts, particularly Millennials and iGen’ers born in the 1990s, had no sexual partners after age 18." .

We ask whether, among Vietnamese men of a certain age, wartime experiences contributed to initiating smoking, and thus shaped one behavioral pathway linking war exposure and older adult health. MethodsWe analyze the Vietnam Health and Aging Pilot Study (VHAPS), a survey of adults ages 55 and older (N = 405) conducted in one commune of northern Vietnam. We implement Cox discrete-time proportional hazards models to discern the effects of military service upon the initiation of smoking. ResultsMilitary service results in a heightened risk of initiating smoking within this cohort (HR 2.13, [CI 1.36, 3.35]). Smoking initiation is also significantly gendered and age graded. Socioeconomic position and social capital variables in the models are statistically insignificant. ConclusionsThis study finds that, among older northern Vietnamese men whose early adulthood coincided with mass mobilization in the Vietnam War, involvement in formal military service significantly increased the risk of initiating smoking. Military-induced smoking emerges where tobacco products were not provided by the military institution, but where social availability of tobacco was widespread." .

The relationship between aerosol particles and cloud droplet number concentration could be properly described by this parameterization because the simulated cloud fraction and cloud liquid water path were generally reliable compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieved data. Simulation results showed that the strong effect of indirect forcing was mainly concentrated in Southeast China, the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the Sea of Japan. The highest indirect radiative forcing of ASN reached −3.47 W m−2 over Southeast China and was obviously larger than the global mean of the indirect forcing of all anthropogenic aerosols. In addition, sulfate provided about half of the contribution to the ASN indirect forcing effect. However, the effect caused by nitrate was weak because the mass burden of nitrate was very low during summer, whereas the cloud fraction was the highest. The analysis indicated that even though the interannual variation of indirect forcing magnitude generally followed the trend of aerosol mass burden from 2005 to 2013, the cloud fraction was an important factor that determined the distribution pattern of indirect forcing. The heaviest aerosol loading in North China did not cause a strong radiative effect because of the low cloud fraction over this region." .

Best known of the issues leading to this picture was the apparent loss of neutrinos coming from the sun. This article describes another piece of evidence that supports the picture; the substantial reduction of high-energy muon-type neutrinos observed in nature. For much of the forty-year period before the modern picture emerged, this observation was known as the “atmospheric neutrino anomaly,” since these neutrinos originate in the Earth’s atmosphere. This paper describes the discovery of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. I explore the scientific context and motivations in the late 1970s, from which this work emerged. The gradual awareness that the observations of atmospheric neutrinos were not as expected took place in the 1983–1986 period." .

Chronologisch werden dabei in der aktuellen Literatur im Wesentlichen vier sich überlappende Abschnitte abgegrenzt: (1.) In die Phase der juristischen Verfolgung und „Entnazifizierung“ fällt der Nürnberger Ärzteprozess, bei dem keine sich so bezeichnenden Neurologen angeklagt waren. (2.) Während des anschließenden Prozesses der weitreichenden Amnestierung und Integration ehemaliger NS-Anhänger in den 1950er Jahren ist auch für die Neurologie eine Kontinuität der Eliten nachzuweisen. In das Jahr 1953 fiel die sog. Lissabon-Affäre, als v. a. niederländische Fachvertreter gegen die Teilnahme Julius Hallervordens am 5. Internationalen Kongress für Neurologie protestierten, sich die neu gegründeten Fachgesellschaften DGN und DGPN jedoch geschlossen hinter Hallervorden stellten. (3.) Die beginnende Kritik am systematischen Verschweigen medizinischer Verbrechen im Nationalsozialismus kennzeichnet die dritte Phase, in der die Neurologie durch das Auffinden inkriminierter Hirnschnitte an verschiedenen Max-Planck-Instituten in den Fokus geriet. (4.) Ab den 1980/1990er Jahren setzte eine Rekonstruktion und Aufarbeitung medizinischer Verbrechen im Nationalsozialismus durch (Medizin-)Historiker ein. Der zeitliche Abstand zu den Ereignissen und der erfolgte Generationenwechsel in der deutschen Ärzteschaft brachten einen Wandel von der Fremd- zur teilweisen Selbstzuschreibung historischer Verantwortung mit sich. Aktuell wird international der Umgang mit neurologischen Eponymen, die einen Zusammenhang mit der NS-Zeit aufweisen, besonders diskutiert. Wir gehen davon aus, dass zukünftige Forschungen zu einer weiteren Ausdifferenzierung des historischen Forschungsstandes führen und u. a. die aktuellen Debatten um Forschungsethik beleben werden." .

Every so often, the need to reach a result may require leaving out a few steps here and there. Historians think and argue best through stories, so what follows are several tales, each of which exemplifies one or more of these aspects, though some reach back nearly two hundred years. The first concerns the depletion of the ozone layer; the second involves the discovery of electric waves by Heinrich Hertz in 1888; the third concerns the controlled production of electromagnetic radiation by Guglielmo Marconi and John Ambrose Fleming in the early 1900s; the fourth portrays the circumstances surrounding Joseph von Fraunhofer’s discovery and use of the spectral lines in the 1810s; our final case involves a bitter controversy between the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz and the astronomer Friedrich Zöllner in the 1890s." .

Dabei konnten sie auf eine Zusammenstellung der Arbeiten anlässlich des 10-jährigen Jubiläums der Direktorenschaft von Prof. Babics im Jahre 1956 zurückgreifen. Die Publikationen wurden nach Themen, Sprachen usw. analysiert. Insgesamt erschienen in 10 Jahren 214 Publikationen von insgesamt 15 Urologen, davon 3 Bücher und 3 Promotionen. Davon wurden 16 Publikationen in deutsch, 22 in englisch, 2 in französisch und eine Arbeit in italienisch verfasst. Der Hauptanteil der Arbeiten (n = 26) handelten über die Grundforschung: Harnleitermotilität, Lymphkreislauf, intrarenale Druckverhältnisse usw. Die weiteren Arbeiten beschäftigten sich mit der Nephrologie, künstlichen Niere, transurethralen Resektion der Prostata (TURP) und der Nierenteilresektion. Einige wenige Arbeiten befassten sich mit Tumoren und der benignen Prostatahyperplasie (BPH). Hingegen fanden sich 17 Publikationen, die sich mit der Andrologie sowie der Tuberkulose befassten. Trotz der politischen Isolation, der kommunistischen Diktatur, der Armut und Mittellosigkeit in Ungarn versuchten die noch in der Vorkriegszeit aufgewachsenen Urologen mit der Mentalität und der Arbeitsmoral aus „alten Zeiten“ mit Fleiß und persönlichem Engagement zeitgemäße klinische Forschung und Grundlagenforschung zu leisten!" .

As the oolitic limestone is the main rock through which the Greco-Roman sites had been excavated, then, the main aims of the current study are to define the damage category (DC) for the weathered oolitic limestone bedrock at coastal regions, with the Greco-Roman El-Shatbi Tombs serving as a case study. Additionally, it aims to modify the DC scale of Fitzner and Heinrichs (The Karolinum Press, pp. 11–56, 2002) to be applicable for defining the damage categories for a given archaeological site where the existing scale isn’t based on any numerical limitations to previously define the DC of a given archaeological site. Detailed field investigations including photo-documentation, measurement of the dimensions of these weathering forms and consideration of the wall side orientation to sea spray at El-Shatbi Tombs have been used in tandem with the modified damage category scale to assess the damage category at these tombs. The net result of processing the field data indicated very severe damage at this site. The laboratory analysis for the small rock samples collected at El-Shatbi Tombs indicated that salts act within the pores of this limestone, particularly in 0.01–0.1-μm pores, at this semi-arid region." .

Using this information, we provide an interface that visualizes individual and small group movement patterns, presentations watched, and aggregated information of overall visitor engagement at the museum.

The potters and workers left scant records that reveal how their wares fit into Utah’s theocratically organized economy. Potters and potteries of 19th-century Utah and the Mormon Domain were part of an archaeological survey conducted between 1999 and 2000. The research project yielded examples of kiln wasters that could be subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The results demonstrate the utility of integrating primary records and archaeometric tools in the study of historical era economic processes. Data also indicate the applicability of the approach for potteries in close geographic proximity and to determine patterns of variation within site assemblages. The authors propose an anthropological research program to explore the economics of religion in Mormon Utah, combining the analytical power of archaeometry with the contextualized questioning possible in historical archaeology." .

(1943) is set during the time of American involvement in World War I, the war of the author’s own childhood. Despite the fact that the book was named a Newbery Honor title, many critics have found it unsatisfyingly unstructured and episodic. I argue, however, that the book is far more unified in its construction than these critics recognize and deserves study as a revelatory title about how the First World War was presented to young readers during the Second World War. In his dauntless determination to support the war effort, young Rufus shows himself to be an iconic home-front hero of precisely the sort encouraged by the United States propaganda machine. But read carefully, the book has such an air of pervasive melancholy and contains so many scenes of disappointed hopes and disillusioned dreams that it can be read as encoding doubts about the first war’s legacy. Despite Estes’s clearly intended attempt to provide hope for young readers, the reality of World War I’s ultimate failure haunts Rufus M. as a sort of pentimento, a darker set of images revealed beneath the text’s surface optimism." .

The total economic value of Singapore’s History Museum is at least US$57 million, and this is high relative to other countries, a fact which can be used to justify increased government funding towards museums as cultural capital. Females and high income people are the target groups for increased visitation, while among the non-patrons, the ethnic majority is another potential clientele. Somewhat surprising is the finding that neither patrons nor non-patrons see the museum as having significant tourist value, and contrary to prospect theory, there is a preference for enhancing the museum’s services over keeping the museum. These findings provide some direction for the management of the museum to improve its visitor appeal." .

The agricultural and archaeological data on subsistence in the antebellum Upland South have been woven into an idealized set of subsistence practices that revolved around agricultural practices. The examination of four contemporaneous faunal assemblages representative of different societal classes living in 19th-century Kentucky shows that this generalized version of Upland South food-ways does not hold true across economic classes. Instead, a closer look reveals that many people living on Kentucky’s antebellum farmsteads struggled regularly for food security and that the idealized version of a shared “Upland South foodway” was restricted to the wealthy planter class that had ready access to the market economy." .

Mainly straight lines and circles have been studied and the general situation is that, no matter what the background coloring, there is always a curve in the family studied whose discrepancy is at least of the order of the square root of the length of the curve. In this paper we generalize the shape of the background, keeping the lattice structure. Our background now consists of lattice copies of any bounded fundamental domain of the lattice, and not necessarily of squares, as was the case in the previous papers. As the decay properties of the Fourier transform of the indicator function of the square were strongly used before, we now have to use a quite different proof, in which the tiling and spectral properties of the fundamental domain play a role." .

We used a unified framework to assess the mitigation components of INDCs covering 105 countries (representing approximately 91 % of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012) with a special focus on the G20 economies. We estimated the required reduction effort by comparing the greenhouse gas emission targets implied by the INDCs with the projected levels resulting from current mitigation policies. The resulting projected global reduction effort amounts to approximately 4–6 GtCO2eq by 2030, of which the G20 economies are responsible for the largest share, in particular Brazil, China, the EU, and the United States. Despite these reductions, the global and G20 emission level is still projected to be higher in 2030 than it was in 2010. We compared the ambition levels of individual INDCs by analysing various indicators. Our analysis shows, for instance, that INDCs imply that greenhouse gas emissions of Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Korea peak before 2025, and of China, India and South Africa by 2030 or later." .

These two recent ECMWF products provide the opportunity for a new analysis of the HC trends and of their uncertainties. Further, the effect of sea surface temperature forcing (including its uncertainty) and data assimilation are investigated. Also the ECMWF reanalysis ERA-Interim, for the period 1979–2010, is considered for a complementary analysis. Datasets present important differences in characteristics and trends of the HC. In ERA-20C HC is weaker (especially the Southern Hemisphere HC) and the whole Northern Hemisphere HC is located more southward than in ERA-20CM (especially in the boreal summer). In ERA-Interim HC is stronger and wider than both other simulations. In general, the magnitude of trends is larger and more statistically significant in ERA-20C than in ERA-20CM. The presence of large multidecadal variability across twentieth century raises doubts on the interpretation of recent behavior, such as the onset of sustained long term trends, particularly for the HC strength. In spite of this, the southward shift of the Southern Edge and widening of the Southern Hemisphere HC appear robust features in all datasets, and their trends have accelerated in the last three decades, but actual expansion rates remain affected by considerable uncertainty. Inconsistencies between datasets are attributed to the different reproduction of the links between the HC width and factors affecting it (such as mean global temperature, tropopause height, meridional temperature contrast and planetary waves), which appear more robust in ERA-20CM than in ERA-20C, particularly for the two latter factors.

In 1827, he performed the first total maxillectomy on 17-year-old boy. His work inspired many surgeons, who were previously unwilling to remove maxillary tumours. A paleopathological study performed in the Dupuytren museum allowed us to identify a skull from the early 19th century, with a large maxillar tumour. There were indications that this skull was operated according to Gensoul’s technique. The aim of this study is to confirm that this patient had, in fact, received this surgical treatment. This is a historical and descriptive paleopathological study of a skull of the early 19th century of Dupuytren Museum in Paris. The historical research was conducted in collaboration with the French Academy of Medicine and the Museum of Medicine History (Paris). Bones mark cut studies allowed us to confirm that the patient was operated according to the method described by Gensoul in his “Surgical letter” in 1833. Our historical research has allowed us to understand the perspectives of surgeons in the 19th century and the intellectual processes that led to this discovery. At a time when the robotization and industrialization dominate our art, it is interesting to look to our past, our origins, and our history. The study of ancient humans remains and allows us to understand the origin of our specialty and pay tribute to these pioneering surgeons. Their intellectual approach and boldness should be acknowledged and applauded, especially as it is also the key to our success." .

Five important Coxoh villages have been identified and located in this region and excavtions are planned at all of them. During the spring of 1975, three months were spent mapping and excavating at Coneta, one of the five villages, in order to investigate the processes of Coxoh acculturation. Of particular interest to the investigations are changes in domestic and ceremonial architecture, community pattern, diet, ceramics, and other aspects of material culture. Such changes are important in understanding syncretic changes in the social systems including kinship, residency, land ownership, and agricultural techniques. A primary function of the archaeological and ethno-historic study of such Colonial sites is the establishment of a social and material culture base line of known linguistic affiliation (Coxoh Maya) to serve as a point of departure for comparisons in future investigations in the same region at purely pre-Hispanic sites. This paper explains the origin and purpose of the Coxoh Project, summarizes the results of the first field season and details some of the more important aspects of the accultivation process." .

MethodsEighteen young men (age 26 ± 2 years; height 174.2 ± 6.0 cm; body mass 70.2 ± 8.1 kg; body fat 18.0 ± 3.8 %; mean ± standard deviation) participated in this study. Oral temperature, heart rate variability (HRV) from 5-min of electrocardiogram data, and diving bradycardia responses were measured at 0900, 1300, and 1700 hours daily. All participants performed diving reflex tests twice in the sitting position with the face immersed in cold water (1.9–3.1 °C) and apnea at midinspiration for a minimum of 30 s and as long as possible, in consecutive order. ResultsOral temperature was found to be less in the morning (0900) than in the afternoon (1300) and evening (1700). In the frequency domain parameters of heart rate variability, the natural logarithms of high-frequency power were higher in the morning than in the evening. All participants showed bradycardia response to the two diving reflex tests. The peak values of R–R interval during the diving reflex test both for as long as possible and 30 s were longer in the morning than in the afternoon and evening. ConclusionOur results indicated that the maximal bradycardia during the diving reflex test exhibits a diurnal variation, with peak levels at morning and gradual decrease towards the evening.

(1) Mus musculus castaneus could have colonised the southern South Island between 1792 and 1810, with sealers returning from the Canton fur market, but these voyages were illegal (=undocumented) because direct trading with China was prohibited until after 1813. Signs that the potential links between the South Island and Canton were seldom used after 1810 include: (a) the Canton sealskin market was already rapidly declining in profitability by the time sealers switched to New Zealand from Bass Strait in 1804; (b) the Otago colonies of fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) were exhausted after 1810; (c) M. m. castaneus is absent from the southern offshore islands repeatedly visited by Sydney-based sealers after 1810. (2) M. m. domesticus had multiple well-documented opportunities to colonise the Bay of Islands with traders from Australia after 1821, and both the Cook Strait area and the southern South Island with whalers after 1829. After 1840, multiple haplotypes of M. m. domesticus from different European sources accompanied the organised settlement of New Zealand by European colonists." .

In this article, we investigate the oxic degradation of different types of organic archaeological deposits located in different climatic zones in West and South Greenland. The rate of degradation is investigated based on measurements of O2 consumption, CO2 production and heat production at different temperatures and water contents. Overall, there is good consistency between the three methods. However, at one site the, O2 consumption is markedly higher than the CO2 production, highlighting the importance of combining several measures when assessing the vulnerability of organic deposits. The archaeological deposits are highly vulnerable to degradation regardless of age, depositional and environmental conditions. Degradation rates of the deposits are more sensitive to increasing temperatures than natural soils and the process is accompanied by a high microbial heat production that correlates significantly with their total carbon content. We conclude that organic archaeology in the Arctic is facing a critical challenge that requires international action." .

From uncertain origins, it appears in historical records in Europe over 300 years ago, with the first records in China date from 100 years ago. Since the 1990s, the German cockroach has dominated indoor environments across China. A genetic analysis of 599 individuals from nine cities across China found two genetic clusters; one dominant in the North and the other dominant the in South of the country. Weak but significantly positive isolation by distance was observed for the entire country; however, when broken into different geographical scales, the significantly positive correlation can be only observed in between cities or city to suburb range (10–221 km). Two factors may have contributed to the spread of the German cockroach in China, which correspond to these two clusters: central heating systems in the north built during the 1960s, and air-conditioning systems in the south built during in the 1990s. The spread of modern, long distance transport systems, such as railways, may have contributed to the lack of geographic patterns, yet it is likely that other factors have been important in determining patterns." .

Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to construct the four-dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3D root systems using Clifford techniques, by constructing them in the 4D even subalgebra of the 3D Clifford algebra; for instance the icosahedral root system H 3 gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional) non-crystallographic root system H 4. Arnold’s trinities and the McKay correspondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the icosahedron and E 8. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made this connection explicit for the first time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D space the 120 elements of the icosahedral group H 3 are doubly covered by 240 8-component objects, which endowed with a ‘reduced inner product’ are exactly the E 8 root system. It was previously known that E 8 splits into H 4-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the two pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the construction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the Coxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework. We advocate the complete factorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra into exponentials of bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle giving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the usual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues. In particular, we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2D, 3D and 4D root systems, D 6 as well as E 8, whose Coxeter versor factorises as $${W = \\exp(\\frac{\\pi}{30}B_C)\\exp(\\frac{11\\pi}{30}B_2)\\exp(\\frac{7\\pi}{30}B_3)\\exp(\\frac{13\\pi}{30}B_4)}$$ W=exp(π30BC)exp(11π30B2)exp(7π30B3)exp(13π30B4) . This explicitly describes 30-fold rotations in 4 orthogonal planes with the correct exponents $${\\{1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}}$$ {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29} arising completely algebraically from the factorisation." .

Through allusions to pivotal events in the United States circa 1966, this introductory editorial characterizes the U.S. zeitgeist around the year of the ADTA’s founding. Specific references are made to the signing of the Voting Rights Act, the establishment of Medicaid and Medicare, the founding of the National Organization for Women, as well as the violent targeting of civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, and the spontaneous launching of the modern LGBT rights movement with the Stonewall Rebellion in New York’s Greenwich Village. Commentary on the six essays to follow the editorial includes discussion of DMT as a female-dominated profession, which has apparently suffered the economic consequences of gender bias. Strategies for countering devaluation of the profession and building respect for it—including improving dance/movement therapists’ cultural competence, upgrading both quantitative and qualitative research, and fostering alliances between the ADTA and sister institutions—are likewise advanced." .

These documents were prepared by several indigenous groups as well as by the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries during their military campaigns and long-term evangelization and colonization and later on, by Indian nobles and Spanish historians. Pre-Columbian drawings show flames coming out of Popocatépetl’s crater while later descriptions from the Spanish colonial period in Mexico (1521 to 1821) refer to ash emission and ballistics, lahars, and some pumice falls, similar to what were depicted in the thirteenth to sixteenth century drawings. Graphic information from the pre-Columbian codices, colonial maps, and paintings referring to the eruptions were correlated with historical accounts and religious chronicles, thereby leading to the reconstruction of a more detailed sequence of eruptive events. From such information, it was possible for us to prepare ash distribution maps for the 1540, 1592, and 1664 eruptions. Most of the known historical eruptions seem to be similar to those that have been occurring at Popocatépetl since 1994, indicating the importance of ash emission and crater dome formation throughout its recent eruptive history. The strongest eruptions occurred in 1510, 1519, 1540, 1580, 1664, and 2001; these produced widespread ash falls that affected both populated and rural areas. Duration of eruptive episodes during the past 800 years were estimated to have ranged from less than a year to more than 30 years, separated by repose periods ranging between 7 and over 100 years." .

Moreover, past technologies often inspire new technology. Authenticity is besides conservation and restoration a key aspect in preserving our past, for example in museums when exposing showpieces. The classification of being authentic relies on an interdisciplinary approach integrating art historical and archaeological research complemented with applied research. In recent decades analytical dating tools are based on determining the raw materials used. However, the traditional applied non-portable, chemical techniques are destructive and time-consuming. Since museums oftentimes only consent to research actions which are completely non-destructive, optical spectroscopy might offer a solution. As a case-study we apply this technique on two stained glass panels for which the 14th century dating is nowadays questioned. With this research we were able to identify how simultaneous mapping of spectral signatures measured with a low cost optical spectrum analyser unveils information regarding the production period. The significance of this research extends beyond the re-dating of these panels to the 19th century as it provides an instant tool enabling immediate answering authenticity questions during the conservation process of stained glass, thereby providing the necessary data for solving deontological questions about heritage preservation." .

The usefulness of lead isotope ratio and compositional analysis in the finger-printing and art historical study of more than 130 early historic, Pallava, Chola, later Chola, and Vijayanagara sculptures (fifth–eighteenth centuries) is highlighted, including Nataraja, Buddha, Parvati, and Rama images made of copper, leaded bronze, brass, and gilt copper. Image casting traditions at Swamimalai in Tamil Nadu are compared with artistic treatises and with the technical examination of medieval bronzes, throwing light on continuities and changes in foundry practices. Western Indian sources could be pinpointed for a couple of medieval images from lead isotope analysis. Slag and archaeometallurgical investigations suggest the exploitation of some copper and lead-silver sources in the Andhra and Karnataka regions in the early historic Satavahana period and point to probable copper sources for the medieval images in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. The general lower iron content in southern Indian bronzes perhaps renders the proximal copper–magnetite reserves of Seruvila in Sri Lanka as a less likely source. Given the lack of lead deposits in Sri Lanka, however, the match of the lead isotope signatures of a well-known Ceylonese Buddhist Tara in British Museum with a Buddha image from Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu may underscore ties between the island nation and the southern Indian Tamil regions." .

However, scholars have rarely made explicit the philosophical assumptions and the research objectives underlying the notion of style: what are its philosophical roots? How does the notion of style fit into the area of research of historical epistemology? What does a comparison between the Hacking’s project on styles of thinking and other similar projects suggest? My aim in this paper is to answer these questions. Hacking has denied that his project of styles of thinking falls into the field of historical epistemology. I shall challenge his remark by tracing out the connections of the notion of style with historical epistemology and, more in general, with a tradition of thought born in France in the beginning of twentieth-century." .

Studies submitted for presentation undergo initial peer review before acceptance and the rate of subsequent publication may be taken as an indicator of access to publication for pediatric radiology studies. ObjectivesEvaluate the proportion of abstracts also published in journals for pediatric radiology conferences and identify factors associated with publication success. Materials and methodsAll Medline articles that originated from oral presentations at the European Society for Paediatric Radiology (ESPR), the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) or the International Pediatric Radiology (IPR) conferences between 2010 – 2012 were evaluated. Descriptive statistics to evaluate published and unpublished groups were calculated overall and split by characteristics of the abstracts such as number of authors. ResultsOverall number of abstracts published was 300/715 (41.9%), with most articles published in radiology specific journals (181/300; 60.3%), with median impact factor 2.31 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.65-3.14, range: 0-18.03). Those published after the conference (262/300, 87.6%) had a median time to publication of 18 months and for those published before, the median time was -11 months. Median sample size in published articles was 52 (IQR: 33-105, range: 1-6,351).

Using data from the Generations and Gender Programme and the British Household Panel Survey, religious differences in completed fertility and the transition to first birth are explored across cohorts of women. In addition, a longitudinal analysis is employed to examine the influence of religion on subsequent childbearing. Although the secularization paradigm assumes that the influence of religion on individual behavior will diminish over time, it is found that religious affiliation and practice continue to be important determinants of fertility and family formation patterns. However, there is some variation in the relationship between religion and fertility across countries; while in France and the Netherlands fertility gaps by religiosity are either consistent or increasing, in Britain, this gap appears to have narrowed over time. These findings suggest that fertility differences by religion also depend on the particular social context of religious institutions in each country." .

During this period, AKEL had to deal with grave economic problems. This article uses the European Elections Study (2009) data and presents a statistical model that explains up to 70 per cent of the variance. We show that retrospective sociotropic evaluation of the economy by the Greek Cypriots has a significant effect on their intention to vote or not for the incumbent party. On the basis of this result, one may argue that the considerable amount of votes lost by AKEL in February 2013 presidential elections could be mainly because of the deteriorating economic situation since the party took office in February 2008." .

It begins by introducing the key features of the two cases, before exploring how they might be described and understood as state-corporate crimes. It then identifies a tendency within the literature to analyse state-corporate crimes as ‘moments of rupture’ in the regulatory relationship. Seeking to move beyond such ‘moments of rupture’, the paper argues for an understanding of regulatory relationships as part of a broader regime of permission that seeks the smooth and uninterrupted accumulation of capital. It thus identifies the ‘process’ that must be analysed as a process of capital accumulation. This process is illustrated by focussing on the spheres of production and distribution in this story of capital accumulation. In the course of describing the complex ‘regime of permission’, the paper uncovers a structure of impunity that generally enables the most powerful architects and beneficiaries of state-corporate crime to sustain a process of capital accumulation." .

It examines these primary texts not only to see how such characters are represented but also to see whether they either bolster or challenge the idea of the female being viewed as the male's ‘Other’. A brief historical and cultural contextualisation of the relationship between mentally ill females and the male-centric profession of modern psychiatry is followed by a close analysis of four primary texts, analysing visual narratives of mentally ill female characters in two picture books, an illustrated book and a graphic novel, noting how contemporary visual depictions contrast with early ideas and images supporting the nineteenth-century feminisation of madness. The conclusion is that, from the limited selection of texts analysed, contemporary children’s visual texts represent a clear contrast to the historical image of the frail and winsome madwoman. The findings are that they do not uphold the image of the female madwoman as Other." .

Literarische Texte lassen sich unter ganz verschiedenen Blickwinkeln betrachten. Der vorliegende Beitrag skizziert eine Geschichte der Epilepsie in der deutschsprachigen Literatur seit der Epoche der Aufklärung. Schriftsteller haben die verschiedensten Gründe, Epilepsie zu erwähnen, denen aber immer künstlerische und keine medizinischen Absichten zugrunde liegen. Zu den Besonderheiten der deutschsprachigen Literatur gehört, dass sich anders als in einigen Nachbarliteraturen die Realisten des 19. Jh.s kaum für Epilepsie interessiert haben, während sich ausgehend von Lichtenberg und Jean Paul eine satirische Tradition entwickelt hat, die es in anderen Literaturen so nicht gibt. Das Dritte Reich ist ein eigenes Thema sowohl wegen der Schicksale der jüdischen Autoren Georg Hermann, Joseph Roth und Ernst Weiß als auch der Bedrohung von Epilepsiekranken durch Zwangssterilisation und Mord. In der deutschen und den meisten Literaturen der Gegenwart gibt es ein großes Interesse an Epilepsie, wobei erfreulicherweise an die Stelle von Schwächemetaphern zunehmend attraktive und selbstständige Romanfiguren treten. Meistens wird heute von Autoren, die nicht aus eigener Anschauung schöpfen können, Epilepsie angemessen recherchiert, aber weiterhin nur selten als behandelbare Krankheit dargestellt, mit einer medikamentösen Behandlung, die überwiegend als sinnloser, von Nebenwirkungen behafteter medizinischer Selbstzweck erscheint." .

Archaeological studies within or near mining districts include assessments of charcoal-production sites when such remnant features are present. Minimal historical documentation exists for individual production sites, and so the science of dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) is used to provide calendar dates and other information on the nature of historical activity within forests and woodlands. A synthesis of the dendrochronological approach to historical charcoal-production investigation is presented in the context of four recent studies, including a comprehensive strategy, new processing techniques, and unique results. This approach provides charcoal-production archaeologists with precise temporal and spatial data that are applied to questions such as patterns and timing of deforestation, or differences in technology and practices among immigrant laborers." .

Their development proceeded mainly in three steps: (1) development of ligature forceps directly for hemostasis (Celsus, first century ad; Paré, 1582; L. Heister, 1743; (2) development of atraumatic forceps, which facilitate vascular reconstruction or anastomosis creation by temporarily clamping vessels (Höpfner, 1903; Stich, 1907; Jeger, 1913; (3) construction of tangential forceps, which, by partially clamping vessels with partial maintenance of blood flow, allow the reconstruction or anastomosis of large vessels in a side-to-side technique. The first tangential occlusion clamp was developed by Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) in 1908, when he established the operative treatment for embolism of the pulmonary artery. This clamp was later modified by A.W. Meyer (1927) and V.P. Satinsky (ca. 1950)." .

Such a ‘material history’ of electroshock therapy reveals that the technical make-up of electroshock devices and what they were used for was relative to the changing interests of physicians, industrial companies and mental health politics; it makes an intriguing case for the Social Construction of Technology theory (Bijker et al., The social construction of technological systems: new directions in the sociology and history of technology.

This paper connects us to Bonaparte’s work on Poe’s short stories. Founded on concepts of Freudian theory and an exhaustive review of the biographical facts, Marie Bonaparte concluded that the works of Edgar Allan Poe drew their most powerful inspirational force from the psychological consequences of the early death of the poet’s mother. In Bonaparte’s approach, which was powerfully influenced by her recognition of the impact of the death of her own mother when she was born—an understanding she gained in her analysis with Freud—the thesis of the dead-living-mother achieved the status of a paradigmatic key to analyze and understand Poe’s literary legacy. This paper explores the background and support of this hypothesis and reviews Bonaparte’s interpretation of Poe’s most notable short stories, in which extraordinary female figures feature in the narrative." .

Several US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communications, society statements, and research articles have been written in an attempt to define and articulate the classification system, safety data, and efficacy of this approach to transvaginal surgery. In this review, we explore the history of transvaginal mesh surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP), review FDA and society statements, and research current practice in the United States. MethodsWe searched the English language literature using PubMed for articles related to safety and monitoring of transvaginal mesh and reviewed all FDA publication and notices and gynecology and urogynecology society statements on its use in the United States. We then reviewed 22 articles and grouped them into several sections. ResultsMesh used to augment transvaginal repair of POP was introduced in the United States in 2005 without clinical safety and efficacy data. In the subsequent years of use, both major and minor complications were increasingly reported, leading to several FDA notifications and warnings. The type of mesh used, reporting and classifications systems, and provider usage has varied widely over time. ConclusionWe present a historical review of transvaginal mesh use for pelvic organ prolapse in the United States from 2005 to 2016. There continues to be heated debate among practitioners about balancing the efficacy of mesh use to decrease recurrent prolapse and complications. Research into safety and efficacy, along with tighter FDA regulations, is ongoing." .

In particular, it argues that cosmopolitanism corrects a common and dangerous tendency to form overly strong identifications with political entities such as countries, nations, and cultures. The account helps to unify the current heterogeneous collection of cosmopolitan theories, as is illustrated by a discussion of the cultural cosmopolitanism of Jeremy Waldron, and the political cosmopolitanism of Simon Keller. The account also helps distinguish cosmopolitans from their critics, most of whom share the cosmopolitan’s commitment to respect for human rights: for example, liberal patriots, liberal nationalists and liberal culturalists." .

One begins what promises to be a routine excavation of a familiar structure. Assumptions are formed about how things are supposed to work in a given situation—assumptions based on education, experience, and the spatial layout of sites. Then unexpected features are encountered. One anticipates a solution, but it never quite emerges; and in the end one reluctantly settles for interpretations that are not entirely logical or satisfactory. Such is the case with the recent excavations at the north windmill on Betty’s Hope Estate in Antigua, West Indies, now the site of a major restoration project. To understand the problem posed by the Betty’s Hope windmill—How did the sugar juice get from the windmill to the factory?—the reader first must understand the spatial layout and operation of a sugar plantation." .

The metric is constructed by exploiting recent results of dynamical systems theory linking rare recurrences to the classical statistical theories of extreme events for time series. We compute rare recurrences for 100 years daily mean temperatures data obtained in a model with historical greenhouse forcing (the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace, IPSL-CM5 model) and compare them with the same quantities obtained from two datasets of reanalysis (twentieth Century Reanalysis and ERA 20C). The period chosen for the comparison is 1900–2000 and the focus is on the European region. We show that with respect to the traditional approaches, the recurrence technique is sensitive to the change in the size of the selection window of extremes due to the conditions imposed by the dynamics." .

It analyses the strategies used to allow children to identify with a contemporary view on this aspect of history. The Netherlands serves as a case study. Five literary strategies are discerned, placing the books on a scale from national heroization to national alienation: monophonic accounts of Western superiority, child protagonists as mediators between past and present, polyphony, multitemporality and narrative alienation." .

Das betrifft insbesondere die Zeitbezogenheit einiger psychoanalytischer Konzepte und die Erlebnisbedeutung der frühesten Erfahrung mit der Mutter vor und während der Geburt. Ein wesentlicher Grund für die unvollständige Erfassung der Wirklichkeit der prä- und perinatalen Erfahrungen liegt in den zeitbedingten und persönlich bedingten Begrenzungen der Erkenntnismöglichkeiten Freuds, die in Anbetracht seiner großen Entdeckungen und aus Loyalität nicht ausreichend reflektiert wurden. Die genannten Brüche waren oft kompromisshafte „Lösungen“ in Bezug auf unterschiedliche Wahrnehmungen, die aber auch mehr, als es jeweils bewusst war, einen Verlust an substanziellen Einsichten bedeuteten. Die Folge dieser Situation ist die, dass wir heute eine Vielfalt von Schulen und Gruppen um Teileinsichten haben, die aber der Gruppenidentität zuliebe oft unbegründet verallgemeinert werden.

The three films feature a similar set of characters and artifacts which serve as the springboard for the unfolding of the individual plots. However, the techniques used in the characters’ portrayal are very different in each of the films, leading to contrasting outcomes. This article explores the way the characters are portrayed, including the use of discursive strategies and intertextual mechanisms, with special emphasis given to the propaganda characteristic of the different periods in the country’s history.

New fashions threatened the established social order as wealthy individuals pretended to status that they had not yet achieved. To respond to these concerns, Jia Yi 賈誼 (200–168 BCE) proposed a new sumptuary code regulating a range of luxury goods from apparel to accessories to ritual wares. This sumptuary system was designed to bolster the authority of the imperial throne and to distinguish members of the Han government and the imperial family from other elites. This essay will present an overview of Jia Yi’s sumptuary code and consider its relationship to earlier theories of ritual reform. It will argue that his system combined Lord Shang’s 商 theory of circumstantial advantage (shi 勢) with a new scheme of imperial publicity. The final section of this study assesses the implementation of Jia Yi’s recommendations by using jade as a case study. Based on recent archaeological evidence, I argue that Jia Yi’s ideas about jade in the context of his sumptuary guidelines have a contemporaneity with the revitalization of jade craft in the early Western Han." .

As we move into the twenty-first century, however, the object of study is changing dramatically in that the majority US population will soon be minorities; this is already the case in many locales, and other countries are experiencing similar shifts. To recount this dynamic and provide context, the paper begins by considering the US city pre-World War II, ethnic enclaves, and their transition to the present day—giving rise to an immigrant ethos that remains prevalent. Attention then turns to general frameworks related to the immigrant experience, and their future applicability. Considered next is the current state of majoritizing the minority. As one outcome, urban neighborhoods will become demographically diverse and reflect socioeconomic differences rather than racial/ethnic ones; that is, in the jargon of past research, neighborhood composition will be determined by Class more than Culture. This should be largely driven by market forces as mediated by elements such as social networks (formal and informal) and personal preferences. Inertia effects also would operate to slow, but not eliminate, shifts in the urban landscape. Conceptually, these forces are represented by Market-Led Pluralism and Resurgent Ethnicity. Regarding other likely futures, as acculturation occurs a substantial increase in intermarriage is expected, leading to A Blended America. Economic shifts also play into the future as nations of the Global South strengthen, while production in the Global North becomes more automated. Hence, immigration will continue, but from different origins; and the overall level will be lower, leading to A Shrinking Nation." .

However, revealing perceptions of their ongoing and systematic political economic marginalization, internally displaced persons and refugees from Timbuktu tended to racialize the occupation, distinguishing it as an attempt to (re-)enslave certain northern Malian populations. Both interpretations creatively highlighted certain themes while silencing others. Nonetheless, by selectively characterizing the occupation of the north, the French press reproduced hegemonic global discourses that largely overlooked the roles of (post)colonial domination in regional politics and justified neocolonial intervention. In so doing, these discourses have reinforced continued misconceptions of global geopolitics, and have therefore sustained imperialist knowledge-practices." .

Despite DMT’s disruption of the patriarchal bias in counseling, and despite having displayed a richness of cultural discourse over the years, a historical analysis of publications in the field reveals a paucity of discourse around feminism and women’s rights, as well as lack of intersectionality. Much as the women’s rights and feminist movements can be criticized for their lack of intersectionality and exclusionary practices, DMT has arguably fallen into a similar pitfall. The authors suggest that moving forward into the next 50 years, the field of DMT may be especially equipped to contribute to discourses around activism, multiculturalism, and social justice through a body-based lens." .

Most of them require some measure of an equivalent stress or strain amplitude, in the sense of causing the same damage as the original history, which may be difficult to obtain for generic non-proportional multiaxial variable amplitude load histories. To identify individual load cycles, a multiaxial rainflow-like algorithm must be employed. For each rainflow-counted cycle, the equivalent stress or strain amplitude along its path is often computed using the so-called convex enclosure methods, which find minimum spheres, ellipsoids, or rectangular prisms that contain the load path in a deviatoric stress or strain space. However, such procedure involves information loss, in special if the path shape is very different from the shape of the enclosing convex surface, resulting in poor estimates of equivalent stress or strain amplitudes. To overcome this problem, the moment of inertia (MOI) method has been proposed in Meggiolaro and Castro (Int J Fatigue 42:217–226, 2012) to calculate equivalent amplitudes and mean components of two-dimensional stress or strain paths, generated, e.g., by tension–torsion or biaxial histories. In this work, the MOI method is extended to deal with generic 6D stress or strain paths, which include all normal and shear components. To accomplish that, the load history path is first represented in a 5D deviatoric stress or strain space and then assumed to be a homogeneous wire with unit mass, whose perimeter centroid is used to estimate the location of the path mean component. Then, the polar moment of inertia (PMOI) of such a hypothetical wire with respect to its mean component is calculated. The PMOI represents the distribution of the path about a single point, the perimeter centroid, giving a measure of how much the path stretches away from its mean component, which is used in the calculation of the equivalent amplitudes. Experimental results for 13 different multiaxial load histories prove the effectiveness of the proposed method to predict equivalent amplitudes and multiaxial fatigue lives." .

This is an excellent occasion to look back at the history of the credentials process, and the evolution to Board certification. This article will trace the major historical events in the development of the ADTA credentials process from it’s inception to the current day, and explore both the internal and external factors that moved this process forward. It will also examine our credentials with a focus on some of the issues raised within the current health care climate." .

Despite the social and economic consequences of this migration, the question of its impacts on labor markets in the North has largely been overlooked in the literature. In this paper, I use both local wage comparisons and structural simulations of the aggregate Northern labor market to provide new evidence on the effects of the Great Migration on wages in the North, redoubling the evidence that it caused large declines in wages for blacks, with little effect for whites. The agreement between my local and aggregate wage effect estimates has implications for our general understanding of how immigration and wages are related and how that relationship can be measured." .

Enhancing the efficiency of currently used collection approaches, such as ovitraps and sticky traps, is desirable for optimal monitoring of the species abundance, for assessment of the risk of arbovirus transmission and for the optimisation of control activities. FindingsTwo sets of 4 × 4 Latin-square experiments were carried out in Tirana (Albania) to test whether modifications in ovitrap shape and size and in oviposition substrate would increase collections of Ae. albopictus eggs and whether hay-infusion would increase adult catches by sticky trap. Generalized Linear Mixed Models with negative binomial error distribution were carried out to analyse the data. Cylindrical ovitraps lined with germination paper yielded significantly higher egg catches than those exploiting either the (commonly used) wooden paddles or floating polystyrene blocks as oviposition substrates. No difference was observed between cylindrical and conical shaped ovitraps. Ovitraps and sticky traps baited with hay infusion yielded significantly higher egg and adult catches than un-baited ones. A significant relationship between ovitrap and sticky trap catches was observed both in the absence and in the presence of attractants, with ovitrap catches increasing more than sticky trap catches at increasing adult female densities. ConclusionsThis study provides grounds for optimisation of ovitraps and sticky traps as monitoring tools for Ae. albopictus by (i) supporting use of germination paper as most appropriate oviposition substrate; (ii) suggesting the possible use of stackable conical ovitraps for large scale monitoring; (iii) confirming the use of hay-infusion to increase egg catches in ovitraps, and showing that hay-infusion also significant increases adult catches by sticky traps." .

Examining choices in ceramic styles is one way to examine the colonial policies of reducción, which were to instill a regular, commonplace Christian order in everyday life. The Río Ceniza Valley of western El Salvador, the heartland of the Nahua-speaking Pipil polity known as the Izalcos, was a center of Spanish colonial commerce in Guatemala. This research presents a typology and chronology of Guatemalan maiolica, the stylistic similarities of its maiolica types to trends in Europe, and frequencies in rural vs. urban use, based on an ample collection of 16th- to 19th-century Guatemalan maiolica from extensive survey and excavations. The relative importance of maiolica vs. maiolica attributes on indigenous-made pottery gives a view into daily life under extreme conditions of colonialism and the process of reducción." .

Emerging in the eighteenth century, these towns grew in significance before the advent of cheaper continental holidays in the 1960s signalled their demise. Nevertheless they retain an affectionate place within English social memory, and are in their own right distinctive maritime communities. Using an archaeological case study and a broadly phenomenological approach this contribution analyzes the experience of the resort holiday through reference to place, space, and materiality. Further, it seeks to situate the English seaside resort, as a functionally distinctive post-medieval urban and maritime phenomenon, within a global context of the archaeology of tourism." .
