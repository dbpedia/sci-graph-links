Abstract We give a counterexample to Theorem 5 in Section 18.2 of Margolis’ book, “Spectra and the Steenrod Algebra” and make remarks about the proofs of some later theorems in the book that depend on it. The counterexample is a module which does not split as a sum of lightning flash modules and free modules.
