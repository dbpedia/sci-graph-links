Abstract This paper analyzes recent struggles surrounding dam projects and extractive industry in Dersim, a Kurdish-Alevi municipality in Eastern Turkey, as both a continuation of state violence against outsider populations, reproducing historical forms of repression, and a more recent neoliberal turn in economic policy and rhetoric, introducing what could be described as accumulation by dispossession to the region. This combination illustrates how the accumulation of capital and resistance to its logic are shaped by other political and cultural struggles that are not generated by the economic logic of capital. We pay particular attention to the active role of nature in these struggles.
