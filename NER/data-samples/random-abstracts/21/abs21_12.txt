Abstract The present paper proposes an overview of the painting materials experimented with over the years by Sam Francis, leading figure of the post-World War II American painting, through the analytical study of an extended number of paint samples supplied by the Sam Francis Foundation. In total, 279 samples taken from twenty-eight artworks made between 1946 and 1992, were analyzed by Raman, FTIR and Py–GC/MS techniques. The obtained results revealed the Francis’ preference in terms of pigments, i.e., phthalocyanine blues and greens, and outlined unconventional combination of binder media.
