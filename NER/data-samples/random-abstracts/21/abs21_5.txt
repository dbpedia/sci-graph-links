Abstract This study analyzed the Collective Action for the Mobility Program of University Students in Asia (CAMPUS Asia) program, whose initiation in the Northeast Asia region was agreed upon for political reasons by the leaders of the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan, and China. The program is significant due to the current rapid marketization of East Asiaâ€™s higher education exchange. Accordingly, this study examines CAMPUS Asia as a top-down exchange and explains how the program enables the institutionalization of a trilateral relationship, promotion of mutual understanding, and identity change. It is hoped that the utilization of one-on-one interviews with participant students in particular will enhance the academic contribution of the paper. Moreover, the conclusion explains the current issues of political instability and imbalanced participation the program faces, and suggests measures to overcome these issues. Through this discussion, it is expected that a vision will be produced whereby the CAMPUS Asia program will go beyond its current pilot phase and develop into a stable program.
