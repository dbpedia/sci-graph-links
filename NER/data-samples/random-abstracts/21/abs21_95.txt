Abstract The case describes a 1-year treatment, by an early career professional, of Colette, a homeless woman with significant childhood trauma and a history of substance use. As the treatment unfolds, Colette begins to participate in activities at the residence where she lives, becomes visible, and relates her story to others. The case illustrates work with complex issues through a psychoanalytic lens.
