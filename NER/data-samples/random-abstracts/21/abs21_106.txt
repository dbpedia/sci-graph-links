Abstract Let {P n } n≥0 denote the Catalan–Larcombe–French sequence, which naturally came from the series expansion of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. In this paper, we prove the strict log-concavity of the sequence $${\left\{ {\sqrt[n]{{{P_n}}}} \right\}_{n \geqslant 1}}$$, which was originally conjectured by Z. W. Sun. We also obtain the strict log-concavity of the sequence $${\left\{ {\sqrt[n]{{{V_n}}}} \right\}_{n \geqslant 1}}$$, where {V n } n≥0 is the Fennessey–Larcombe–French sequence arising from the series expansion of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.
