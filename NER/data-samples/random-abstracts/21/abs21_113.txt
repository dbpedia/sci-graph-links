Abstract Visual presentation of data is essential in archaeological reports, but because of inadequate funding and/or available artistic talent, too few reports are illustrated sufficiently. This article describes a method whereby good quality line drawings can be produced inexpensively with only a modicum of illustrative skills. While the technique itself is not innovative, its widespread use would be. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the technique so that others may be encouraged to use it.
