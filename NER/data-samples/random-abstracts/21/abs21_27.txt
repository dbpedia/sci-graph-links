Abstract A finite group FH is said to be Frobenius-like if it has a nontrivial nilpotent normal subgroup F with a nontrivial complement H such that $$ [F,h]=F$$ [F,h]=F for all nonidentity elements $$h\in H$$ h∈H . Let FH be a Frobenius-like group with complement H of prime order such that $$C_F(H)$$ CF(H) is of prime order. Suppose that FH acts on a finite group G by automorphisms where $$ (|G|,|H|)=1$$ (|G|,|H|)=1 in such a way that $$C_G(F)=1.$$ CG(F)=1. In the present paper we prove that the Fitting series of $$C_G(H)$$ CG(H) coincides with the intersections of $$ C_G(H)$$ CG(H) with the Fitting series of G, and the nilpotent length of G exceeds the nilpotent length of $$C_G(H)$$ CG(H) by at most one. As a corollary, we also prove that for any set of primes $$\pi $$ π , the upper $$\pi $$ π -series of $$ C_G(H)$$ CG(H) coincides with the intersections of $$C_G(H)$$ CG(H) with the upper $$\pi $$ π -series of G, and the $$\pi $$ π - length of G exceeds the $$\pi $$ π -length of $$ C_G(H)$$ CG(H) by at most one.
