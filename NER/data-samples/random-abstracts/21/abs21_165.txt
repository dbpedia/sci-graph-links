Abstract Analysis of the data on the distribution range of the chiropterans in Siberia (personal communications, museum collections, and published data) shows a considerable eastward shift of the boundary of the common noctule (Nyctalus noctula Schreber, 1775) to the Yenisei River. The possible influence of population waves and climate changes on the distribution of this species is proposed.
