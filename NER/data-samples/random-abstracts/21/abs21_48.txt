Abstract Many institutions and research facilities contain donated collections of unusual artifacts which have not been described or researched. Analysis of these materials, along with the scanty knowledge of their provenience, can provide the archaeologist with a large body of comparative material culture. The collection of terra cotta tobacco pipes discussed herein provides information on such an assemblage.
