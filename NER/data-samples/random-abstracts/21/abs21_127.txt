Abstract Small lenticular soil mounds are scattered in several African savannahs. At Lamto, Côte d’Ivoire, most of these lenticular mounds house nests of Odontotermes aff. pauperans which have to date been thought to have built them. However, repeated observations made in 2000 and 2015 supply several arguments in favour of another hypothesis, namely that after a nest of Macrotermes has been abandoned and eroded, it could be colonized by O. aff. pauperans and subsequently maintained, stabilized, by this latter species or possibly recolonized by another Macrotermes society.
