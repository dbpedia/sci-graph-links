Abstract Maiolica (tin-enameled earthenware) was a staple of daily life for serving food and drink, as well as other household purposes, in Spain and Spanish America throughout the colonial period. Examining choices in ceramic styles is one way to examine the colonial policies of reducción, which were to instill a regular, commonplace Christian order in everyday life. The Río Ceniza Valley of western El Salvador, the heartland of the Nahua-speaking Pipil polity known as the Izalcos, was a center of Spanish colonial commerce in Guatemala. This research presents a typology and chronology of Guatemalan maiolica, the stylistic similarities of its maiolica types to trends in Europe, and frequencies in rural vs. urban use, based on an ample collection of 16th- to 19th-century Guatemalan maiolica from extensive survey and excavations. The relative importance of maiolica vs. maiolica attributes on indigenous-made pottery gives a view into daily life under extreme conditions of colonialism and the process of reducción.
