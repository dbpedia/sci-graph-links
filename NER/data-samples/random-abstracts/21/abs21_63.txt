Abstract In this paper, we consider a class of wave equation with past history and a delay term in the internal feedback. Namely, we investigate the following equation $$u_{tt} - \alpha\triangle u + \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t} \mu(t - s)\triangle u(s){\rm d}s+\mu_1u_t + \mu_2u_t(x, t - \tau) + f(u) = h,$$ utt-α▵u+∫-∞tμ(t-s)▵u(s)ds+μ1ut+μ2ut(x,t-τ)+f(u)=h, together with some suitable initial data and boundary conditions. The problem was considered by several authors, with $${\mu_2 = 0}$$ μ2=0 . The project of the present paper is to provide the well-posedness for this problem in a general setting which includes a delay term ($${\mu_2 \neq 0}$$ μ2≠0 ). We also establish the exponential stability result when $${h(x) = 0}$$ h(x)=0 .
