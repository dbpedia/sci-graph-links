Abstract The 50th anniversary of the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) is a celebration of our achievements over the last half-century and a time for analysis and reflection regarding all facets of the development of the profession of dance/movement therapy. This is an excellent occasion to look back at the history of the credentials process, and the evolution to Board certification. This article will trace the major historical events in the development of the ADTA credentials process from itâ€™s inception to the current day, and explore both the internal and external factors that moved this process forward. It will also examine our credentials with a focus on some of the issues raised within the current health care climate.
