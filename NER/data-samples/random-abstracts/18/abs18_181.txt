Abstract We investigate the compressible Navier–Stokes equations where the constitutive law for the stress tensor given by Maxwell’s law is revised to a system of relaxation equations for two parts of the tensor. The global well-posedness is proved as well as the compatibility with the classical compressible Navier–Stokes system in the sense that, for vanishing relaxation parameters, the solutions to the Maxwell system are shown to converge to solutions of the classical system.
