Abstract This paper establishes the entropy convergence of a new two-value high resolution finite volume scheme with slope relaxation for conservation laws. This scheme, motivated by the general method of high resolution schemes that have high-order accuracy in smooth regions of solutions and are free of oscillations near discontinuities, unifies and evolves slopes directly with a slope relaxation equation that governs the evolution of slopes in both smooth and discontinuous regions. Proper choices of slopes are realized adaptively via a relaxation parameter. The scheme is shown to be total-variation-bounded (TVB) stable and satisfies cell-entropy inequalities.
