Abstract We establish uniform sub-exponential tail bounds for the width, height and maximal outdegree of critical Bienaymé–Galton–Watson trees conditioned on having a large fixed size, whose offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law. This extends results obtained for the height and width by Addario-Berry, Devroye and Janson in the finite variance case.
