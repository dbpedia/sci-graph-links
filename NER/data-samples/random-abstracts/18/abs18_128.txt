Abstract A sequence A of positive integers having the property that no element $$a_i \in A$$ ai∈A divides the sum $$a_j+a_k$$ aj+ak of two larger elements is said to have ‘Property P’. We construct an infinite set $$S\subset \mathbb {N}$$ S⊂N having Property P with counting function $$S(x)\gg \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{\log x}(\log \log x )^2(\log \log \log x)^2}$$ S(x)≫xlogx(loglogx)2(logloglogx)2 . This improves on an example given by Erdős and Sárközy with a lower bound on the counting function of order $$\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\log x}$$ xlogx .
