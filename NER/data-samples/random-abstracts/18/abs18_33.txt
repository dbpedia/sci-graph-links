Abstract Conditions are provided under which a normed double sum of independent random elements in a real separable Rademacher type p Banach space converges completely to 0 in mean of order p. These conditions for the complete convergence in mean of order p are shown to provide an exact characterization of Rademacher type p Banach spaces. In case the Banach space is not of Rademacher type p, it is proved that the complete convergence in mean of order p of a normed double sum implies a strong law of large numbers.
