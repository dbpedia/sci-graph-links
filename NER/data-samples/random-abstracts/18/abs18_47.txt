Abstract We are concerned with a scalar conservation law with a source term. This equation is proposed to describe the qualitative behavior of waves for a general system in resonance with the source term by T.P. Liu. In addition to this, the scalar conservation law is used in various areas such as fluid dynamics, traffic problems etc. In the present paper, we prove the global existence and stability of entropy solutions to the Cauchy problem. The difficult point is to obtain the bounded estimate of solutions. To solve it, we introduce some functions as the lower and upper bounds. Therefore, our bounded estimate depends on the space variable. This idea comes from the generalized invariant region theory for the compressible Euler equation. The method is also applicable to other nonlinear problems involving similar difficulties. Finally, we use the vanishing viscosity method to construct approximate solutions and derive the convergence by the compensated compactness.
