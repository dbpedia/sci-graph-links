Abstract In this paper we study the well-posedness and the asymptotic stability of a one-dimensional thermoelastic Bresse system, where the heat conduction is given by Cattaneoâ€™s law effective in the shear angle displacements. We establish the well-posedness of the system and prove that the system is exponentially stable depending on the parameters of the system. Furthermore, we show that in general, the system is not exponential stable. In this regards, we prove that the solution decays polynomially.
