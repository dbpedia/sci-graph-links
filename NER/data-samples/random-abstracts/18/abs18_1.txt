Abstract This paper presents the results of a 2007 survey of victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our results show that the ICTY is the primary decision-maker for war crimes and crimes against humanity of their choice, particularly for the trials of military and political leaders. The respondents who reported being raped, beaten, and starved were more supportive of the ICTY than the other respondents were. The respondents who evaluated the ICTY as fair and who testified at the Court of BiH were more likely to select the ICTY as the preferred decision-maker. The respondents evaluated only one domestic court—the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Court of BiH)—as fair.
