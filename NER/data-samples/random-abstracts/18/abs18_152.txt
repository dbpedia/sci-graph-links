Abstract This paper presents theoretical and experimental study of the mechanisms of conducted couplings, generated by an electromagnetic interference such as the galvanic, capacitive and inductive crosstalk. These couplings are due to various parameters, such as the width and the length of the tracks (or drivers) for the galvanic coupling and the circulation of noise currents and voltages (between the aggressor and the victim) which are caused by the proximity of the tracks and the very high frequency interference signals for the capacitive and inductive coupling. Also, this study shows the increases of the noise level caused by the incrementing of the signal frequency for all different types of crosstalk. This work is validated with empirical formula (for the inductive effect), also by the conventional formulas such as Kirchhoffâ€™s laws (the node law, the mesh law) and by an experimental study (represented by a work bench) on the coupling behavior.
