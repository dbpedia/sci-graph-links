Abstract Recently Buckdahn et al. (Mean-field stochastic differential equations and associated PDEs, arXiv:1407.1215, 2014) studied a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE), whose coefficients depend on both the solution process and also its law, and whose solution process $${(X_s^{t,x,P_\xi},X_s^{t,\xi}=X_s^{t,x,P_\xi}|_{x=\xi})}$$ (Xst,x,Pξ,Xst,ξ=Xst,x,Pξ|x=ξ) , $${s\in[t,T], (t,x)\in[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^{d}, \xi\in L^2(\mathcal{F}_{t},\mathbb{R}^{d})}$$ s∈[t,T],(t,x)∈[0,T]×Rd,ξ∈L2(Ft,Rd) , admits the flow property. This flow property is the key for the study of the associated nonlocal partial differential equation (PDE). In this work we extend these studies in a non-trivial manner to mean-field SDEs which, in addition to the driving Brownian motion, are governed by a compensated Poisson random measure. We show that under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients of the SDE, the solution $${X^{t,x,P_\xi}}$$ Xt,x,Pξ is twice differentiable with respect to x and its law. We establish the associated nonlocal integral-PDE, and we show that $${V(t,x,P_\xi)=E[\Phi(X_T^{t,x,P_\xi},P_{X_T^{t,\xi}})]}$$ V(t,x,Pξ)=E[Φ(XTt,x,Pξ,PXTt,ξ)] is the unique classical solution $${V:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^{d}\times \mathcal{P}_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}}$$ V:[0,T]×Rd×P2(Rd)→R of this nonlocal integral-PDE with terminal condition $${\Phi}$$ Φ .
