Abstract We take a Student process that is based on independent copies of a random variable $${X}$$ X and has trajectories in the function space $${D}$$ D [0, 1]. As a consequence of a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for this process, with $${X}$$ X in the domain of attraction of the normal law, we consider convergence in distribution of five functionals of this process and derive respective asymptotic confidence intervals for the mean of $${X}$$ X . We conclude that the obtained intervals have higher finite-sample coverage probabilities, or shorter expected lengths, than those of a classical asymptotic confidence interval, $${I_0}$$ I0 , that follows simply from the asymptotic normality of the Student $${t}$$ t -statistic. Thus, the five FCLT based intervals may present reasonable alternatives to $${I_0}$$ I0 .
