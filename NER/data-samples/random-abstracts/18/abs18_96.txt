Abstract We consider the fluctuations of the free energy for the 2-spin spherical Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model with no magnetic field. We show that the law of the fluctuations converges to the Gaussian distribution when the temperature is above the critical temperature, and to the GOE Tracy–Widom distribution when the temperature is below the critical temperature. The orders of the fluctuations are markedly different in these two regimes. A universality of the limit law is also proved.
