Abstract We analyze the influence of spatially inhomogeneous diffusion on several common ecological problems. Diffusion is modeled with Fick’s law and the Fokker–Planck law of diffusion. We discuss the differences between the two formalisms and when to use either the one or the other. In doing so, we start with a pure diffusion equation, then turn to a reaction–diffusion system with one logistically growing component which invades the spatial domain. We also look at systems of two reacting components, namely a trimolecular oscillating chemical model system and an excitable predator–prey model. Contrary to Fickian diffusion, spatial inhomogeneities promote spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation in case of Fokker–Planck diffusion.
