Abstract The synthesis and X-ray diffraction study of compound {[Ag2Ge(НCit)2(H2O)2] ∙ 2H2O} n , where H4 Cit is the citric acid, are performed. In the polymeric structure, the НCit 3– ligand fulfils the tetradentate chelate–μ4-bridging (3Ag, Ge) function (tridentate with respect to Ge and Ag atoms). The Ge atom is octahedrally coordinated by six O atoms of two HCit 3–ligands. The coordination polyhedron of the Ag atom is an irregular five-vertex polyhedron [four O atoms of four HCit 3– ligands and the О(Н2О) atom]. An extended system of О–Н···О hydrogen bonds connects complex molecules into a supramolecular 3D-framework.
