Abstract Synthesis and characterization of an optically active binuclear dichloro-bridged copper(II) complex [Cu2(μ-Cl)2(HL)2]·H2O 1 (H2L = S-(−)-2-[(2-hydroxy-1-phenyl-ethylimino)-methyl]-phenol) of a Schiff-base derived from salicylaldehyde and (S)-(+)-2-phenylglycinol are described. Compound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic chiral P212121 space group with Z = 4, a = 10·21(2), b = 11·574(3), c = 25·364(9). Each copper shows square pyramidal geometry with O2NCl2 coordination and the Cu2Cl2 core geometry adopts a butterfly shape. Crystals of 1 were further characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) studies.
