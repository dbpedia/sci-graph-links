Abstract The change of the immitance of the metal–insulator–metal memristive structures based on SiOx, which is observed during electroforming and resistive switching, confirms the formation of conducting channels (filaments) in the insulator during forming and their rupture upon a transition of the structure to a highresistance state. The observed switching of the differential capacitance and conductivity synchronously with the switching of current (resistance) can substantially extend the functional applications of memristive devices of this type.
