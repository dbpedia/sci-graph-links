Abstract Since surface roughness greatly influences the force of adhesion between two bodies, the dynamic behavior of different biological micro/nanoparticles on rough surfaces during 3D manipulation operations has been studied in this paper by employing the atomic force microscope (AFM). In this regard, the force of adhesion between two surfaces has been simultaneously investigated on the basis of two important approaches. First, the interactions between two surfaces have been evaluated based on the available contact mechanics theories, and depending on the type of biological nanoparticle studied in this research, an appropriate model has been presented. Then, the common adhesion models of Rumpf and Rabinovich have been modified based on the Van der Waals force and with regard to the cylindrical geometry of the nanoparticles. Finally, based on the Schwartz method, by developing the adhesion model based on the two approaches mentioned above, the adhesion force between cylindrical biological nanoparticles and rough surfaces has been extracted for the first time. The dynamic behavior of nanoparticles in 3D manipulation on a rough substrate has been modeled and then simulated and analyzed. The simulation results indicate that, by increasing the asperity radius, the critical force needed to manipulate a nanoparticle increases. Also, in contrast to the sliding mode, the critical force of movement in the rolling mode diminishes with the increase of nanoparticle radius. The experimental results obtained from the topography of glass and silica substrates indicate that the Rumpf model underestimates the adhesion force relative to the Rabinovich model.
