Abstract In this paper, we introduce canal surfaces determined by spherical indicatrices of any spatial curve in Minkowski 3-space by means of timelike split quaternions. Moreover, using orthogonal matrices corresponding to these quaternions, the canal surfaces are obtained as homotetic motions. Then, we investigate a relationship between the canal surfaces and unit split quaternions. Finally, we present some interesting examples with figures.
