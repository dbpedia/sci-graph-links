Abstract The sorption of radium 226 (226Ra) on different clay materials (bentonite, illite and a mixture of bentonite–illite) was studied. Clay materials are used in the construction of disposal pits for technically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) wastes (i.e., contaminated soil and sludge) generated by the oil and gas industry operations. Experimental conditions (pH, clay materials quantity, and activity concentrations of 226Ra) were changed in order to determine the optimal state for adsorption of 226Ra. The results showed that the concentration of adsorbed 226Ra on clay materials increased with time to reach an equilibrium state after approximately 5 h. More than 95 % of the radium was adsorbed. The mixture of bentonite–illite (1/9) exhibited the greatest adsorption of radium under all experimental conditions.
