Abstract A series of organic–inorganic conducting nano polymer-matrix composite cation-exchanger have been synthesized via sol–gel method and characterized through FTIR, XRD, TGA-DTA, SEM, and TEM studies. The structural studies confirm the semi-crystalline nature of the material but the morphology of the exchanger gets changed after incorporation of inorganic moiety. The particle size of the nano-composite was found to be 19.2 nm. The observed band gap for the different samples was found to be in the range of 3.70–4.61 eV which shows that nano-composite material covers semiconducting range but the resistivity of samples is highly dependent on the percentage of inorganic part in the composite. Further the oxidative degradation of the polymer backbone begins after the removal of trapped water successively followed by dopant and low molecular weight oligomers. During the antimicrobial screening, the nano-composite was found to be active against different strains of bacteria and fungi. Gel electrophoresis and molecular docking studies were carried out to check the interaction and mechanism of inhibition of microbial growth, respectively by studying the effect of the nano-composite with DNA-Topoisomerase-1.
