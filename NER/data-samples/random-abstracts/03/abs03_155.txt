Summary Inelastic interactions induced by 5 GeV/c negative muons were studied using K5 emulsion. The events examined have more than about the 100 MeV transfer energy of the muon. The total cross-section for the observed events is determined to be (3.0±0.4)·10−30 cm2/nucleon. About 90 percent of this total cross-section is reasonably attributed to pion production. The residual events are consistently explained by the process indicated by «quasi-deuteron» model. It is shown that the single- and double-pion productions pass dominantly through the (3,3) resonance in the case that the squared four-momentum transfer of the muon is less than about 0.1 (Ge V/c)2. The distributions of transfer energy and squared four-momentum transfer for the process of pion production are well explained by an empirical formula based on the considerations of Daiyasuet al.
