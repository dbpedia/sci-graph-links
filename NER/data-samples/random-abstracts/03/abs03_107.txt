AbstractAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are the promising future therapeutic candidates because of their multifunctional roles and unique mode of action against microbes. Despite several advantages, developing AMPs into therapeutic antibiotics is often associated with limitations, such as thermal and enzymatic stability, moderate antimicrobial activity and higher toxicity. We here report the synthesis of 2-fluoro- and 2,6-difluorophenyalanine, their introduction into naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide Temporin L (TL). We also report the antimicrobial and hemolytic activity of parent TL as well as the fluorinated variant in plasma and buffer conditions. Circular dichroism studies clearly show that fluorination reduces the helical propensity, thus accounting for lower activity. We further demonstrated that fluorinated TL can act as antimicrobial agents in creams and gels used for treating skin infections. Graphical Abstract
