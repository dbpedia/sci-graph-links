We conducted a screening program for vasoactive compounds and detected a potent activity in the cultured broth of Streptomyces sp. SANK 63697. From the cultured broth, two active compounds, vestaine A1 and B1, were isolated. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by physicochemical data and spectral analyses, and found to be new compounds.
