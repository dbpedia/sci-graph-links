Abstract The structure of two crystalline modifications of [Pb3(OH)4Co(NO2)3](NO2)2 containing tetrahedral [Pb3(OH)4Co(NO2)3]2+ complex cations is studied. Three lead atoms and one cobalt atom are located in the vertices of a distorted tetrahedron with the edges of 3.39-3.92 Å. The distances from the metal atoms to the oxygen atoms belonging to μ3 bridging hydroxo groups are within 1.910-1.956 Å for Co–O and 2.340-2.439 Å for Pb–O. The packing motifs of the crystal structures are analyzed.
