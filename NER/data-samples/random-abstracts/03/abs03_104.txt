Abstract N-Substituted 7-amino-4-methyl-2H-chromen-2-ones containing one or two functionalized azole or azine moieties were synthesized. The structures of all synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited weak antibacterial activity against Rhizobium radiobacter, Escherichia coli, and Xanthomonas campestris.
