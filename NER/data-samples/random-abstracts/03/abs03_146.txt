Abstract Cells contain a large number of metalloproteins that commonly harbor at least one metal ion cofactor. In metalloproteins, metal ions are usually coordinated by oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen centers belonging to amino acid residues in the protein. The presence of the metal ion in metalloproteins allows them to take part in diverse biological processes, such as genome stability, metabolic catalysis, and cell cycle progression. Clinically, alteration of the function of metalloproteins in mammals is genetically associated with diseases characterized by DNA damage and repair defects. The present review focuses on the current perspectives of metal ion homeostasis in different organisms and summarizes the most recent understanding on magnesium, copper, iron, and manganese-containing proteins and their functional involvement in the maintenance of genome stability.
