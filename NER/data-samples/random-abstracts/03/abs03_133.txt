Abstract High surface area electrode materials are of interest for the application of electrochemical sensors. Currently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene-sensing electrodes are scarce. Herein, for the first time, a graphene based on a Ta wire support was prepared using the CVD method to form a highly electroactive biosensing platform. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were utilized to characterize the morphology and investigate the electrochemical properties of the CVD graphene electrodes. The resulting CVD graphene electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and had a prominent response effect on dopamine, uric acid, guanine, and adenine. Standing graphene nanosheets have rich catalytic sites such as the edges, the defect levels of the plane, and porous network structures between the graphene nanosheets. These catalytic sites prompt the adsorption and resolution for the four species and the strong electron transport capability of the CVD graphene, which effectively improved the electrical signals for response to four species. Moreover, the graphene electrode is a promising candidate in electrochemical sensing and other electrochemical device applications.
