Abstract In the October 2009 issue of this Journal, we introduced a special pot type, which could improve the energy efficiency of induction cooking, make the boiling process faster and the cooking more comfortable. The dissipated power in the new pot was significantly higher than in the traditional ones at any inductor current. In this paper we show another pot type with similar advantages, but having a simpler structure. The main model parameters were the same as in our previous work: we used the same material properties, including the Bâ€“H curve of the ferromagnetic pot material, the same arrangement of the coil-pot system, and the same formula for calculating the hysteresis loss. We applied similar inductor current with $$f = 25~\hbox {kHz}$$ f=25kHz frequency in the finite element analyses, but instead of 2D, we had to use 3D models because of the pot structure. The non-linear magnetization curve necessitated the use of transient simulations, and we calculated the steady-state rms results from the exact time variations of the field quantities.
