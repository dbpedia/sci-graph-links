Abstract In an effort to better understand the biological efficacy of the tridentate aroyl hydrazone Cu(II) complexes, the Cu(II) complex of di-2-pyridyl ketone isonicotinoyl hydrazone ligand (HL), {[Cu(L)(H2O)]·H2O·NO3}n (C1) was synthesized and characterized. Single crystal X-ray study reveals that complex C1 forms 1D zigzag chains in solid state. In water, the hydrolysis of the 1D zigzag chains was observed, and finally formation of monomeric species. In vitro studies revealed that complex C1 showed significantly more anticancer activity than the ligand alone. Investigation of the anticancer mechanisms of C1, confirmed that the Cu(II) complex exhibit a strong capacity to promote productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.
