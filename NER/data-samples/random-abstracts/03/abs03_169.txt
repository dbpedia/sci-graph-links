Abstract A fabric based on cellulose derivatives has been hydrophobized via coating with oligochloromethylethoxysiloxane and then treated with butyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and higher fatty alcohols. With the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it has been shown that the reaction of alcohols with the siloxane coating proceeds through the exchange of ethoxysilane groups for higher alkoxy groups, whereas the expected reaction of chloromethyl groups with alcohols (the Williamson reaction) does not occur under the chosen conditions.
