Abstract Two novel 3D supramolecular architectures with hexamolybdate and phosphotungstate anions were synthesized under ionothermal conditions. The structures were named as [CuI(L1)2]2L2[Mo6O19](1) and [CuI(L3)2]2.5· H0.5[PW12O40]·H2O(2)(L1=2,2′-bipyridine, L2=4,4′-bipyridine, L3=2,2′–biimidazole) and characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR) and FT-Raman spectroscopy analyses. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the two compounds crystallized in the space group P $$\bar 1$$ and were constructed through hydrogen bonding.
