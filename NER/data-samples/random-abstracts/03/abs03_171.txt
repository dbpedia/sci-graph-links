ABSTRACT PurposeTo investigate the mechanisms of polysorbate (PS) degradation with the added objective of differentiating the hydrolysis and oxidation pathways. MethodsUltra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was utilized to characterize all-laurate polysorbate 20 (PS20) and its degradants. 18O stable isotope labeling was implemented to produce 18O-labeled degradation products of all-laurate PS20 in H2 18O, with subsequent UPLC-MS analysis for location of the cleavage site on the fatty acid-containing side chain of PS20. ResultsThe analysis reveals that hydrolysis of all-laurate PS20 leads to a breakdown of the ester linkage to liberate free lauric acid, showing a distinct dependence on pH. Using a hydrophilic free radical initiator, 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) to study the oxidative degradation of all-laurate PS20, we demonstrate that free lauric acid and polyoxyethylene (POE) laurate are two major decomposition products. Measurement of 18O incorporation into free lauric acid indicated that hydrolysis primarily led to 18O incorporation into free lauric acid via “acyl-cleavage” of the fatty acid ester bond. In contrast, AAPH-exposure of all-laurate PS20 produced free lauric acid without 18O-incorporation. ConclusionsThe 18O-labeling technique and unique degradant patterns of all-laurate PS20 described here provide a direct approach to differentiate the types of PS degradation.
