Abstract Nanosized dispersive flake-like magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) had been prepared by a hydrothermal method. In the process, when the surfactant polyvinyl pyrrolidone was added, high dispersion, small particle size and large specific surface area of hexagonal crystal magnesium hydroxide was obtained by ultrasonic dispersion and temperature program. The flame retardant of Mg(OH)2 was systematically explored by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, BET analysis and thermo-gravimetric analysis tests. SEM showed the formation of uniform and small size magnesium hydroxide particle with hexagonal nanoscale. Under the optimized conditions, high nano-sized hexagonal Mg(OH)2 was acquired with a mean particle size of 134 nm and a specific surface area of 26.66 m2/g. According to TGA results, the sample’s decomposition temperature was 626.9 K, which was consistent with the reported literature. It is vitally prospected that the prepared hexagonal Mg(OH)2 is to be applied to the industry as a flame retardant.
