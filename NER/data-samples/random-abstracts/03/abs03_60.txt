Abstract A new fluorescent labeling reagent, benzimidazo[2,1-b]quinazolin-12(6H)-one-5-ethyl-p-toluenesulfonate (BQETS) was designed and synthesized, and it was successfully applied to the determination of fatty acids with liquid chromatography. BQETS can easily and quickly label fatty acids within 20 min at 90 °C in dimethylformamide with K2CO3 as catalyst. The derivatives exhibit high stability and strong fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths of 247 and 401 nm, respectively. The 24 derivatives of fatty acids were completely separated by gradient elution on a Hypersil GOLD C18 column. Excellent linear responses for all fatty acids were observed with correlation coefficients of >0.9991. The method also showed good sensitivity and precision, with limits of detection in the 0.0024–0.0206 μg g−1 range and relative standard deviations ≤9.6 %. This is the first time that BQETS fluorescent probe and its applications for the determination of fatty acids have been reported. Moreover, this is the first report on the comparison of free fatty acids composition in the above-ground part of Coriandrum sativum L. from different habitats in China.
