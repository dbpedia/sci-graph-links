In this study, a series of injectable thermoreversible and thermogelling PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA copolymers were developed and a systematic evaluation of the thermogelling system both in vitro and in vivo was performed. The aqueous PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA solutions above a critical gel concentration could transform into hydrogel spontaneously within 2â€‰minutes around the body temperature in vitro or in vivo. Modulating the molecular weight, block length and polymer concentration could adjust the sol-gel transition behavior and the mechanical properties of the hydrogels. The gelation was thermally reversible due to the physical interaction of copolymer micelles and no crystallization formed during the gelation. Little cytotoxicity and hemolysis of this polymer was found, and the inflammatory response after injecting the hydrogel to small-animal was acceptable. In vitro and in vivo degradation experiments illustrated that the physical hydrogel could retain its integrity as long as several weeks and eventually be degraded by hydrolysis. A rat model of sidewall defect-bowel abrasion was employed, and a significant reduction of post-operative adhesion has been found in the group of PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA hydrogel-treated, compared with untreated control group and commercial hyaluronic acid (HA) anti-adhesion hydrogel group. As such, this PDLLA-PEG-PDLLA hydrogel might be a promising candidate of injectable biomaterial for medical applications.
