Abstract Methods of synthesis have been developed for new types of promising precursors of metal borides, coordination compounds [ML3]B{3H8{2 (M = Fe2+, Ni2+; L = bipy, phen), using modified procedures of synthesis of octahydrotriborate anion. Compounds [Ni(bipy)3]B{3H8}2, [Ni (phen)3]B{3H8}2 and [Fe(phen)3]B{3H8}2 were prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
