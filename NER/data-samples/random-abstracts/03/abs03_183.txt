Abstract Pomegranate-shaped Fe3O4/RGO nanohybrids were prepared via an ethylene glycol-mediated solvothermal method. Their morphology and structure were investigated by different characterization techniques. The red shift in FTIR and Raman spectra of nanohybrids demonstrated the existence of interfacial interactions between Fe3O4 and RGO. As anode material for lithium-ion battery, these nanohybrids exhibited elongated cycling stability and enhanced reversible capacity compared with bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles and mixture (Fe3O4 + RGO). The initial capacity of the nanohybrids could reach to 1266 mAh g−1 and remained 992 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 150 mAh g−1. Their cells manifested an outstanding rate capability of 384 mAh g−1 at 5.0 °C. The relationships between microstructure and performance were carefully exploited to obtain key factors that are helpful for design and construction of hybridized materials with improved electrochemical performance.
