Abstract The work describes novel functional bionanosystems for treatment and diagnostics on the basis of proteins, enzymes, polymeric coatings, and magnetic nanoparticles developed at Lomonosov Moscow State University Laboratory for Chemical Design of Bionanomaterials in collaboration with scientists from UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy (USA). The properties of enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, organophosphate hydrolase, and lysines of bacteriophages) and other drug molecules immobilized in polymeric complexes, as well as the methods for targeted drug delivery using cell-mediated systems and magnetic nanoparticles in in vitro and in vivo operating conditions, are discussed. Physical and chemical characteristics, including data on the functional properties of the nanoformulations, are obtained. The nanoformulations developed demonstrated high potential therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of central nervous system and brain diseases, inflammations (including inflammatory diseases of the eye), cancer and infectious diseases, neurotoxic injury, and others. The possibilities of remote control biochemical reactions using a nonheating low-frequency alternating magnetic field (AMF) for the controlled release of drugs are analyzed in the review. The experimental results of the AMF effects on bionanosystems containing magnetic nanoparticles, such as changing the catalytic activities of enzymes bound to magnetic nanoparticles and ‘disordering’ of the lipid bilayer in membranes, are considered.
