It has been proven on the example of individual hydrocarbons that IR spectrometry can be used to analyze properties of base oils. A proximate viscosity, viscosity index, and pour point determination method was developed based on quantitative IR spectrometry using the areas of two characteristic peaks and regression analysis for API-classified group 3 and 4 oils. This method can be used for quality control and real-time study of base oils.
