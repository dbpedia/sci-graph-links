Abstract Surfactants and paraffin wax were used to coat microcrystalline cellulose to prevent cellulose agglomeration during dispersion in this study. The coated particles exhibited similar lengths, but the area of coverage varied from little to complete coverage of the cellulose particles depending on the amount of surfactant and paraffin wax. The results demonstrate the possibility of coating microcrystalline cellulose with a desired amount of surfactants and paraffin wax.
