AbstractAn efficient, useful and general procedure for the synthesis of 2,4-disubstituted quinolines via one-pot three-component reaction of aryl amines, aryl aldehydes and phenylacetylene using Al2O3 nanoparticles/methanesulfonic acid (nano-AMA) as a new catalyst has been described. The major advantages of this protocol are high yields, inexpensive catalyst, short reaction times, green and reusable heterogeneous nanocatalyst. It is found that the catalyst is recyclable and can be used up to five times without significant loss of its activity. Graphical Abstract
