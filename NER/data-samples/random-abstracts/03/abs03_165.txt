Abstract We show that there cannot be more than 64 lines on a quartic surface with isolated rational double points over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $$p \ne 2,\,3$$ p≠2,3 , thus extending Segre–Rams–Schütt theorem. Our proof offers a deeper insight into the triangle-free case and takes advantage of a special configuration of lines, thereby avoiding the technique of the flecnodal divisor. We provide several examples of non-smooth K3 quartic surfaces with many lines.
