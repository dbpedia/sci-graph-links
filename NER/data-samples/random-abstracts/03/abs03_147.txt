Abstract We utilized density functional theory (DFT) study to understand the adsorption mechanism of lithium oxides (LixO2) onto N-doped graphene during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for lithium–air batteries. We systematically proposed two possible ORR pathways and examined various adsorption configurations in each system, including for the O2 and Li ORR reactants and the LiO2 and Li2O2 ORR products. The doping of the N atom into graphene was calculated to enhance the adsorption of O2, but to attenuate the adsorption of Li, because of the repulsion between the electron-rich N-doped graphene and the electron-donating Li atom, and the attraction of this N-doped graphene for electronegative O2. Nevertheless, since the adsorption of Li onto N-doped graphene (−1.001 to −0.503 eV) was still stronger than the adsorption of O2 (−0.280 to −0.215 eV), Li should bind N-doped graphene first. Moreover, N-doped graphene was calculated to bind LiO2 (−0.588 eV) more strongly than was pristine graphene (−0.450 eV). Additionally, the Li2O2 configuration that yielded the most stable adsorption on N-doped graphene was calculated to yield an adsorption energy of −0.642 eV, which is more favorable than that for pristine graphene (−0.630 eV). Overall, N-doped graphene was found to strengthen the adsorption of lithium oxides (LixO2) and increase charge transfer to substantial levels.
