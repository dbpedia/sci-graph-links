Abstract Cross-linked polyimides containing phenolic residue were prepared by Dielsâ€“Alder (DA) reaction of Phenol-furfural resin with various bis(maleimides), in presence of tetrahydro-furan-acetone (50:50 v/v) mixture solvent and without solvent. The so-called DA adduct tetrahydrophthalimide intermediates obtained were aromatized in the presence of acetic anhydride. The resultant cross-linked polyimides were characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectral studies and thermogravimetry. The results show that produced polyimides exhibit good thermal stability. The glass reinforcement of produced cross-linked polyimides system affords the laminates with good mechanical properties.
