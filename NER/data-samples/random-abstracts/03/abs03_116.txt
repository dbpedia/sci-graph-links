Abstract Complexation between ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (Н4Y, EDDS) and Er3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+ ions in aqueous solutions is studied by calorimetry and pH measurements. The thermodynamic parameters (logK, ΔrG, ΔrH, and Δr S) of formation of LnY–and LnHY complexes at 298.15 K and ionic strength I = 0.5(KNO3) are determined. Changes in the thermodynamic parameters of reactions while moving along the lanthanide series are discussed.
