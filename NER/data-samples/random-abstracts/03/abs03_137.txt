Abstract An attempt has been made to prepare cobalt-doped lithium manganese oxide with three different concentrations by simple molten salt method to enhance the electrical property of Li4Mn5O12. Prepared samples were examined by XRD and SEM to identify its structure and morphology. Electrical properties were identified by impedance and conductivity analysis, and it was found that the material exhibits negative temperature coefficient (NTCR) property, i.e., semi-conducting nature. Among the various concentrations, 0.5 mol of Co-doped lithium manganese oxide has shown good conductivity of 3.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 433 K.
