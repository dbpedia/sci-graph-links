Abstract There is an emerging field in literacy research which acknowledges the potential variances in literacy practices valued by schools and families. This article reports on one instance where the rich literacy practices of a particular home environment were not recognized within the childâ€™s school context. The data explores the impact on the child as a reader situated in dichotomous environments. This article argues for the importance of legitimising a broad range of literacy practices within schools which may serve to position a wider range of children as readers therefore promoting equitable outcomes.
