Abstract The present study investigated the associations of visual-spatial attention with word reading fluency and spelling in 92 third grade Hong Kong Chinese children. Word reading fluency was measured with a timed reading task whereas spelling was measured with a dictation task. Results showed that visual-spatial attention was a unique predictor of speeded reading accuracy (i.e., the total number of words read correctly divided by the total number of words read in a timed reading task) but not reading speed (i.e., the number of words read correctly in the same task) after controlling for age, non-verbal intelligence, morphological awareness, phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and rapid automatized naming. Visual-spatial attention also explained unique variance in word spelling measured with a dictation task after the same control variables. The findings of the present study suggest that visual-spatial attention is important for literacy development in Chinese children.
