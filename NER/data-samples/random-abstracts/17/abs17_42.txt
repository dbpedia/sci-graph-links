Abstract The solvability of the word problem for Yamamura’s HNN-extensions $$[S;A_{1},A_{2};\varphi ]$$ [S;A1,A2;φ] has been proved in some particular cases. However, we show that, contrary to the group case, the word problem for $$[S;A_{1}A_{2};\varphi ]$$ [S;A1A2;φ] is undecidable even if we consider S to have finite $$\mathscr {R}$$ R -classes, $$A_{1}$$ A1 and $$A_{2}$$ A2 to be free inverse subsemigroups of finite rank and with zero, and $$\varphi ,\varphi ^{-1}$$ φ,φ-1 to be computable.
