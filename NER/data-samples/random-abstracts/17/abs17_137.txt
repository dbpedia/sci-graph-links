Abstract The aim of the present paper was to study the impact of a gratitude building intervention on adolescents’ gratitude and well-being indicators. The sample comprised 177 students aged 11–14 years (M Age = 12.29 years, SD = 0.67, 58 % male) attending two schools in North India. Using quasi-experimental design, participating classrooms from both schools were randomly allocated to intervention group (n = 95) or control group (n = 82). Participants completed an assessment battery comprising measures of well-being, positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, gratitude and cognition of benefit-appraisal at pre-test and post-test. Intervention group attended 30-min-long weekly sessions based on the gratitude curriculum (Froh et al. School Psychology Review, 132–152, 2014) for five consecutive weeks while control group attended neutral sessions for the same duration. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the differences between the intervention and control groups at post-test. Results suggested significant intervention effects on psychological well-being, positive affect, positive feelings, life satisfaction and gratitude. The cascading effect of gratitude was also observed. Overall findings rendered favourable evidence for Froh et al.’s (School Psychology Review, 132–152, 2014) gratitude intervention among North Indian adolescents.
