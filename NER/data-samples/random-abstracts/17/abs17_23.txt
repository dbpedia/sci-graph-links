Abstract The problem on the motion of a homogeneous ball on a horizontal plane is considered. The existence of the vector first integral independent of the friction character and the motion of the support plane in the horizontal directions is shown. In particular, the velocities of the ball center are identical at the moments of rolling on a motionless plane, which corresponds to experiments with the ANAIS billiard table.
