Traditional computer simulations do not incorporate human intuition and human‐like engagement that acknowledges complex and abstract questions. This paper presents WOTS (Wizard of Oz Telemedicine Simulator), a generic cognitive training platform that supports transfer of medical knowledge through remote training and consultations (telemedicine training). Medical training via the WOTS provides remote learners a risk‐free environment in which they can practice and make mistakes, while receiving online feedback about their decisions. WOTS leverages the Wizard of Oz (WOZ) concept, where human intuition is applied through corrective feedback to complex and abstract misconceptions of learners’ thinking (flawed mental models). The contribution of WOTS to enhanced learning is demonstrated by a number of pilot runs and a case study.
