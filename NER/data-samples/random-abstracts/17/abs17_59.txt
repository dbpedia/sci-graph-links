Abstract We discuss here the potential use of a morphologically aware spelling corrector to aid second language learners in finding words in an electronic dictionary, using Korean as the language of instantiation but with a method extensible to many languages. The tool discussed is a composition of two parts: a spelling corrector and morphological analyzer. When these two parts are composed, it allows for the spelling correction of morphologically complex words. The results include correct spellings as well as one or more possible morphological parses, which can aid the student both in their spelling and in their understanding of the components of the words. It can be particularly useful when students hear a word (rather than constructing it themselves) and may, therefore, not know the correct spelling or all the morphemes in it. The performance of this method is tested with data obtained from a Korean student learner error corpus and then compared with that of another publicly available morphologically aware spellcheckerâ€”the online Pusan National University spelling and grammar checker. Testing and findings reveal that traditional spellcheckers will not find many student errors, because they are not designed to; the word they typed is a correct word, but the incorrect one for the context. Providing students with multiple search results at all times allows them to choose the correct one for their context, and doing so allowed our tool to offer spelling correction, where a more traditional spellchecker did not.
