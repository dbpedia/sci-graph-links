Abstract The PhD thesis "On Cognitive Aspects of Human-Level Artificial Intelligence" summarises several connected lines of work from the field of human-level artificial intelligence (HLAI) research. Among others, complexity and approximation properties of the heuristic-driven theory projection analogy engine have been examined, and the framework has been applied to modelling tasks in cognitive psychology and the learning sciences. Additionally, the general importance and applicability of formal methods as potential guidance for research and development of systems in AI/HLAI has been outlined and exemplified. Finally, questions for the scientific status of AI/HLAI and for means of assessing or measuring progress in the field have been discussed.
