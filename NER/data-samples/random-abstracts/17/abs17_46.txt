Abstract A unique formulation of the solution to a spinning, nearly axisymmetric rigid-body is presented. Direct integration of the linearized equations of motion gives accurate results for nearly axisymmetric inertia ellipsoids while avoiding the complexity of more general formulations. The simplicity of the formulation lends itself to a better understanding of the system behavior. Specifically, the motion of the spin axis for this nearly axisymmetric case is described by an oblate epicycloid, providing an extension of the classic epicycloid solution for axisymmetric objects.
