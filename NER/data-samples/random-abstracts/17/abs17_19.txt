Abstract The initial vision for intelligent tutoring systems involved powerful, multi-faceted systems that would leverage rich models of students and pedagogies to create complex learning interactions. But the intelligent tutoring systems used at scale today are much simpler. In this article, I present hypotheses on the factors underlying this development, and discuss the potential of educational data mining driving human decision-making as an alternate paradigm for online learning, focusing on intelligence amplification rather than artificial intelligence.
