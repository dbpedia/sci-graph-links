Abstract This study aims to reveal the teaching script and structure of lesson practice of two seventh-grade Japanese mathematics teachers—a “novice” and “expert”—through comparative analysis of mathematics lessons. Specifically, it aims to clarify how the teachers’ views of teaching as tacit knowledge determine lesson structure and share the same culture in different forms in practice. This comparative analysis shows how the lessons can be described as sharing the same teaching culture in different forms from the following two perspectives: (1) methods of mathematical communication between teacher and students, and (2) approaches to dealing with mathematical concepts.
