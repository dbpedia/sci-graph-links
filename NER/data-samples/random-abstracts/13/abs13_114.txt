Abstract Given the interrelated role of writing and the development of early literacy skills, recommendations have been made to increase instructional writing experiences in K-2 classrooms. In an effort to increase the amount of writing in the primary grades that leads to later literacy success, it is important that teachers engage in instructional practices that align with how early writing skills develop in young children. To this end, early childhood teachers and teacher educators can benefit from an enhanced understanding of the writing instructional practices teachers have engaged in and the associated challenges they have experienced as they respond to the expectation to increase writing experiences in their classrooms. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine how five K-2 teachers perceived, implemented, and reflected on writing instruction in their classrooms. Using a case study design, researchers examined interview, survey, and observational data, resulting in an in-depth description and analysis of the writing instructional experiences of these five teachers. Qualitative analyses identified two meta-themes related to writing instruction: opportunities and obstacles. Implications for K-2 teacher preparation and professional development are discussed.
