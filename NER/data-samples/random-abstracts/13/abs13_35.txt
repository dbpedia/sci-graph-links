Using the 2014 ACA Code of Ethics’ nine categories of orientation content as its framework, this study explored the information provided on the 63 CACREP-accredited CE doctoral programs’ websites in the U.S. Content suggestions for CE program websites are provided. The purpose is to improve program fit via providing prospective students with thorough information about the CE profession, a department and its program.
