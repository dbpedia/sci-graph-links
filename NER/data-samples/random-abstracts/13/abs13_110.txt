Abstract The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of whether learners’ conformity behaviors and learning anxiety can affect their intrinsic and extrinsic motivations when participating in Facebook groups that implement physical classroom courses. This study employs the “conformity scale of students using Facebook course groups”, the “learning anxiety scale”, and the “intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation scale” as measurement tools on 184 valid questionnaires. In addition, structural equation modeling was adopted to analyze the data. Results showed that high conformity exerts a positive impact on both intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivations, while learning anxiety has a negative impact on intrinsic motivation. Finally, the authors provide recommendations based on these results, so that researchers and educators can use them as a reference for future studies.
