Abstract In many cases, classrooms seem to be functioning as well as ever, though the challenges and expectations have changed quite dramatically. This study presents an innovative project-based cloud learning (PBCL) model which integrates various Google services in order to enhance critical thinking abilities in human–computer interface design. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SNS collaborative teaching model for HCI design, the one-group pretest–posttest experiment was adopted in a university HCI design course in Taiwan. Participants included 32 technical and vocational university students aged 20–22, all major in information science. The collected data is used to explore the change in students’ critical thinking skills. Additionally, this study also adopts an interview survey to collect qualitative data. There are 11 groups in this course, and the 11 respondents were randomly selected from these groups after the course. The results indicate that the practice of PBCL could help students to develop critical thinking skills rather than disposition. More specifically, the differences of low initial disposition group’s pre-test and post-test of CTD and CTS were significant. The qualitative interview results reveal that experimental subjects hold a positive view on integrating SNS and various Google services to human–computer interface course to enhance project design and critical thinking skills. It implies that the PBCL model is an innovative and practical teaching model to be beneficial to learners with low initial interest. In addition, it helps students deepen impression of learning content and inspire new ideas.
