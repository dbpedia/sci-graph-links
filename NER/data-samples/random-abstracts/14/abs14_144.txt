Abstract A mimicry honeypot framework based on game theory is presented in our work, which can calculate the equilibrium strategy of the deceptive game using non-cooperative incomplete dynamic game theory, and make decisions for the mimicry framework to deploy the simple service, the honeypot and the fake honeypot. A mimicry prototype is implemented using NS2 platform, and simulation experiments are launched to validate the decision-making result and the deceptive performance of the mimicry honeypot. The empirical study shows that the mimicry honeypot framework based on game theory can be able to influence the equilibrium strategy results by dynamically changing the deployment vector of the mimicry system. It validates that the mimicry honeypot framework has better flexibility, activeness and fraudulence than the traditional honeypot.
