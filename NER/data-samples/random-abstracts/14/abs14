Supporting studies have employed a limited range of analytical techniques and the objective of the present paper is to test the hypothesis using a new methodology, the Relative Social Willingness to Pay. Three subsidiary hypotheses are: (1) that the importance of the ‘severity effect’ varies with the type of medical problem; (2) that the relationship between value and utility varies with the severity of the initial health state; and (3) that there is a threshold beyond which severity effects are insignificant. For each of seven different health problems respondents to a web-based survey were asked to allocate a budget to five services which would, cumulatively, move a person from near death to full health. The time trade-off utilities of health states before and after the service were estimated. The social valuation of the service measured by the budget allocation was regressed upon the corresponding increase in utility and severity as measured by the pre-service health state utility. Results confirm the severity hypothesis and support the subsidiary hypotheses. However, the effects identified are quantitatively significant only for the most severe health states. This implies a relatively limited redistribution of resources from those with less severe to those with more severe health problems." .

To resolve these issues simultaneously, a new class of rainbow trend options is proposed. The diversification effect of rainbow options can reduce the importance of asset selection decisions and trend options can mitigate unfavorable effects on market entry and exit decisions. We consider a general framework to facilitate the derivation of analytic pricing formulas for simple, pure, and Asian rainbow trend options using the martingale pricing method. The properties of these options and their Greeks are analyzed. We also investigate the performance of the dynamic delta hedging strategy for issuers of rainbow trend options. Last, this paper explores the applications of rainbow trend options for hedging price risks, designing executive stock options, modifying countercyclical capital buffer proposed by Basel Committee, and acting as control variates of the Monte Carlo simulation." .

El objetivo de este análisis económico fue estimar los costes sanitarios que podrían evitarse con el tratamiento combinado con furoato de fluticasona/vilanterol (FF + VI) respecto al tratamiento con VI en monoterapia en pacientes con EPOC, de acuerdo a la reducción de la tasa de exacerbaciones con FF + VI frente a VI observada en ensayos clínicos. MétodosSe estimó el número de pacientes de 40 años o más con EPOC de moderada a muy grave y antecedentes de exacerbaciones susceptibles de recibir tratamiento con FF + VI. Se generaron simulaciones de Monte Carlo (una por paciente incluido) para simular las exacerbaciones moderadas-graves y los costes sanitarios evitados con FF + VI frente a VI desde la perspectiva del Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) español y en un horizonte temporal de 1 año. Las variables utilizadas para el análisis fueron la tasa anual de exacerbaciones con FF + VI y VI, obtenidas del análisis integrado de dos ensayos clínicos, y los costes de exacerbaciones moderadas-graves, obtenidos a partir de un estudio observacional realizado en España. Los resultados se expresaron como media (desviación estándar). ResultadosSe incluyó a 18.098 pacientes en el análisis. El tratamiento con FF + VI evitó 4.251 (58) exacerbaciones en comparación con el tratamiento con VI, que supusieron unos costes sanitarios evitados de 1.869.430 euros (37.669 euros). ConclusionesLa reducción de la tasa de exacerbaciones con FF + VI respecto al tratamiento con VI observada en ensayos clínicos puede traducirse en costes sanitarios evitados al SNS, lo que podría disminuir, a su vez, la carga económica asociada a la EPOC." .

Die Ursache-Wirkungs-Zusammenhänge sind dabei nicht vollständig geklärt. Die vorliegende Sekundäranalyse zielt darauf, die Wechselwirkungen zwischen Arbeitslosigkeit und Gesundheit in einem repräsentativen Sample zu untersuchen. MethodenDie Datengrundlage bildet der Scientific-Use-File (SUF) des Panels Arbeitsmarkt und soziale Sicherung (PASS), das sich aus Leistungsempfängern der Bundesagentur für Arbeit und ihren Haushaltsmitgliedern sowie einer haushaltsbasierten Bevölkerungsstichprobe zusammensetzt. In der 7. Welle (2013) wurden 12.570 Personen (im Alter von 15 bis 64 Jahren) aus 8.392 Haushalten interviewt. ErgebnisseBeschäftigte und Arbeitslose unterscheiden sich stark nach soziodemografischen Merkmalen und bei Gesundheitsvariablen. Arbeitslose schätzen ihren subjektiven Gesundheitszustand bedeutend häufiger als weniger gut oder schlecht ein (arbeitslose Männer: 31,0 % vs. beschäftigte Männer: 14,0 %; arbeitslose Frauen: 37,7 % vs. beschäftigte Frauen: 21,7 %) und berichten häufiger, dass sie durch seelische Probleme ziemlich oder sehr beeinträchtigt sind (arbeitslose Männer: 21,9 % vs. beschäftigte Männer: 7,2 %; arbeitslose Frauen: 20,4 % vs. beschäftigte Frauen: 15,8 %). Bei Arbeitslosen ist zudem der Anteil von Personen mit einer amtlich anerkannten Behinderung und sonstigen schwerwiegenden Gesundheitseinschränkungen erhöht. Sie berichten zu einem wesentlich größeren Teil von mind. einem Krankenhausaufenthalt in den vergangenen 12 Monaten (arbeitslose Männer: 16,3 % vs. beschäftigte Männer: 9,9 %; arbeitslose Frauen: 19,6 % vs. beschäftigte Frauen: 12,2 %) und haben mehr Arztkontakte als Beschäftigte. Dagegen sind Arbeitslose im geringeren Maße sportlich aktiv. Die multivariaten, logistischen Regressionsmodelle ergeben longitudinal starke gesundheitsbezogene Selektionseffekte bei Arbeitsmarktübergängen. Je ungünstiger der subjektive Gesundheitszustand ist, desto höher ist im Folgejahr bei Beschäftigten das Arbeitslosigkeitsrisiko und umso geringer sind die Reintegrationschancen von Arbeitslosen. Die höchste Vorhersagekraft für einen schlechten subjektiven Gesundheitszustand hat die Gesundheit im Vorjahr. Arbeitsplatzverlust und Wiederbeschäftigung beeinflussen diese tendenziell. SchlussfolgerungenDie Auswertungen zeigen erhebliche Gesundheitsunterschiede zu ungunsten von Arbeitslosen. Sie weisen auf Präventionspotenziale für das Gesundheitswesen und die Arbeitsförderung hin." .

The results show that Chinese cities benefit from the economic spillovers from surrounding cities, but bear the costs of negative air pollution externalities created by neighboring cities. We use wind direction and the administrative boundaries of provinces to disentangle possible multicollinearity between air pollution emissions and economic spillovers across cities. However, the results could not reject the growth-restricting effects of air pollution from neighboring cities. The results imply that the development of a city surrounded by polluters is likely to be constrained." .

To reconcile the mixed evidence, this paper examines the nonlinear relationship between the agglomeration of exporters and export decisions. In brief, the results show that the former positively affects the latter. Furthermore, the squared term of agglomeration calculated only by the number of skilled workers is negatively and significantly associated with export decisions, which can be explained by congestion costs in a local labor market for the skilled worker. As a result, these findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between the agglomeration of exporters and the probability of being an exporter." .

However, this change did not happen all at once, instead there was a gradual shift over time as experimenting firms learned that they could sell lower quality loans into the market and other firms were forced to follow along or lose market share. Mortgages started from a position of a stable market with high-quality loans and then shifted over time to a market characterized by continually declining quality and then shifted again sharply back towards high quality, although now requiring government intervention for support. This same pattern was seen across a number of different characteristics of the market. This paper shows how and why the shift happened from an evolutionary perspective and discusses the implications of this kind of behavior for understanding this period and also for possible developments in the future." .

Previous research shows that students choose the degree/major that reports them the maximum utility level. This evidence relies on data from revealed preferences, implicitly assuming that the degree/major a student pursues is the student’s preferred degree. However, numerus clausus and other restrictions can condition the choice of major. Under these restrictions, the revealed choice is not necessarily the alternative that maximizes utility. We analyze data from pre-enrollment student-stated preferences regarding degrees within a natural field choice experiment setting. Our findings are in line with the rational choice results obtained in the literature, thus contributing external validity in a previously unexplored setting. In addition, we also contribute a discrete choice modeling strategy and estimation method. The discrete choice model accounts for individual characteristics, degree attributes and their interaction in an specification that is as general as discrete choice models used in the literature. The estimation method can handle cases where the number of alternatives and individual observations is large while other methods are unfeasible." .

By establishing a VAR model, this paper examines the multivariate causal relationships direction in short and long term and to what extent they affect each other. A series of econometric tools are employed to build a systematic analytical framework, including cointegration test, vector error correction, impulse response function, and variance decomposition. The empirical test results show the existence of bidirectional impacts among the four variables. The findings indicate that energy use boosts economic growth; meanwhile, CO2 emissions positively relate to economic slowdown in China in recent years. Cointegration test indicates the existence of four long-term equilibrium relationships among the variables. VECM model reveals that energy use has a reverse adjusting power of 11.68 % working on shifting short-term deviation back to long-term equilibrium. Impulse response function demonstrates that environmental regulation benefits economic growth only in the long run and facilitates improving energy efficiency, and the current implementation of regulation on CO2 emissions is inconsistent. Variance decomposition shows that environmental regulation impacts energy use more greatly than economic growth. The final part concludes the new findings of the paper and proposes suggestions for China’s sustainable development." .

The linkages between human capital and migration have also found a fertile ground in recent years especially in Europe where many studies have focused on interregional migration of graduates and highly skilled individuals. However, the literature on this phenomenon in the USA is less developed. Using the SESTAT database from NSF, this paper aims at contributing to the understanding of inter-state migration behavior of graduates in the USA and its effects on their career outcomes. It builds on the existing literature not only by focusing specifically on the US context, but also incorporating into the empirical model a correction for the possible selection bias that arises from the dual relationship between migration propensity and human capital endowment. Our estimated Mincerian earning equations, corrected for migrant self-selectivity, show that indeed repeat migration is associated with higher average salaries, while late migration is associated with a salary penalty. As for the other control variables, our results are consistent with what has been found in the labor economics literature. Female workers suffer from a salary penalty, while experience, level of education and employer size are all associated with higher average salaries. The labor market also rewards different fields of study differently." .

Models with person fixed effects show that, on average, immigrant men in Canada do not experience any relative growth in these three outcomes compared to men born in Canada. Immigrant men in the USA, on the other hand, experience positive annual growth in all three domains relative to US-born men. This difference is largely on account of low-educated immigrant men, who experience faster or longer periods of relative growth in employment and wages in the USA than in Canada. We further compare longitudinal and cross-sectional trajectories and find that the latter over-estimate wage growth of earlier arrivals, presumably reflecting selective return migration." .

We model the system at the so-called flow level, where the number of flows varies dynamically and each flow has a random service requirement. Due to the interference between the stations the system is modeled as a set of four interacting processor sharing queues. Our objective is to consider, by using several approaches, the gains from dynamic policies that utilize instantaneous state information to minimize the total mean number of flows. Assuming that the capacity is shared dynamically according to the notion of balanced fairness yields a general policy that is also Pareto optimal, and we are able to explicitly analyze its performance. For exponential service times, we also apply the theory of Markov decision processes and the policy iteration algorithm to minimize the number of flows in the system. Finally, we define priority policies for certain special cases and show that they are even stochastically optimal. Our numerical results show that the gains from the dynamic policies compared with a statically optimized policy can be significant. Surprisingly, the gains can be achieved largely by our novel robust heuristic policy that only relies on instantaneous information about the number of flows." .

We argue that the informal recruitment channel may increase job–education mismatches both directly (by inducing some workers to undertake careers in industries, professions, or firms where their comparative productive advantage is not fully exploited) and indirectly by negatively affecting spatial flexibility. In order to test these hypotheses, we estimate probit models with self-selection using ISFOL Plus survey data providing information on labour market entry channels, job-related migration and a “subjective” measure of overeducation. We find a robust positive impact of the use of the informal channel on overeducation and a robust negative effect of the use of this channel on migration. On the other hand, we find that migration reduces overeducation only in some geographical areas of the Italian territory. Overall, these findings suggest that a reform of employment services in Italy is needed in order to favour spatial flexibility, reduce the use of the informal channel and enhance the quality of job–education matches." .

We mainly analyze the differential responses of trading volumes to housing price changes (denoted as price elasticity), employing a quantile cointegrating approach that allows us to capture housing boom–bust cycles earlier. In addition, we also explore the long-term impacts of monetary policies on housing sales. According to our findings, the price elasticities perform differently across the booms and busts of housing markets. Shifts in price elasticities can transmit signals of oncoming upturns, recovery, and downturns of housing cycles, which possibly relate to the business cycle. On the other hand, a contractionary monetary policy exerts a much effective control over an overheated housing market, but an expansionary monetary policy has a relatively small influence on stimulating a depressed housing market. Our findings offer some important suggestions and policy implications." .

The sudden increase in the country’s wealth created an inflow of capital never seen before, which led to an appreciation of its currency and, therefore, a loss of competiveness in the non-energy exporting sector. The purpose of this article is to provide empirical evidence of Dutch disease in Colombia. This country is different from other economies analyzed for Dutch disease since it has been dependent on two different commodities, coffee first and oil lately. Hence, we focus on the long-run analysis and test by means of a vector error correction model whether commodity prices are related to the real exchange rate and the relative manufacturing output. The long-run relations as well as the impulse response analysis clearly show that commodity prices are positively related to the real exchange rate. Thus, increases in commodity prices have a negative effect on the competitiveness of the country. Our result also shows that public spending is a major source of pressure on the Colombian real exchange rate." .

Shorter walking times and shorter distances are significant criteria in commuter path choice; however, in the presence of multiple pathways of virtually the same length, the criteria of perceived time and perceived distance play the key role in path choice. In this regard, this study investigates perceived legibility (PL) as an alternative path choice criterion for commuters on the basis of its hypothesized correlation with perceived time. For commuters, a more legible pathway is a well-signed directional pathway, which generates a strong sense of direction toward the destinations along it. As Perceived legibility (PL) is assumed to be a positive factor for commuters’ choice of path, the main question of this research is whether the highest PL is taken into account by commuters as an important path choice criterion in the case of available alternative pathways of almost the same length. In this regard, the importance of the highest PL for commuters’ path choice was examined in comparison with other probable path choice criteria. In addition, the components of the highest PL were explored according to the perceptions of commuters. It was conducted in nine zones of the CBD of Kuala Lumpur. The zones were selected and finalized based on the design of the zone selection process. The collected data were processed using two consecutive survey questionnaires and an observational analysis. The highest PL showed moderate importance regarding commuter path choice. However, because of the significant correlation between PL and perceived time as well as sense of pleasance as two of the most important path choice criteria, highest PL or strongest sense of direction toward the destination is taken into account as one of the key factors for commuter path choice. Furthermore, factors such as the presence of buildings according to their height and façade, and commuters’ greater ability to see their destination point while walking, were found to be components of PL. Such relationships indicate the importance of these physical and visual factors for improving the path choice and walking rates of commuters in the CBD." .

To test for changes in the level or in the trend, we use the algorithm developed by Kejriwal and Perron (J Time Ser Anal 31:305–328, 2010. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9892.2010.00666.x) to detect structural breaks for each sub-Saharan African country for the period 1950–2010 and then verify whether per capita income paths eventually converge to their long-run trend.

In order to examine the fact that the per capita GDP growth rate in one region may be associated with the growth rate in neighbouring regions, our empirical part begins with the Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). This preliminary analysis based on the ESDA tools has suggested the appropriateness of the spatial aspect in income regional convergence modelling. Following these results, we proceed with the estimation of the beta-convergence models for purpose of verifying various absolute and conditional convergence hypotheses. The estimation of the income convergence models confirmed that the spatial dependence among regions does matter. We have also employed the dummy variable corresponding to the former political orientation of the regions in order to test the conditional convergence hypothesis assuming that it controls for different country specific factors. The incorporation of the dummy variable enabled us to assess the speed of convergence and the half-life time separately for two groups of regions under the consideration (post-communist or not). Almost all hypotheses of the analysed convergence models were confirmed. The inclusion of spatial effects to the models always led to worsening of the convergence characteristics. Overall, the results of our analysis imply that convergence process is not determined only by a region’s initial income and other specific factors but also essentially by its neighbourhood region’s growth performance." .

The study also investigates two indirect channels and finds that concentration has a positive and stabilizing impact on financial stability through the profitability channel and a negative and destabilizing impact through the interest rate channel. When considering the level of development across countries, our results support the existence of a stabilizing effect of concentration on financial stability and the absence of a destabilizing interest channel for developing countries. Interestingly, our results also indicate that concentration has a direct and indirect effect on financial stability during crisis periods, but no direct effect on financial stability during normal periods." .

Using Spain as an example I find that neither GDP Granger-causes informality nor informality Granger-causes GDP. If at all, GDP and informality only weakly respond to shocks of the other variable. The formal and informal economies in Spain seem to be rather independent arenas for economic exchange." .

We extend the empirical literature on the impact of sudden stops on GDP by proposing an alternative econometric approach which is multivariate, nonlinear and uses a novel way to identify sudden stops. We estimate a Markov switching vector autoregression with a latent variable indicating whether the economy is in a sudden stop regime. We use the maximum fraction of forecast error variance approach for partial structural identification of the vector autoregression model. Beyond confirming findings from the existing empirical literature on sudden stops, our results additionally show that (i) sudden stops are associated with regime switches (i.e., breaks in the behavior of economic variables), which have significantly negative and permanent effects on GDP; (ii) impulse responses to net capital inflow shocks are regime dependent with economies being more vulnerable to shocks during the sudden stop regime; and (iii) there were different main drivers of the output decline in historical sudden stop episodes." .

A cultural norm that determines the contemptibility of tax dodging practices links the past incidence of tax evasion with the tax payers’ current incentives to conceal sources of income. This dynamic complementarity may lead to multiple equilibria in the evolution of tax evasion. Due to the latter’s effect on capital accumulation, this multiplicity may lead economies in divergent development paths, as long as they differ in the initial magnitude of tax evasion. This happens even though economies may be, on the outset, identical in terms of capital stock and structural characteristics, including those that govern tax enforcement." .

To achieve this, we use a univariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to capture the volatility characteristics of freight derivative returns and apply time-varying copula models to describe the nonlinear dependence between returns of spot and freight derivatives. Using quotes of spot freight rate and forward freight agreement (FFA) in the tanker market from January 3, 2006 to December 23, 2011, we derive the minimum VaR hedge ratios. Our main findings are as follows: First, we found significant evidence for the presence of volatility persistence in freight rate returns. Second, for dependence, we suggested that a time-varying t-copula performs best in describing how returns of spot freight rates relate to 1-month FFA returns, whereas a time-varying Gumbel copula performs much better for the description of nonlinear dependence between returns of spot freight rates and 2 and 3-month FFA returns. Third, the derived hedge ratios are associated with shipowners’ risk preferences and freight rate dynamics, which have important implications for shipowners in determining the optimal number of FFA contracts. The results provide some insights into the modeling of freight derivatives for risk management." .

Evidence from a nationwide survey of private firms across China suggests that both regulatory uncertainty and market uncertainty in a transition economy motivate firms to conduct corporate giving. Further, a firm’s political ties and financial performance alleviate its response to environment pressures. Specifically, both political ties and financial performance reduce the impact of regulatory uncertainty on both giving probability and amount, but neither affects market uncertainty’s impact. This study illustrates the role of environmental uncertainty in driving corporate social behavior among Chinese private firms, and provides valuable insights for corporate giving in other transition economies." .

I argue institutions do not cause growth, but institutional change does. I expound a theoretical model where the circulation of elites entails endogenous institutional change and growth. I prove a generation taken in isolation can increase its welfare by a unilateral reduction in institutional change, in societies where groups that compete for accession to the ruling class are relatively smaller in size; and by a move to more, in societies where those groups are relatively larger. I prove the former are dynamically efficient societies; and the latter, dynamically inefficient." .

This paper deals with both, expectations and uncertainty derived from the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters. Given the strong turbulences that the euro area macroeconomic indicators observe since 2007, the aim of the paper is to check whether there is any room for improvement of the consensus forecast accuracy for GDP growth and inflation when accounting for uncertainty. We propose a new measure of uncertainty, alternative to the ad hoc equal weights commonly used, based on principal components. We test the role of uncertainty in forecasting macroeconomic performance in the euro area between 2005 and 2015. We also check the role of surprises in the considered forecasting sample." .

Further, not only is it the level of inflation persistence that is important in economic analyses, but also the question of whether the persistence varies over time, for instance, across business cycle phases, is equally pertinent, since assuming constant persistence across states of the economy is sure to lead to misguided policy decisions. Against this backdrop, we extend the literature on long-memory models of inflation persistence for the US economy over the monthly period of 1920:1–2014:5, by developing an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model with a time-varying memory coefficient which varies across expansions and recessions. In sum, we find that inflation persistence does vary across recessions and expansions, with it being significantly higher in the former than in the latter. As an aside, we also show that persistence of inflation volatility is higher during expansions than in recessions. Understandably, our results have important policy implications." .

Australian consumers, on average, allocate about two-thirds of their income on food, housing, transport and recreation. We considered three demand models, the AIDS, Rotterdam and CBS demand systems, for estimation. The estimated income elasticities reveal that food, alcohol and tobacco, housing and medical care are necessities.

We analyze the underlying factors and investment/innovation behavior of individual firms in the German iron and steel industry to better understand barriers and drivers for technological change. The paper gives insights on the decision-making process on energy efficiency in firms and helps to understand how policy affects decision-making. We use a mixed method approach. First, we analyze the diffusion of three energy-efficient technologies (EET) for primary steelmaking from their introduction until today (top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT), basic oxygen furnace gas recovery (BOFGR), and pulverized coal injection (PCI)). We derive the uptake of these technologies both at the national level and at the level of the individual firm. Second, we analyze the impact of drivers and barriers on the decision-making process of individual firms whether or not they want to implement these technologies. Economics and access to capital are the foremost barriers to the uptake of an EET. If the expected payback period exceeds a certain value or if the company lacks capital, investments in EET seem not to happen. But even if an EET is economically viable and the company has access to capital, investments in EET might not be realized. Policy-induced prices might have strengthened the recent diffusion of TRT. We found indications that in a limited number of cases, policy intervention was a driving factor. Technical risks and imperfect information are only marginal factors in our cases. Site-specific factors seem to be important, as site-specific factors shape the economics of the selected EET." .

These indicators were aggregated into a composite indicator or index through a multiple layer data envelopment analysis (DEA) composite indicator model, which looks for the optimum combination of indicators’ weights for each decision‐making unit, in this case 27 Brazilian states. The index score represents the road safety performance, based on which a ranking of states can be made. Since such a model has never been applied for road safety evaluation in Brazil, its parameters were calibrated based on the experience of more consolidated European Union research in ranking its member countries using DEA techniques. Secondly, cluster analysis was conducted aiming to provide more realistic performance comparisons and, finally, the sensitivity of the results was measured through a bootstrapping method application. It can be concluded that by combining fatality indicators, defining clusters and applying bootstrapping procedures a trustworthy ranking can be created, which is valuable for nationwide road safety planning." .

In particular, we found that low productivity in agriculture relative to that of the economy as a whole (i.e., dualism) and inflation were significant contributing factors to income inequality.

However, efficiency of these interventions remains a concern. Cost-utility analysis, representing health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), is a type of economic evaluation that has widely been recommended in assessing efficiency of health interventions. However, certain limitations in using QALYs remain specifically difficult in QALYs estimation. This study estimates the long-term QALYs gain from reversing childhood obesity in Thailand. MethodsAn economic model was developed to estimate long-term QALYs of the youth aged 3–18 for the BMI status in childhood, which were categorized into three groups: normal weight, overweight, and obese. Long-term QALYs were estimated between ages 35 and 100, according to children’s age, sex, and BMI status. Differences in QALYs between BMI status groups were calculated to represent the QALYs gain for youth from reversing obesity and overweight. The future outcomes were discounted at 3 % per annum in the base-case analysis; the discount rates of 0, 1.5, 3.5, and 5 % were also applied in the sensitivity analyses. ResultsQALYs gained from reversing childhood obesity increase with age, starting from 0.040 and 0.083 QALYs at age 3 to 0.590 and 0.553 QALYs at age 18 in boys and girls, respectively. Reversing overweight and obesity in girls produces more QALYs than in boys between ages 3 and 17. ConclusionsEfficiency is an important issue in allocating public healthcare resources to maximize social benefits. The results of this study facilitate long-term QALYs estimation with respect to BMI status in childhood, which could encourage more routine economic evaluation of child obesity interventions and maximize their health benefits." .

The analysis synthesizes results from the RoSE multi-model study aiming to identify robust and sensitive features of mitigation pathways under these inherently uncertain drivers of energy and emissions developments. Based on an integrated assessment model comparison exercise, we show that economic growth and fossil resource assumptions substantially affect baseline developments, but in no case they lead to the significant greenhouse gas emission reduction that would be needed to achieve long-term climate targets without dedicated climate policy. The influence of economic growth and fossil resource assumptions on climate mitigation pathways is relatively small due to overriding requirements imposed by long-term climate targets. While baseline assumptions can have substantial effects on mitigation costs and carbon prices, we find that the effects of model differences and the stringency of the climate target are larger compared to that of baseline assumptions. We conclude that inherent uncertainties about socio-economic determinants like economic growth and fossil resource availability can be effectively dealt with in the assessment of mitigation pathways." .

Households in resource-based economies allocate their time and other factors between resource extraction and other activities. As a result, factors may shift from one sector to another as marginal returns change. This has two important implications. First, it implies potentially strong linkages between resource and non-resource sectors. Second, it means that unmanaged resources cause inefficient allocations of inputs across all sectors, and the effects of resource management spill into other sectors. We construct a local general equilibrium model that accounts for inputs that over-allocate to an open access resource and create a general equilibrium tragedy of the commons. This model describes resource rent dissipation more adequately in economies with mobile factors than a model with slowly dissipating rents. Perfectly mobile factors dissipate rent in every period, but endogenous wages cause labor and capital allocations to change with the resource stock. We use the model to illustrate medium-run impacts of a limit on capital in an artisanal fishery in Honduras. Simulation results reveal that fishery management has economy-wide impacts on prices and wages. Managers in developing countries thus should consider these linkages when implementing policies to conserve fish stocks." .

In this study, we combine longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on local area unemployment rates to examine the relationship between adverse labor market conditions and mothers’ experiences of abusive behavior between 2001 and 2010. Unemployment and economic hardship at the household level were positively related to abusive behavior. Further, rapid increases in the unemployment rate increased men’s controlling behavior toward romantic partners even after we adjust for unemployment and economic distress at the household level. We interpret these findings as demonstrating that the uncertainty and anticipatory anxiety that go along with sudden macroeconomic downturns have negative effects on relationship quality, above and beyond the effects of job loss and material hardship." .

A retailer can postpone order placement to obtain a better demand forecast with a shorter supply lead time. However, the manufacturer would charge the retailer a higher cost for a shorter lead time and set restrictions on the ordering times and quantities. This prevents retailers from taking full advantage of demand forecast updating to improve profits. In studying the manufacturer-related effects, two supply modes are investigated: supply mode A, which has a limited ordering time scale, and supply mode B, which has a decreasing maximum ordering quantity. For supply mode A, it is proven under justifiable assumptions that a retailer should order either as early or as late as possible. For supply mode B, an algorithm is proposed to simplify the ordering policy by appropriately relaxing the ordering quantity restrictions. Numerical analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of product and demand parameters on the value of demand forecast updating in the two supply modes. A comparison of the different supply scenarios demonstrates the negative effects of increased purchasing cost and ordering time and quantity restrictions when demand forecast updating is implemented." .

Although many important theoretical models require the real interest rates to be stationary, the empirical evidence accumulated so far has not been able to provide conclusive evidence on the mean reverting dynamics of this variable. To resolve this puzzle we re-investigate the stochastic nature of the real interest rates by developing unit root tests for nonlinear heterogeneous panels where the alternative hypothesis allows for a smooth transition between deterministic linear trends around which stationary asymmetric adjustment may occur. When the newly developed panel unit root tests are applied to the real interest rates of the 17 OECD countries, we were able to uncover overwhelming empirical support in favor of mean reversion in the short-run and long-run real interest rates. Therefore, these results show that the conclusions drawn from a miss-specified test that ignores the presence of either nonlinearity, structural breaks or cross sectional dependence can give quite misleading results about the stochastic behavior of the real interest rates." .

Firms experience random productivity shocks after factor employment. A cap-and-trade regulation controls pollution emissions. Trade in emission permits entails transactions costs. Under proportional permit trading costs, the equilibrium depends on total per unit trading cost; its incidence between buyers and sellers does not matter. Under fixed trading costs, both buyers’ and sellers’ costs matter. Under proportional costs, permit trade always occurs when total trading costs are below net trade surplus. If these costs are sufficiently low, the production–emission outcome is as under costless trade with full utilization of production capacity and emission permits. With fixed costs, trade occurs if costs are sufficiently low, but production capacity and emissions permits are never fully utilized. Under proportional costs, trade is impeded most when the emission cap is either relatively high or low. There exists a nonmonotonic relationship between the emissions cap and a lower bound for trading costs that obstructs trade. Under fixed costs, a similar relationship holds only if the output variance is scale independent. Under proportional costs, capacity utilization decreases with output variance; the result is the opposite under fixed costs." .

ObjectiveWe assess the impact of household size on decisions to enroll in CBHI and demonstrate how to correct for group disparity in scale (i.e. variance differences). MethodsA discrete choice experiment was conducted across five CBHI attributes. Preferences were elicited through forced-choice paired comparison choice tasks designed based on D-efficiency. Differences in preferences were examined between small (1–4 family members) and large (5–12 members) households using conditional logistic regression. Swait and Louviere test was used to identify and correct for differences in scale. ResultsOne-hundred and sixty households were surveyed in Northwest Cambodia. Increased insurance premium was associated with disutility [odds ratio (OR) 0.61, p < 0.01], while significant increase in utility was noted for higher hospital fee coverage (OR 10.58, p < 0.01), greater coverage of travel and meal costs (OR 4.08, p < 0.01), and more frequent communication with the insurer (OR 1.33, p < 0.01). While the magnitude of preference for hospital fee coverage appeared larger for the large household group (OR 14.15) compared to the small household group (OR 8.58), differences in scale were observed (p < 0.05). After adjusting for scale (k, ratio of scale between large to small household groups = 1.227, 95 % confidence interval 1.002–1.515), preference differences by household size became negligible. ConclusionDifferences in stated preferences may be due to scale, or variance differences between groups, rather than true variations in preference. Coverage of hospital fees, travel and meal costs are given significant weight in CBHI enrollment decisions regardless of household size. Understanding how community members make decisions about health insurance can inform low- and middle-income countries’ paths towards universal health coverage." .

The long-term loss of younger individuals has in many ways “drained” the labor market and the economic market power of rural areas. This is the context of our research: the locational choice of university graduates from an urban–rural perspective. Using micro data covering the entire Swedish population, we identify all university graduates from the year 2001. We analyze them with respect to whether they live in a rural or urban region before starting university and where they live after graduation at two points in time: 5 and 10 years. We use a series of multinomial logit regressions to determine what factors affect their short-term and long-term choices of location. We find that having children is one of the most influential factors for moving back home after graduation, irrespective of type of region.

Perhaps more importantly, we show that, independently of whether the equilibrium is convergent or divergent, there are three predominant effects on equilibrium tax rates: the group-size effect (the larger an income group, the larger its influence on equilibrium tax rate), the income effect (poor voters are more responsive to a redistributive transfer) and the within-group homogeneity effect (the degree to which voters of the same income group have similar non-economic characteristics). The latter drags redistribution toward the preferred level of redistribution of the less “divided”—in terms of non-economic characteristics—income group and may dominate over the other two." .

(J Econom 44(1):215–238, 1990) parametric seasonal unit root test to test for cyclical non-stationarity in commodity prices. The testing procedure is simple and involves evaluating various linear restrictions on lagged price levels in an error correction model of prices, equivalent to the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test. Unit root behaviour at low frequencies implies cyclical non-stationarity. In our empirical application, we fail to reject unit roots at frequencies associated with 3- to 5-year-long price cycles for 7 of 16 major commodities. Our results suggest that longer cycles in many commodity prices are highly stochastic, and care should be taken when interpreting the regularity and out-of-sample predictability of such cycles using historical price movements." .

Reasons to limit economic coercion include protecting minorities and preventing disenfranchised groups from engaging in socially costly behavior, or political economy considerations. If consumers are fully rational, we show that limiting coercion is equivalent to placing more welfare weight on coerced consumers at the expense of others. If, however, consumers’ rationality is bounded, counterfactual utility becomes endogenous to current policy, and the welfare loss associated with limiting coercion increases. We set up a numerical version of our model and find that the bias-related welfare loss can be substantial." .

Typically, such evidence is gathered by studying experience as it accumulates within subjects over time. We examine a new question; whether behaviors associated with experience can be transferred directly to new market participants. Specifically, we study the intergenerational transmission of information, including direct advice, in experimental asset markets. Empirical results suggest that advice is a substitute for experience. Prices in sessions with advised traders shift towards fundamentals—a pattern consonant with prior work exploring the impact of own-experience on pricing dynamics. Further, convergence is observed in mixed-markets where only a subset of traders are advised." .

Endogenous worker-firm matching could also account for such wage differences. This hypothesis is tested thanks to linked employer-employee data on the French private sector between 1995 and 2011. Childbirth penalties are estimated for women and for men from hourly wage equations including firm- and worker-fixed effects on top of usual measures of human capital. Though worker-firm matching explains none of the motherhood wage penalty, it plays a role in the case of fathers who do not experience any wage loss after childbirth, but do not enjoy any premium either; there is evidence of an erosion of this premium since the end of the 1990s. In a counterfactual where women do not incur any penalty after childbirth, the gender gap still amounts to 2/3 of the one that currently prevails." .

The estimation results of the dynamic linear logit model reveal that the dynamic adjustment in the input demand system is very sluggish. In addition, the estimation results show that an increase in gasoline output no longer raises the share of ethanol after imposing the mandated percentage standard for ethanol. The estimated price elasticities of input demand offer statistical evidence that ethanol demand is less responsive to crude oil prices in the post-ethanol-mandate period than in the pre-ethanol-mandate period. The decompositions of cross-price elasticities strongly support that the reduced elasticities of ethanol demand with respect to the price of crude oil are more attributable to the mandated percentage standard for ethanol rather than the relative price of ethanol to crude oil." .

The employment benefits of export orientation are also modest even in “comparative advantage” industries of developing countries. However, diversifying the export basket contributes significantly to employment growth, particularly in the medium- and high-technology industries. Import competition does not undermine employment growth in low-technology industries of developing countries while it displaces jobs in the same industries in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and transition economies. For developing countries, import-induced job losses are higher in the more capital-intensive medium-technology industries. Jobs in high-technology industries are less sensitive to imports with positive relationships observed in the OECD. Investment also complements job creation in low-technology industries of developing countries that have yet to industrialize. JEL codes: J21, L60, O14, O25" .

The primary analysis uses statistical data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations which has been re-categorized according to species groups established by the European Aquaculture Technology and Innovation Platform (EATiP) and by culture system type using expert knowledge. Additional data sources for the analysis include the European Market Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products (EUMOFA) and the European Commission Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. EU aquaculture production was 1.34 million tonnes in 2012 with a first sale value of €4.76 billion. Shellfish comprised 45 % by volume and 28 % by value; marine fish 30 % by volume and 53 % by value; and freshwater fish 25 % by volume and 19 % by value. The total production volume has actually fallen slightly from 1.4 million tonnes in 2000, whilst the value has increased significantly from 2.79 billion in 2000, mainly due to a growth in Atlantic salmon production. Five countries accounted for around 78 % of the direct output value of EU aquaculture in 2012, the UK, France, Greece, Italy and Spain. Around 50 % of the direct output value was generated using marine cage systems (28 % by volume), whilst less than 3 % of value was generated in recirculated aquaculture systems (<1.5 % by volume). Around 5 % of value was contributed by extensive to semi-intensive inland and coastal pond systems. STECF (2014) estimates there are between 14,000 and 15,000 aquaculture enterprises in the EU employing around 80,000 people, approximately 40,000 full-time equivalent (FTE). The greatest number of jobs (FTE) is provided by the freshwater pond and suspended shellfish sectors due to much lower productivity figures. This could be seen as a social benefit in rural and coastal regions, but corresponding low wages could also discourage young entrants to the industry and lead to dependency on migrant workers. Where efficiencies can be improved through capital investment there is likely to be significant scope for consolidation of ownership as can be observed in the marine fish sector. The output from aquaculture has to find a place within the wider fish and seafood market where volumes are generally inversely related to price. The potential growth of the sector is therefore constrained both in relation to the overall market and with respect to competition from substitute products. These include product from EU capture fisheries as well as imports from third countries (sourced from aquaculture and capture fisheries). Whilst interactions between individual products can be hard to demonstrate, any increase in production costs is likely to lead to lower output volumes, whilst improvements in production efficiency can lead to increased output volumes. With around 60 % of EU fish and seafood supply obtained through imports, and little prospect of increasing outputs from capture fisheries, EU policy is generally supportive of sustainable aquaculture development for reasons of food security and economic development. The underlying basis for this is maximizing the quality and health benefits of farmed products, whilst improving resource efficiency and minimizing impacts. This is expressed through funding support for research and technological development and structural funds to the fisheries and aquaculture industries. However, constraints to growth also exist in the form of regulatory barriers and costs that reduce industry competitiveness. Changing market requirements are also a factor. Prospects for growth have been assessed using the results of EATiP stakeholder workshops combined with the analysis of the sector by system type. These suggest an overall increase in production by 55 % is possible by 2030 based mainly on expansion of marine cage-based farming using larger systems in more exposed sites and similarly shellfish farming using larger-scale suspended systems. Expansion of recirculated aquaculture systems appears likely based on entrepreneurial and European policy for research and technological development activity, although constrained by currently low competitiveness." .

For the resulting non-equivalence of priors, an appropriate commodity-price space is introduced. Agents are heterogeneous in the size of captured ambiguity, endowment and preference for risk and ambiguity. Preferences are of variational type à la Maccheroni et al. (Econometrica 74(6):1447–1498, 2006). One important implication involves a problematic aspect of linear equilibrium price systems. Positive payoffs are for free on events outside the domain of the representing equilibrium pricing measure. Moreover, when aggregate risk is present and aggregate ambiguity is absent, the insurance properties of optimal allocations depend on the notion of ambiguity-free payoffs." .

The least advantaged in society experience a greater burden of mental illness, but inequalities in mental health vary by social, political, and economic contexts. This study investigates whether spending on different types of social protection alters the extent of social inequality in depressive symptoms. MethodsData were obtained from the 2006 and 2012 cross-sectional waves of the European Social Survey, which included 48,397 individuals from 18 European countries. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D 8). Statistical interactions between country-level social protection spending and individuals’ education level, employment and family status were explored using multilevel regression models. ResultsHigher spending on active labour market programmes was related to narrower inequality in depressive symptoms by education level. Compared to men with high education, the marginal effect of having low education was 1.67 (95 % CI, 1.46–1.87) among men in countries with lower spending and 0.85 (95 % CI, 0.66–1.03) in higher spending countries. Single parents exhibited fewer depressive symptoms, as spending on family policies increased. Little evidence was found for an overall association between spending on unemployment benefits and employment-related inequalities in depressive symptoms, but in 2012, unemployment spending appeared beneficial to mental health among the unemployed. ConclusionsGreater investment in social protection may act to reduce inequalities in depressive symptoms. Reductions in spending levels or increased conditionality may adversely affect the mental health of disadvantaged social groups." .

MethodsA systematic review was performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, using relevant terminology and included articles published from 1 January, 2013 to 30 June, 2016. We included observational studies where the primary outcomes included FT and study samples were greater than 200. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. ResultsFrom 417 citations, a total of 25 studies were included in this review. Seventy outcomes of FT were reported with 47 covering monetary, objective and subjective indicators of FT. A total of 28–48% of patients reported FT using monetary measures and 16–73% using subjective measures. The most commonly reported factors associated with FT were: being female, younger age, low income at baseline, adjuvant therapies and more recent diagnosis. Relative to non-cancer comparison groups, cancer survivors experienced significantly higher FT. Most studies were cross-sectional and causal inferences between FT and determinants were not possible. Measures of FT were varied and most were not validated, while monetary values of out-of-pocket expenses included different cost components across studies. ConclusionsA substantial proportion of cancer survivors experience financial hardship irrespective of how it is measured. Using standardised outcomes and longitudinal designs to measure FT would improve determination of the extent of FT. Further research is recommended on reduced work participation and income losses occurring concurrently with FT and on the impacts on treatment non-adherence." .

Trade credit insurance, as one of the most important risk management tools, has been widely used in companies’ daily operation. In this study, the manufacturer who allows customers to delay payment for goods already delivered purchases trade credit insurance to transfer and reduce non‐payment risk and borrows money from a bank to accommodate the capital constraint problem. The Stackelberg game and loss‐averse theory are used to establish a newsboy model including trade credit insurance, and the optimal insurance coverage and total sales of the manufacturer are thereby investigated. Subsequently, the interest rate decision of the bank under different risk‐averse situations is also characterized. We find that the interest rate set by a loss‐averse bank is equal to or greater than that given by a risk‐neutral bank. The use of trade credit insurance can help the manufacturer expand sales and dramatically reduce its default risk. Both the bank and the manufacturer are better off due to the use of trade credit insurance, but contrary to what one might expect, the bank prefers giving a higher interest rate to the manufacturer when the premium rate is in a reasonable region, which indicates that the manufacturer cannot use the insurance to negotiate better financing terms." .

Against this backdrop, the present paper seeks to evaluate the performance of 15 general insurance companies for the period 2009–2010 to 2013–2014 using a two stage approach. In the first stage, the study uses the dynamic DEA model suggested by Tone and Tsutsui (Omega, 38(3–4):145–156, 2010) to evaluate the in-sample companies in terms of slacks based measure of technical efficiency. In the second stage, the efficiency scores have been explained by solvency performance of the insurers in terms of a panel data censored regression model with robust residuals. The results indicate a very strong association between efficiency and solvency." .

In the case of deterministic demand and constant marginal cost, reducing a price cap yields increased total output, consumer welfare, and total welfare, results consistent with those for oligopoly markets with a fixed number of firms. With deterministic demand and increasing marginal cost, these comparative static results may be fully reversed, and a welfare-improving cap may not exist. Recent results in the literature show that for a fixed number of firms, if demand is stochastic and marginal cost is constant, then lowering a price cap may either increase or decrease output and welfare (locally); however, a welfare-improving price cap does exist. In contrast to these recent results, we show that a welfare-improving cap may not exist if entry is endogenous. However, within this stochastic demand environment we show that certain restrictions on the curvature of demand are sufficient to ensure the existence of a welfare-improving cap when entry is endogenous." .

This is the first study to combine the case-resampling bootstrap method with the coskewness and cokurtosis test. Thus the new method works well on data with a non-normal distribution or non-constant variance. Additional channels of contagion may also be detected to reflect a more precise pattern of contagion. In contrast to Hatemi-J and Hacker, Applied Financial Economics Letters, 1(6), 343-347 (2005)‘s result, we find that the case-resampling bootstrap method diminishes the overall effect of contagion. In particular, no additional channels of contagion can be found when the case-resampling bootstrap method is applied on the coskewness test, but when the case-resampling bootstrap method is applied on the cokurtosis test, additional channels of contagion are detected. Furthermore, the overall effect of contagion is greater on the general equity markets than on the securitized real estate markets. This study has useful implications to investors, regulators and policy makers." .

This approach is motivated by models of institutional change drawn from the political science literature which focus on the existence of both fast-moving and slow-moving institutional changes and the interactions between them as drivers of the dynamics of asset prices. As a methodological contribution, we use several time-varying parameter models for the first time in investigations of institutional change. Our findings support the existence of both structural breaks and continuous variance in parameters. This contributes to our understanding of the housing market in two respects. Firstly, the dates of structural breaks appear to better match unexpected market shocks rather than remarkable political events, and this supports prior institutional theory. Secondly, assessment of the effect of slow-moving institutional changes shows that people’s biased expectations rather than the economic fundamentals have increasingly played an important role in driving housing prices in the short run although fundamentals continue to drive house prices to converge to their long-run equilibrium." .

What kind of risks derive from the use of robots? Are there any differences between insuring a robot and another product? And finally, who should bear the burden of paying the insurance premium? The objective of this article is to provide the reader with an overview on the issue of risk management of robotic applications through insurance contracts. Indeed, insurance products are essential for an effective technology transfer from research to market. As of today, the production, use and diffusion of robots, determines risks that can hardly be identified and assessed both with respect to the probability of their occurrence and to the consequences they might bring about. Thence, innovation causes existing insurance products to be inadequate, and often times, it leaves insurance companies in the complex position of needing to elaborate new solutions in the absence of complete information. This article discusses the reasons for those hindrances and identifies the essential issues that lawyers, economists and engineers need to address in their future research in order to overcome current limitations and ultimately develop efficient and adequate risk management tools." .

While research on national and regional SAM has become common, examples of interregional SAM are rare currently. This study points out that there is a substantial need to build a small regional and interregional SAM because of economic sensitivity. Our work evaluates the economic effects of national and regional government behavior, such as changes of the local tax system and decentralization of power, on the regional economy by structural path analysis. This research finds the differential impact flows of local government expenditures to regional incomes between a remote area and the rest of Japan (ROJ), or the leakages of remote area’s money to ROJ via property income." .

ETST determines and optimizes the matching issue between the sets of online orders generated by the e-commerce platform and the sets of transport vehicles supplied by logistics service providers. We first establish a framework for formulating ETST problem with the consideration of its characteristics. We then apply the framework for developing a cost minimization model to optimize the assignment of B2B online orders and vehicles. A full-factorial simulation experiment is proposed to investigate the effects of factors on the performance indexes such as the total logistics cost per unit, the type of the vehicle required, and the number of the vehicle in use. The results show that the vehicle cost and order characteristics (ratio of weight and volume) significantly impact the vehicle assignment in terms of the vehicle type and vehicle quantity. We also find that the ratio of different vehicles is significantly affected by demand fluctuations and holding cost." .

Based on the hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve, the analyses include survey measures from Consensus Economics to compare inflation dynamics across Euro Area member countries. Particular focus is set on the choice of suitable measures of real marginal cost. In addition to the well-known output gap, the role of finance-neutral output gaps and unemployment gaps is examined. Throughout the analyses, price setting is found to be largely backward-looking, but with a decreasing trend over time. Countries’ varying sensitivity to the different measures of real marginal cost is highlighted, which may indicate persistent heterogeneity in Euro Area inflation dynamics. With the onset of the financial crisis, finance-neutral output gaps outperform alternative measures of real marginal cost." .

As in former research, we show that workers tend at the same time to agglomerate in order to limit trade costs of manufactured goods and to scatter in order to alleviate the burden of urban costs due to large urban areas. In this paper, special attention is paid to the role of congestion, which acts as a dispersion force and hampers workers from agglomerating in the same urban area. We show that the development of public transport, or the construction of road infrastructure, modifies the spatial organization of the economy and fosters agglomeration, as it reduces congestion." .

To this end, the principal ingredient for obtaining a reliable crude oil confidence interval is its volatility. Moreover, accurate crude oil volatility estimation has fundamental implications in terms of risk management, asset pricing and portfolio handling. Generally, current studies consider volatility models based on lagged crude oil price realizations and, at most, one additional macroeconomic variable as crude oil determinant. This paper aims to fill this gap, jointly considering not only traditional crude oil driving forces, such as the aggregate demand and oil supply, but also the monetary policy rate. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the debate concerning the potential impact of (lagged) US monetary policy as well as the other crude oil future price (COFP) determinants on daily COFP volatility. By means of the recently proposed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling model, different proxies of the US monetary policy alongside US industrial production (proxy of the US aggregate demand) and oil supply are included in the COFP volatility equation. Strong evidence that an expansionary (restrictive) variation in monetary policy anticipates a positive (negative) variation in COFP volatility is found. We also find that a negative (positive) variation of industrial production increases (decreases) COFP volatility. This means that volatility behaves counter-cyclically, according to the literature. Furthermore, the out-of-sample forecasting procedure shows that including these additional macroeconomic variables generally improves the forecasting performance." .

It appears that institutional shareholdings—either financial or non-financial corporations—are associated with poor performance, whereas the foreign and domestic private ownerships lead to an improvement in the performance of the firms. We observe that unwinding the cross-shareholding between banks and corporations and mutual transfers among non-financial institutions allows for efficiency gain. Furthermore, the ownership transfer to private and foreign individuals is consistently associated with high market value, which implies that individuals’ transfers lead to an increase in efficiency." .

For 12 of 24 countries in the sample, the three tests yield uniform results in terms of causality presence (absence) and direction. Causality running from credit depth to economic growth is found for the UK, Australia, Switzerland, and Greece. The findings lend no support to the view that financial development shifts from a supply-leading to demand-following pattern as economic development proceeds. The aggregate results mesh well with the current discussion on “too much finance” and disintermediation effects. However, idiosyncratic country determinants also appear significant." .

In contrast, the income effect of public capital stock is negative. The state-specific coefficients indicate that this effect likely stems from the negative elasticity of income with respect to public capital in the states located primarily in the Snow Belt region." .

However, evidence for the most recent years is still scant, and studies considering the role of intangible assets in the enlarged European Union are virtually nonexistent. This article focuses on the convergence patterns of income per capita in 260 European regions during the period 2000–2011. Following the distribution dynamics approach, the role of a set of intangible assets is considered by introducing several conditioning schemes. In line with previous contributions the results suggest that the distribution of income is bimodal. The regional stocks of the different intangible assets considered have some power for explaining convergence tendencies in the studied period." .

This is obtained by decomposing financial time series into simple oscillations associated with distinct time-scales. We propose two new time-varying measures of complexity: 1) an amplitude scaling exponent and 2) an entropy-like measure. We apply these measures to intraday, 30-second sampled prices of various stock market indices. Our results reveal intraday trends where different time-horizons contribute with variable relative amplitudes over the course of the trading day. Our findings indicate that the time series we analysed have a non-stationary multifractal nature with predominantly persistent behaviour at the middle of the trading session and anti-persistent behaviour at the opening and at the closing of the session. We demonstrate that these patterns are statistically significant, robust, reproducible and characteristic of each stock market. We argue that any modelling, analytics or trading strategy must take into account these non-stationary intraday scaling patterns." .

Thus it is not clear if absolute PPP holds in the long run between the U.S. and Mexico. Given that relative PPP is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for absolute PPP to hold, this study tests the relationship between the change in the log of the exchange rate, and the changes in the log of the U.S. producer price index (PPI) and the Mexican PPI. Here, the absence of relative PPP would indicate that absolute PPP could not hold. Given that all the relevant variables in first difference log are stationary, PPP in its relative form holds and OLS can be applied directly in a VAR model setting, viz., treating all variables initially as potentially endogenous. The estimates indicate one-way Granger causality from the percentage change in the exchange rate to the percentage change in the Mexican price level, which is not an implausible result for an emerging nation such as Mexico which imports a significant fraction of (dollar denominated) intermediate products and capital inputs." .

To provide empirical evidence for this, we present the land price change related to the Japanese government’s report on the damage of catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis whose probability of occurrence is extremely low. While this relationship has been studied in previous research, there are some notable shortcomings. Firstly, the control of the attributes between the treatment group, namely the land in the area where information is updated, and the control group is insufficient. Secondly, the link between rational behavior and the estimation result is not established enough. This study addresses these two points and updates the findings in this regard. We find that the estimated results presented herein match those proposed by previous works, confirming that the established link between the data and rational behavior suggests the importance of accounting for such catastrophic events even if their probability of occurrence is extremely low." .

It also reviews the procedure developed by Sato (Econ Stud Q 34:97–109, 1983) which achieves aggregate correct revelation in the sense that the sum of the Nash equilibrium strategies always coincides with the aggregate value of the correct marginal rates of substitution. The procedure named the Generalized MDP Procedure can possess other desirable properties shared by continuous-time locally strategy proof planning procedures, i.e., feasibility, monotonicity and Pareto efficiency. Under myopia assumption, each player’s dominant strategy in the local incentive game associated at any iteration of the procedure is proved to reveal his/her marginal rate of substitution for a public good. In connection with the Generalized MDP Procedure, this paper analyzes the structure of the locally strategy proof procedures as algorithms and game forms. An alternative characterization theorem of locally strategy proof procedures is given by making use of the new condition, transfer independence. A measure of incentives is proposed to show that the exponent attached to the decision function of public good is characterized. A Piecewise Nonlinearized MDP Procedure is presented, which is coalitionally locally strategy proof. Equivalence between price-guided and quantity-guided procedures is also discussed." .

Our conditions for the existence of Pareto optima can be interpreted as a requirement of impatience in the first context and of some pessimism or not unrealistic optimism in the second context. A non-existence example is provided when, in the second context, some DM is too optimistic. We furthermore show that at an individually rational Pareto optimum at most one strictly optimistic DM will avoid ruin at each state or date. Considering a risky context, this entails that even if risk averters will share risk in a comonotonic way as usual, at most one classical strong risk lover will avoid ruin at each state or date. Finally, some examples illustrate circumstances when a risk averter could take advantage of sharing risk with a risk lover rather than with a risk averter." .

Three types of farming—field crop, dairy and beef cattle—are considered. Comparison of efficiency across periods indicates a significant reduction in efficiency in the period following the first CAP reform (1992 MacSharry reform) but an improvement in efficiency change. Econometric results related to the effect of subsidies on efficiency scores (with fixed effect models) and productivity change indices (with ordinary least squares) give ambiguous findings. The effect of a particular type of subsidy was found to be negative or positive depending on the sample’s production orientation and on the performance considered.

Alternative competing models employed in the study include Bayesian autoregressions (BARs) and time-varying parameter VARs with stochastic volatility, among others. The empirical results reveal that, overall, medium-scale BVARs enriched with economy-wide variables can considerably and consistently improve short-term inflation forecasts. The information content of financial variables, on the other hand, proves to be beneficial for the lending rate density forecasts across forecasting horizons. Both of the above-mentioned results are robust to alternative specification choices, while for the rest of the variables smaller-scale BVARs, or even univariate BARs, produce superior forecasts. Finally, we find that the popular, data-driven, shrinkage methods produce, on average, inferior forecasts compared to the theoretically grounded method considered here." .

Eligible participants will be aged 16 or over, and are those who have been invited to screening appointments annually, but who have not attended, or telephoned to rearrange an appointment, within the last 24 months.Eligible participants will be randomized to one of three conditions:1.Control condition (usual invitation letter)2.Fixed incentive condition (usual invitation letter, including a voucher for £10 if they attend their appointment)3.Probabilistic incentive condition (invitation letter, including a voucher for a 1 in 100 chance of winning £1000 if they attend their appointment). Participants will be sent invitation letters, and the primary outcome will be whether or not they attend their appointment. One thousand participants will be included in total, randomized with a ratio of 1.4:1:1. In order to test whether the incentive scheme has a differential impact on patients from different demographic or socio-economic groups, information will be recorded on age, gender, distance from screening center, socio-economic status and length of time since they were last screened. A cost-effectiveness analysis will also be performed. DiscussionThis study will be the first trial of financial incentives for improving uptake of diabetic eye screening. If effective, the intervention may suggest a cost-effective way to increase screening rates, thus reducing unnecessary blindness. Trial registration ISRCTN14896403, 25 February 2016" .

The Bankscope database for the period from 1996 to 2011 was used in the research. The ordered probit models show that inclusion of macroeconomic variables as well as the regional dummies improve their explanatory power. Moreover, the significance of the time dummies allowed us to conclude that rating agencies do change their grade when an economy operates on the different business cycle stages. Furthermore, the conclusions of a conservative nature of Standard & Poor’s ratings and overvalued Moody’s grades compared to the rating agency Fitch were performed. The models were checked for the in-sample and out-of-sample fit including distributional comparisons across agencies. The obtained model was classified as practically useful, as it gave 31 % of precise results and up to 70 % forecasts with an error within one rating grade. Moreover, 62 % of rating classes of banks were predicted without an error and more than 95 % of rating classes’ forecasts had an error within one rating class." .

However, empirical evidence to support the expected benefits of modularity is scarce in the literature. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of modularity on the efficiency of, for example, an area or production system. The present work takes a case study approach to analyze the effects of the implementation of product modularity on the production process efficiency of a bus manufacturer. The effects of modularity are evaluated longitudinally using a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and causal impact assessment in time series (CausalImpact). The results show that the effects of modularity on efficiency are positive and significant. In addition, there are significant differences between modularized and non-modularized products. Finally, the research establishes causality between modularity and production process efficiency improvements in the examined company." .

Health, and particularly pharmaceuticals, constitute a significant part of public expenditure and as such they have been subject to significant budget reduction and stringent policies. As a consequence of these measures, an increasing percentage of patients resort to private sector for acquisition of their prescribed pharmaceuticals, due to exclusion of public health care beneficiary status, reduction of breadth of national formularies, delays in reimbursement and excessive waiting times. Affordability for pharmaceuticals in the private sector is of paramount importance since household disposable income plummets and more people are prone to impoverishment. This is critical for branded products, whose active substance and trademark are under patent protection, since no alternative options exist while their monopoly status imply that their prices are high. The impact on affordability regarding access of patient to necessary pharmaceutical care has not been documented in developed countries. MethodsA laspeyer index was constructed to compare prices of branded pharmaceuticals and assess affordability, by adjusting price index with Gross Domestic Product Purchase Power Parity per capita. Laspeyer index compares prices based on weights, which in our study are the corresponding sales of products in Cyprus. Moreover, we define the percentage of population that will face catastrophic pharmaceutical expenditure after acquisition of one product from eight major and common therapeutic categories. We used data from five European recession countries: Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Cyprus, for 48 products which were selected based on sales. ResultsCyprus displays the highest prices for pharmaceuticals. By adjusting for Gross Domestic Product Purchase Power Parity per capita, affordability is worst for Cyprus and Portugal. ConclusionsAs more patients have to resort to private sector for provision of adequate and timely healthcare, health agencies must reassess affordability of medicines and minimise catastrophic expenditure impact. Health agencies should primarily try to enhance efficiency of the system and reduce waste, instead of resorting to blunt budget reduction, which can demonstrate unpredictable consequences in public health." .

The main purpose of the paper is to explore the socioeconomic and demographic factors of indigenous people in Peninsular Malaysia in context of poverty and the role of income dependency of non-timber forest products (NTFP). The data were collected in 2014 and 2015 through primary and secondary sources. Partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analysis the data. PLS is a modeling technique that features multiple regression and principal component analysis. The study shows that still a large number of indigenous households is involved in the NTFP activities. But the communities are moving away from NTFP based income to cash-crop based income because of poor sustainable forest management and lack of forest property rights. However, NTFP have a significant role in the household income and contribute 24% of the average income. Moreover, the analysis shows that location is significant to the poverty. There should be a suitable sustainable forest management system which can teach these indigenous communities about proper way of NTFP gathering and given proper rights to forest land. Furthermore, education is not significant to indigenous people and there is a high rate of school dropout among them. The government should introduce a different education system for indigenous communities which will emphasize the importance of education to them." .

In addition to central bank announcements, interbank rates such as Euribor are also influenced by, forward guidance from the ECB, various macroeconomic events, liquidity in the money markets and the perceived credit worthiness of financial institutions. Forward rates are usually used by policy makers and market practitioners to examine expectations, but options provide additional information about the uncertainty of these expectations, particularly future jump expectations. This research examines the jump characteristics of the 3-month Euribor futures contract and its corresponding futures option contracts using both a jump diffusion model with a Bernoulli jump distribution and option-implied parameters using a jump diffusion process with Poisson distribute. We find that both the Bernoulli jump analysis of historical data and implied jump diffusion model succinctly capture diffusion volatility, jumps and jump size. Using a regression analysis to examine the effect of ECB refinancing rate monetary policy announcements on the 3-month Euribor and the associated jump parameters, we find a significant relationship between ECB announcements and the probability of a jump in Euribor. Regression coefficients on the implied jump amplitude parameters suggest that the market correctly anticipates the direction of the rate announcement suggesting option-implied jump parameters can predict, to some extent, ECB announcements. However, our results also show that there is significant uncertainty before the announcements, and this implies that monetary policy communication is not having the full desired effect." .

Inventories flatten the consumption path and eliminate price jumps at the end of the extraction period, so that market equilibrium becomes possible. We distinguish between two types of solutions, one with immediate and one with delayed buildup of inventories. For both cases, we do not only characterize potential optimal paths but also show that equilibria actually exist under fairly general conditions. It is found that optimum resource extraction involves increasing quantities over a period of time. What is generally interpreted as an indicator of increasing resource abundance is thus perfectly compatible with constant resource stocks." .

For this reason, the lack of qualitative characteristics in the products of some manufacturing units causes the absence of their competition in the market. One of the major problems of the stone industry is lack of proper planning of management to produce high-quality stone and according to the international standards. Therefore, management techniques should be used to improve the quality of products and solve the existing problem. Despite multiple tools, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is an effective tool in quality management. Therefore, in this study, at first, by using FMEA technique, failures in the stone industry in Iran have been identified, and the causes of each failure, and their effects and preventive and control measures of any failure are investigated. Finally, to achieve real results, the imposed costs related to any failure in the system have been calculated, and to prioritize failures instead of the use of risk priority number (RPN) is performed by using FMEA and data envelopment analysis (DEA). Somehow, the three factors of severity, occurrence, and detection of failures as inputs and cost as undesirable output are considered in this approach. The results of FMEA-DEA approach based on the cost, at Travertine and Marble processing industry, show the abilities of the proposed approach." .

Our estimation results show that the full sample period is sufficiently different from the short sample period, that the asymmetric (nonlinear) empirical models used in this paper are important and that the sustainability of US government debt topic needed to be revisited. Indeed, the short sample provides evidence of fiscal policy sustainability in line with Bohn’s (1998) findings. However, when considering the full sample, US fiscal policy is found sustainable during good economic times only according to the best fitting nonlinear model, but unsustainable for all specifications studied during times of distress. With regard to cyclicality, both samples show policy is asymmetric. Moreover, both samples show countercyclical policy during times of distress and the full sample results show some evidence that policy may be procyclical during good economic times." .

However, the housing market may not be efficient in the short run. Based on the correlation between housing returns and the economic growth rate, 3 distinct states can be discerned in the performance of the Chinese housing market. The first state is a bubble period, during which housing returns are excessively high and negatively correlated with the economic growth rate; the second state is a correction period, during which housing prices are corrected toward market fundamentals; and the third state is a calm market period, during which no substantial performance or trends manifest. This study determined that excess monetary liquidity significantly influenced the housing market states; however, no such effect was observed when the interest rate was adjusted. Thus, the findings implicate that if the People’s Bank of China intends to avoid losing control of the housing market, it should exercise monetary control to avoid excess liquidity in the housing market." .

The first is the normal completion and extends Dilworth’s classical construction to the pointfree setting. The second shows that in the bounded case, the Dedekind completion is isomorphic to the lattice of bounded continuous real functions on the Booleanization of L, and that in the non-bounded case, it is isomorphic to the lattice of continuous real functions on the Gleason cover of L. Finally, the third is the pointfree version of Anguelov’s approach in terms of interval-valued functions. Two new classes of frames, cb-frames and weak cb-frames, emerge naturally in the first two representations. We show that they are conservative generalizations of their classical counterparts." .

The expansion of credit was particularly strong in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus and all of them subsequently needed official financial support. In each of the four programmes, financial assistance has been provided and promised against the commitment of each country to fulfil certain economic policy conditions contained in the macroeconomic adjustment programme. In general, a macroeconomic adjustment is a process driven by policies but also by changes in private spending behaviour (consumption, imports, investment) and improvement in competitiveness that countries are required to undertake after a large shock. In the case of the four countries, the shock emerged as a consequence of an excessive accumulation of imbalances in different parts of the economy: in the public sector in Greece, in the housing and banking sectors in Ireland, external imbalances in Portugal and in the banking sector in Cyprus. The paper looks at the feasibility of the fiscal adjustment comparing the macroeconomic conditions in the four countries and emphasising the role of the fiscal multipliers in the process. It also assesses the fall in the output in a comparative framework, stressing the role played by the different components of demand either in amplifying the effect of the fiscal consolidation or in offsetting it. In addition, it considers formulation of the programmes as well as their implementation with most attention devoted to reforms aiming at improving competitiveness, growth and employment in the framework of a cross-country approach." .

As functionally defined, these economic areas represent the relevant regional markets for labor, products and information. The result of spatial switching regression reveals that the initial gaps between economic areas relative to average global initial per capita income appear to have declined, but the two spatial clubs exhibit a significant difference in their income convergence processes over the period. The estimated coefficient of the convergence parameter for the peripheral spatial regime is negative and highly significant, indicating that a convergence process exists in this spatial regime. However, there is no statistically significant evidence of convergence in the core spatial regime, implying the possibility of different patterns in the growth dynamics of the core spatial regime." .

Studies available at the regional level explore innovation and ICT use incorporating different variables, while those investigating ICT use mainly focus on that of households. This paper investigates the existence of common factors for innovation and ICT at the regional level, considering not only ICT use by households but also that of firms. Using factorial and spatial regression analysis, we find that although ICT use and innovation are mainly explained by different variables, knowledge-intensive services and the percentage of population aged 15–64 are common to all of them. In addition, ICT use by households and ICT use by firms are basically driven by different factors. Government quality is the main factor explaining ICT use at home, while ICT use by firms is mostly driven by employment in knowledge-intensive services. R&D is the main variable explaining innovation. We also find positive spatial effects, which are particularly notable in ICT use by households. The results stress the importance of promoting specialization strategies based on the knowledge economy that may contribute to creating synergies between innovation and ICT use in different environments." .

An early study using the same model has shown that a good-society equilibrium, characterized by both economic efficiency and economic equality, can be achieved probabilistically by a von Neumann network, and can be achieved surely with the presence of some agents having social preferences, such as the inequity-averse preference or the ‘keeping-up-with-the-Joneses’ preference. In this study, we examine this fundamental result by exploring the inherent complexity of the model; specifically, we address the effect of the three key parameters related to size, namely, the network size, the neighborhood size, and the memory size. We find that social preferences still play an important role over all the sizes considered. Nonetheless, it is also found that when network size becomes large, the parameter, the bar capacity (the attendance threshold), may also play a determining role." .

The theoretical premise of the study is the Keynesian view that the nature and the level of development of the banking system and the geography of financial intermediation are imperative to the understanding of regional economic disparities. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis tools used in the analysis indicate the presence of a statistically significant non-random spatial pattern at the provincial NUTS 3 level for the 2006–2013 period. LISA cluster maps reveal that the southeastern provinces of the country constitute a hot spot of credit activity in this period. Moreover, the evolution of financial inequality indices suggests that this clustering has led to a reduction in regional financial disparities across the country over the period in question. The results of econometric conditional convergence analysis suggest regional beta-convergence in terms of Gross Value Added per Capita but no statistically significant link between beta-convergence and the reduction in financial disparities." .

In the context of Brazil, a country with extremely high regional disparities, exploring this issue is important not only for private stakeholders but also for public policy practitioners. In the framework of static agglomeration effects, we investigate the industrial scope of agglomeration economies in Brazil. On the basis of identified registration data which cover the whole formal labour market in three particular years (2004, 2008 and 2012), we estimate separate models for the logarithm of the hourly individual wage for five broad economic sectors (S1—Manufacturing low-tech; S2—Manufacturing medium-tech; S3—Manufacturing high-tech; S4—Services less-knowledge; and S5—Services high-knowledge). Different estimation strategies are considered in a two-stage model: with and without individual fixed effects in the first stage; and with and without instrumental variables for population density in the second stage. The main results indicate that there is no unique optimal local industrial mix to foster productivity in different technological sectors. Comparing possible theoretical approaches (Marshall–Arrow–Romer, Jacobs, Porter) related to combinations of diversity, specialisation and competition, we find that for S5 only diversity is significant (and positive), suggesting that Jacobs’s perspective is adequate. However, for S1, S2 and S4, the MAR framework seems better able to explain the underlying patterns. In the case of S3, there are elements from both Marshall’s and Jacobs’s perspective. These results seem to be robust to different specifications and estimation strategies. Finally, the urbanisation economies coefficient appears to be positive and significant for all sectors, ranging from 0.0511 to 0.0940 in different specifications, under the simplest estimation (OLS in the first and the second stages). Ordering these effects between the sectors from the highest to the lowest, we find the following sequence: S3, S1, S5, S4 and S2.

There is a paucity of research on the association between obesity and generational changes in socio-economic status (SES) in developing countries like Ghana, and therefore a critical need to better understand within-country differences in obesity and its association with SES over the life-course. MethodsData from a nationally representative sample of adult women in Ghana was used to examine the association between life-course SES and adult body mass index (BMI). Life-course SES was defined based on changes in the employment and education status of both parents and the study participant. Survey weighted multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association between individual and life-course SES in relation to BMI. ResultsParticipants with higher SES over their life course, that is, both the participant and her father had at least a primary education (both > = primary vs. both < primary: BMI 27.2 vs. 24.1), and both were employed (both employed vs. both unemployed: BMI 26.5 vs. 24.4) had higher BMI compared with participants with lower SES over their life course. ConclusionHigher individual and life-course SES is associated with higher BMI among women in Ghana, although maternal employment was associated with lower BMI." .

As such, we are especially interested in how the policy instrument reacts to key macroeconomic variables in the face of possible corruption (modelled here as tax leakage) and possible dependence by the central bank on the fiscal policy process. We analyse this issue by deriving optimal rules for a strict inflation targeting and a real exchange rate target regime. We find that, firstly, the existence of corruption imposes an inflationary bias on the optimal rule – even when the central bank is independent. We find, furthermore, that a central bank that exhibits some dependence exacerbates this effect." .

Thus, how to effectively control and eliminate deceptive counterfeits in the market has become a critical problem to the local government. One of the principal challenges in combating the cheating action for the government is how to enhance the enforcement of relative quality inspection agencies like industrial administration office (IAO). In this paper, we formulate a two-stage counterfeit product model with a fixed checking rate from IAO and a penalty for holding counterfeits. To minimize the total expected cost over two stages, the retailer adopts optimal ordering policies which are correlated with the checking rate and penalty. Under certain circumstances, we find that the optimal expected cost function for the retailer is first-order continuous and convex. The optimal ordering policy in stage two depends closely on the inventory level after the first sales period. When the checking rate in stage one falls into a certain range, the optimal ordering policy for the retailer at each stage is to order both kinds of products. Knowing the retailer’s optimal ordering policy at each stage, IAO can modify the checking rate accordingly to keep the ratio of deceptive counterfeits on the market under a certain level." .

However, this is not a good use of the data. In a previous study, the author proposed a method that jointly utilises cross-sectional data from multiple time points in which parameters are assumed to be functions of time (year), meaning that the parameter values vary over time. The method was applied to journey-to-work mode choice analyses for Nagoya, Japan. Behaviours in 2001 were forecast using one model with only the most recent 1991 dataset and other models that combined datasets for 1971, 1981, and 1991. The latter models outperformed the former model, which demonstrated the applicability of the proposed method. Although the functions of time ascribe the parameter changes to the trends over time, the theoretical underpinnings needed further investigation. The aim of this study is to analyse the same dataset used in the author’s previous study, but express the parameters as functions of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. This method has fewer problems related to its theoretical underpinnings, since the parameter changes are explained by the effects of economic conditions. The functions of GDP per capita produced better forecasts than the functions of time. In addition, the functions of GDP per capita present fewer problems when choosing functional forms and extrapolating into the distant future/past and even to other areas. Sensitivity analysis with respect to uncertainties in the future GDP per capita showed that the proposed models are practical." .

Is trade liberalization associated with improved welfare outcomes for the poor, as Bhagwati contends? Or is Sen correct that policymakers in liberalizing economies need to change their governance priorities to focus on redistribution? This analysis draws on existing literature to develop testable hypotheses that attempt to resolve the Sen–Bhagwati divide. Using fixed effect panel regressions and simultaneous equation models, we find that although there is empirical support for both arguments, the results on balance favor Sen: The positive relationship between trade and improved poverty is conditional upon more equitable distributions of income. In effect, Bhagwati’s predictions about the beneficial impacts of openness on social welfare occur only in a subset of developing nations, findings which have very different implications for the poor in developing countries." .

The implications for policy of these two perspectives are discussed in relation to Schumpeter’s ambiguous stance on economic policy issues. Finally, based on an articulation of institutions and individual behavior in light of recent developments in behavioral economics, we provide some implications for new perspectives on economic policy." .

The government has launched a set of reforms designed to get social care funding onto a sustainable footing by establishing a new level for what individuals and the state will pay. The reforms are designed to encourage individuals to explore how best to use their available wealth and assets to meet care costs through a mixed system of local authority and private sector care-funding options. One option is to use the value in the home to bridge the cost between out-of-pocket costs and care home fees. In this article, we consider two new financial arrangements designed to meet the needs of people in different financial circumstances based on releasing equity from the home.

There is a large and growing literature on access to health care in an era of dwindling public resources due to recent economic downturns. Health care is an essential service, but it is not the only basic service. The literature on access to basic services including, but not limited to, health care is relatively small. The paper aims at contributing to the literature by providing a new index to measure and monitor household accessibility to basic services. A study of Italian regions is presented. It is shown that northern regions have more accessible basic services than central, southern and island regions. A longitudinal comparison has been performed. The results are very worrying because show that policy makers have failed in reducing regional (and in particular north–south) disparities in basic service accessibility. Measuring and monitoring the level of accessibility is central for an adequate provision of basic services and for exploring how the delivery of basic services in the most problematic regions can be improved." .

Sellers are endowed with one unit of the good and compete by posting prices in every period. Buyers each demand one unit of the good and have a common reservation price. They have full information regarding the prices posted by each firm in the market; hence, search is costless. The number of buyers coming to the market in each period is random. Demand uncertainty is said to be high if there are at least two non-zero demand states that give a seller different option values of waiting to sell. Our model features a unique symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium in which price dispersion prevails if and only if the degree of demand uncertainty is high. Several testable theoretical implications on the distribution of market prices are derived." .

I find that business cycles appear similar whether international asset markets are complete or not when driven by a combination of non-persistent monetary shocks and persistent productivity (TFP) shocks. In turn, international asset market incompleteness has sizeable effects if (persistent) investment-specific technology (IST) shocks are a main driver of business cycles. I also show that the model with incomplete international asset markets can approximate the RER volatility and persistence observed in the data, for instance, if IST shocks are near-unit-root. Hence, I conclude that the nature of shocks, the extent of financial integration across countries and the existing limitations on asset trading are central to understand the dynamics of the real exchange rate and the endogenous international transmission over the business cycles." .

Our data allow us to estimate the optimal reallocation of environmental investments, expenditures and energy use to simultaneously maximize production output and minimize emissions in the years immediately before and after the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. We find some evidence of overall productivity decline when considering both emissions and output objectives, due primarily to technological decline, and that cumulative dynamic inefficiency outweighs static inefficiency. A comparison of optimal investment with observed investment indicates that firms could have improved their performance by reallocating environmental investments to early periods and production-oriented investment to later periods." .

Moreover, our censored quantile regressions lead to relatively flat coefficients of inflation and insignificant coefficients of the output gap over the conditional interest rate distribution, suggesting that monetary policy in Japan may be well described by a linear rule." .

We address these concerns by using a unique dataset of employee records from six large Indian IT firms operating in the USA. We find that the guest workers in our sample exhibit a significant amount of inter-firm mobility that varies over both the earnings distribution and the business cycle.

So, it may not be adequate to use a general model for all the companies operating in the European market, as the one proposed by the Directive 2009/138/CE. Solvency II is a general regulatory model such that the volume of own resources will be determined depending on risks based on a calibration reached considering the average behaviour of companies. In order to criticize this approach, we have obtained a characterization of the profiles of companies using a PAM clustering methodology, adapted for longitudinal data, and we have studied the evolution of the obtained groups of companies under a Bayesian approach. In this way, we have introduced a multinomial general dynamic linear model to study the probabilities of the companies to be included into each group. The characterization and identification of these groups suggest that an unique regulatory model may be unsuitable. We have used data from DGSFP (Spanish insurance regulator), with public information about the balance sheets and income statements from years 1999 to 2011." .

Theoretical papers such as Svensson (The instrument-rate projection under inflation targeting: the Norwegian example. Centre for European Policy Studies Working Paper (127), 2006) and Galí (J Monet Econ 58:537–550, 2011) suggest an accuracy ranking for these forecasts, from employing central bank expectations yielding the highest forecast accuracy to conditioning on constant interest rates yielding the lowest. Yet, when investigating the predictive accuracy of the Bank of England’s and the Banco Central do Brasil’s forecasts for interest rates, inflation and output growth, we hardly find any significant differences between forecasts based on the different interest rate paths. Our results suggest that the choice of the interest rate assumption appears to be of minor relevance empirically." .

Conversely, when the cost-savings from reducing output (given the capacity level) are sufficiently small, any outcome of iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies in the supply function game is also an outcome of the same process in Cournot, and vice-versa." .

Customers arrive according to a Poisson process of rate $$\\lambda$$ λ and service time follows exponential distribution with parameter $$\\mu$$ μ .

In doing so, we focus on the distribution dynamics approach. The first novel aspect of this study consists in the fact that it analyses whether the convergence patterns differ when the population is taken into account, while the second one consists in investigating the convergence process in the case of total energy intensity, fossil fuel and alternative and nuclear intensity for the overall sample of countries as well as differentiating between develop and developing countries. On the one hand, our results indicate that the convergence patterns do differ once we weight the transition matrix by population, since we find more evidence against divergence. Moreover, a significant persistence is also found in the intra‐distribution dynamics, which in turn influences the speed at which the steady state is achieved. On the other hand, the Kernel density estimates and the stationary distribution show that the distribution becomes at least bimodal in the former and clearly multimodal in the latter, thereby implying that convergence occurs within a group of countries. This phenomenon is present in all sources of energy examined, but in the case of alternative and nuclear intensity there are more symptoms of convergence. Developing countries converge at higher energy intensity ratios, while in the case of developed countries there are at least two convergence clubs, one in the lowest levels of energy intensity and another with higher levels of energy intensity. These results show the need to promote further energy‐saving measures in the sample of countries examined." .

Instead of summarizing covariate associations with treatment, the DRS summarizes covariate associations with potential outcomes. Adjustment based on the DRS has unique challenges and limitations compared to PS adjustment, but the DRS also has advantages over the PS in certain settings. In this paper, we review the recent developments and applications of DRSs.

Bei Vorhandensein eines Optionsprogramms lassen sich im Modell des ökonomischen Gewinns jedoch zwei Vorbildgrößen definieren: Der gesamte Unternehmenswert und der auf die Altaktionäre entfallende Unternehmenswert, der bei Anlageentscheidungen relevant wird. Es wird gezeigt, dass eine erfolgsneutrale Erfassung von Aktienoptionsprogrammen aus messperspektivischer Sicht den Gesamtwert des Unternehmens approximiert, während durch eine Erfassung als Aufwand (im Sinne eines exercise date accounting) der besser zu interpretierende Wert der Altaktionäre approximiert wird.

The questions of whether this decline has actually been an outcome of inflation targeting solely and whether inflation targeting has been successful in stabilizing other macroeconomic variables though remain. This study considers these questions on the basis of 16 inflation targeting countries and 21 non-targeting ones using a difference-in-difference approach. With regard to the baseline period of 1996–1999 during which neither of the groups was implementing inflation targeting, a difference-in-difference approach was employed to assess the effects of inflation targeting on inflation, output growth, real exchange rates, inflation volatility and real exchange rate volatility during moving 4-year periods between 2007 and 2015. Our estimates suggest that inflation targeting was superior in terms of harnessing inflation as well as inflation volatility. In terms of economic growth, however, inflation targeting seems to be neutral and in terms of real exchange rates it seems not to be stabilizing, if not de-stabilizing. A hybrid version of inflation targeting, namely the conventional inflation targeting augmented by an improved capacity to deliver macro-prudence as in the post-Lehman economic climate, can therefore be viewed as the best available policy alternative for the upcoming decades." .

We show that market completeness allows agents to smooth consumption across states of nature, but not across time; as a result initial differences in beliefs induce persistent consumption imbalances that are not grounded in fundamentals. In some cases, these imbalances are not sustainable forever: the debt of one agent would grow unboundedly, and binding borrowing limits are necessary to prevent Ponzi schemes. Finally, we find that if a rational social planner attaches fixed Pareto weights to different individuals, financial autarky might be welfare superior to complete markets.

However, allowing for period-specific heterogeneous slopes, we find that a negative relationship between wages and regional unemployment emerged in the period 2010Q2–2011Q4 which however was short-lived. This relationship appears to be exclusively due to the restructuring of the collective bargaining regime and the reduction in the national minimum wages, both of which were implemented in the private sector." .

This is achieved primarily by combining one-step-ahead probability forecasts associated with each model. The paper applies well-established scoring rules for qualitative response models in the context of forecast combination. Log scores, quadratic scores and Epstein scores are used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of each model and to combine the probability forecasts. In addition to producing point forecasts, the effect of sampling variation is also assessed. This methodology is applied to forecast US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions regarding changes in the federal funds target rate. Several of the economic fundamentals influencing the FOMC’s decisions are integrated, or I(1), and are modeled in a similar fashion to Hu and Phillips (J Appl Econom 19(7):851– 867, 2004). The empirical results show that combining forecasted probabilities using scores generally outperforms both equal weight combination and forecasts based on multivariate models." .

Using information on previous and current contracts, the approach yields a model of customer behaviour, useful, for example, in assessing the impact of determinants of default, a natural concern for credit and behavioural scoring. Under plausible assumptions, a debtor in each period faces a number of missed payments, which depends on his previous repayment decisions; meanwhile, as most debtors are expected to meet financial obligations, the number of missed payments is bound to display excess zeros, with reference to a single-part law. Each sequence of missed payments is modelled by using the binomial thinning, a conceptual tool that allows for dependence between integers by defining the support of consecutive counts. Under suitable assumptions on heterogeneity, the model can be produced under a random effects approach, leading to a two-part panel data model, estimable by quasi-maximum likelihood. The proposed approach is illustrated using a panel data set on personal loans granted by a Portuguese bank." .

Moreover, we customize this new extension for the family of partially bounded CRS additive models, i.e., models where at least one variable is naturally bounded from below, if it is an input, or from above, if it is an output." .

A distinguished feature of our model is that the random terms in the utility functions are correlated over time and jobs (habit or job persistence). Past options and not only the past optimal choices matter for the current choices. Given observed incentives and institutional constraints on offered hours, we find that nurses are mobile when they are young (less mobility than among physicians), but there is also a weak tendency of higher mobility again when they are approaching retirement age. Wage increases have a modest impact on labor supply. The overall elasticity for nurses is close to zero. These low elasticities shadow for stronger responses, shifting labor away from part-time jobs in the public and private sector toward full-time jobs in the private sector. A change in taxation away from the progressive tax system toward a flat tax of 28 % gives registered nurses a very modest incentive to shift their job to private hospitals. For physicians, the impact is stronger." .

Our findings provide robust evidence of positive correlation between the growth and inequality across frequencies. Yet, directions of causality vary across frequencies and evolve with time.

Therefore, the goal of the European Union (EU) and many other countries is to promote energy-friendly product choices (i.e., choice of products with low energy consumption). In a purchase situation, consumers are confronted with a wide range of energy-related information that can influence the decision-making process. Understanding how consumers reach a decision based on the information provided and identifying decision-making strategies that are beneficial or destructive in terms of energy friendliness is crucial for the improvement of existing energy-policy measures and, consequently, for the successful achievement of target energy saving goals. This paper provides insights from an exploratory eye-tracking study (N = 59) investigating consumers’ decision-making process. Participants were required to identify the most energy-friendly television (i.e., the television with lowest energy consumption). Cluster analysis revealed three consumer segments with different decision-making strategies: the energy-directed lexicographic, unsystematic lexicographic, and unsystematic exhaustive strategies. The energy-directed lexicographic strategy resulted in 60% optimal choices in terms of energy friendliness, unsystematic lexicographic in 33%, and unsystematic exhaustive in 38%. No decision-making strategy resulted in 100% optimal choices in terms of energy friendliness. Findings emphasize that lexicographic strategies can successfully identify energy-friendly products when the correct information (i.e., actual energy consumption) is used. However, a lexicographic strategy can be very misleading and result in non-optimal choices in terms of energy friendliness when it is based on ambiguous information (i.e., energy efficiency information) that does not enable a conclusive decision. Further, this paper discusses implications for policy-makers and marketers for the promotion of energy-friendly consumer behaviour." .

We provide an algorithm that permits polynomial time market-clearing and -pricing. The results are presented in the context of our main application: the futures opening auction problem. Futures contracts are an important tool to mitigate market risk and counterparty credit risk. In futures markets these contracts can be traded with varying expiration dates and underlyings. A common hedging strategy is to roll positions forward into the next expiration date, however this strategy comes with significant operational risk. To address this risk, exchanges started to offer so-called futures contract combinations, which allow the traders for swapping two futures contracts with different expiration dates or for swapping two futures contracts with different underlyings. In theory, the price is in both cases the difference of the two involved futures contracts. However, in particular in the opening auctions price inefficiencies often occur due to suboptimal clearing, leading to potential arbitrage opportunities. We present a minimum cost flow formulation of the futures opening auction problem that guarantees consistent prices. The core ideas are to model orders as arcs in a network, to enforce the equilibrium conditions with the help of two hierarchical objectives, and to combine these objectives into a single weighted objective while preserving the price information of dual optimal solutions. The resulting optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time and computational tests establish an empirical performance suitable for production environments." .

Ownership is one factor affecting bicycle usage, but work is still ongoing to not only quantify its effects but also to understand patterns in its growth and influence. In recent work, we mined and discovered patterns in global bicycle ownership that showed the existence of four characteristic country groups and their trends. Building on these results, we show in this paper that the ownership dataset can be modeled as a network. First, we observe mixing tendencies that indicate neighboring countries are more likely to be in the same ownership group and we map the likelihoods for cross-group mixings. Further, we define the strength of connections between countries by their proximity in ownership levels. We then determine the weighted degree assortative coefficient for the network and for each group relative to the network. We find that while the weighted degree assortativity of the ownership network is statistically insignificant, the highest and lowest ownership groups exhibit disassortative behavior with respect to the entire network. The second and third ranked groups, however, are strongly assortative. Our model serves as a step toward further work in studying the relationship between proximity and bicycle ownership among nations and unearthing possible patterns of influence. Considering further developments, this work can inform policy-relevant recommendations toward regional planning. This effort also contributes to expanding research in assortativity analyses, especially in weighted networks." .

Simulations using a validated health economics model suggest that screening for osteoporosis in Chinese women is cost-effective and may even be cost-saving in Chinese post-menopausal women. IntroductionThis study aimed at determining the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening strategies in post-menopausal Chinese women. MethodsA validated state-transition microsimulation model with a lifetime horizon was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies with treatment of alendronate compared with current osteoporosis management in China. Osteoporosis screening strategies assessed were (1) universal screening with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) alone; (2) Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) + DXA; and (3) quantitative ultrasound (QUS) + DXA with rescreening at 2, 5 or 10-year intervals for patients screened negative by DXA. The study was performed from the Chinese healthcare payer’s perspective. All model inputs were retrieved from publically available literature. Uncertainties were addressed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ResultsScreening strategies all improved clinical outcomes at increased costs, and each were cost-effective compared with no screening in women aged 55 years given the Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold of USD 20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Pre-screening with QUS and subsequent DXA screening if the QUS T-score ≤ −0.5 with a 2-year rescreening interval was the most cost-effective strategy with the highest probability of being cost-effective across all non-dominated strategies. Screening strategies were cost-saving if screenings were initiated from age 65 years. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust. ConclusionsPre-screening with QUS with subsequent DXA screening if the QUS T-score ≤ −0.5 with a 2-year rescreening interval in the Chinese women starting at age 55 is the most cost-effective. In addition, screening and treatment strategies are cost-saving if the screening initiation age is greater than 65 years." .

Using a difference-in-differences strategy and a comprehensive data set on the regional prices of CPI items, we find that general level of consumer prices has declined by approximately 2.5 % due to immigration. Prices of goods and services have declined in similar magnitudes. We highlight that the channel through which the price declines take place is the informal labor market. Syrian refugees supply inexpensive informal labor and, thus, substitute the informal native workers especially in informal-labor intensive sectors. We document that prices in these sectors have fallen by around 4 %, while the prices in the formal labor-intensive sectors have almost remained unchanged. Increase in the supply of informal immigrant workers generates labor cost advantages and keeps prices lower in the informal labor-intensive sectors." .

IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to estimate, from the perspective of Japan’s healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention by OLS relative to no therapy in patients with osteoporosis and a history of hip fracture. MethodsA patient-level state transition model was developed to predict lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients with or without secondary fracture prevention by OLS. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of secondary fracture prevention compared with no therapy was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the influence of parameter uncertainty on the base case results. ResultsCompared with no therapy, secondary fracture prevention in patients aged 65 with T-score of −2.5 resulted in an additional lifetime cost of $3396 per person and conferred an additional 0.118 QALY, resulting in an ICER of $28,880 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that treatment duration and offset time strongly affect the cost-effectiveness of OLS. According to the results of scenario analyses, secondary fracture prevention by OLS was cost-saving compared with no therapy in patients with a family history of hip fracture and high alcohol intake. ConclusionsSecondary fracture prevention by OLS is cost-effective in Japanese women with osteoporosis who have suffered a hip fracture. In addition, secondary fracture prevention is less expensive than no therapy in high-risk patients with multiple risk factors." .

The paper also supplements the current literature on infinite dynamic games with continuous buyer types, which relies on the use of a distribution of types with full support and an envelope theorem.

Assuming the existence of two types of firms, we show that either a separating or a pooling credit market equilibrium can arise, depending on the level of taxation.

These governments have been implementing various strategies such as improving healthcare financing, improving access to health, increasing educational level, and income level of the household to improve child health. Despite all these efforts, under-five and infant mortality rates remain high in many developing nations. Some previous studies examined how economic development or household’s economic condition contributes to child survival in developing countries. In Ghana, the question as to what extent does economic circumstances of households reduces infant and child mortality still remain largely unanswered. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which wealth affects the survival of under-five children, using data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Ghana. MethodsIn this study, we use four waves of data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Ghana from 1993 to 2008. The DHS is a detailed data set that provides comprehensive information on households and their demographic characteristics in Ghana. Data was obtained by distributing questionnaires to women (from 6000 households) of reproductive age between 15 and 49 years, which asked, among other things, their birth history information. The Weibull hazard model with gamma frailty was used to estimate wealth effect, as well as the trend of wealth effect on child’s survival probability. ResultsWe find that household wealth status has a significant effect on the child survival in Ghana. A child is more likely to survive when he/she is from a household with high wealth status. Among other factors, birth spacing and parental education were found to be highly significant to increase a child’s survival probability. ConclusionsOur findings offer plausible mechanisms for the association of household wealth and child survival. We therefore suggest that the Government of Ghana strengthens and sustains improved livelihood programs, which reduce poverty. They should also take further initiatives that will increase adult education and improve health knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Ghana that combines four cross sectional data sets from DHS to study a policy-relevant question. We extend Standard Weibull hazard model into Weibull hazard model with gamma frailty, which gives us a more accurate estimation. Finally, the findings of this study are of interest not only because they provide insights into the determinants of child health in Ghana and other developing countries, but they also suggest policies beyond the scope of health." .

We quantify this channel using several empirical methods under daily data. In early 2009, the US real interest rate became negative, with sample mean varying from 1.75 % (in the mid-1997 to January 28, 2009, subsample) to $$-1.50\\,\\%$$ -1.50% (in January 29, 2009, to mid-September 2013 subsample). Gold displays higher risk-adjusted returns earlier, while copper and oil have higher risk-adjusted returns more recently. Shocks to the exchange rate and the real interest rate in VARs explain almost 30 % for oil and 32 % for copper more recently when impulse responses are more significant. The time-varying correlation of oil with the real interest rate in the more recent period is $$-0.462$$ -0.462 , and its correlation with the exchange rate is $$-0.460$$ -0.460 , compared to $$-0.089$$ -0.089 and $$-0.120$$ -0.120 , respectively, in the earlier period. Vine copula methods identify a dependence pattern of C-vine copula with t-copula in almost every pair among commodity prices, the real value of the US dollar and the US real interest rate." .

However, it could be more realistic to consider that the dynamics generating economic growth take place at a smaller spatial scale. Potential heterogeneity across local areas might be not correctly quantified if the analysis is made at an aggregated geographical scale, which produces the so-called modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The objective of this paper is to explore to which extent MAUP has an effect on convergence analysis, in particular in the empirical estimation of $$\\beta $$ β -convergence equations. First, we show how aggregation of spatial data can generate a problem of bias in the OLS estimator of $$\\beta $$ β -convergence equations from cross-sectional data, as well as inflating its variance. Second, by means of a numerical simulation, we quantify the effect of geographical aggregation on the estimates of $$\\beta $$ β -convergence. Our experiment is based on real spatial structures of aggregated and disaggregated data for different countries, and it numerically illustrates how a modification in the spatial scale has a significant effect on this type of studies." .

The free-market equilibrium is iniquitous, both because the households have different resources and because the children have different access to education. Public policy is thus called for, for vertical as well as horizontal equity purposes. Conventional wisdom has it that both objectives could be achieved using price control instruments, i.e. income taxes and price subsidies. We find instead that income taxes reduce equality of opportunity and that price subsidies cannot remedy this. Quantity controls become necessary: a compulsory education package, financed by a redistributive tax system, achieves both types of equity. Redistributive taxation and compulsory education are therefore best seen as complementary policies." .

When individuals in an informed environment have homogeneous beliefs (common priors), they objectively agree; however, they can agree without knowing they agree. With homogeneous beliefs, individuals still face intrinsic uncertainty over unknown beliefs of others. If two people have homogeneous beliefs and their informed posteriors for an event E are common knowledge, then–contrary to the widely held view–these posteriors may be unequal. The two people can agree to disagree. Consensus over the probabilities of the possible states requires an agreed common‐knowledge priors assumption." .

Types can be multidimensional and potentially interdependent. We show that, if the realized frequency of types (the exact number of agents for each type) is common knowledge, then a mechanism exists, which is consistent with truthful revelation of private information and which implements first-best allocations of resources as the unique equilibrium. The result requires the single-crossing property on utility functions and the anonymity of the Pareto correspondence." .

Agents have complete, transitive and strict preferences over bundles of objects. A rule assigns objects to agents. A single object may be assigned to several agents as long as the agents satisfy a compatibility constraint. If no restrictions are imposed on the compatibility structure, there exists no rule that satisfies Pareto efficiency and compatibility-monotonicity. Imposing two restrictions on the compatibility structure, the class of rules called compatibility-sorting sequential dictatorships can be fully characterized by four different combinations of group-strategyproofness, strategyproofness, Pareto efficiency, non-bossiness, compatibility-monotonicity and compatibility-invariance. It is demonstrated that the characterization in Pápai (J Public Econ Theory 3:258–271, 2001) of sequential dictatorships for the case where assignments are not allowed to overlap is contained as a special case of the main result. Finally, some additional properties are considered and an extension of the model introducing capacity constraints is presented." .

Beside a player’s natural capacity, here overconfidence and bluffing may also play a decisive role and influence how to share a restricted reward. While bluff provides clear, but risky advantage, overconfidence, as a form of self-deception, could be harmful to its user. Still, it is a long-standing puzzle why these potentially damaging biases are maintained and evolving to a high level in the human society. Within the framework of evolutionary game theory, we present a simple version of resource competition game in which the coevolution of overconfidence and bluffing is fundamental, which is capable to explain their prevalence in structured populations. Interestingly, bluffing seems apt to evolve to higher level than corresponding overconfidence and in general the former is less resistant to punishment than the latter. Moreover, topological feature of the social network plays an intricate role in the spreading of overconfidence and bluffing. While the heterogeneity of interactions facilitates bluffing, it also increases efficiency of adequate punishment against overconfident behavior. Furthermore, increasing the degree of homogeneous networks can trigger similar effect. We also observed that having high real capability may accommodate both bluffing ability and overconfidence simultaneously." .

As school-to-work pathways become increasingly diverse and complex, there is growing evidence that transitions during this period significantly influence individual career trajectories and long-term earning capacities. For non-metropolitan youth, this period of the life course often involves migration to urban centres in the search for better educational and employment opportunities. Drawing on longitudinal data, this paper examines the influence of migration and school-to-work pathways on entry-level wages for non-metropolitan youth in Australia. Our results highlight that migration from non-metropolitan communities to urban centres leads to higher entry-level wages, but these wage gains are not immediate, rather they are realised at a period 3 years post-migration. Individuals remaining in non-metropolitan communities were found to experience pathways that lead to lower wage returns. Furthermore, unobserved attributes, such as motivation and aspirations, were found to be a major factor explaining the higher wage returns achieved by non-metropolitan migrants. Findings have important consequences for policy in their potential to contribute to new evidenced-based policy designed to entice the return of young people to non-metropolitan communities and ameliorate the long-standing net loss of young population from regional areas." .

Feasible generalized least square (3FGLS) method is applied on large data-set of about 90,000 households in the Punjab province, Pakistan. The results indicate that the analysis based on the two approaches results in considerable geographic differences in the distribution of vulnerability to poverty. The implication of our results is that anti-vulnerability interventions based on monetary indicators of poverty will penalize those regions with low monetary poverty but high nutrition poverty." .

The answer to this empirical question is mixed and not conclusive, despite its significance for public policy and marketing. Using the tools of experimental economics, we seek answer to this empirical question in this paper. Our experiments constitute the first laboratory test of the effect of informative advertising in a horizontally differentiated market. Study 1 shows that informative advertising can lead to higher prices if consumer valuations are low. Study 2, on the other hand, points to the possibility that informative advertising can lead to lower prices if consumer valuations are high. Thus, these studies provide evidence on the causal relationship between price and advertising and more importantly clarify the conditions under which we may observe divergent results. Furthermore, our experimental analysis is the first to study competition involving multiple firms (n = 7) in a horizontally differentiated market using the spokes framework." .
