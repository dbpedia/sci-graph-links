Abstract This paper investigates whether and how corporate giving is affected by a firm’s perceived degree of environmental uncertainty in the context of a transition economy. Evidence from a nationwide survey of private firms across China suggests that both regulatory uncertainty and market uncertainty in a transition economy motivate firms to conduct corporate giving. Further, a firm’s political ties and financial performance alleviate its response to environment pressures. Specifically, both political ties and financial performance reduce the impact of regulatory uncertainty on both giving probability and amount, but neither affects market uncertainty’s impact. This study illustrates the role of environmental uncertainty in driving corporate social behavior among Chinese private firms, and provides valuable insights for corporate giving in other transition economies.
