Abstract We have studied the log-growth population rate distributions of the US incorporated places (resp., all places) for the period 1990–2000 (resp. 2000–2010) and the recently constructed US City Clustering Algorithm (CCA) population data in the period 1991–2000. Also, we have considered the samples of US incorporated places that are one decade old in 1910, five decades old in 1950 and nine decades old in 1990. An excellent parametric description of these log-growth rates is obtained by means of a newly introduced distribution called “double-mixture exponential Generalized Beta 2 (dmeGB2).” The normal distribution is not the one empirically observed for the same data sets.
