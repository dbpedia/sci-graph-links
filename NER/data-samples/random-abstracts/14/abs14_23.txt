Abstract In India, competition scenario in the general insurance sector changed since the year 2000–2001 with the entry of several private sector players in the respective market. While a few studies attempted to benchmark the performance of Industry players using early data available from the market regulator, the existing research studies have a number of weaknesses. Against this backdrop, the present paper seeks to evaluate the performance of 15 general insurance companies for the period 2009–2010 to 2013–2014 using a two stage approach. In the first stage, the study uses the dynamic DEA model suggested by Tone and Tsutsui (Omega, 38(3–4):145–156, 2010) to evaluate the in-sample companies in terms of slacks based measure of technical efficiency. In the second stage, the efficiency scores have been explained by solvency performance of the insurers in terms of a panel data censored regression model with robust residuals. The results indicate a very strong association between efficiency and solvency.
