Abstract This paper estimates production functions for the 48 contiguous U.S. states over the 1970â€“2000 period employing recently developed panel estimators that tackle simultaneously parameter heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity. The findings suggest that labor, private capital and, when controlling for cross-sectional dependence, average schooling years exert a positive and significant effect on state income. In contrast, the income effect of public capital stock is negative. The state-specific coefficients indicate that this effect likely stems from the negative elasticity of income with respect to public capital in the states located primarily in the Snow Belt region.
