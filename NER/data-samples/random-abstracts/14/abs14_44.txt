Abstract SummaryA model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention by osteoporosis liaison service (OLS) relative to no therapy in patients with osteoporosis and a history of hip fracture. Secondary fracture prevention by OLS is cost-effective in Japanese women with osteoporosis who have suffered a hip fracture. IntroductionThe purpose of this study was to estimate, from the perspective of Japan’s healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention by OLS relative to no therapy in patients with osteoporosis and a history of hip fracture. MethodsA patient-level state transition model was developed to predict lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients with or without secondary fracture prevention by OLS. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of secondary fracture prevention compared with no therapy was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the influence of parameter uncertainty on the base case results. ResultsCompared with no therapy, secondary fracture prevention in patients aged 65 with T-score of −2.5 resulted in an additional lifetime cost of $3396 per person and conferred an additional 0.118 QALY, resulting in an ICER of $28,880 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that treatment duration and offset time strongly affect the cost-effectiveness of OLS. According to the results of scenario analyses, secondary fracture prevention by OLS was cost-saving compared with no therapy in patients with a family history of hip fracture and high alcohol intake. ConclusionsSecondary fracture prevention by OLS is cost-effective in Japanese women with osteoporosis who have suffered a hip fracture. In addition, secondary fracture prevention is less expensive than no therapy in high-risk patients with multiple risk factors.
