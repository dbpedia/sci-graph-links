Abstract This article considers general equilibrium economies with a primitive uncertainty model that features ambiguity about continuous-time volatility. For the resulting non-equivalence of priors, an appropriate commodity-price space is introduced. Agents are heterogeneous in the size of captured ambiguity, endowment and preference for risk and ambiguity. Preferences are of variational type à la Maccheroni et al. (Econometrica 74(6):1447–1498, 2006). One important implication involves a problematic aspect of linear equilibrium price systems. Positive payoffs are for free on events outside the domain of the representing equilibrium pricing measure. Moreover, when aggregate risk is present and aggregate ambiguity is absent, the insurance properties of optimal allocations depend on the notion of ambiguity-free payoffs.
