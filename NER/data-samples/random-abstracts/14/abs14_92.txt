Abstract Adopting a production function-based approach, we model the role of health as a regular factor of production on economic growth, and use disaggregate measures of male and female health capital using principal component analysis. Allowing for the dynamics of TFP to be embedded in the production function, we estimate both in levels and in growth rates to distinguish between long- and short-run effects. We use appropriate panel cointegration methodology to control for endogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. Our main finding is that while male and female health capital stocks have a significantly positive effect on level of output in the long-run, changes in gender-disaggregated health capital have a negative or insignificant effect on output growth in the short-run.
