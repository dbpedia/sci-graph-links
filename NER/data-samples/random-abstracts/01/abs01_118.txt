Abstract Recently we introduced T-duality in the study of topological insulators, and used it to show that T-duality transforms the bulkâ€“boundary homomorphism into a simpler restriction map in two dimensions. In this paper, we partially generalize these results to higher dimensions in both the complex and real cases, and briefly discuss the 4D quantum Hall effect.
