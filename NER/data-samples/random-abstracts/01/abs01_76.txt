This paper presents a two‐phase heuristic approach for the two‐dimensional bin packing problem with two‐staged patterns and nonoriented items. A solution is generated in each phase and the better one is selected. Residual problems are solved by column generation in the first phase, where a partial admitting procedure is used to admit some of the patterns into the phase‐1 solution. The second solution is obtained from solving an integer linear programming problem over the set of all patterns generated in the first phase, where a time limit is used and subsequently the solution may not be optimal over the pattern set. The computational results indicate that the approach yields the best solution quality among the heuristics that use two‐staged or more complex patterns.
