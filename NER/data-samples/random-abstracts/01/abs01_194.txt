Abstract In this paper, Lyapunov second method was employed to obtain criteria for uniform ultimate boundedness and asymptotic behaviour of solutions of nonlinear delay differential equations (DDE) of the third order. The results obtained in this investigation include and extend some well known results on third order nonlinear DDE in the literature. For illustration, an example is also given.
