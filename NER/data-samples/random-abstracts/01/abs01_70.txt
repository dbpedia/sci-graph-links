Abstract This paper is concerned with the asymptotic behavior on $${\partial\Omega}$$ ∂Ω of boundary blow-up solutions to semilinear elliptic equations $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \Delta u=b(x)f(u),~~ &x\in \Omega, \\ u(x)=\infty, ~~ &x\in\partial\Omega,\end{array} \right.$$ Δu=b(x)f(u),x∈Ω,u(x)=∞,x∈∂Ω, where b(x) is a nonnegative function on $${\Omega}$$ Ω and may vanish on $${\partial\Omega}$$ ∂Ω at a very degenerate rate; f is nonnegative function on [0,∞) and normalized regularly varying or rapidly varying at infinity. The main feature of this paper is to establish a unified and explicit asymptotic formula when the function f is normalized regularly varying or grows faster than any power function at infinity. The effect of the mean curvature of the nearest point on the boundary in the second-order approximation of the boundary blow-up solution is also discussed. Our analysis relies on suitable upper and lower solutions and the Karamata regular variation theory.
