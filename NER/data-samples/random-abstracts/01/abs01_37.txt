Abstract In this note, we show that a complete n-dim Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature is of finite topological type provided that the diameter growth of M is of order $$o(r^{((n-1)\alpha +1)/n})$$ o(r((n-1)α+1)/n) and the sectional curvature is no less than $$-{\frac{c}{r^{2\alpha }}}$$ -cr2α (here, $$0 \le \alpha \le 1$$ 0≤α≤1 and c is some positive constant) outside a geodesic ball large enough. In particular, if in a neighborhood of an isolated end of the manifold in question, the above assumptions are satisfied, then the end has a collared neighborhood.
