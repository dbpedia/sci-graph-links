Abstract We discuss spectral properties of a charged quantum particle confined to a chain graph consisting of an infinite array of rings under the influence of a magnetic field assuming a $${\delta}$$ δ -coupling at the points where the rings touch. We start with the situation when the system has a translational symmetry and analyze spectral consequences of perturbations of various kind, such as a local change of the magnetic field, of the coupling constant, or of a ring circumference. A particular attention is paid to weak perturbations, both local and periodic; for the later, we prove a version of Saxon–Hutner conjecture.
