Abstract. We review the status of our understanding of nucleon structure based on the modelling of different kinds of parton distributions. We use the concept of generalized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and Wigner distributions, which combine the features of transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and generalized parton distributions. We revisit various quark models which account for different aspects of these parton distributions. We then identify applications of these distributions to gain a simple interpretation of key properties of the quark and gluon dynamics in the nucleon.
