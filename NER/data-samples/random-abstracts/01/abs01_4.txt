Abstract We prove interior $$H^{2 s - \varepsilon }$$ H2s-ε regularity for weak solutions of linear elliptic integro-differential equations close to the fractional s-Laplacian. The result is obtained via intermediate estimates in Nikol’skii spaces, which are in turn carried out by means of an appropriate modification of the classical translation method by Nirenberg.
