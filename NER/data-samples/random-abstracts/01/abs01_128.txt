Abstract We prove an arithmetic removal result for all compact abelian groups, generalizing a finitary removal result of Král’, Serra, and the third author. To this end, we consider infinite measurable hypergraphs that are invariant under certain group actions, and for these hypergraphs we prove a symmetry-preserving removal lemma, which extends a finitary result of the same name by the second author. We deduce our arithmetic removal result by applying this lemma to a specific type of invariant measurable hypergraph. As a direct consequence of our removal result, we obtain the following generalization of Szemerédi’s theorem: for any compact abelian group G, any measurable set $${A \subseteq G}$$ A⊆G with Haar probability $${\mu(A) \geq \alpha > 0}$$ μ(A)≥α>0 satisfies $${\int_{G}\int_{G}1_{A}(x)1_{A}(x+r)...1_{A}(x+(k-1)r)\, {\rm d} \mu(x)\, {\rm d} \mu(r) \geq c}$$ ∫G∫G1A(x)1A(x+r)...1A(x+(k-1)r)dμ(x)dμ(r)≥c , where the constant $${c=c(\alpha, k) > 0}$$ c=c(α,k)>0 is valid uniformly for all G. This result is shown to hold more generally for any translationinvariant system of r linear equations given by an integer matrix with coprime $${r \times r}$$ r×r minors.
