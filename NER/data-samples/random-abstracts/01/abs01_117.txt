Abstract This paper presents a new optimization algorithm called fuzzy adaptive teaching–learning-based optimization (FATLBO) for solving numerical structural problems. This new algorithm introduces three new mechanisms for increasing the searching capability of teaching–learning-based optimization namely status monitor, fuzzy adaptive teaching–learning strategies, and remedial operator. The performance of FATLBO is compared with well-known optimization methods on 26 unconstrained mathematical problems and five structural engineering design problems. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that FATLBO is able to deliver excellence and competitive performance in solving various structural optimization problems.
