Abstract The paper studies applications of C*-algebras in geometric topology. Namely, a covariant functor from the category of mapping tori to a category of AF-algebras is constructed; the functor takes continuous maps between such manifolds to stable homomorphisms between the corresponding AF-algebras. We use this functor to develop an obstruction theory for the torus bundles of dimension 2, 3 and 4. In conclusion, we consider two numerical examples illustrating our main results.
