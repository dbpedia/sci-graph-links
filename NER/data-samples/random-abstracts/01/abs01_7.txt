Abstract We have derived D-dimension rotating charged black-holes with a flat horizon in the framework of Maxwell–Weitzenböck geometry. We have discussed the singularities of these black holes using the invariants of torsion and curvature and shown that the invariants of the torsion have more singularities than those of curvature. To investigate the physics of the derived black holes we have used the Einstein–Cartan geometry to calculate the conserved quantities. From these calculations, we have analyzed the physical meaning of the constants of integration.
