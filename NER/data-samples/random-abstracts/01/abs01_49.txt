Abstract We give different linear and nonlinear differential relations on Jacobi theta functions with more emphasis on the nonlinear differential equation of the third order of Jacobi. We present different points of view with a special attention to the role played by the second order linear differential equations, and their link to the Riccati equation and the Schwarzian equation. We also study an identity for theta functions resulting from the action of certain infinite order differential operators.
