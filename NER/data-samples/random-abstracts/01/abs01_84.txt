Abstract Fundamental matrix estimation for wide baseline images is significantly difficult due to the fact that the proportion of inliers in putative correspondences is generally very low. Traditional robust fundamental matrix estimation methods, such as RANSAC, will encounter the problems of computational inefficiency and low accuracy when outlier ratio is high. In this paper, a novel robust estimation method called inlier set sample optimization is proposed to solve these problems. First, a one-class support vector machine-based preselection algorithm is performed to efficiently select a candidate inlier set from putative SIFT correspondences according to distribution consistency of features in location, scale and orientation. Then, the quasi-optimal inlier set is refined iteratively by maximizing a soft decision objective function. Finally, fundamental matrix is estimated with the optimal inlier set. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to several state-of-the-art robust methods in speed, accuracy and stability and is applicable to wide baseline images with large differences.
