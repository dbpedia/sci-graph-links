Abstract We study phylogenetic invariants of general group-based models of evolution with group of symmetries $${\mathbb{Z}_3}$$ Z3 . We prove that complex projective schemes corresponding to the ideal I of phylogenetic invariants of such a model and to its subideal $${I'}$$ I′ generated by elements of degree at most 3 are the same. This is motivated by a conjecture of Sturmfels and Sullivant [14, Conj. 29], which would imply that $${I = I'}$$ I=I′ .
