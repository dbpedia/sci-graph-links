Abstract In this work a class of time-periodic electromechanical system is investigated. This system is nonhyperbolic. By using Regular Perturbation Theory, results on existence and stability of periodic orbits are obtained. Moreover, the dynamics of this system can be approached in a mathematically rigorous way. These results generalize previous ones obtained for autonomous electromechanical systems.
