Summary The method of Dashen and Frautschi (1) for calculating the effects of perturbations on the strong interactions is investigated in a potential theory model. The effect of a perturbation is considered on the binding energy of the lowests-wave bound state in an exponential well. When evaluated exactly the dispersion integral for the change in binding energy reproduces the standard result of first-order perturbation theory. The effect is considered of approximating the dispersion integral in the way that would be necessary in a relativistic calculation. Both long- and short-range perturbations are considered. Provided the binding energy is small enough, the dispersion integral converges quickly enough for the simplest approximation to it (first Born approximation for the left-hand cut of the change in the partial-wave amplitude) to give a value for the change in binding energy of the right sign and order of magnitude; first and second Born approximations give about 90% of the total shift in binding energy. However, as the coupling in the unperturbed problem becomes stronger, the dispersion integral converges more slowly. If the coupling is strong enough almost to bind a seconds-wave state, first Born approximation becomes entirely inadequate. For one of the short-range perturbations considered, even first and second Born approximations give a shift in binding energy of the wrong sign in this case. Some comments are made concerning various methods of treating long-range perturbations.
