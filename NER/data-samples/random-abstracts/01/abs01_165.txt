Abstract Under investigation in this paper is the discrete Hirota equation which is a combination of discrete NLS and discrete complex modified KdV equations. The discrete spectral problem analysis has been made, and discrete Darboux transformation(DT) has been constructed based on $$2\times 2$$ 2×2 discrete Lax pair for system (1.3). In addition, we have derived new discrete one-soliton solutions by using the obtained discrete DT for system (1.3). Figures have been plotted to display the dynamic features of discrete solitons.
