Abstract This paper describes the problem of passive identification of heat equation coefficients with account for the noise of the behavior of the object dynamics model and for the noise of the measuring system model. The use of the finite difference method allowed for reducing the solution of partial differential equations to the solution of a system of linear finite-difference and algebraic equations described by models in the form of a state space. Presentation of the heat equation in form of such a model makes it possible to apply the Kalman filter algorithm for the reliable estimation of the behavior of the object under study.
