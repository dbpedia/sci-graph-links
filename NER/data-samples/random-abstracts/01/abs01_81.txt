Abstract We introduce and study stochastic N $N$-particle ensembles which are discretizations for general- β $\beta $ log-gases of random matrix theory. The examples include random tilings, families of non-intersecting paths, (z,w) $(z,w)$-measures, etc. We prove that under technical assumptions on general analytic potential, the global fluctuations for such ensembles are asymptotically Gaussian as N→∞ $N\to \infty $. The covariance is universal and coincides with its counterpart in random matrix theory. Our main tool is an appropriate discrete version of the Schwinger-Dyson (or loop) equations, which originates in the work of Nekrasov and his collaborators.
