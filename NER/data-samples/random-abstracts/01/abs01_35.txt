Abstract The local dynamics of the KdVâ€“Burgers equation with periodic boundary conditions is studied. A special nonlinear partial differential equation is derived that plays the role of a normal form, i.e., in the first approximation, it determines the behavior of all solutions of the original boundary value problem with initial conditions from a sufficiently small neighborhood of equilibrium.
