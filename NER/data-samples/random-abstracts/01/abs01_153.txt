Abstract This work is concerned with the time discrete analysis of the Oseen system of equations driven by nonlinear slip boundary conditions of friction type. We study the existence of solutions of the time discrete model and derive several a priori estimates needed to recover the solution of the continuous problem by means of weak compactness. Moreover, for the difference between the exact and approximate solutions, we obtain the rate of convergence of order one with respect to the time step without imposing extra regularity on the weak solution.
