Abstract In this article, we prove the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for the following fractional elliptic equation with sign-changing weight functions: $$\left\{\begin{array}{l@{\quad}l}(-\Delta)^\alpha u= a_\lambda(x)|u|^{q-2}u+b(x)|u|^{2^*_\alpha-1}u &{\rm in} \,\,\Omega, \\ u=0&{\rm in} \,\,\mathbb{R}^N{\setminus} \Omega,\end{array}\right.$$ (-Δ)αu=aλ(x)|u|q-2u+b(x)|u|2α∗-1uinΩ,u=0inRN\Ω, where $${0 < \alpha < 1}$$ 0<α<1 , $${\Omega}$$ Ω is a bounded domain with smooth boundary in $${\mathbb{R}^N}$$ RN with $${N > 2 \alpha}$$ N>2α and $${2^*_{\alpha}=2N/(N-2\alpha)}$$ 2α∗=2N/(N-2α) is the fractional critical Sobolev exponent. Our multiplicity results are based on studying the decomposition of the Nehari manifold and the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category.
