Abstract Jamun fruit comprises of seed and thick pulp. The pectin–protein bond of the thick pulp creates difficulty in making juice. Clear Jamun juice is not available in the market, so there is a need for extraction of juice with maximum yield. The goal of this research is to obtain high yield of clarified juice with the help of Pectinase (Aspergillus aculeatus) enzyme. The study was conducted at different enzyme concentration (0.01–0.1%), time duration (40–120 min), and temperature (30–50 °C). Various physical and chemical parameters, such as yield, turbidity, viscosity, clarity, colour, polyphenol, protein, TSS, and total solid, were measured as dependent variables. Process optimization has been done using Box–Behnken design. Optimization has been done for maximum yield percentage, L* value, a* value, protein, and polyphenol content, and minimum values for turbidity, viscosity, clarity, b* value, TSS, and total solid content. The suggested parameters for extraction of juice were at 0.05% enzyme concentration at 44 °C for 80 min. In a large-scale production, extraction of juice by Pectinase (Aspergillus aculeatus) has a significance importance due to its high yield as well as nutritional values.
