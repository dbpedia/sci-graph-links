Abstract In this article we study the problem $$\begin{aligned} \Delta ^{2}u-\left( a+b\int _{\mathbb {R}^{N}}\left| \nabla u\right| ^{2}dx\right) \Delta u+V(x)u=\left| u\right| ^{p-2}u\ \text { in }\mathbb {R}^{N}, \end{aligned}$$ Δ2u-a+b∫RN∇u2dxΔu+V(x)u=up-2uinRN, where $$\Delta ^{2}:=\Delta (\Delta )$$ Δ2:=Δ(Δ) is the biharmonic operator, $$a,b>0$$ a,b>0 are constants, $$N\le 7,$$ N≤7, $$p\in (4,2_{*})$$ p∈(4,2∗) for $$2_{*}$$ 2∗ defined below, and $$V(x)\in C(\mathbb {R}^{N},\mathbb {R})$$ V(x)∈C(RN,R) . Under appropriate assumptions on V(x), the existence of least energy sign-changing solution is obtained by combining the variational methods and the Nehari method.
