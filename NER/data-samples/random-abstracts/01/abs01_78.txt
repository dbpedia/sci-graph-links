Abstract Let $${C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_{\infty})}$$ Cr∗(F∞) be the reduced C*-algebra of the free group on infinitely many generators. Say that $${a, b \in C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_{\infty})_{SA}}$$ a,b∈Cr∗(F∞)SA . Then $${a}$$ a is majorized by $${b}$$ b if and only if $${a \in \overline{Conv(U(b))}.}$$ a∈Conv(U(b))¯. In particular, $${\tau(b)1 \in \overline{Conv(U(b))}.}$$ τ(b)1∈Conv(U(b))¯. Moreover, in the above results, we provide uniform bounds for the number of unitary conjugates needed for a given approximation. In the above, $${Conv(U(b))}$$ Conv(U(b)) is the convex hull of the unitary orbit of $${b}$$ b in $${C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_{\infty})}$$ Cr∗(F∞) .
