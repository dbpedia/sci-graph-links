Abstract In this paper, finite-time stability (FTS) and finite-time boundedness (FTB) are investigated for a class of switched linear systems with large delay period and input disturbances. The limitation of the frequency and the maximum ratio of large delay period are used to guarantee the properties of FTS and FTB. By constructing a piecewise Lyapunov functional with large delay integral terms, sufficient conditions that can guarantee the FTS and FTB are developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.
