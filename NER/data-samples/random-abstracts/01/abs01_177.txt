Abstract We consider a continuous coercive Hamiltonian H on the cotangent bundle of the compact connected manifold M which is convex in the momentum. If $$u_\lambda :M\rightarrow \mathbb {R}$$ uλ:M→R is the viscosity solution of the discounted equation $$\begin{aligned} \lambda u_\lambda (x)+H(x,\mathrm{d}_x u_\lambda )=c(H), \end{aligned}$$ λuλ(x)+H(x,dxuλ)=c(H), where c(H) is the critical value, we prove that $$u_\lambda $$ uλ converges uniformly, as $$\lambda \rightarrow 0$$ λ→0 , to a specific solution $$u_0:M\rightarrow \mathbb {R}$$ u0:M→R of the critical equation $$\begin{aligned} H(x,\mathrm{d}_x u)=c(H). \end{aligned}$$ H(x,dxu)=c(H). We characterize $$u_0$$ u0 in terms of Peierls barrier and projected Mather measures. As a corollary, we infer that the ergodic approximation, as introduced by Lions, Papanicolaou and Varadhan in 1987 in their seminal paper on homogenization of Hamilton–Jacobi equations, selects a specific corrector in the limit.
