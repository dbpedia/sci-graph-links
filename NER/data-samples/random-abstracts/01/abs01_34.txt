Abstract Diabetes also known as diabetes mellitus is a chronic and complex metabolic disease due to the persistent raised blood glucose concentration for long duration. The mechanism behind the disturbed glucose-insulin dynamics is still not fully understood. The mathematical models which describe the glucose homeostasis, different aspects of diabetes and its consequences are growing rapidly, provide new insights into the biological mechanism involved and help in the management of diabetes. Here, contribution of diabeticâ€™s modelling using ordinary differential equations over the past five decades is discussed. Some parameter estimation techniques, softwares involved and some computational results are also presented.
