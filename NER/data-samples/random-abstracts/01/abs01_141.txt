Abstract Time-dependent reliability (failure probability) aims at measuring the probability of the normal (abnormal) operation for structure/mechanism within the given time interval. To analyze the maximum probable life time under a required time-dependent failure probability (TDFP) constraint, an inverse process corresponding to the time-dependent reliability is proposed by taking the randomness of the input variables into consideration. The proposed inverse process employs the monotonicity between the TDFP and the upper boundary of the given time interval which reflects the life time, and an adaptive single-loop sampling meta-model for the time-dependent limit state function is presented to estimate the TDFP at the given time interval flexibly. Since the TDFP is generally monotonic to the upper boundary of the given time interval, thus by adjusting the probable upper and lower boundaries of the time interval in which the corresponding TDFPs include the required TDFP constraint, the proposed approach can always search the maximum probable life time at the required TDFP by the dichotomy. By introducing the time variable as an input which is the same level as the input random variables and constructing the adaptive single-loop sampling meta-model for the time-dependent limit state function in a longer time interval with the TDFP bigger than the required TDFP, the TDFP in any subintervals of the time interval involved in the constructed meta-model can be estimated as a byproduct of the constructed meta-model without any additional actual limit state evaluations. Then the efficiency for analyzing the maximum probable life time is improved by the dichotomy and the unified meta-model of the time-dependent limit state function. Two examples are employed to illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed approach.
