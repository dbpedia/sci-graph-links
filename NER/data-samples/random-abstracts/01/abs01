The model has kinetic base, it is constituted by four reactions occurring in series and parallel and takes contemporarily into consideration, within a simplified but reliable scheme, the actual reactions occurring during polybutadiene sulphur curing, namely primary crosslinking and possible de-vulcanization. The first order differential equation system obtained is suitably rearranged and a closed form expression for the vulcanization degree is derived, depending the four kinetic constants characterizing the chemistry describing reactions. Instead of using classic least-squares optimization routines to characterize kinetic constants on experimental data, a simplified but reliable approach is proposed, where a system of four non-linear equations is solved with a recursive strategy, allowing estimating kinetic constants that proved to fit well normalized experimental data. The procedure is fast and its reliability is tested on a number of experimental data available, relying into a high-cis polybutadiene rubber cured under different temperatures and accelerators concentrations. Very good approximations of experimental data are obtained, also in comparison with a heuristic numerical approach where optimization is obtained interactively." .

An important loophole in the arguments of Luty-Polchinski-Rattazzi and Dymarsky-Komargodski-Schwimmer-Theisen is that trace of the energy-momentum tensor T could be a generalized free field. In this paper we rule out this possibility. The key ingredient is the observation that a unitary theory with scale but not conformal invariance necessarily has a non-vanishing anomaly for global scale transformations. We show that this anomaly cannot be reproduced if T is a generalized free field unless the theory also contains a dimension-2 scalar operator. In the special case where such an operator is present it can be used to redefine (“improve”) the energy-momentum tensor, and we show that there is at least one energy-momentum tensor that is not a generalized free field. In addition, we emphasize that, in general, large momentum limits of correlation functions cannot be understood from the leading terms of the coordinate space OPE. This invalidates a recent argument by Farnsworth-Luty-Prilepina (FLP). Despite the invalidity of the general argument of FLP, some of the techniques turn out to be useful in the present context." .

This new result of the linear theory of hydrodynamic stability is obtained by abandoning traditional assumption of the longitudinal periodicity of disturbances in the flow direction. It is established that previous notions about linear stability of this flow at arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers relied directly upon the assumed separation of spatial variables of the field of disturbances and their longitudinal periodicity in the linear theory. By also abandoning these assumptions for plane Poiseuille flow, a new threshold Reynolds number Reth ≈ 1035 is obtained, which agrees to within 4% with experiment—in contrast to 500% discrepancy for the previous estimate of Reth ≈ 5772 obtained in the framework of the linear theory under assumption of the “normal” shape of disturbances [2]." .

The pectin–protein bond of the thick pulp creates difficulty in making juice. Clear Jamun juice is not available in the market, so there is a need for extraction of juice with maximum yield. The goal of this research is to obtain high yield of clarified juice with the help of Pectinase (Aspergillus aculeatus) enzyme. The study was conducted at different enzyme concentration (0.01–0.1%), time duration (40–120 min), and temperature (30–50 °C). Various physical and chemical parameters, such as yield, turbidity, viscosity, clarity, colour, polyphenol, protein, TSS, and total solid, were measured as dependent variables. Process optimization has been done using Box–Behnken design. Optimization has been done for maximum yield percentage, L* value, a* value, protein, and polyphenol content, and minimum values for turbidity, viscosity, clarity, b* value, TSS, and total solid content. The suggested parameters for extraction of juice were at 0.05% enzyme concentration at 44 °C for 80 min. In a large-scale production, extraction of juice by Pectinase (Aspergillus aculeatus) has a significance importance due to its high yield as well as nutritional values." .

According to the fault estimation information obtained during the fault diagnosis, the fault tolerant control scheme is developed by adopting the adaptive dynamic surface control technique, which guarantees the asymptotic output tracking and ultimate uniform boundedness of the closed-loop attitude control systems of UAV in actuator faulty case. Further, a prescribed transient performance of the FTC attitude control systems is considered which characterizes the convergence rate and maximum overshoot of the attitude tracking error. Finally, simulation results are shown that the attitude control system states remain bounded and the output tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of zero." .

On the other side, understanding the population dynamics subject to seasonally changing weather conditions plays a fundamental role in predicting the trends of population patterns and disease transmission risks under the scenarios of climate change. With the host–macroparasite interaction as a motivating example, we propose a synthesized approach for investigating the population dynamics subject to seasonal environmental variations from theoretical point of view, where the model development, basic reproduction ratio formulation and computation, and rigorous mathematical analysis are involved. The resultant model with periodic delay presents a novel term related to the rate of change of the developmental duration, bringing new challenges to dynamics analysis. By investigating a periodic semiflow on a suitably chosen phase space, the global dynamics of a threshold type is established: all solutions either go to zero when basic reproduction ratio is less than one, or stabilize at a positive periodic state when the reproduction ratio is greater than one. The synthesized approach developed here is applicable to broader contexts of investigating biological systems with seasonal developmental durations." .

Since all SSA runs are independent, the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors based on the Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture can be exploited to distribute the workload. We considered two execution modalities on MIC: one consisted in running exactly the same CPU code of SSA, while the other exploited MIC’s vector instructions to reuse the CPU code with only few modifications. MIC performance was compared with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), specifically implemented in CUDA to optimize the use of memory hierarchy. Our results show that GPU largely outperforms MIC and CPU, but required a complete redesign of SSA. MIC allows a relevant speedup, especially when vector instructions are used, with the additional advantage of requiring minimal modifications to CPU code." .

The macroscopic tangent operators are computed in an efficient way from a multiple right hand sides linear system whose left hand side matrix is the stiffness matrix of the microscopic linearized system at the converged solution. The number of vectors at the right hand side is equal to the number of the macroscopic kinematic variables used to formulate the microscopic boundary condition.

As well-known, the standard GKPW prescription, applied to a finite radial cut-off, leads to contact terms in correlators. de Haro et al. [1] introduced bulk counterterms to remove these. This prescription, however, yields additional terms in the correlator corresponding to spurious double trace deformations. Further, if we view the GKPW prescription coupled with the prescription in [1], in terms of a boundary wavefunction, we find that it is incompatible with radial Schrödinger evolution (in the spirit of holographic Wilsonian RG). We consider a more general wavefunction satisfying the Schrödinger equation, and find that generically such wavefunctions generate both (a) double trace deformations and (b) contact terms. However, we find that there exist special choices of these wavefunctions, amounting to a new AdS/CFT prescription at a finite cut-off, so that both (a) and (b) are removed and we obtain a pure power law behaviour for the correlator. We compare these special wavefunctions with a specific RG scheme in field theory. We give a geometric interpretation of these wavefunctions; these correspond to some specific smearing of boundary points in the Witten diagrams. We present a comprehensive calculation of exact double-trace beta-functions for all couplings On $$ {\\mathbb{O}}_n $$ and match with a holographic computation using the method described above. The matching works with a mapping between the field theory and bulk couplings; such a map is highly constrained because the beta-functions are quadratic and exact on both sides. Our discussions include a generalization of the standard double-trace Wilson-Fisher flow to the space of the infinite number of couplings." .

First, a one-class support vector machine-based preselection algorithm is performed to efficiently select a candidate inlier set from putative SIFT correspondences according to distribution consistency of features in location, scale and orientation. Then, the quasi-optimal inlier set is refined iteratively by maximizing a soft decision objective function. Finally, fundamental matrix is estimated with the optimal inlier set. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to several state-of-the-art robust methods in speed, accuracy and stability and is applicable to wide baseline images with large differences." .

Moment-based approximations for the expected output quantity of the workstation at any arbitrary time is derived and discussed. In addition, an upper bound approximation for the variation of the produced amount is proposed. Failure and repair times are assumed to be arbitrarily distributed. The proposed approximations are compared with a simulated model using the ARENA 10 free version software to demonstrate the accuracy of the method. These approximations are nonparametric, easy to implement and depend only on the first three moments of the underlying distributions without recourse to the functional form of the distributions." .

Since the perturbations of the correlation matrix and the noise subspace are inversely proportional to the number of OFDM symbols, the subspace channel estimation involves much computational complexity to improve the convergence speed when computing the noise subspace from the correlation matrix of the received signals. Using the block circular property of the channel matrix, the circular repetition method (CRM) is proposed to generate a group of equivalent signals for each OFDM symbol. The subspace estimation of the channel coefficients performs very well within a few OFDM symbols using these equivalent symbols for both the CP-OFDM and ZP-OFDM systems with or without VCs. The computational complexity is analyzed for the CRM-based channel estimation, which reveals that it has an almost identical complexity to the traditional method. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed CRM-based blind/semi-blind channel estimation achieves a lower MSE than the other methods." .

One potentially serious problem is that a discretization may produce the loss of validity of some of the physical principles or mathematical properties originally present in the continuous equation. Such loss may lead to uncertain results such as numerical instabilities or unexpected non-physical solutions. As a consequence, the compatibility of a discrete formulation with respect to intrinsic physical principles might be essential for the success of a numerical scheme. This paper addresses such type of issue. Its main objective is to demonstrate that standard Finite Element discretizations of the heat conduction equation violate Clausius’s postulate of the second law of thermodynamics, at nodal level. The problem occurs because non-physical, reversed nodal heat-fluxes arise in such discretizations. Conditions for compatibility of discrete nodal heat-fluxes with respect to Clausius’s postulate are derived here and named discrete thermodynamic compatibility conditions (DTCC). Simple numerical examples are presented to show the undesirable consequences of such failure. It must be pointed out that such DTCCs have previously appeared in the context of the study of the conditions that make discrete solutions to satisfy the discrete maximum principle (DMP). However, the present article does not put attention on such mathematical principle but on the satisfaction of a fundamental physical one: the second law of thermodynamics. Of course, from the presented point of view, it is clear that the violation of such fundamental law will cause, among different problems, the violation of the DMP." .

The FIM involves solving large coupled systems of nonlinear algebraic equations. Newton-based methods, which are employed to solve the nonlinear systems, can suffer from convergence problems—this is especially true for large time steps in the presence of highly nonlinear flow physics. To overcome such convergence problems, the time step is usually reduced, and the Newton steps are restarted from the solution of the previous (converged) time step. Recently, potential ordering and the reduced-Newton method were used to solve immiscible three-phase flow in the presence of buoyancy and capillary effects (e.g., Kwok and Tchelepi, J. Comput. Phys. 227(1), 706–727 2007). Here, we improve the robustness of the potential-based ordering method in the presence of gravity. Furthermore, we also extend this nonlinear approach to interphase mass transfer. Our algorithm deals effectively with mass transfer between the liquid and gas phases, including phase disappearance (e.g., gas going back in solution) and reappearance (e.g., gas coming out of solution and forming a separate phase), as a function of pressure and composition. Detailed comparisons of the robustness and efficiency of the potential-based solver with state-of-the-art nonlinear/linear solvers are presented for immiscible two-phase (Dead-Oil), Black-Oil, and compositional problems using heterogeneous models. The results show that for large time steps, our nonlinear ordering-based solver reduces the number of nonlinear iterations significantly, which leads to gains in the overall computational cost." .

For many parameters and initial conditions, the solutions of these equations exhibit non-smooth behaviour, namely discontinuities in form of shock waves. In this paper we obtain a novel method for the solution of Buckley–Leverett equations, which is based on geometry of differential equations. This method is fast, accurate, stable, and describes non-smooth phenomena. The main idea of the method is that classic discontinuous solutions correspond to the continuous surfaces in the space of jets - the so-called multi-valued solutions (Bocharov et al., Symmetries and conservation laws for differential equations of mathematical physics. American Mathematical Society, Providence, 1998). A mapping of multi-valued solutions from the jet space onto the plane of the independent variables is constructed. This mapping is not one-to-one, and its singular points form a curve on the plane of the independent variables, which is called the caustic. The real shock occurs at the points close to the caustic and is determined by the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions." .

The role of FA in investment decisions is well recognized. While comparing two stocks on FA of their companies it is important to have both drawn from the same sector of economy. This reason motivated us to propose a sectoral portfolio optimization (SPO) which, instead of looking to optimize among all stocks together, focuses on optimizing stocks within each sector on the basis of FA. These stocks are then pooled together and an optimal portfolio is formed from them with their FA weights and mean returns. In context of FA, the four financial ratios included in present study are return on asset (profitable ratio), debt-assets ratio (solvency ratio), current ratio (liquidity ratio), and price-to-earning ratio (valuation ratio). The risk in a portfolio is quantified using the second order stochastic dominance and to this effect constraints are added in the selection process to generate optimal portfolios for rational risk averse investors. The performance of the optimal portfolios from the proposed model is tested against the portfolios from the traditional second order stochastic dominance model [named (SSDP) in this work], the benchmark index and four 5-star rated mutual funds of India from diversified equity. The out-of-sample analysis is carried on mean returns, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and also their ability to dominate the benchmark index in almost second order stochastic dominance sense over the tolerable violation regions. The stock price data for the period April 2004 to November 2014 of S&P BSE 500 index is used for testing the models. The optimal portfolios generated from the SPO perform better than the portfolios generated from the (SSDP), the benchmark index and the MFs, indicating effectiveness of FA in SPO framework." .

The faults of each actuator occurs randomly and its failure rates are governed by a set of unrelated random variables satisfying certain probabilistic distribution. In terms of the probabilistic failures of each actuator and time-varying random delays, new fault model is proposed. Based on the new fuzzy model, reliable controller is designed and sufficient conditions for the exponentially mean square stability (EMSS) of T-S fuzzy systems are derived by using Lyapunov functional method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. It should be noted that the obtained criteria depend on not only the size of the delay, but also the probability distribution of it. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method." .

We compare several elementary properties which such an area function may have (roughly speaking shear invariance, equality of area of the two triangles obtained by cutting a parallelogram along a diagonal, and equality of area of the two triangles obtained by cutting a triangle along a median). It turns out purely by arguments of elementary affine geometry (if cleverly arranged) that these properties are grosso modo equivalent, although one has to be careful about “pathological” situations. Furthermore, all oriented area functions satisfying these properties are explicitly determined. Finally they are compared with so-called geometric valuations." .

In this study, a multi‐stage optimal control formulation is proposed to obtain the optimal vehicle trajectory on signalized arterials, where both vehicle queue and traffic light status are considered.

In this paper, we consider both the trajectory generation and position tracking of a riderless bicycle. To achieve smooth motion performances, the desired planar trajectory of the contact point of the bicycle's rear wheel is constructed using a parameterized polynomial curve that can connect two given endpoints with associated tangent angles. The optimal parameters of the polynomial curve are obtained by minimizing the maximum of the roll angle's quasistatic trajectory of the bicycle, and this problem is solved by the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, position tracking of the desired planar trajectory with balance is converted into an optimization problem subject to the dynamic constraints. The cost function is designed as the combination of the position errors and the roll acceleration of the bicycle, in order to achieve an accurate tracking performance and to prevent the bicycle from falling down. This optimization problem is solved by the Gauss pseudospectral method. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method." .

The paper shows that the proposed modelling framework can be applied to both median and centre facility location problems, either with barriers or forbidden regions. The resulting models are either mixed‐integer linear or non‐linear programming formulations, depending on the shape of the restricted region and the considered distance measure.

(2014). When solving some matrix optimization problems via gauge dual, one is usually able to avoid full matrix decompositions such as singular value and/or eigenvalue decompositions. In such an approach, a gauge dual problem is solved in the first stage, and then an optimal solution to the primal problem can be recovered from the dual optimal solution obtained in the first stage. Recently, this theory has been applied to a class of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems with promising numerical results by Friedlander and Macêdo (2016). We establish some theoretical results on applying the gauge duality theory to robust principal component analysis (PCA) and general SDP. For each problem, we present its gauge dual problem, characterize the optimality conditions for the primal-dual gauge pair, and validate a way to recover a primal optimal solution from a dual one. These results are extensions of Friedlander and Macêdo (2016) from nuclear norm regularization to robust PCA and from a special class of SDP which requires the coefficient matrix in the linear objective to be positive definite to SDP problems without this restriction. Our results provide further understanding in the potential advantages and disadvantages of the gauge duality theory." .

In this case, using an action of the Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions NSymm on P n , we show that these algebras are closely related to the description of coefficients of the formal inverse to the polynomial endomorphism X + tF, where X = (x 1 , x 2 ,…,x n ) and t is an independent parameter. We prove that the Jacobian matrix J(F) is nilpotent if and only if all right powers D F [r] of D F in ℒ n have zero divergence. In particular, if J(F) is nilpotent then DF is right nilpotent. We give one formula for the coefficients of the formal inverse to X + tF as a left-symmetric polynomial in one variable and formulate some open questions." .

To compute an efficient numerical solution we develop and implement a Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) that solves nonlinear problems on a coarse grid by constructing local multiscale basis functions and treating part of the nonlinearity locally as a parametric value. After linearization with a Picard Iteration, the procedure begins with construction of multiscale bases for both displacement and pressure in each coarse block by treating the staggered nonlinearity as a parametric value. Using a snapshot space and local spectral problems, we construct an offline basis of reduced dimension. From here an online, parametric dependent, space is constructed. Finally, after multiplying by a multiscale partitions of unity, the multiscale basis is constructed and the coarse grid problem then can be solved for arbitrary forcing and boundary conditions. We implement this algorithm on a geometry with a linear and nonlinear pressure dependent permeability field and compute error between the multiscale solution with the fine‐scale solutions." .

It classifies sequences into two types: normally related and distantly related. For normally related sequences, it uses an adaptive approach to construct the guide tree needed for progressive alignment; it first estimates the input’s discrepancy by computing the standard deviation of their percent identities, and based on this estimate, it chooses the better method to construct the guide tree. For distantly related sequences, PnpProbs abandons the guide tree and uses instead some non-progressive alignment method to generate the alignment. ResultsTo evaluate PnpProbs, we have compared it with thirteen other popular MSA tools, and PnpProbs has the best alignment scores in all but one test. We have also used it for phylogenetic analysis, and found that the phylogenetic trees constructed from PnpProbs’ alignments are closest to the model trees. ConclusionsBy combining the strength of the progressive and non-progressive alignment methods, we have developed an MSA tool called PnpProbs. We have compared PnpProbs with thirteen other popular MSA tools and our results showed that our tool usually constructed the best alignments." .

In this paper, an innovative numerical method is proposed which finds the “optimal” traction to the inverse problem. When sufficient regularization is applied, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the widely used approach using Green’s functions. Motivated by real cell experiments, the equilibrium condition of a slowly migrating cell is imposed as a set of equality constraints on the unknown traction. Our validation benchmarks demonstrate that the numeric solution to the constrained inverse problem well recovers the actual traction when the optimal regularization parameter is used. The proposed method can thus be applied to study general force sensing problems, which utilize displacement measurements to sense inaccessible forces in linear elastic bodies with a priori constraints." .

Few researchers have focused on the development of constrained approximate optimization strategies that are assured of converging to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point for the problem. Recent work by the authors based on a trust region model management strategy has shown promise in managing the convergence of constrained approximate optimization in application to a suite of single level optimization test problems. Using a trust-region model management strategy, coupled with an augmented Lagrangian approach for constrained approximate optimization, the authors have shown in application studies that the approximate optimization process converges to a KKT point for the problem. The approximate optimization strategy sequentially builds a cumulative response surface approximation of the augmented Lagrangian which is then optimized subject to a trust region constraint. In this research the authors develop a formal proof of convergence for the response surface approximation based optimization algorithm. Previous application studies were conducted on single level optimization problems for which response surface approximations were developed using conventional statistical response sampling techniques such as central composite design to query a high fidelity model over the design space. In this research the authors extend the scope of application studies to include the class of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) test problems. More importantly the authors show that response surface approximations constructed from variable fidelity data generated during concurrent subspace optimization (CSSOs) can be effectively managed by the trust region model management strategy. Results for two multidisciplinary test problems are presented in which convergence to a KKT point is observed. The formal proof of convergence and the successful MDO application of the algorithm using variable fidelity data generated by CSSO are original contributions to the growing body of research in MDO." .

A few classes of constraints satisfying such assumptions are identified covering a wide range of situations. Relying on these results, a descent method for solving QEP is devised and its convergence proved. Finally, error bounds are given in order to guarantee the boundedness of the sequence generated by the algorithm." .

To analyze the maximum probable life time under a required time-dependent failure probability (TDFP) constraint, an inverse process corresponding to the time-dependent reliability is proposed by taking the randomness of the input variables into consideration. The proposed inverse process employs the monotonicity between the TDFP and the upper boundary of the given time interval which reflects the life time, and an adaptive single-loop sampling meta-model for the time-dependent limit state function is presented to estimate the TDFP at the given time interval flexibly. Since the TDFP is generally monotonic to the upper boundary of the given time interval, thus by adjusting the probable upper and lower boundaries of the time interval in which the corresponding TDFPs include the required TDFP constraint, the proposed approach can always search the maximum probable life time at the required TDFP by the dichotomy. By introducing the time variable as an input which is the same level as the input random variables and constructing the adaptive single-loop sampling meta-model for the time-dependent limit state function in a longer time interval with the TDFP bigger than the required TDFP, the TDFP in any subintervals of the time interval involved in the constructed meta-model can be estimated as a byproduct of the constructed meta-model without any additional actual limit state evaluations. Then the efficiency for analyzing the maximum probable life time is improved by the dichotomy and the unified meta-model of the time-dependent limit state function. Two examples are employed to illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed approach." .

Recently researchers have extended SMT to the optimization problem over linear arithmetic constraints. To the best of our knowledge, Symba and OPT-MathSAT are two most efficient solvers available for this problem. The key algorithms used by Symba and OPT-MathSAT consist of the loop of two procedures: 1) critical finding for detecting a critical point, which is very likely to be globally optimal, and 2) global checking for confirming the critical point is really globally optimal. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the Simplex method widely used in operation research. Our fundamental idea is to find several critical points by constructing and solving a series of linear problems with the Simplex method. Our approach replaces the algorithms of critical finding in Symba and OPT-MathSAT, and reduces the runtime of critical finding and decreases the number of executions of global checking. The correctness of our approach is proved. The experiment evaluates our implementation against Symba and OPT-MathSAT on a critical class of problems in real-time systems. Our approach outperforms Symba on 99.6% of benchmarks and is superior to OPT-MathSAT in large-scale cases where the number of tasks is more than 24. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach has great potential and competitiveness for the optimization problem." .

We consider how the spectrum of BPS states varies as continuous parameters of a theory are perturbed. This question can be posed in a wide variety of physical contexts, and we answer it by proposing that the relationship between unperturbed and perturbed BPS spectra is described by a spectral sequence. These general considerations unify previous applications of spectral sequence techniques to physics, and explain from a physical standpoint the appearance of many spectral sequences relating various link homology theories to one another. We also study structural properties of colored HOMFLY homology for links and evaluate Poincaré polynomials in numerous examples. Among these structural properties is a novel “sliding” property, which can be explained by using (refined) modular S-matrix. This leads to the identification of modular transformations in Chern-Simons theory and 3d N=2 $$ \\mathcal{N}=2 $$ theory via the 3d/3d correspondence. Lastly, we introduce the notion of associated varieties as classical limits of recursion relations of colored superpolynomials of links, and study their properties." .

It yields a feasible solution over this set with a guaranteed worst-case value. As opposed to a previous conception that RO is conservative based on optimal value analysis, we argue that in practice the uncertain parameters rarely take simultaneously the values of the worst-case scenario, and thus introduce a new performance measure based on simulated average values. To this end, we apply the adjustable RO (AARC) to a single new product multi-period production planning problem under an uncertain and bounded demand so as to maximize the total profit. The demand for the product is assumed to follow a typical life-cycle pattern, whose length is typically hard to anticipate. We suggest a novel approach to predict the production plan’s profitable cycle length, already at the outset of the planning horizon. The AARC is an offline method that is employed online and adjusted to past realizations of the demand by a linear decision rule (LDR). We compare it to an alternative offline method, aiming at maximum expected profit, applying the same LDR. Although the AARC maximizes the profit against a worst-case demand scenario, our empirical results show that the average performance of both methods is very similar. Further, AARC consistently guarantees a worst profit over the entire uncertainty set, and its model’s size is considerably smaller and thus exhibit superior performance." .

This assortment problem under the multinomial logit model with multiple customer types is NP‐complete. Although there are heuristics to find good assortments, it is difficult to verify the optimality gap of the heuristics. In this study, motivated by the difficulty of finding optimal solutions and verifying the optimality gap of heuristics, we develop an approach to construct an upper bound on the optimal expected revenue. Our approach can quickly provide upper bounds and these upper bounds can be quite tight. In our computational experiments, over a large set of randomly generated problem instances, the upper bounds provided by our approach deviate from the optimal expected revenues by 0.15% on average and by less than one percent in the worst case.

The problem is often constrained because of the limited hardware resources, and the communication network, which may connect only certain resources. Owing to the non‐linear nature of the reliability function, current optimisation methods have focused mainly on heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms. These are approximate methods, which find near‐optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper, we present a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the component deployment problem. We design a set of experiments where we compare the MILP solver to methods previously used to solve this problem. Results show that the MILP solver is efficient in finding feasible solutions even where other methods fail, or prove infeasibility where feasible solutions do not exist." .

This paper elaborates specific straightforward implementations and applies them to a practical allocation problem, in which transportation cost and risk of shortage in supplied livestock quality are balanced. The variability in delivered quality is modelled using a scenario‐based model that exploits historical farmer quality delivery data. The behaviour of both implementations is illustrated on this specific case, providing insight in (i) the obtained solutions, (ii) their computational efficiency. Our results indicate how efficient trade‐offs in bi‐criterion problems can be found in practical problems." .

This study produces theoretical expressions for the tensile stress-strain curve in the rise and transverse directions. In addition, the theoretical results are examined with finite element simulation using an existing formula. The results indicate that the theoretical analysis agrees with the finite element simulation when the strain is not too high, and the present model is better.

As the anisotropy ratio increases, the tensile stress is improved in the rising direction but drops in the transverse direction under the same strain." .

We investigate the direct effect of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) on BP and GE, while considering the non-directional dependence between BP and GE, by using copula functions to jointly model BP and GE conditional on SNVs. We implement the method for analysis on a genome-wide scale, and illustrate it within an association analysis of 68,727 SNVs on chromosome 19 that lie in or around genes with available GE measures. Although there is no indication for inflated type I errors under the proposed method, our results show that the association tests have smaller p values than tests under univariate models for common and rare variants using single-variant tests and gene-based multimarker tests. Hence, considering multilevel biological measures and modeling the dependence structure between these measures by using a plausible graphical approach may lead to more informative findings than standard univariate tests of common variants and well-recognized gene-based rare variant tests." .

The numerical solution to pure convection equations, such as shallow water equations, is an important component of many problems. An element-free Galerkin (EFG) method has been developed and implemented to solve these equations. In this method, there is no need for nodal connectivity; it simply uses nodal data that are similar to those used in the finite element method. The essential boundary condition is enforced by the penalty method and the moving least squares approximation is used for the interpolation scheme. The numerical efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by solving several benchmark examples. Sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the EFG method was carried out and the results confirm its ability to solve shallow water equations and reveal that increasing the number of field nodes and Gauss quadrature points can improve the accuracy of the proposed method. It can be concluded that the average distance of the Gauss points should be less than one-third of the average distance of the nodal points. To produce the best results, the radius of influence domain should be three times the distance of the nodal points." .

The calculation exploits the fact that the de Rham–d’Alembert wave operator can be extended to a chain map that is homotopic to zero and that its causal Green function fits into a convenient exact sequence. As a first application, we use the method on the de Rham complex, then also on the Calabi (or Killing–Riemann–Bianchi) complex, which appears in linearized gravity on constant curvature backgrounds.

Such an optimal threshold level is found based on the estimation of the variance-to-mean ratio for the occurrence of peak values, which characterizes the Poisson assumption. A generalized Pareto distribution is then fitted to the extracted peaks over the optimal threshold level and the distribution parameters are estimated by the method of the maximum spacing estimation. This methodology is applied to estimate the short-term distributions of load extremes of the blade bending moment and the tower base bending moment at the mudline of a monopile-supported 5MW offshore wind turbine as an example. The accuracy of the POT method using the optimal threshold level is shown to be better, in terms of the distribution fitting, than that of the POT methods using empirical threshold levels. The comparisons among the short-term extreme response values predicted by using the POT method with the optimal threshold levels and with the empirical threshold levels and by using direct simulation results further substantiate the validity of the proposed new methodology." .

The effect of a perturbation is considered on the binding energy of the lowests-wave bound state in an exponential well. When evaluated exactly the dispersion integral for the change in binding energy reproduces the standard result of first-order perturbation theory. The effect is considered of approximating the dispersion integral in the way that would be necessary in a relativistic calculation. Both long- and short-range perturbations are considered. Provided the binding energy is small enough, the dispersion integral converges quickly enough for the simplest approximation to it (first Born approximation for the left-hand cut of the change in the partial-wave amplitude) to give a value for the change in binding energy of the right sign and order of magnitude; first and second Born approximations give about 90% of the total shift in binding energy. However, as the coupling in the unperturbed problem becomes stronger, the dispersion integral converges more slowly. If the coupling is strong enough almost to bind a seconds-wave state, first Born approximation becomes entirely inadequate. For one of the short-range perturbations considered, even first and second Born approximations give a shift in binding energy of the wrong sign in this case. Some comments are made concerning various methods of treating long-range perturbations." .

Specifically we apply a Bayesian model selection approach to compare models of conserved and varying network structure, and use Gaussian graphical models to represent the network structures. We apply a variational inference approach to the learning of Gaussian graphical models of gene regulatory networks, that enables us to perform Bayesian model selection that is significantly more computationally efficient than Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches. Our method is demonstrated to be more robust than independent analysis of data from multiple conditions when applied to synthetic network data, generating fewer false positive predictions of differential edges.

The parameters which characterize topological properties of brain networks follow one parameter scaling theory in all levels of network structure, which reveals the self-similar rules governing the network structure. Further, the calculated fractal dimensions of brain networks of different species are found to decrease when one goes from lower to higher level species which implicates the more ordered and self-organized topography at higher level species. The sparsely distributed hubs in brain networks may be most influencing nodes but their absence may not cause network breakdown, and centrality parameters characterizing them also follow one parameter scaling law indicating self-similar roles of these hubs at different levels of organization in brain networks.

Driver breaks have already been considered in long haul transportation when drivers must rest during their travel, but the underlying optimization problem remains difficult and few contributions can be found for less than truckload and last mile distribution contexts. This problem, which appears in the furniture delivery industry, includes rich features such as time windows and heterogeneous vehicles. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a new mathematical formulation for the VRPLB and of a fast and high performing heuristic. The mixed integer linear programming formulation has the disadvantage of roughly doubling the number of nodes, and thus significantly increasing the size of the distance matrix and the number of variables. Consequently, standard branch‐and‐bound algorithms are only capable of solving small‐sized instances. In order to tackle large instances provided by an industrial partner, we propose a fast multi‐start randomized local search heuristic tailored for the VRPLB, which is shown to be very efficient. Through a series of computational experiments, we show that solving the VRPLB without explicitly considering the pauses during the optimization process can lead to a number of infeasibilities. These results demonstrate the importance of integrating drivers pauses in the resolution process." .

In this article, a method for stabilization of mortgage price dynamics is developed. It is considered that mortgage prices follow a PDE model which is equivalent to a multi-asset Black–Scholes PDE. Actually it is a diffusion process evolving in a 2D assets space, where the first asset is the house price and the second asset is the interest rate. By applying semi-discretization and a finite differences scheme this multi-asset PDE is transformed into a state-space model consisting of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. For the local subsystems, into which the mortgage PDE is decomposed, it becomes possible to apply boundary-based feedback control. The control system’s design proceeds by showing that the state-space model of the mortgage price PDE stands for a differentially flat system. Next, for each subsystem which is related to a nonlinear ODE, a virtual control input is computed, that can invert the subsystem’s dynamics and can eliminate the subsystem’s tracking error. From the last row of the state-space description, the control input (boundary condition) that is actually applied to the multi-factor mortgage price PDE system is found. This control input contains recursively all virtual control inputs which were computed for the individual ODE subsystems associated with the previous rows of the state-space equation. Thus, by tracing the rows of the state-space model backwards, at each iteration of the control algorithm, one can finally obtain the control input that should be applied to the mortgage price PDE system so as to assure that all its state variables will converge to the desirable setpoints. By showing the feasibility of such a control method it is also proven that through selected modification of the PDE boundary conditions the price of the mortgage can be made to converge and stabilize at specific reference values." .

In SORA, the double loop structure is decoupled through a serial of cycles of deterministic optimization and reliability assessment. In each cycle, the deterministic optimization and reliability assessment are performed sequentially and the boundaries of violated constraints are shifted to the feasible direction according to the reliability information obtained in the previous cycle. In this paper, based on the concept of SORA, approximate most probable target point (MPTP) and approximate probabilistic performance measure (PPM) are adopted in reliability assessment. In each cycle, the approximate MPTP needs to be reserved, which will be used to obtain new approximate MPTP in the next cycle. There is no need to evaluate the performance function in the deterministic optimization since the approximate PPM and its sensitivity are used to formulate the linear Taylor expansion of the constraint function. One example is used to illustrate that the approximate MPTP will approach the accurate MPTP with the iteration. The design variables and the approximate MPTP converge simultaneously. Numerical results of several examples indicate the proposed method is robust and more efficient than SORA and other common RBDO methods." .

They combine the well-known Cheeger–Simons characters with Chern–Simons forms. In the same way as Cheeger–Simons characters generalize Chern–Simons invariants of oriented closed manifolds, Cheeger–Chern–Simons characters generalize Chern–Simons invariants of oriented manifolds with boundary. We study the differential cohomology of compact Lie groups G and their classifying spaces BG. We show that the even degree differential cohomology of BG canonically splits into Cheeger–Simons characters and topologically trivial characters. We discuss the transgression in principal G-bundles and in the universal bundle. We introduce two methods to lift the universal transgression to a differential cohomology valued map. They generalize the Dijkgraaf–Witten correspondence between 3-dimensional Chern–Simons theories and Wess–Zumino–Witten terms to fully extended higher-order Chern–Simons theories. Using these lifts, we also prove two versions of a differential Hopf theorem. Using Cheeger–Chern–Simons characters and transgression, we introduce the notion of differential trivializations of universal characteristic classes. It generalizes well-established notions of differential String classes to arbitrary degree. Specializing to the class $${\\frac{1}{2} p_1 \\in H^4(B{\\rm Spin}_n;\\mathbb{Z})}$$ 12p1∈H4(BSpinn;Z) , we recover isomorphism classes of geometric string structures on Spin n -bundles with connection and the corresponding spin structures on the free loop space.

Differential String classes provide trivializations of this extended Chern–Simons theory.

The elliptic operator in the equation is given in divergence form with bounded measurable coefficients. We prove a well-posedness result in the setting of bounded weak solutions and study the stability and instability of the zero function in the special case where the nonlinearity vanishes at 0. We also establish a blowup result for positive convex and superlinear nonlinearities." .

Firstly, to enhance the nutritional contents of rice straw (RS), two fermentation parameters (effect of inoculation ratio and inoculation time) were optimized. It was found that when C. utilis was inoculated 60 h later than N. crassa with the inoculation ratio of 1:5 (N. crassa to C. utilis), the maximum TP yield was obtained. In order to further optimize TP content, Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM) were adopted. The results of PBD indicated that Mn2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ were the significant variables. The optimum values for the three cations determined by the BBD were as follows: Mn2+ 0.06 g/L, Zn2+ 0.15 g/L, and Cu2+ 0.2 g/L. After the optimization of RSM, a model was proposed to predict the optimum value 10.36% confirmed by the experimental result 9.84%. The TP content increased from 3.98 to 9.84%, with 147.24% of its increase rate. This study proposed an ecofriendly and economical way to convert RS into protein-enriched livestock feed." .

Network models can produce persistent and ramping activity, but the positive feedback that is critical for these slow dynamics can cause sensitivity to perturbations. Here we use electrophysiology and optogenetic perturbations in the mouse premotor cortex to probe the robustness of persistent neural representations during motor planning. We show that preparatory activity is remarkably robust to large-scale unilateral silencing: detailed neural dynamics that drive specific future movements were quickly and selectively restored by the network. Selectivity did not recover after bilateral silencing of the premotor cortex. Perturbations to one hemisphere are thus corrected by information from the other hemisphere. Corpus callosum bisections demonstrated that premotor cortex hemispheres can maintain preparatory activity independently. Redundancy across selectively coupled modules, as we observed in the premotor cortex, is a hallmark of robust control systems. Network models incorporating these principles show robustness that is consistent with data." .

In order to resolve this random access congestion, we propose RoBiN - Random access using Border router in M2M cellular Networks. RoBiN proposes an architectural modification of introducing small cells, called Border Routers (BR), in cellular networks, with complete frequency reuse capability. We formulate the aforementioned challenge in terms of collision probability and system capacity. Subsequently, we propose an efficient solution for M2M communications in cellular networks. Exhaustive mathematical analysis shows that RoBiN significantly improves the random access success probability, by 50 % over existing 4G cellular systems. Simulation results on typical 4G networks corroborate our mathematical analysis and demonstrate almost 15 dB increase in Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and 3 times throughput improvements over legacy 4G cellular systems. Furthermore, RoBiN also achieves 50 %−80 % improvement in collision probability over existing time alignment matching work." .

(2010) Scand Actuar J 3:165–184 that gives analytical formulas for the moment generating function (mgf) of some discounted compound renewal processes. Here these mgf’s are used to derive and study the distribution of discounted compound Phase-type (PH) renewal sums. The approach consists in first deriving a differential equation, in the time variable, for the mgf of discounted compound sums when the inter–arrival times are PH–distributed. Then the corresponding distribution of the discounted compound PH sum is obtained by inversion of its mgf (or the equivalent Laplace transform). Analytical expressions for the asymptotic distribution of these discounted compound renewal sums are also given, to test general expressions in some limiting cases. Despite the technical difficulty, several new examples are provided where the inversion is possible, through symbolic computation in MAPLE. When the inversion is too complex, a truncated series solution method is proposed, which is not new but turns out to be very fast and accurate here, much more than other methods (such as rational approximations). The article concludes with some applications where the mgf and the distribution are used to calculate risk measures such as VaR, CTE, Esscher’s, Wang’s Proportional Hazard transforms and evaluate their evolution in time." .

The optimization model employs a pressure-driven analysis simulator that accounts for the minimum node pressure constraints and conservation of mass and energy. Pump scheduling, tank siting and tank design are integrated seamlessly in the optimization without introducing additional heuristic procedures. The computational solution of the optimization problem is entirely penalty-free, thanks to pressure-driven analysis and the inclusion of explicit criteria for tank depletion and replenishment. The model was applied to the Anytown network that is a benchmark optimization problem. Many new solutions were achieved that are cheaper and offer superior performance compared to previous solutions in the literature. Detailed and extensive simulations of the solutions achieved were carried out. Spatial and temporal variations in water quality were investigated by simulating the chlorine residual and disinfection by-products in addition to water age. The hydraulic requirements were satisfied; efficiency of pumps was consistently high; effective operation of the new and existing tanks was achieved; water quality was improved; and overall computational efficiency was high. The formulation is entirely generic." .

Firstly, we are concerned with functions, which are the maximum of a finite amount of continuously differentiable functions of n real variables, paying special attention to the case of polyhedral functions. For these max‐functions, we obtain some results about outer limits of subdifferentials, which are applied to derive an upper bound for the calmness modulus of nonlinear systems. When confined to the convex case, in addition, a lower bound on this modulus is also obtained. Secondly, by means of a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker index set approach, we are also able to provide a point‐based formula for the calmness modulus of the argmin mapping of linear programming problems, without any uniqueness assumption on the optimal set. This formula still provides a lower bound in linear semi‐infinite programming. Illustrative examples are given." .
