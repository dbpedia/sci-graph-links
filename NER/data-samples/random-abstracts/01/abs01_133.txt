Summary The notion of spontaneous breakdown of isospin symmetry as the origin of the photon is investigated in the framework of the unified field theory of elementary particles on the basis of the Goldstone theorem. The treatment evolves towards a particularity of quantum electrodynamics in the hierarchy of interactions. Progress with regard to the problem of unwanted zerons is also reported. An attempt is made to clarify the physical basis of the successes of the unified theory of elementary particles.
