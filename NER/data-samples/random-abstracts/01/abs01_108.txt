Abstract We generalize the Simson-Wallace locus in d-dimensional projective metric space, i.e. we look for the points whose orthogonal projections onto the hyperplanes of a fixed d-simplex lie on a hyperplane ((d−1)-plane). We show that this Simson–Wallace locus $${\mathcal{SW}}$$ SW is a (hyper)surface of d + 1 degree, if the metric hyperplane to point polarity $${((_*)}$$ ((∗) or later scalar product $${\langle , \rangle}$$ ⟨,⟩ ) is non-degenerate, e.g. in spherical and hyperbolic d-spaces (also in the geometry of the universal cover of $${\mathbb{S} \mathbb{L}_2 \mathbb{R}}$$ SL2R ), respectively. Else it splits by the ideal hyperplane of poles of the simplex hyperplanes, e.g. into this ideal hyperplane and a remaining d-degree surface, e.g. in the Euclidean d-space. Our seemingly new general method is based on the starting concepts of the Grassmann–Clifford exterior algebra calculus.
