Abstract For any discretely self-similar, incompressible initial data which are arbitrarily large in weak $$L^3$$ L3 , we construct a forward discretely self-similar solution to the 3D Navier–Stokes equations in the whole space. This also gives a third construction of self-similar solutions for any $$-1$$ -1 -homogeneous initial data in weak $$L^3$$ L3 , improving those in JiaSverak and Šverák (Invent Math 196(1):233–265, 2014) and Korobkov and Tsai (Forward self-similar solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations in the half space, arXiv:1409.2516, 2016) for Hölder continuous data. Our method is based on a new, explicit a priori bound for the Leray equations.
