Abstract We prove a geometric version of an operator valued Hahn–Banach theorem and use it to study sets K that are A-convex over a unital C*-algebra A in the sense that $${\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{j}^{*}y_{j}a_{j}\in K}$$ ∑j=1naj∗yjaj∈K whenever $${y_{j}\in K}$$ yj∈K and $${a_{j}\in A}$$ aj∈A with $${\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{j}^{*}a_{j}=1}$$ ∑j=1naj∗aj=1 . We show how weak* compact such sets can be realized as concrete sets of unital completely positive maps. An application to C*-extreme points is also presented.
