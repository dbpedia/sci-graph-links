Abstract In this paper, we consider the CPE conjecture in the frame-work of $${K}$$ K -contact manifold and $${(\kappa, \mu)}$$ (κ,μ) -contact manifold. First, we prove that a complete $${K}$$ K -contact metric satisfying the CPE is Einstein and is isometric to a unit sphere $${S^{2n+1}}$$ S2n+1 . Next, we prove that if a non-Sasakian $${ (\kappa, \mu) }$$ (κ,μ) -contact metric satisfies the CPE, then $${ M^{3} }$$ M3 is flat and for $${ n > 1 }$$ n>1 , $${ M^{2n+1} }$$ M2n+1 is locally isometric to $${ E^{n+1} \times S^{n}(4)}$$ En+1×Sn(4) .
