Abstract A novel mathematical approach to predict the vulcanization degree of high-cis polybutadiene rubber vulcanized with sulphur is presented. The model has kinetic base, it is constituted by four reactions occurring in series and parallel and takes contemporarily into consideration, within a simplified but reliable scheme, the actual reactions occurring during polybutadiene sulphur curing, namely primary crosslinking and possible de-vulcanization. The first order differential equation system obtained is suitably rearranged and a closed form expression for the vulcanization degree is derived, depending the four kinetic constants characterizing the chemistry describing reactions. Instead of using classic least-squares optimization routines to characterize kinetic constants on experimental data, a simplified but reliable approach is proposed, where a system of four non-linear equations is solved with a recursive strategy, allowing estimating kinetic constants that proved to fit well normalized experimental data. The procedure is fast and its reliability is tested on a number of experimental data available, relying into a high-cis polybutadiene rubber cured under different temperatures and accelerators concentrations. Very good approximations of experimental data are obtained, also in comparison with a heuristic numerical approach where optimization is obtained interactively.
