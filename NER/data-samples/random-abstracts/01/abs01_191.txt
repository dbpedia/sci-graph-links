Abstract In this paper we establish an existence and uniqueness result for solutions of multidimensional, time-dependent, stochastic differential equations driven simultaneously by a multidimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $$H>1/2$$ H>1/2 and a multidimensional standard Brownian motion under a weaker condition than the Lipschitz one.
