Abstract BackgroundUnderstanding interspecific associations in old-growth forests will help to reveal mechanisms of interspecific replacement in the process of forest development and provide a theoretical basis for vegetation restoration and reestablishment. In this study, we analyzed interspecific associations of eleven dominant tree populations of varying development stages in an old-growth oak forest stand in the Qinling Mountains, China. We examined overall interspecific associations (multiple species) and pairwise interspecific associations (two species). ResultsInterspecific competition was intense during forest development and was the main factor driving succession. Community structure appears to become more stable over time which supports the harsh-benign hypothesis that interspecific competition is more common in stable sites. ConclusionOld growth oak (Quercus spp.) forests are distributed widely around the world in part due to oak being a typical K-selected species. K-selected species produce fewer, high-quality offspring with higher survival rates, strong competitive ability, and longevity. The resulting distribution shifted from clumped to random, likely as a result of intense interspecific competition creating ecological niche differentiation.
