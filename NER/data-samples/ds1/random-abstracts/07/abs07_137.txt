Abstract The aim of the present study was to evaluate the different supplementation strategies for finishing Nellore beef cattle on pastures of Tanzania guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. ‘Tanzania’). The experiment was performed in a 12 ha area divided into 12 paddocks of 1 ha each. Forty-eight, 2-year-old, non-castrated Nellore cattle with an initial body weight (BW) of 384 kg (SEM = 21) were used in this study. The following supplementation strategies were evaluated: (1) mineral supplement supplied once per week (MS), (2) energy and protein supplement with intake regulator (2 g/kg BW) supplied once per week (EPS1), (3) energy and protein supplement (7 g/kg BW) supplied daily (EPS2), and (4) energy and protein supplement (7 g/kg BW) supplied three times per week (EPS3). The average daily gain (ADG) of animals receiving EPS3 was 0.177 kg/day higher than those receiving EPS1 (p < 0.01), 0.233 kg/day higher than the MS group, and not significantly different from EPS2. Animals in MS and EPS1 groups exhibited the lowest ADG. The ADG was not significantly different between EPS1 and EPS2 animals, but was 0.203 kg/day higher for EPS2 animals than for MS. Animals receiving only mineral supplementation spent more time grazing than the other supplementation groups tested (p < 0.01). We therefore conclude that Tanzania guinea grass is nutritionally limited and can be amended using supplements, thereby increasing animal performance. Animal performance was higher with increased protein and energy supplementation (7 g/kg BW), independent of the frequency with which supplements were administered.
