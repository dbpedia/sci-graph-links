Abstract According to the EU and Swiss food legislation, only authorised traits of transgene plants are allowed to be imported and sold to the consumer. In order to control imports of maize products from retailers, efficient and reliable methods for the detection and quantification are a prerequisite. Actually, in the EU, more than 25 gm Maize traits were authorised and are allowed to be sold. To ensure correct labelling and exclude unauthorised gm traits from sale, five multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction systems were developed and validated. These 20 systems for the most prevalent maize gm traits allow relative multiplex quantification and/or delta–delta Ct method quantification in routine in a reliable, cost- and time-efficient way.
