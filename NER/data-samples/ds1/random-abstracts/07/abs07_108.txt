Abstract Based on a previously reported method for monitoring eggs of the grape leafhopper (BÃ¶ll and Herrmann 2001) stated as Leda (Leafhopper Egg Detection by Autofluorescence), a simplified but equally reliable version of this method, Sleda (Simplified Leafhopper Egg Detection by Autofluorescence), is introduced. Both methods are based on the fact that the leafhopper eggs show an intense green autofluorescence under blue light excitation. However, in contrast to Leda, for Sleda a fluorescent light microscope is no longer prerequisite, only an optic light source equipped with a blue exciter and a commercial blue cutter are required.
