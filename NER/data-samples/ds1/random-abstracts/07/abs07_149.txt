Abstract The species composition of Odonata facultatively associated with forest ecosystems at the adult stage have been studied in the forestâ€“steppe of Central Chernozem region. Factors facilitating the entry of adult dragonflies deep into forested areas, specific features of their behavior in the forest, and the role of human activities in the spread of these insects in forest ecosystems have been elucidated.
