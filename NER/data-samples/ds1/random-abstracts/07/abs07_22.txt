Abstract This work aimed at developing a HS–SPME/GC–MS method for the extraction and analysis of volatile compounds from the kernels of durum wheat. Fiber coating, temperature and time of extraction were evaluated. Moreover, the method was used as a tool for varietal characterization. The qualitative and semi-quantitative characterization of the volatile fraction of durum wheat kernels highlighted 11 different chemical classes, alcohols and aldehydes prevailing over acids, alkanes, aromatic and heterocyclic hydrocarbons. Concerning the comparison among the studied durum wheat kernel cultivars, Sculptur was the one with the highest amount and variability of volatile compounds. This cultivar stood out for the highest level of alkanes and ketones, while Anco Marzio contained higher levels of aldehydes and alkenes. The optimized method allowed for the qualitative and semi-quantitative characterization of the volatile fraction of durum wheat kernels, and it was effective at differentiating durum wheat cultivars based on their different volatile profiles, representing a potential tool for varietal selection and for the exploitation of specific durum wheat cultivars.
