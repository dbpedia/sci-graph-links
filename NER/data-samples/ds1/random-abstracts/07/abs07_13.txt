Abstract The aim of the experiments was to deepen the knowledge of the effects of the time of addition of oak chips on quality of Nero di Troia wine. The oak chips were added before or after malolactic fermentation, and the analyses were performed after 12Â months of aging. The treatment did not induce the expected increase in polymerization degree of anthocyanins and tannins because of the high tannins-to-anthocyanins ratio. No differences were found among control and treated wines in the color parameters. The contact with oak chips determined in all the treated wines the decrease in floral and fruity notes, the increase in the spicy and woody flavors, and the attenuation of vinous character. The Nero di Troia wines treated before malolactic fermentation showed softer oak and spicy characters, more fruity notes, and less ethereal character than the wines treated after malolactic fermentation.
