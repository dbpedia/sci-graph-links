Abstract The detection of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL) producers in the fecal flora of healthy food-producing animals has increased in recent years. This is mainly attributed to the intense use of antibiotics in this sector. There is growing concern regarding the risk of spread of such bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Salmonella, to humans and to the environment. The occurrence of ESBL producers in the major groups of livestock, i.e., poultry, pigs, cattle, and sheep is highlighted and discussed with regard to data that provide evidence for transmission of their resistance traits from livestock to humans and to farm environments.
