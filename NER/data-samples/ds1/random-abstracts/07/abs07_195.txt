Abstract Crop plants are regularly exposed to an array of abiotic and biotic stresses, among them drought stress is a major environmental factor that shows adverse effects on plant growth and productivity. Because of this these factors are considered as hazardous for crop production. Drought stress elicits a plethora of responses in plants resulting in strict amendments in physiological, biochemical, and molecular processes. Photosynthesis is the most fundamental physiological process affected by drought due to a reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate and disruption of primary photosynthetic reactions and pigments. Drought also expedites the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering a cascade of antioxidative defense mechanisms, and affects many other metabolic processes as well as affecting gene expression. Details of the drought stress-induced changes, particularly in crop plants, are discussed in this review, with the major points: 1) leaf water potentials and water use efficiency in plants under drought stress; 2) increased production of ROS under drought leading to oxidative stress in plants and the role of ROS as signaling molecules; 3) molecular responses that lead to the enhanced expression of stress-inducible genes; 4) the decrease in photosynthesis leading to the decreased amount of assimilates, growth, and yield; 5) the antioxidant defense mechanisms comprising of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and the other protective mechanisms; 6) progress made in identifying the drought stress tolerance mechanisms; 7) the production of transgenic crop plants with enhanced tolerance to drought stress.
