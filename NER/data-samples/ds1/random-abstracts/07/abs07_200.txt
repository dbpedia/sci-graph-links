Abstract The paper proves that for any ε > 0 there exists ameasurable set E ⊂ [0, 1] with measure |E| > 1 − ε such that for each f ∈ L1[0, 1] there is a function $$\tilde f \in {L^1}\left[ {0,1} \right]$$ coinciding with f on E whose Fourier-Walsh series converges to $$\tilde f$$ in L 1[0, 1]-norm, and the sequence $$\left\{ {\left| {{c_k}\left( {\tilde f} \right)} \right|} \right\}_{n = 0}^\infty $$ is monotonically decreasing, where $$\left\{ {{c_k}\left( {\tilde f} \right)} \right\}$$ is the sequence of Fourier-Walsh coefficients of $$\left\{ {\left| {{c_k}\left( {\tilde f} \right)} \right|} \right\}_{n = 0}^\infty $$.
