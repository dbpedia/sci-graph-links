Abstract Genomic selection implies assessing the breeding value of an animal based on the DNA markers uniformly covering the whole genome. This review summarizes the information on the modern trends in dairy cattle genomic selection and the use of reproductive technologies allowing for the increase of breeding efficiency. The main trends in the advance of genomic selection are the improvement of the accuracy of breeding value estimations by pooling the reference populations; use of female genotyping in breeding programs; imputation of genotypes based on lower marker density SNP arrays; and prediction of animal genotypes from the genotyped relatives. Genomic selection can be even more profitable in combination with the state-of-the-art reproductive biotechnologies, such as semen sexing, multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, ovum pick-up followed by in vitro fertilization, embryo genotyping, and cloning of the best breeders. In dairy cattle genomic selection programs, biotechnological manipulations with gametes and embryos allow for the improvement of many factors determining breeding efficiency, namely, selection intensity, accurate breeding value assessment, and the generation interval. Successful embryo genotyping methods for numerous markers after biopsy at the morula or blastocyst stage are based on the whole-genome amplification of the embryoâ€™s DNA. Eventually, these achievements will provide the grounds for new approaches to reducing the generation interval, selecting elite cows, reducing the inbreeding rate, etc.
