Abstract We aimed to evaluate nutrient intake, performance and rumen fermentation of sheep fed cassava leaf silage (CLS). Sixteen growing Java thin-tailed male sheep (body weight (BW) 20.4 ± 1.9 kg) were fed one of the following dietary treatments: T0 (100 % forage); T1 (100 % chopped forage); T2 (80 % chopped forage + 20 % concentrate); and T3 (80 % chopped forage + 20 % CLS). Nutrient intake, production performance and rumen fermentation characteristics were measured. There was no significant effect on the consumption of dry matter, whereas there was a significant effect (P < 0.05) on the consumption of crude protein, fat, crude fibre and total digestible nutrients. Concentrate or CLS at a 20 % level could increase BW and feed efficiency. No significant difference was observed in total bacteria; however, concentrate could increase total protozoa (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids were higher in T2 than in T3, but ammonia concentration was higher in T3 than in T2. In conclusion, feeding 20 % cassava leaf silage greatly improved sheep performance, approaching that achieved by feeding concentrate.
