Abstract Key message We evaluated genomic selection across five breeding cycles of bread wheat breeding. Bias of within-cycle cross-validation and methods for improving the prediction accuracy were assessed. AbstractThe prospect of genomic selection has been frequently shown by cross-validation studies using the same genetic material across multiple environments, but studies investigating genomic selection across multiple breeding cycles in applied bread wheat breeding are lacking. We estimated the prediction accuracy of grain yield, protein content and protein yield of 659 inbred lines across five independent breeding cycles and assessed the bias of within-cycle cross-validation. We investigated the influence of outliers on the prediction accuracy and predicted protein yield by its components traits. A high average heritability was estimated for protein content, followed by grain yield and protein yield. The bias of the prediction accuracy using populations from individual cycles using fivefold cross-validation was accordingly substantial for protein yield (17–712 %) and less pronounced for protein content (8–86 %). Cross-validation using the cycles as folds aimed to avoid this bias and reached a maximum prediction accuracy of $$r_{\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.51 for protein content, $$r_{\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.38 for grain yield and $$r_{\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.16 for protein yield. Dropping outlier cycles increased the prediction accuracy of grain yield to $$r_{\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.41 as estimated by cross-validation, while dropping outlier environments did not have a significant effect on the prediction accuracy. Independent validation suggests, on the other hand, that careful consideration is necessary before an outlier correction is undertaken, which removes lines from the training population. Predicting protein yield by multiplying genomic estimated breeding values of grain yield and protein content raised the prediction accuracy to $$r_{\text{GS}}$$ rGS  = 0.19 for this derived trait.
