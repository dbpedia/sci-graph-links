A high capacity of laccase from Trametes versicolor capable of degrading pesticides has been revealed. The conditions for degrading of five selected pesticides including chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil, pyrimethanil, atrazine and isoproturon with the purified laccases from Trametes versicolor were optimized. The results showed that the optimum conditions for the highest activity were pH at 5.0 and temperature at 25 °C. The best mediators were violuric acid for pyrimethanil and isoproturon, vanillin for chlorpyrifos, and acetosyringone and HBT for chlorothalonil and atrazine, respectively. The laccase was found to be stable at a pH range from 5.0 to 7.0 and temperature from 25 to 30 °C. It was observed that each pesticide required a different laccase mediator concentration typically between 4.0–6.0 mmol/L. In the experiment, the degradation rates of pyrimethanil and isoproturon were significantly faster than those of chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil and atrazine. For example, it was observed that pyrimethanil and isoproturon degraded up to nearly 100% after 24 hours while the other three pesticides just reached up 90% of degradation after 8 days of incubation.
