Abstract This study presents the first definitive anatomical description of the tongue and lingual papillae of the cattleyak. Data on tongues from 12 healthy cattle-yaks were collected. The results show that five types of papillae were identifiable on the tongue surface of the cattle-yak. Among these, three types were mechanical papillae (filiform, conical, and lenticular), and two types were gustatory papillae (vallate and fungiform). Some morphological features of the cattle-yak tongue were similar to those of domestic ruminants, but the lingual prominence was higher and more developed. For example, more mechanical papillae were present and they were covered by a thicker, keratinized epithelium, the conical papillae possibly perform an immune function, the fungiform papillae have more mucussecreting pores, and the sublingual glands were more developed. This research will provide a further and detailed source of morphological information about the cattle-yak that is currently lacking in species-specific studies on the morphology of the Bovidae family.
