Abstract Key message An integrated genetic map was constructed for einkorn wheat A genome and provided valuable information for QTL mapping and genome sequence anchoring. AbstractWheat is one of the most widely grown food grain crops in the world. The construction of a genetic map is a key step to organize biologically or agronomically important traits along the chromosomes. In the present study, an integrated linkage map of einkorn wheat was developed using 109 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter sub-specific cross, KT1-1 (T. monococcum ssp. boeoticum) × KT3-5 (T. monococcum ssp. monococcum). The map contains 926 molecular markers assigned to seven linkage groups, and covers 1,377 cM with an average marker interval of 1.5 cM. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of five agronomic traits identified 16 stable QTL on all seven chromosomes, except 6A. The total phenotypic variance explained by these stable QTL using multiple regressions varied across environments from 8.8 to 87.1 % for days to heading, 24.4–63.0 % for spike length, 48.2–79.6 % for spikelet number per spike, 13.1–48.1 % for plant architecture, and 12.2–26.5 % for plant height, revealing that much of the RIL phenotypic variation had been genetically dissected. Co-localizations of closely linked QTL for different traits were frequently observed, especially on 3A and 7A. The QTL on 3A, 5A and 7A were closely associated with Eps-A m 3, Vrn1 and Vrn3 loci, respectively. Furthermore, this genetic map facilitated the anchoring of 237 T. urartu scaffolds onto seven chromosomes with a physical length of 26.15 Mb. This map and the QTL data provide valuable genetic information to dissect important agronomic and developmental traits in diploid wheat and contribute to the genetic ordering of the genome assembly.
