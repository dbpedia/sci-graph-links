Abstract Hypodermosis is one of the important veterinary problems because of its worldwide prevalence and significant economic losses. Economic losses is due to decreasing of productivity potential and leather quality. The disease is caused by two parasitic fly species in cattle, Hypoderma bovis and lineatus. Diagnosis of the parasites has crucial importance because of treatment and eradication plannings. Basically diagnosis is based on parasitological methods but recently serological methods were used in some countries. In the present study, a total of 3716 cattle were investigated in Industrial Slaughter house of Ardebil, Northwest of Iran. In this study, the prevalence of H. lineatus and H. bovis was 0.32 % (12 larva) and 1.07 % (40 larva), respectively. Low prevalence of hypodermosis could be caused by cold climate of studied region also shows efficacy of controlling programs. Unlike low prevalence of Hypoderma spp. in the studied regions, antiparasitic agents such as organophosphates and avermectins should be used to reduce the prevalence.
