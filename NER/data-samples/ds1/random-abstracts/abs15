However, existing findings are still largely fragmented, and this stream of research lacks theoretical consolidation. This article integrates the diffuse and multi-disciplinary literature on CSR micro-level influences in a theoretically driven conceptual framework that contributes to explain and predict when, why, and how employees might react to CSR activity in a way that influences organizations’ economic and social performance. Drawing on social identity theory and social exchange theory, we delineate the different but interdependent psychological mechanisms that explain how CSR can strengthen the employee–organization relationship and subsequently foster employee-related, micro-level outcomes. Contributions of our framework to extant literature and potential extensions for future research are then discussed." .

We combine the resources-based view with the institutional perspective to highlight the costs and benefits of business groups’ internationalization, rather than business groups’ affiliated firms’ internationalization, and consider how ownership heterogeneity among business groups influences the internationalization-performance relationship. Three ownership types—family, domestic financial institution, and foreign corporate—serve as distinguishing characteristics of business groups and potential moderators of this relationship. In a sample of 185 Indian business groups examined over more than a decade (2000–2010), we find that these three ownership types have a differential impact on the internationalization-performance relationship¸ depending on the level of internationalization of the business group. Specifically¸ we find that at lower levels of internationalization, family and foreign corporate ownership has a positive moderating effect whereas domestic financial institutional ownership has a negative moderating effect. Conversely¸ at higher levels of internationalization, family and foreign corporate ownership has a negative moderating effect, while domestic financial institutional ownership positively moderates the internationalization-performance relationship." .

Building on principal agent theory, we argue that in the Chinese context higher ownership levels do not necessarily have a positive effect on the extent of control over the foreign subsidiary. We further argue that cultural distance between the parent firm and the subsidiary moderates this relationship. We test our hypotheses using data from a sample of 156 foreign subsidiaries in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and find strong support for our arguments. Our findings show that in WoS parent firms reduce their extent of control, while in IJVs parent firms increase their extent of control. Moreover, we find that extent of control over WoS (IJVs) declines (increases) when cultural distance increases. Our results have significant theoretical implications for international business (IB) research as they challenge existing views with regard to the relationship between ownership mode and control as well as the moderating effect of cultural distance." .

The resource perspective (or organisational perspective) deals, among others, with the assignment of resources to process activities. Mining in relation to this perspective aims to extract rules on resource assignments for the process activities. Prior research in this area is limited by the assumption that only one resource is responsible for each process activity, and hence, collaborative activities are disregarded. In this paper, we leverage this assumption by developing a process mining approach that is able to discover team compositions for collaborative process activities from event logs. We evaluate our novel mining approach in terms of computational performance and practical applicability." .

Minority participation by private investors—as empirically observed—arises endogenously in the model to prevent investment expropriation. We consider the example of water supply with perfectly inelastic demand and fixed-price regulation, coupled with price discretion at a local level. Welfare-maximizing local governments face a trade-off between the increase in consumers’ surplus and the reduction in costly public funds. Therefore, private shareholders choose investment to keep the government share at a threshold such that the politician always sticks to the price-cap and dividends are then maximized. To consider normative issues, we compare investment by mixed firms and by a social planner." .

We build a brand new firm-level dataset able both to represent the extent of Italian firms’ foreign activity and to provide reliable measures of key performance indicators, especially total factor productivity (TFP) and employment. We then use a propensity score matching procedure to analyze the causal relationship between FDI and firm performance. Firms investing abroad for the very first time, especially in advanced economies, show higher productivity and employment dynamics in the years following the investment: the average positive effect on TFP is driven by new multinationals operating in specialized and high-tech sectors, while the positive employment gains are explained by an increase of the white collar component. On average there are no negative effects on the parent firm’s blue collar component." .

Scholars have thus wondered if this is an exception rather a rule. Are more centralized countries innovative? Existing empirical research has produced mixed results. This study introduces a new perspective on this issue. Rather than the degree of centralization found in formal institutions, we focus on non-institutional or informal dimensions of centralization particularly associated with culture. Using Hofstede’s cross-national dataset capturing national culture, we explore how different dimensions of national culture are linked to national innovative capacity as proxied by patents. Our preliminary findings from the analysis of 34 OECD member states based on the patent data extracted from the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) database suggest that non-institutional dimensions of centralization account more for the variations in national rates of patents per capita than more formal aspects of centralization measured by traditional political datasets such as POLCON. While cultural aspects have been examined in technology management at the individual and the firm level, this study fills a gap in the existing literature by exploring their relationship at the national level. More research is clearly needed to explore the roles of non-institutional features facilitating or hampering innovation." .

In particular, building on the premise that social movements reflect ideologies that direct behavior inside and outside organizations, this essay identifies mechanisms by which social movements induce firms to engage with social issues. First, social movements are able to influence the expectations that key stakeholders have about firms’ social responsibility, making corporate social initiatives more attractive. Second, through conflict or collaboration, they shape firms’ reputation and legitimacy. And third, social movements’ ideologies manifest inside the corporations by triggering organizational members’ values and affecting managerial cognition. The essay contributes to the literatures on social movements and CSR, extends the understanding of how ideologies are manifested in movement-business interactions, and generates rich opportunities for future research." .

Thus, patent analysis is important for defining business strategies and supporting decision-making in organizations. However, patent analysis can involve vast data sets and are difficult to analyze. The purpose of this study is to apply artificial immune system hybrid collaborative filtering to build a patent quality classification model. We apply the model to predicting the quality of radio frequency identification patents. Using a simple definition of quality, we define each patent’s data as an antigen and then compute the affinities of the target patent to all immune networks. If the affinity is larger than a given threshold, the antibody is cloned to the related immune network. After the immune networks are constructed, they exhibit high affinity to the target patent. Finally, a series of experiments show that the proposed model can accurately predict the quality of new patents. The resulting automatic patent quality classification model provides manufacturers with improved insights into their company’s intellectual property strategy, product direction and long-term vision." .

Therefore, previous work offers an incomplete and somewhat reductionist view of corporate sustainability. In this article, we develop a holistic framework of corporate sustainability in which both the moral and technical aspects of sustainability are considered. We do so by integrating the ethical, normative perspective of the Catholic social teaching (CST) with the competitive view of the natural resource-based view. This framework highlights the importance of CST principles and ideas in developing executive moral competences such as moral sensitivity and awareness, and moral cognition and motivation. Moral competences, in turn, influence the organizational selection of environmental strategies, giving leaders the intrinsic motivation to promote both a longer-term stance on corporate sustainability efforts and a relentless search for greener business models. Such strategies move the firm closer towards achieving environmental sustainability. Hence, by bridging the individual, normative-ethical with the organizational, implementational levels of corporate sustainability, our framework provides a more realistic, coherent, and complete perspective on the complex process of achieving corporate sustainability." .

Drawing on survey data from 164 large firms, we use structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among four outcome variables. We provide support for three major findings. First, the Strategically Aligned Behavior of middle and lower managers is positively associated with both successful strategy implementation and the effectiveness of strategic planning, while the former is also positively related with the latter. These relationships are robust to accounting for the extent of participation by top or middle managers in the strategic planning process. Second, having top managers play a predominant role the strategic planning process fosters the positive relationship between successful strategy implementation and Organizational Performance. Third, having middle managers play a dominant role in the strategic planning process supports the significantly positive effect of Strategic Planning Effectiveness on Organizational Performance. Overall, we conclude that improvements in Organizational Performance result from the choice of participation of top and/or middle management in the strategy process." .

While a robust body of empirical and theoretical work suggests that government ownership suppresses innovation, the increasing global competitiveness of government-owned firms coupled with the transition of these firms’ competitive advantage from low-cost labor-focused to innovation-focused suggests we reconsider the relationship between government ownership and innovation. This paper develops and tests a theory that a minority level of government ownership has a positive influence on firm-level innovation, by substituting for a better-developed financial market and alleviating financial constraints. By combining the incentives and monitoring benefits of private ownership with the more “patient” shareholders of and protection from failure by the state, minority government ownership can provide an environment for firms to pursue otherwise risky innovative projects. The testing of this theory makes use of a large sample of Asian firms, and the results with respect to matched minority government-owned and privately held firms show that minority government ownership increases the likelihood of innovation among financially constrained firms; moreover, it especially increases the likelihood of process innovation (as opposed to product innovation), which is traditionally difficult to finance. The study’s results—which stand to benefit firms and governments worldwide—remain robust to alternative mechanisms and controls, as well as to a variety of sensitivity tests." .

We argue that the informal recruitment channel may increase job–education mismatches both directly (by inducing some workers to undertake careers in industries, professions, or firms where their comparative productive advantage is not fully exploited) and indirectly by negatively affecting spatial flexibility. In order to test these hypotheses, we estimate probit models with self-selection using ISFOL Plus survey data providing information on labour market entry channels, job-related migration and a “subjective” measure of overeducation. We find a robust positive impact of the use of the informal channel on overeducation and a robust negative effect of the use of this channel on migration. On the other hand, we find that migration reduces overeducation only in some geographical areas of the Italian territory. Overall, these findings suggest that a reform of employment services in Italy is needed in order to favour spatial flexibility, reduce the use of the informal channel and enhance the quality of job–education matches." .

We find that the key constraint to firm transition is firm capabilities, followed by the level of urbanisation, access to electricity and roads, and human capital, with financial constraints playing a lesser role.

However, empirical research is scarce on these aspects of automotive RE and warrants closer examination. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify problems or challenges in automotive RE with respect to communication and organisation structure. Using a multiple-case study approach, we collected data via 14 semi-structured interviews at one car manufacturer and one supplier. We tested our findings from the case study with a questionnaire distributed to practitioners in the automotive industry. Our results indicate that it is difficult but increasingly important to establish communication channels outside the fixed organisation structure and that responsibilities are often unclear. Product knowledge during early requirements elicitation and context knowledge later on is lacking. Furthermore, abstraction gaps between requirements on different abstraction levels leads to inconsistencies. For academia, we formulate a concrete agenda for future research.

In contrast to previous studies, we distinguish between the average systematic risk of REITs and their asymmetric risk in the sense of a disproportionate likelihood of joint negative return clusters between REITs and the stock market. We find that REITs with low systematic risk are typically small, with low short-term momentum, low turnover, high growth opportunities and strong long-term momentum. Holding systematic risk constant, the main driving forces of asymmetric risk are leverage and, to some extent, short-term momentum. Specifically, we find that leverage has an asymmetric effect on REIT return dependence that outweighs the extent to which it increases the average sensitivity of REIT equity to market fluctuations, explaining the strong negative impact of leverage on firm performance especially during crisis periods that has been documented in recent empirical work." .

The operations department is responsible for the quality improvement of a particular product and sells this product to end customers through the marketing department who controls the retail price and advertising effort. Our results suggest that compared with the administered transfer price, the negotiation between the operations department and the marketing department leads to a higher transfer price, and then a higher retail price, lower advertising effort and higher quality improvement effort.

In the context of this study, hotels are chosen as an exemplary field since it is one of the key leading economic sectors in Turkey. Building and maintaining brand loyalty and trust are the important themes for every firm in such competitive environment. Hotels, in this case, have made many efforts on branding to gain brand loyalty and brand trust from their customers and recently they have carried their efforts to social media to survive in online environment as well. But, in general hotels are booked via mediators like Booking.com etc., thus hotels’ own websites are not visited as an online store. The aim of this study is to identify the effect of social media marketing efforts on brand loyalty and brand trust for hotels, especially on hotels’ own websites. The effect of social media marketing efforts including (1) a clear website, (2) website security, (3) active and updated social media tools, (4) online interactivity and (5) collaboration with other useful websites on brand loyalty and trust were tested by using structural equations model. The results show the positive effects of a clear website, website security, online interactivity and collaboration with other useful websites on brand trust and the effect of brand trust on brand loyalty. The study is believed to be helpful to marketing managers of the hotels in terms of protecting their own online stores and meet their visitors first at their own websites. Also, crafting right online strategies to compete with other hotels and mediators is an important aim. The results of the study is believed to add to the extant literature in terms of social media marketing." .

We argue that CSO is a legitimacy signal consciously employed by firms to demonstrate their shareholder and specific non-shareholder orientations in the midst of institutional pressures emerging from country and industry contexts. Using a 7-code index of CSO on CEO–shareholder communications from India, we find that in general large firms in India exhibit a pre-dominant, significant and rising trend of pro-shareholder orientation in the six-year period immediately preceding the CSR law. Yet, we uncover significant industry differences in CSO potentially driven by four key factors: the degree of competitive dynamics, nature of products and services, extent of negative externalities and social activism, and exposure to international markets. Our findings support the view that while some minimum threshold of regulatory intervention is required to balance the interests of business with society, legislation raises questions in relation to the usefulness of a uniform one-size-fits-all CSR across all industries." .

In this paper, the ERP system based approach is presented to quality control and assurance work in light of seamless integration of in-process production data and information internally and therefore managing suppliers more effectively and efficiently. The Aerospace Manufacturing Quality Assurance Standard (BS/EN9100) is one of the most recognised and essential protocols for developing the industry-operated-and-driven quality assurance systems. The research investigates using the ERP based system as an enabler to implement BS/EN9100 quality management system at manufacturing SMEs and the associated implementation and application perspectives. An application case study on a manufacturing SME is presented by using the SAP based implementation, which helps further evaluate and validate the approach and application system development." .

The theory posits that hubris impairs moral awareness by causing decision makers to ignore external factors that otherwise drive such awareness. Additionally, these individuals apply a flawed subjective assessment of the decision they face which further impairs moral awareness. The predicted result is that hubris leads managers to invoke an amoral decision process which causes a higher incidence of unethical behavior among these individuals. An empirical study investigates the relationship between CEO hubris and the unethical practice of earnings manipulation. This study finds a significant correlation between CEO hubris and earnings manipulation at the firms they lead, an outcome broadly consistent with the theory developed." .

We consider the online scenario where a sequence of n jobs has to be scheduled non-preemptively on m machines so as to minimize the maximum completion time of any job. The best competitive ratio that can be achieved by deterministic online algorithms is in the range [1.88, 1.9201]. Currently no randomized online algorithm with a smaller competitiveness is known, for general m. In this paper we explore the power of job migration, i.e. an online scheduler is allowed to perform a limited number of job reassignments. Migration is a common technique used in theory and practice to balance load in parallel processing environments. As our main result we settle the performance that can be achieved by deterministic online algorithms. We develop an algorithm that is $$\\alpha _m$$ αm -competitive, for any $$m\\ge 2$$ m≥2 , where $$\\alpha _m$$ αm is the solution of a certain equation. For $$m=2$$ m=2 , $$\\alpha _2 = 4/3$$ α2=4/3 and $$\\lim _{m\\rightarrow \\infty } \\alpha _m = W_{-1}(-1/e^2)/(1+ W_{-1}(-1/e^2)) \\approx 1.4659$$ limm→∞αm=W-1(-1/e2)/(1+W-1(-1/e2))≈1.4659 . Here $$W_{-1}$$ W-1 is the lower branch of the Lambert W function. For $$m\\ge 11$$ m≥11 , the algorithm uses at most 7m migration operations. For smaller m, 8m to 10m operations may be performed. We complement this result by a matching lower bound: No online algorithm that uses o(n) job migrations can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than $$\\alpha _m$$ αm . We finally trade performance for migrations. We give a family of algorithms that is c-competitive, for any $$5/3\\le c \\le 2$$ 5/3≤c≤2 . For $$c= 5/3$$ c=5/3 , the strategy uses at most 4m job migrations. For $$c=1.75$$ c=1.75 , at most 2.5m migrations are used." .

Based on four comparative case studies of fast-launching clean tech startups in the USA (two of which were university-affiliated), this paper explains how some technology startups are able to develop innovative products, form organizations, internationalize, and release products into global markets very rapidly, and highlights implications for university-sourced ventures. Findings show that two processes, “product emergence” and “organization emergence,” have to be managed strategically, with time as a critical variable to be considered. This paper suggests that there are dynamic tensions between temporal, financial, and human resources in the technology startup process. To start up quickly, the new international technology venture compresses two parallel timelines: product launch and organization launch, which can also accelerate the internationalization process. This study identifies the organizational formation pivot as a risky but necessary transition from a lean, informal, fast-paced technology development project to a structured, legally compliant organization, in the case of a university-sourced venture fully independent from the university that spawned it, that can be trusted for transactions and investment." .

The model endogenously determines not only the timing of investments but also their capacities, the degree of overlap between the initial and the subsequent innovations, and the way the competitors resolve the dispute. It shows that the firms’ R&D competition in the burgeoning market is more likely to entail a lawsuit and distinctly differentiated products, while they easily agree on cross licensing to utilize each other’s works in the slow-growing market, leaving little difference between the products. From the perspective of public policy, it is clarified that the policy on patent scope cannot yield the first-best result in terms of the speed of innovation, and the welfare analysis shows that social welfare is higher when the conflict is settled via cross licensing. However, the weak protection on patent rights, which is shown to encourage cross licensing, does not always guarantee the highest level of social welfare since it weakens the leader’s bargaining power in the negotiation, leading to fewer advanced products with higher prices." .

In many cases, consumers may differ in their willingness-to-pay for the green products that firms should determine which segment to sell the green products to. This paper examines the role of costs, consumer’s green segmentation, and competition in firm’s green production decisions. We find that the cost conditions for green production is relaxed in competition cases compared with the monopolist case. Under competition, the traditional firm would possibly to defend his market share via decreasing the traditional product’s price, which leading to an equilibrium that green products are sold to green segment solely. And we show that in some cases, both traditional and green firms can benefit from a large green segment ratio and consumer’s premium differentiation.Big data contains huge value through which we can better understand consumers. Based on big data technologies development, consumers can be accurate segmented with improved indexes of green premium and segment ratio, thus these conclusions can provide guidance to green production in practice." .

Using two-wave longitudinal data from high schools in Helsinki, Finland (N = 523), we tested a mediation model with competencies as mediators between personality and entrepreneurial alertness and intention. The findings suggest that entrepreneurial alertness and career intention (a) are rather independent career development constructs of the emerging entrepreneurial mind-set, (b) are both an expression of an entrepreneurial personality structure, and (c) are predicted by different underlying competencies: leadership and self-esteem mediated the personality—entrepreneurial intention link, and leadership, creativity, and proactivity motivation the personality—entrepreneurial alertness link. Consistent with the balanced skill approach to entrepreneurship, the intraindividual variety of these competencies was also a valid mediator; it did not show incremental predictive power though.

In life cycle assessment of food supply chain, a particular environmental impact category from farming to distribution is aggregated. These values are widely used in determining which supply chain is performing more environmentally sound on the basis of a particular impact category. However, when different categories of environmental impacts are represented in one matrix, different impact categories can exhibit increasing and decreasing trends simultaneously for the same product. Moreover, different impact categories have different units of measurement. All of these factors make it difficult to clearly prefer one supply chain to the other. Therefore, a quantifiable indicator is desirable for each individual product which can represent all impact categories for a single product through a single index and can be easily comparable during decision making. This paper presents a new framework to compute a single index based on Life cycle assessment using vector space theory. This index can be utilized to compare the environmental sustainability among various food supply chains. The index is named as green value of a supply chain. The use of this proposed green value is explained through three case studies with different goals, scopes, system boundaries, and functional units. It is also shown that how the order of green value varies by changing the functional unit of the same product. The contribution of green value is the better interpretation of Life cycle assessment result for the purpose of decision making and is easily understandable to customers, manufacturers, policy makers, and other stakeholders." .

We review three major corporate responsibility perspectives, which we refer to as economic, critical, and politico-ethical. We analyse the major potential uses and pitfalls of the perspectives, and integrate the debate on these two levels. Our synthesis concludes that when a society has a robust division of moral labour in place, the responsibility of a corporation may be economic (as suggested under the economic perspective) without jeopardising democracy and sustainability (as reported under the critical perspective). Moreover, the economic role of corporations neither signifies the absence of deliberative democratic mechanisms nor business practices extending beyond compliance (as called for under the politico-ethical perspective). The study underscores the value of integrating different perspectives and multiple levels of analysis to present comprehensive descriptions and prescriptions of the responsibility phenomenon." .

In tandem with the development of CrM activities, criticism of CrM has increased; critics note that some CrM claims mislead consumers regarding their purchases’ donative impact. Critics such as consumers and nonprofit advocates are using ad parodies, noncommercial messages that mimic an actual advertisement. In this context, the study investigates how these ad parodies can result in a detrimental impact on consumers’ perceptual and behavioral evaluations of the sponsoring brand. By implementing a tightly controlled experiment comparing actual CrM campaigns and CrM parodies, the author shows that the detrimental effects of CrM parodies on brand attitude and word-of-mouth valence can be explained by greater skepticism toward the firm’s sincere and altruistic motivations. In addition, the author shows that a robust asymmetry emerges in which CrM ad parodies damage perceptual and behavioral evaluations of brands more than actual CrM campaigns improve them. The authors replicate the results for two kinds of critics and two types of brands. The results provide useful implications for theory and practice, documenting the backfire effect of poorly designed CrM, which may urge brands to move toward more self-regulation of CrM practices." .

Previous work on the nature of the relationship between labor unions and environmentalists, mostly drawn from case studies and interviews with union leaders, has not reached consistent conclusions. To provide a realistic examination of the relationship, we apply an empirical analysis to investigate attitudes of individual union members toward the stringency of environmental policies. Using the General Social Survey, we examine grass-root union members’ preferences for public environmental spending options. Contrary to prevailing perceptions of conflict, we find a positive association between union membership and the choosing to increase environmental spending. Further, investigating the environmental attitude of union members in heavily regulated industries, we do not find evidence to support the argument that these laborers tend to be unfavorable toward environment. Our results also suggest that the level of regulation an industry is facing does not appear to have a statistically significant effect on respondent’s choice of environmental spending." .

MethodsWe analyzed a cross-sectional survey of 26,611 full-time employees from the third wave of the Korean Working Conditions Survey in 2011. Experience of absenteeism and presenteeism during the past 12 months was assessed through self-reports. Employment condition was classified into six categories based on two contract types (parent firm and subcontract) and three contract durations [permanent (≥1 year, no fixed term), long term (≥1 year, fixed term), and short term (<1 year, fixed term)]. ResultsWe found opposite trends between the association of nonstandard employment with absenteeism and presenteeism after adjusting for covariates. Compared to parent firm—permanent employment, which has been often regarded as a standard employment, absenteeism was not associated or negatively associated with all nonstandard employment conditions except parent firm—long term employment (OR 1.88; 95 % CI 1.57, 2.26). However, presenteeism was positively associated with parent firm—long term (OR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.42, 1.91), subcontract—long term (OR 1.61; 95 % CI 1.12, 2.32), and subcontract—short term (OR 1.26; 95 % CI 1.02, 1.56) employment. ConclusionsOur results found that most nonstandard employment may increase risk of presenteeism, but not absenteeism. These results suggest that previous findings about the protective effects of nonstandard employment on absenteeism may be explained by nonstandard workers being forced to work when sick." .

What roles do institutional entrepreneurs play in the different stages of evolution of the business model? In the past four decades, the fabless model (which allows a semiconductor firm to operate without a fabrication unit) has changed the global semiconductor industry with significant impact in the Asian regions. In this paper, we trace the origin and evolution of the fabless model through a mixed-method approach, utilizing historic milestones, events, and financial data of publicly-traded semiconductor firms. We have applied theories of institutional entrepreneurship and adaptive ecosystem to identify four stages in this history: differentiation, mobilization, legitimization, and symbiosis to conceptualize the fabless model’s co-creation and co-evolution. Our findings indicate that actions of institutional entrepreneurs within specific temporal locations and structures played a crucial role in the fabless business model’s origin and co-evolution." .

The consumers at the demand markets reflect their preferences through the demand price functions, which depend on the product demands and on the average level of cybersecurity in the supply chain network. We identify the supply chain network vulnerability to cyberattacks as well as that of the individual retailers. We demonstrate that the governing Nash equilibrium conditions can be formulated as a variational inequality problem and we provide a novel alternative formulation, along with the accompanying theory. We also propose an algorithm for the alternative formulation, which yields, at each iteration, closed form expressions in product transactions, security levels, and Lagrange multipliers associated with the budget constraints. We then apply the algorithm to compute solutions to a spectrum of numerical supply chain network cybersecurity investment examples. The examples broaden our understanding of the impacts of the addition of retailers, changes in budgets, demand price functions, and financial damages, on equilibrium product transactions and cybersecurity investments, as well as on the supply chain network vulnerability and retailer vulnerability under budget constraints." .

We attempt to answer two questions in this study: (1) Do these sinful firms actively advertise their CSR engagements compared to non-sinful firms? And (2) do their advertising efforts really yield increased financial performance? Positing that advertising not only can make sinful firms’ good deeds visible, but also can highlight the contradiction between these firms’ stigma and their prosocial activities, we claim that sinful firms are likely to advertise their CSR engagement to overcome their stigmatized firm image, but these advertising activities will make the firms’ performance vulnerable by inducing skepticism from stakeholders. Using KLD database in conjunction with COMPUSTAT and Center for Research in Security Prices from 1991 to 2010, where 337 firms are involved in the controversial sinful industries, namely tobacco, alcohol, gaming, firearms, military, and nuclear power, we examine the effect of advertising spending of sinful firms’ CSR engagement on performance vulnerability, which is instantiated with idiosyncratic risk. The empirical results indicate that sinful firms increase their advertising expenditure when they engage in CSR programs, but these efforts for advertising CSR tend to increase idiosyncratic risk. This finding indicates that even though sinful firms can benefit from engaging in socially responsible initiatives, advertising their CSR efforts may backfire." .

Distinctions between the sexes that may have previously been presumed to be due to “nurture” may now also be demonstrably related to “nature.” Here, we report recent neuroscience findings related to males’ and females’ brain structures and brain chemistry, along with the results of recent neuroeconomic studies. We learn not only that male and female brains are structured differently, but also that different portions of their brains are used for the same tasks, often leading to identical conclusions. Neuroeconomic studies also demonstrate that the effects of hormones—most notably, oxytocin and testosterone—urge males and females to both think and behave differently in ethical situations. We suggest that examination of these new results could benefit six areas of business ethics research: trust, moral decision-making, organizational justice, moral development, the ethic of care, and female management styles. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for business practice, suggesting that it may be ethical to allow men and women to be treated differently in the workplace: such treatment may be advantageous not only for the workers’ firms, but also for the workers themselves." .

One major component of after-sale service involves service parts management. However, service parts businesses are typically seen as add-ons to existing business models, and are not well integrated with primary businesses. Consequently, many service parts operations are managed using ad-hoc practices that are often subordinated to primary businesses. Early research in this area has been instrumental in assisting organizations to begin optimizing some aspects of service parts management. However, performance goals for service parts management are often ill-defined. Further, because these service parts businesses are often subordinated to primary businesses within a firm, the use of newer big data applications to help manage these processes is almost completely absent. Herein, we develop a framework that seeks to define service parts performance goals for the purpose of outlining where scholars and practitioners can further examine where, how, and why big data applications can be employed to enhance service parts management performance." .

In particular, this is the case in the service sector. We divide the service sector into a tradable and a non-tradable part using an approach to identify tradable industries utilizing a measure of regional concentration of production. We examine whether the probability of displacement is higher and income losses after displacement greater for workers in tradable services and manufacturing (tradable) than in non-tradable services. We also analyze whether the probability of re-employment is higher for workers displaced from tradable services and manufacturing than from non-tradable services. We find that in the 2000s the probability of displacement is relatively high in tradable services in comparison to non-tradable services and manufacturing. On the other hand, the probability of re-employment is higher for those displaced from tradable services. The largest income losses are found for those who had been displaced from manufacturing. Interestingly, the income losses of those displaced from manufacturing seems mainly to be due to longer spells of non-employment, whereas for those displaced in tradable services lower wages in their new jobs compared to their pre-displacement jobs appears to play a larger role." .

The research results based on a sample collected from firms in Vietnam show that TMT trust climate is a key mediator which can convert CEO TFL into better performance outcomes. Moderated-mediation analyses further reveal that the mediating effect of TMT trust climate is more significant in less dynamic environments. Our study contributes to the TFL theory by identifying a critical mechanism that intervenes in the relationship between CEO-level TFL and firm performance. We reveal how CEOs exert leadership influence on subsequent TMT dynamics and performance outcomes by navigating external environments. Moreover, our study offers insights with regard to the trust theory by uncovering TMT-level intragroup trust as a mediator, and thus complements most of prior examinations that focus on the moderating role of trust in workplace team contexts." .

Enterprise system is intended to enable automation as it offers the availability of real-time data, improved process visibility, and an increased level of automation. In this paper, we propose to use cloud computing technologies to share computing resources and support advanced features such as on demand payments in human resource management (HRM) sub-system, and we focus on the applications in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The presented work consists of the following four parts. First, we discuss the cloud computing concept extensively in terms of the definitions, the classifications, and main characteristics, as well as its applications. Second, we perform the game analysis on the cloud computing of HRM in SMEs. Third, we propose new infrastructure of cloud computing to implement HRM in SMEs. Fourth, we illustrate the applications of the proposed infrastructure in HRM; in particular, we discuss some cloud-computing-based enterprise systems application systems including human resources management alliance, human resources management consulting services, and human resources shared services for process reengineering. Our innovation is the primary attempt of applying cloud computing technologies to elevate HRM sub-system in enterprise systems for SMEs." .

In particular, management shortcomings and institutional deficits—which are partly related to cultural issues—frequently impede the realization of responsible business practices in emerging and developing countries. It is widely established in theory that industry self-regulation constitutes a particularly promising approach for overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, it is still an open question as to whether industry initiatives effectively promote responsible standards in practice. This contribution aims to enrich the current discussion about the power of industry self-regulation to ensure responsible labor standards in factories in emerging and developing countries. For this purpose, we analyze the ICTI CARE Process (ICP), the self-regulation initiative of the international toy industry, that aims to promote responsible business practices in Chinese toy factories. The assessment of the ICP shows that corporations’ buying behavior is decisive in order for industry self-regulation to become an appropriate means of improving labor standards. Based on the insights from the study and from theoretical reasoning, we develop a framework for effective industry self-regulation that integrates the perspective of factories." .

The existing innovation literature does not emphasize budgeting as an important contributor to product innovation, even though it recognizes that poor budgeting may weaken the capability to innovate. However, the budgeting literature suggests that budgets can be used in different ways to improve firm performance. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the frequency of budget preparation and the interactive use of budgets are associated with product innovation and firm performance. The empirical data were collected, through a web-based survey, from CFOs and CEOs in 132 Finnish firms. The results of our partial least squares analysis indicate that the frequency of budget preparation positively affects product innovation through interactive budget use, which supports our hypothesis. Furthermore, the frequency of budget preparation and interactive budget use do have a direct positive relationship with firm performance, but one mediated by product innovation. Therefore, this study contributes to the innovation and budgeting literature by showing the frequency of budget preparation and interactive use of budgets to be two separate and important factors in product innovation. The results also show that the relationship between budgets and product innovation and performance are different in defender and prospector firms." .

However, a company cannot offer high level of service for all products. In this sense, one of the ways used to optimize the activities for order picking is the study of storage location assignment problem (SLAP). Thus, this paper proposed a multi-criteria decision model to perform the products classification and to solve the SLAP in a multi-layer warehouse. The ELECTRE TRI method is used to define the shelf level for each product, and the ELECTRE III method is used to establish a fixed location for each product on the shelf it belongs to. The great advantage of this model is that there is not trade-off among the criteria, and it is able to consider several criteria simultaneously. However, the main goal is not optimization, but the search for a storage operations performance balance, considering multiple criteria, allowing for a better inventory management when considering profitability criteria, for example, and improvement in the order picking operations, through the demand and space required criteria. In addition, it considers the preferences of the decision maker." .

Manches Unternehmen geht in seinem Engagement strategisch vor, um gezielt lokalen Herausforderungen zu begegnen. Der vorliegende Artikel befasst sich mit der Verantwortungsübernahme von Unternehmen für die Stadtteilentwicklung. Am Beispiel der Duisburger Familienunternehmen Haniel und Grillo wird aufgezeigt, wie Unternehmen in ihrer Rolle als gute Nachbarn durch gesellschaftliches Engagement ihr Umfeld mitgestalten und dabei zu Raumproduzenten in der Stadtteilentwicklung werden können. Die spezifische Ausgangssituation im Stadtteil sowie die wirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen in der Kommune bilden dabei einen Erklärungshintergrund für das Engagement. Die untersuchten Unternehmen weisen eine ausgeprägte lokale Kompetenz hinsichtlich der jeweiligen Notwendigkeiten und Möglichkeiten der Stadtteilentwicklung auf. Sie werden so zu kompetenten Partnern öffentlicher und zivilgesellschaftlicher Akteure, weswegen es sich lohnt, das Thema zukünftig sowohl in der Theorie als auch in der Praxis verstärkt aus der Governance-Perspektive zu adressieren." .

Management of airlines and airports often consider failures to comply with safety-related regulations as important contributors to safety occurrences. To address the issue of compliance, approaches based on external regulation of the employees’ behavior were proposed. Unfortunately, an externally imposed control is often not internalized by employees and has a short-term effect on their performance. To achieve a long-term effect, employees need to be internally motivated to adhere to regulations. To understand the role of motivation for compliance in ground service organizations, in this paper a formal agent-based model is proposed based on theories from social science with a wide empirical support. The model incorporates cognitive, social, and organizational aspects. The model was simulated and partially validated by a case study performed at a real airline ground service organization. The model was able to reproduce behavioral patterns related to compliance of the platform employees in this study. Based on the model, global sensitivity analysis was performed. The results of this analysis together with the simulation results were used to generate recommendations to improve compliance." .

Firms can price discriminate based on perfect data on consumer addresses and (possibly) imperfect data on consumer flexibility. We show that firms’ location choices depend on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility. Precisely, when consumers are relatively homogeneous, equilibrium locations are socially optimal regardless of the quality of customer flexibility data. However, when consumers are relatively differentiated, firms make socially optimal location choices only when customer flexibility data becomes perfect. These results are driven by the optimal strategy of a firm on its turf, monopolization or market-sharing, which in turn depends on consumer heterogeneity in flexibility. Our analysis is motivated by the availability of customer data, which allows firms to practice third-degree price discrimination based on both consumer characteristics relevant in spatial competition, addresses and transport cost parameters." .

Seven hundred and eighty employees and top management from logistics companies were sampled. The data were analyzed using factor analysis, structural equation modeling techniques, and one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that social expectations, organizational support, and stakeholder pressure were the important antecedents for the adoption of corporate environmental responsibility and green practices. In the path analysis, social expectations had the greatest impact on both stakeholder pressure and green practice adoption. Moreover, we found that the higher the job titles were, the more willing they were to adopt green practices. This indicated that the current top management of Korean logistics companies is well aware of being mandated to make a commitment to corporate environmental responsibility and green practices." .

A cross effect is defined as the effect which a marketing variable used for a certain product category exerts on purchases of another category. Using Dirichlet process mixture models with multivariate probit components we analyze purchase incidences of 24,047 shopping visits of a random sample of 1500 households. Independent variables of these models encompass marketing variables for 25 product categories and household attributes. We discuss differences between the two best performing models, a full model which includes both cross effects and cross category dependences, and a related restricted model which ignores cross effects. We obtain several high and significant differences with respect to category constants and cross category dependences between these two models. We also present explanations for the larger (in absolute terms) cross effects of features or displays. We demonstrate that by ignoring cross effects management runs the risk to obtain in many product categories too optimistic forecasts of sales revenue changes due to promotions. In contrast to previous related work suggesting not to use promotions which are not tailored to individual households in any of the investigated categories, we obtain support for such promotions in at least 48 % of the 25 product categories. In addition, based on the full model we demonstrate that often different categories are appropriate for promotions which are targeted at household clusters." .

With an analysis based on extensive interviews with top executive leaders in Chinese enterprises, we thus show that (1) integrating compassion and self-cultivation enriches our understanding of the moral growth of compassion; (2) compassion affects performance outcomes at the individual, relational, and organizational levels; and (3) self-cultivation and compassion have an ultimate interaction effect on organizational performance outcomes." .

Pricing and green innovation strategies in integrated and decentralized channels are computed and compared, and a two-part tariff contract is designed to coordinate the decentralized supply chain. A Nash bargaining model is further developed to distribute the extra-profit between channel members. A numerical example is conducted to explore the impacts of green effectiveness and operational inefficiency effect on optimal/equilibrium solutions and coordination. The main results show that the green innovation investment, energy efficiency level and channel profit of integrated channel are larger than those of decentralized one, but the relationship of sales prices under two channel structures depends on system parameters. Green effectiveness exerts a positive effect on optimal/equilibrium solutions. The coordinator’s coordination capability is improved by green effectiveness, but weakened by operational inefficiency effect." .

This paper studies how the addition of reserve capacity in the supply chain—one of the most common strategies in contingency plans against supply disruption—can alleviate the effects of supply disruption on product and income streams and total supply chain profit. We also perform a preliminary study to find the potential implications of utilizing excess production capacity for alternative uses particularly when a firm tries selling some of its intermediate products to an external buyer who in turn could process them into finished products and compete with the firm in the same markets. We formulate a network design optimization model for supply chain contingency planning and present a decomposition procedure which exploits the natural separation between the logistics and pricing decisions in the model.

However, there are some organizations whose purpose is not exclusively economic to the extent that they seek to constitute common good. Building on Christian ethics as a starting point, our article shows how the pursuit of the common good of the firm can serve as a guide for humanistic management. It provides two principles that humanistic management can attempt to implement: first, that community good is a condition for the realization of personal good, and second, that community good can only be promoted if it is oriented towards personal good. To better understand which community good can favor personal good and how it can be achieved, we examine two recent humanistic movements—Conscious Capitalism and Economy of Communion—that strive to participate in the common good. From the analysis of these two movements, we identify a shared managerial willingness to adopt the two principles. Moreover, we also reveal that Conscious Capitalism and Economy of Communion present different ways of linking community good and personal good, and therefore, different means exist for firms to participate in the common good." .

By combining elements primarily of neo-institutional theory with Bourdieu’s theory of practice, we construct a theoretical framework to examine the extent to which social responsibility activity is modified or informed by a distinctive faith perspective. Given that neo-institutional theory predicts a convergence of structures and practices between different organisations operating in the same institutional sector, this research draws on a single case study focusing on social responsibility activity in six different Church of England dioceses and shows that the opposite is actually the case: there is evidence of a significant degree of divergence in terms of organisational practice within the same institutional structure. Reasons for that were found to be the impact of human agency and loose institutional structures. This paper thus contributes to the understanding of social responsibility in religious organisations by exploring the dynamics between institutional pressures, organisational context and individual agents operating in the field of faith-based social responsibility. It thereby also contributes to neo-institutional theory." .

Iteration has positive effects, such as enabling progressive generation of knowledge, enabling concurrency, and integrating necessary changes, but it also increases duration and cost of a project.

This article contributes a literature summary and integrating taxonomy to clarify the different perspectives on iteration. It brings together insights into iteration gained from different research communities (mainly design and product development, alongside selected work in construction management and software project management) and different research approaches (including conceptual frameworks, mathematical and simulation models, case studies and surveys, and protocol studies). By differentiating the issues and providing a uniform terminology, the article maps insights developed to date and may help situate future analyses of iterative processes." .

The sustainable manufacturing system includes economic, environmental, and social sustainabilities. Green manufacturing enhances the environmental sustainability but, it also affects the economic and social sustainabilities. The compulsion to follow the environmental rules and regulation in any business activity has increased the awareness for the use of green products, recyclable materials for packaging, reduction of carbon emission, etc. Due to the involvement of extra costs in green manufacturing, some ignorance in the implementation of green practices may be observed. To ensure sustainable systems, selection of suppliers based on green performance measures is very important. This study evaluates the suppliers’ performances based on Green Practices as follows: environmental management and pollution control, cost, quality, and flexibility using the fuzzy-extended Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality approach. This approach helps the managers to incorporate the linguistic decision of the decision makers and convert it into quantitative scale. This method is used to eliminate and outrank the poor performers. As poor performers are outranked, this approach helps to select the most suitable green suppliers as per organization’s requirement." .

Three different scenarios emerge: constant technological leadership, the technological leapfrogging and symmetric outcome with or without potential spillovers. R&D is maximal for the first scenario and minimal for the symmetric play under the threat of spillover with endogenous specialization of firms’ activities in cases of constant leadership and leapfrogging. Definition of technological competition intensity as inverse to the technology gap allows to recover inverted-U relationship between those two in a multidimensional context." .

However, the ability of a brand to transfer its brand loyal customers from the parent to the extension category has been widely neglected. Brand loyalty can be regarded as a consequence of the underlying assumption of customers transferring their quality perceptions, their brand knowledge, and their experience with the brand from one category to the other. We find empirical evidence that consumers who are loyal to the brand in the leading (parent) product category show a higher probability to be loyal to that same brand in another (extension) category compared to those consumers who are not loyal in the leading category. Moreover, as the overall success of the extension includes positive retroactive effects of the extension product on the parent product or brand, the arising question is whether there are differences between extension product categories regarding their attachment to the parent category and their ability to stimulate brand loyal purchases in the parent category, i.e., speaking of ‘leader’ and ‘follower’ categories in terms of brand loyal purchase behavior. This might even hold true for the relationship of any two categories the brand competes." .

This study examines the meaning and value of resources within a social structure in order to extend the boundary conditions of existing research on resources. Based on a two-step content analysis of the meaning and value of resources in Chinese universities, this study identifies three types of social-oriented resources (resources that help organizations achieve social goals). These contrast with economic-oriented resources (resources that help organizations achieve economic goals) in markets. We also find three strategies that create the value of social-oriented resources. The findings regarding the meaning and value of social-oriented resources uncover the sociality of resources that complement the economic perspective and highlight the importance of understanding organizational competitive advantage from a sociological perspective." .

Along with its detrimental effects on the environment, such practice is now deemed unsustainable. This phenomenon has led to the growth for utilisation of biomass in the production of biofuels, biochemical and other related bioproducts. This waste-to-wealth strategy is no doubt highly beneficial to the society. However, the major challenge in the commercialisation of bioproducts production includes the complex conversion processes and the uncertainty in the supply and sources of biomass. Therefore, efficient supply chain management and optimisation is essential to overcome these barriers and variables that may constrain the development of a competitive and sustainable bioproducts market. This overview provides an extensional definition of biomass-to-bioproducts supply chain and systematically describes the problems and decisions along this chain. It also identifies the characteristics of a sustainable integrated biomass supply chain, and finally presents an overview of biomass supply chain synthesis and optimisation methods. Based on the existing research gap, the key challenges and potential future works are highlighted. This paper will provide readers with an initial point to understand the concept of sustainable biomass supply chain management and the synthesis and optimisation of sustainable biomass supply chain models." .

To this end, project managers, and managers in general, design and assess different projects with the purpose of achieving efficient processes, reducing costs and waste, increasing product and service quality, developing new products and services, enhancing customer relationship management, optimising enterprise resources, and so on. However, it is well-known that managing enterprise resources in order to accomplish effective completion of projects is a complex task to carry out. Furthermore, it has been recognised that the way staff actually understands the purpose of a project, the way they perform different project activities, and how they are able to influence project design and assessment are key factors for influencing the success of a project. This paper presents a systemic methodology to design and assess projects more effectively and efficiently based on program logic models and system dynamics with the aim of facilitating a clear understanding of the needs, purposes, goals, activities and tasks of a project among its stakeholders towards achieving success." .

Thus, inter-organizational information systems (IOIS) play a critical role in present day organizations and their relationships with business partners. Nevertheless, potential benefits that can be achieved from an IOIS implementation are tightly connected to the achievement of a critical number of adopters among business partners. One primary strategy introduced in this context is the exertion of coercive pressure to persuade business partners to adopt. However, results of prior investigations on the influence of coercive pressure on organizational adoption decisions have varied, while experimental investigations of coercive pressure as a strategy to foster adoption of IOIS among business partners have remained scarce. This study conducts a controlled field experiment on organizational level to investigate the effect of applied coercive pressure on the adoption of IOIS among 126 business partners of a medium-sized firm in Germany. Results present empirical evidence for a positive effect of coercive pressure. Assuming a configurational perspective, several organizational characteristics are further hypothesized to moderate this relationship. The type of industry and the degree of technology readiness are found to be significant moderators. The results emphasize the importance of a configurational perspective in investigations on the organizational level, and provide decision-makers with valuable insights into the mechanisms that drive the effect of coercive pressure as a strategy to foster adoption of IOIS among business partners." .

Volatility interactions across markets may lower the effectiveness of diversification strategies to mitigate price risks and should be taken into account when analyzing the pricing behavior of different agricultural commodities. We follow a multivariate GARCH approach to evaluate the time evolution of conditional correlations and volatility transmission across corn, wheat, and soybeans price returns on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. The period of analysis is from 1998 to 2012. The estimation results indicate a lack of lead‐lag relationships between corn, wheat, and soybeans price returns at the mean level. We find, however, important volatility spillovers across commodities, particularly at the weekly and monthly level. Wheat and corn seem to play a major role in terms of volatility transmission. Despite the supposed higher financial market integration of agricultural commodities, we do not observe that agricultural markets have become more interdependent in recent years." .

The results reveal that psychological capital moderates the direct and indirect relationships between positive display rule perceptions and emotional exhaustion. Psychological capital also moderates the relationship between deep acting, but not surface acting, and emotional exhaustion. These findings suggest that psychological capital generally plays a positive role in the emotion regulation process. It is also noted that although psychological capital can reduce employees’ emotional exhaustion, employees with high psychological capital who practice surface acting may suffer increased emotional exhaustion. Suggestions are offered accordingly for organizations that wish to enhance their employees’ psychological capital and to reduce the negative effects of emotional labor." .

The relevance of this research is based on the approach to theories of skills development, and the main purpose is to identify the skills developed by the students from management courses and compare it to the skills needed by the organizations to be competitive in the market. In this stage of the research, the skills needed by the organizations were identified through a document analysis of prospective studies conducted in industrial sectors developed in the last 15 years. In order to verify whether these skills are developed in the management courses, an online survey was conducted among distance learning University students from 2011 to 2014. The research problem considered the analytical dimension of skills development in organizations anchored to the following research questions: What were the skills identified in the prospective studies? What has been the level of skills developed in courses on management in e-learning mode in higher education? What were the relationships between the perceived skills development and various factors such as gender, employed/unemployed, type of organization and job variables? What are the lessons learnt in order to propose a theoretical model developing skills in higher education management courses? This study is centred on the research of more relevant work skills which can contribute to organizations’ performance and competitiveness in the market." .

Critical incident technique was used to collect concrete examples from 45 managers and non-managerial employees of observed managerial behaviors that they perceived as effective and ineffective. While the emphasis was given to both effective and ineffective managerial behaviors with a holistic approach, 38 distinctive behavioral categories of effective and ineffective managerial behavior were derived. Furthermore, the seven overarching indigenous themes of Korean managerial behavior emerged, offering an insightful, contextually relevant, and richly described understanding of perceived managerial and leadership effectiveness in a Korean context. The authors identified and described several Korean cultural concepts embedded in the indigenous themes, which may confirm implicit leadership theory. After discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings, the authors provide the limitations of this study and several directions for future research. As one of the first attempts at identifying indigenous Korean managerial and leadership effectiveness, this study could become a cornerstone for advanced indigenous empirical studies and a catalyst for dialogue related to indigenous managerial and leadership research, especially in Korean and other East Asian contexts." .

Electronic commerce leads to constantly changing customer needs, therefore quick action and collaboration between production and the market is essential. Meanwhile, the abundant transactional data generated by electronic commerce allows us to explore browsing behaviors, habits, preferences and even characteristics of customers, which can help companies to understand their customer’s needs more clearly. Traditional supply chain management (SCM) simply cannot keep up with electronic commerce because demand forecasts are constantly changing. Customer demands create and affect the whole supply chain. The purpose of SCM is to satisfy the customers who support the company by paying for the products; so meeting changing customer needs should be incorporated into SCM by developing demand chain management (DCM). In this paper, we explore how DCM can perform better in the electronic commerce environment based on studying website behavior data and using data analytics tools. The results show that DCM performs much better when paired with the benefits of electronic commerce and Big Data than traditional SCM methods." .

We identify the origins of their wealth and point to the growing number of wealthy heirs to the enterprises founded by their forebears and the implications for succession and the management of these enterprises. We compare and contrast China’s billionaires with comparable lists of billionaires in the United States.

Using data from 508 Chinese firms, we demonstrate that the stabilizing bundling process is negatively related to the speed of strategic change, and enriching and pioneering bundling processes are positively related to the speed of strategic change. Importantly, we find that specific effects of resource bundling on strategic change speed are influenced by different types of external social relationships. These results suggest that managerial capabilities and external ties affect the speed with which strategic change can be implemented." .

It provides a long-term competitive edge through geomanagement. As a niche area of the global tourism industry, geotourism is growing rapidly due to the high appreciation of landscape and geological phenomena. Fostering the nature and cultural sustainability, geotourists seek geological wonders framed in a natural and cultural authenticity. Responding to the call of the Egyptian Tourism Ministry to study non-traditional patterns of tourism, this study aims to investigate the factors predicting the behavioural intention to take geotours among international tourists. The study incorporated new constructs in the theory of reasoned action to achieve its aim. Employing structural equation modelling, findings revealed that behavioural intention of taking geotours is affected by geotourists’ attributes, attitudes towards geotours, cultural heritage and subjective norms. The study introduces useful implications to policymakers and managers of tourism authorities in developing countries." .

As an ion channel, CFTR must form a continuous pathway across the cell membrane—referred to as the channel pore—for the rapid electrodiffusional movement of ions. This review summarizes our current understanding of the architecture of the channel pore, as defined by electrophysiological analysis and molecular modeling studies. This includes consideration of the characteristic functional properties of the pore, definition of the overall shape of the entire extent of the pore, and discussion of how the molecular structure of distinct regions of the pore might control different facets of pore function. Comparisons are drawn with closely related proteins that are not ion channels, and also with structurally unrelated proteins with anion channel function. A simple model of pore function is also described." .

However, specialized treatises tend to treat it through ideal statements. Highlighting the materialization of abstract reasoning, those demonstrations serve the scientific legitimation of quadratura practice, possibly circumscribed to enlightened scientific and artistic circles, rather than the dissemination of procedures aiming to train people in the projection craftsmanship. This may even be the best-kept secret of the quadratura painters. In this context, this paper is focused on Sena’s quadratura (1754), at the church of Santarém’s Jesuit College, where under Vieira’s statements exposed in his treatise on perspective (Tractado de Prospectiva, Codex 5170, Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, 1716), we will disclose procedures based upon common practices of the painter’s workshop concerning the outline and projection of the image." .

Our proposal consists in aligning ideation to innovation strategies through the use of avatars in a virtual world. On the basis of the Persona method and the Proteus effect, we design avatars’ appearance so as to implement a Need-seeker or a Technology-driver innovation strategy. To test the effectiveness of this avatar-mediated innovation tool, we conducted an experiment in a French company. Two groups of highly qualified employees from the innovation department had to find applications for smart windows in public transportation. Both groups experienced immersion in a virtual transportation situation: one group embodied avatars resembling Inventors, whereas the other group embodied Personas representing users of public transportation. As expected, avatars’ appearance proved to influence the creative production: the Inventor condition led to a techno-centered ideation profile, oriented toward technological solutions, while the Persona condition led to more user-centered, needs-oriented ideas. Consistently, Inventors’ production tended to be better evaluated through industrial criteria and Personas’ production tended to be better evaluated by transportation users. We discuss the use of avatar-mediated creativity as a strategic tool for companies seeking to innovate." .

We observe that unwinding the cross-shareholding between banks and corporations and mutual transfers among non-financial institutions allows for efficiency gain. Furthermore, the ownership transfer to private and foreign individuals is consistently associated with high market value, which implies that individuals’ transfers lead to an increase in efficiency." .

Through an in-depth study of the foundings and failures that have occurred in Chinese and Italian textile and clothing firms over the last two decades, this study develops analysis of demographic and organisational ecology, and investigates the processes of legitimation and competition. The results of the study indicate that the district’s Italian and Chinese firms experienced two distinct evolutionary phases during the research period: while the former declined, the latter saw development in spite of recent economic crises. The analyses also demonstrate how the evolution of Italian and Chinese populations moved in opposite directions: as the first failed, the second saw increases in the number of its foundings. This indicates the presence of a substitution effect between each firms’ population at the district level." .

Risk-taking in group affiliated firms leads to higher performance, compared to independent firms, but the impact of proactivity is attenuated. Utilizing Indian data, we show that risk-taking may undermine rather than improve business performance, but this effect is not present in business groups. Proactivity enhances performance, but less so in business groups. Firms can also enhance performance by technological knowledge acquisition, but these effects are not significantly different for various ownership categories." .

We consider the franchise chain as a specific learning organizational form and explore whether this structure handles knowledge and builds competences according to an idiosyncratic pattern. Concretely, we empirically identify differences in the architecture of competences of franchised vs independent shops in the car maintenance industry in France, and analyse some causes for those differences. Thanks to in depth interviews coupled with lexical and quantitative analyses we find that franchised shops do master specific competences. However, the distinctive competences held by franchisees do not necessarily reflect franchisors’ knowledge, and are not exclusively the consequences of a shared identity in the franchise chain. We conclude that the development of franchise cannot be explained by competence‐related arguments only, knowledge and competences being managed in distinctive ways within different franchising networks." .

Furthermore, multiple case studies have been conducted in British SMEs to explore the potential of CIM with the help of the proposed model. The result shows that there is lack of long-term strategic vision of the top management in HHW company. Whereas, a survey of SMEs have pointed out increase in reliability of delivery date, throughput/production volume, level of product customisation, reduction in manufacturing costs, WIP inventory and improvement in the image of the companies with the implementation of CIM." .

We build on conservation of resources theory to develop a leader–follower crossover model of the impact of authentic leadership on followers’ job satisfaction through leaders’ and followers’ work–life balance. The model integrates authentic leadership and crossover literatures to suggest that followers perceive authentic leaders to better balance their professional and private lives, which in turn enables followers to achieve a positive work–life balance, and ultimately makes them more satisfied in their jobs. Data from working adults collected in a correlational field study (N = 121) and an experimental study (N = 154) generally supported indirect effects linking authentic leadership to job satisfaction through work–life balance perceptions. However, both studies highlighted the relevance of followers’ own work–life balance as a mediator more so than the sequence of leaders’ and followers’ work–life balance. We discuss theoretical implications of these findings from a conservation of resources perspective, and emphasize how authentic leadership represents an organizational resource at the work–life interface. We also suggest practical implications of developing authentic leadership in organizations to promote employees’ well-being as well as avenues for future research." .

Credit guarantees are denoted by the total amount of credit guarantees provided by three authorities in Korea, and the business cycle consists of two volatilities, that is, real GDP per capita and industrial product index. We used Toda and Yamamoto Granger causality test and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach to examine the existence of cointegration and to find out the short-run and long-run relationship between credit guarantees and business cycle. The ARDL bounds testing approach has an advantage that it can be used when I (0) and I (1) variables are mixed. Based on the ARDL bounds test approach, we find that credit guarantees for SMEs mitigate business cycle fluctuations in the short run, but find no significant effects in the long run." .

Using an international sample of 1233 firm-year observations over the period 2007–2014, the findings document the impact of the brand reputation and industry specialisation of assurance providers on the level of assurance. The probability of detecting material errors and omissions in a sustainability report is higher if it is verified by a Big 4 auditing firm and by an industry expert as an assurance practitioner. The greater experience in providing audit services and the relevant skills and training provided by Big 4 firms, as well as the greater knowledge and experience of industry experts, increase the propensity to report more accurate opinions about a sustainability report. The findings are robust for alternative measures for the level of assurance and the industry specialisation." .

We do not intend to focus on a specific industry like financial institutions, but rather develop a more generic approach. By establishing the added benefits of a risk governance approach vis-a-vis corporate governance and risk management, we will develop a theoretical foundation covering a conceptual understanding and implicating major tasks. Risk governance bridges corporate governance and risk management and is fully aligned with the objective of long-term value optimization of companies. We will conclude by sketching out the risk governance research agenda ahead." .

First, using trading volume, the authors establish that the perceived value of moral capital generated by news involving institutional (e.g., environmental and community) stakeholders is less clear to investors than that of the news involving technical (e.g., customers and employees) stakeholders. Subsequently, the authors analyze abnormal returns from 565 unique firm events—each comprising at least one positive and one negative stakeholder news item. Using signaling theory, the authors demonstrate that news of the number of CSR activities involving institutional groups counteracts the effects of same day CSiR news in an inverted U-shaped fashion. In contrast, they find that news of the number of CSR activities involving technical groups mitigates the effects of same day CSiR news in a U-shaped fashion." .

This study adopted a descriptive and inferential survey design. The target population for this study was 60 senior managers composing of directors and managers from Kenya Power and Kengen. Questionnaires were used to collect primary data. The study established that there is a relationship between foreign direct investment variables of infrastructure, technology diffusion, trade facilitation, knowledge management, and technology transfer and economic growth. The study found that investment in the energy sector has led to new technology in the country as it has transferred technology to local investors through sharing of knowledge in new innovation in production, research, and development and also has led to increased competition in trading which has resulted in efficiency and effectiveness of the industry. A major implication of this study is that policy makers must devise policies that would create an enabling environment for attracting FDIs in order to facilitate technology transfer and hence economic growth." .

Specifically, the effects of the market share of credit associations in regional markets on their lending rates are empirically investigated. Accordingly, we determined that credit associations compete with each other in regional lending markets by using two different proxies for the market share held by credit associations in a region. The first proxy was the credit associations’ share of all deposits in a region and the second was the credit associations’ share of all branch offices in a region. In addition, credit associations that face more intense competition from regional banks in regional markets were found to face more intense competition from other credit associations." .

This study is intended to advance this debate by arguing for the existence of curvilinear relationship and empirically testing the same using survey data on UK manufacturing firms. FP is captured in terms of growth in sales and market share. Our results show evidence for a quadratic relationship—as firms improve their EP, they seem to achieve much higher levels of FP. These results are consistent with the resource-based view of a firm; as firms engage in EP activities, they are able to gain inimitable knowledge that helps in further learning to further improve performance. Based on our results, we suggest that new studies focus on strategies to extend the period of increasing returns and maximizing the benefits of the positive association between EP and FP." .

The findings, obtained from survey data collected from 208 firms in the Chinese manufacturing industry, indicate that both categories of ties improve firm performance. The value of the two categories of ties changes in organizational contexts that vary in terms of the moderators of size, age, and firm strategy. Specifically, ties to banks improve the performance of younger firms significantly more than that of older firms, while ties to large-scale state-owned enterprises improve the performance of smaller firms significantly more than that of larger firms." .

Whereas the ethics of using Guanxi in China has been comprehensively discussed, Korean informal networks remain difficult to manage for firms in South Korea due to the absence of existing academic debate and research in this field. In this study, we concentrate mainly on the question of whether foreign firms will and can use affective ties in Korea. The informal social network forms are classified and contrasted with the conventional ethical approaches used in international business ethics (relativism, universalism, and social contract theory) to assess which categories can be regarded as ethical or unethical. Finally, foreign firms are advised how to cope with and use different affective network types. Although the nature of affective ties and networks in Korea differs from that found for instance in China (Guanxi), consistent with the conclusion of prior research, we recommend particularistic analysis and decision making regarding the circumstances in which to conclude affective ties and networks and when to opt out. We conclude that foreign firms in Korea should invest in establishing Inmaek, refrain from engaging in Yonjul, and support host country nationals’ Yongo ties. Moreover, it is suggested that foreign firms should find ways to monitor and manage informal ties effectively." .

Our model also integrates the firm’s past prioritization of CSP and the impact of a company’s participation in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Upper echelons theory and agency theory frameworks are adopted to understand CSP. Using an analysis of panel data for 88 public companies across 13 years in France, we find that a change of chief executive has a positive and significant effect on CSP 5 years after the change. This positive effect is stronger when the new CEO is recruited from outside the firm. The impact on CSP is invariably positive and significant, except for voluntary departures. The arrival of a new CEO affects CSP less when the firm has already achieved a high standard of CSP and participates in the GRI. These results are obtained after controlling CSP determinants already validated in the literature (financial performance, size, profitability, etc.). The findings show that expectations of CEOs are not solely economic and financial but also concern CSP. In terms of governance, they should prompt shareholders looking to strengthen CSP to choose new CEOs from outside the firm and to encourage the firm to participate in the GRI." .

Although a cultural shift toward recognizing the strategic importance of energy efficient and environmental friendly solutions is diffusing among industrial companies, also pushed by the evolution of local and international regulatory frameworks, strong barriers hampering the adoption of energy efficiency measures (EEMs) still exist. These barriers, and in particular those linked to behavioral issues, may be overcome by the use of a well-designed energy audit methodology. However, how energy audit can help overcome behavioral barriers to industrial energy efficiency remains an under-researched topic in literature. This paper presents and discusses a novel methodology for energy audit developed and implemented by a large manufacturing company. The methodology is built around four phases, and it pays special emphasis to the initial step of the audit, where the strongest resistance to the implementation of EEMs is typically found due to a lack of awareness and commitment which hampers the identification of needs and opportunities associated with the adoption of EEMs. The proposed methodology has been able to overcome in practice the typical behavioral barriers that affect the implementation of EEMs in the manufacturing sector and has strong applicability in other firms and industries." .

We find that product line introduction strategy depends on this uncertainty. Specifically, under low levels of uncertainty the firm introduces both models during the first period; under higher levels of uncertainty, the firm prefers sequential introduction and delays design of the second product until the second period. Under intermediate levels of uncertainty the firm's first product should be of lower quality than one produced by a myopic firm that does not take product line effects into consideration. We find that when the firm introduces a product sequentially, the strategy might depend on realized demand. For example, if realized demand is high, the firm's second product should be a higher‐end model; if demand turns out to be low, the firm's second product should be a lower‐end model or replace the first product with a lower‐end model." .

Furthermore, there has been no systematic analysis of the responsibilities of the high value jewellery industry and jewellery SMEs in particular. This study explores the potential for harm and value creation by individual stakeholders in fine jewellery production. Using the harm chain and institutional theory to frame our investigation, we seek to understand how small businesses within the fine jewellery industry respond to the economic, social and environmental challenges associated with responsible jewellery production, and to investigate how they perceive and negotiate the tensions between responsibility and the resistance derived from the operational norms of secrecy and autonomy within the industry. Our exploratory research provides illustrative examples of how complex harm networks operate within and across the fine jewellery industry, and demonstrates the inter-relationships that exist across the different stages of the fine jewellery harm chain. Findings suggest that institutional forces are coalescing towards a more responsible agenda for the fine jewellery industry. Moreover, while CR is a tool to disrupt harmful institutional norms and practices within such an industry, it requires the co-creation of new transformative business models and multi-stakeholder involvement including firms (SMEs and MNEs), trade associations, non-governmental organisations and consumers. Solutions include national and international legislation, price adjusted certification routes for small firms, harmonisation of industry CR standards to reduce overlap in certification and regulation and gem and precious metal “track and trace” schemes." .

But how does supervisor-subordinate guanxi influence employees’ extra-role behaviors in relation to organizational interests? To answer this question, this paper examines a particular structural phenomenon in the context of the Chinese workplace. Guanxi circles (the phenomenon under investigation) are ego-centered guanxi networks with a powerful person at the center. Although a circle leader and his or her group members exchange favors for private goals, they need to actively balance their own interests with the interests of people/groups outside the guanxi circle; so as to maintain a harmonious relationship with the larger network. For this reason, extra-role performance benefiting the larger network is encouraged in the management of a guanxi circle. By studying survey data from China, we demonstrate how a wide variety of circle roles facilitate extra-role performance, and ultimately benefit the organization as a whole. Circle bridges have higher OCB toward organizations (OCB-O) than peripheral members of a circle, who in turn have higher OCB-O than core members of the same circle." .

The concept of innovation systems - at the regional, sectoral and national levels - have been highly influential. Previous literature developing the concept of innovation systems has stressed the importance of institutions, networks and knowledge bases at the regional, sectoral and national levels. This paper primarily draws upon an evolutionary and Schumpeterian economics perspective, in the following three senses. The conceptualization of 'innnovation spaces' focuses upon how and why firm search for innovations is influenced the opportunities within certain geographical contexts. This means that the firm create opportunities and can span different context, but they are influence by the context in term of the access, flow and co-evolution of ideas, resources, technology, people and knowledge, which help stimulate business innovation in terms of products, process and services. The paper concludes with an agenda for future research and especially the need to focus on globalization as a process of intensifying linkages across the globe." .

However, much is still not known about the implementation of effective HR practices and their specific impact on employee behaviors. In this regard, this study identifies the significance of HR practice consistency, develops direct measures of that consistency, and examines the impact on employee role performance. This study also explores how consistency affects shared perceptions of procedural justice and employees’ role performance by employing a cross-level research design. The data in the study were collected from 355 employees of 42 companies within the manufacturing and service industries in Taiwan. This study makes theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying the significance of HR practice consistency, and provides empirical evidences for its potential influences. It also offers practical suggestions that can be used as important reference points by organizations, particularly those in Asia seeking to implement high performance HR practices." .

Originally conceived of as a way of understanding employer ideology with regard to the employment relationship, unitarist frames of reference conceive a workplace that is characterised by shared interests and a single source of authority. This frame has continuously evolved and persistently formed thinking about HRM; however, this influence has been largely covert and unexamined. Using an epistemic analysis informed by theories of knowledge, we examine new unitarism against three types of validity claims—descriptive, normative, and instrumental—in order to understand how it has been ideologically constitutive of HRM scholarship. We consider the implications of this analysis for HRM research and practice and contend that an alternative frame, namely ‘new pluralism’, has potential to offer a more valid account of the employment relationship, to provide a framework for assessing how power affects the pursuit of employee interests, and to allow space for taking up deeply ethical questions related to employment." .

We further examine how the CSiR–CEO succession relationship is moderated by firm visibility to stakeholders and industry dynamism. Our results, based on a dataset of 248 U.S. public firms between 2001 and 2008, provide evidence that firms’ CSiR affects what is conventionally seen as primarily a market-driven decision on executive turnover, especially when firms operate in a more dynamic industry.

In this paper, we attempt to address this misalignment. We examine both applied and scholarly applications of OR-based big data analytical tools and techniques within an operations and supply chain management context to highlight their future potential in this domain.

Nevertheless, understanding of e-servicescape attributes remains unclear, due to the limited empirical evidence that has been obtained and examined. Therefore, this study aims to describe the nature of e-servicescapes and investigate the relationships among website trustworthiness, website attitude, brand attitude, e-WOM intention, and purchase intention. Furthermore, this study also aims to identify the role of two contextual factors, namely online purchasing experience and gender differences, and their effects on the relationships among the e-servicescape dimensions, website trustworthiness and attitude. A total of 290 responses were collected from Taiwanese consumers using online-based questionnaires. SPSS and partial least square were used to analyze the collected data. The findings show that e-servicescape dimensions (aesthetic appeal, customization, usability, and financial security) have significant impacts on consumer attitudes and trust toward a website. In particular, women are more likely to experience more positive effects of e-servicescape on internal responses, such as website trustworthiness and attitude. In addition, purchase intention and e-WOM intention can be influenced through internal responses. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that website designers aim to improve the usability, customization, and financial security dimensions of their sites, and especially the aesthetic appeal, so the effectiveness of their designs can be optimized. It is also necessary for e-retailers to raise the top-of-the-mind awareness for their brands, as this can enhance trust in the website. In addition, marketers may add the ‘social network’ factor to offer a platform on which customers can connect with friends and share their experiences with the website and brand, as this may further enhance purchase intention." .

The generalized varying parameter results indicate that about 30 percent of the funds show selectivity, 19 percent have random betas, and 14 percent indicate significant, yet negative, market timing performance.

The shadow costs include two components. The first component is the product of pure information cost due to imperfect knowledge and heterogeneous expectations. The second component represents the additional cost caused by the short-selling constraint. Short-selling bans around the world after the global financial crisis become more and more important. Nezafat and Wang (Short-sale constraints, information acquisition, and asset prices, Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, p 30308, 2013) develop a model of information acquisition and portfolio choice under short-sale constraints.

The obtained fuzzy measure will be integrated into a general method for the evaluation of firms. This general framework will guide the investor in his investment decision process taking account of the available information and investor’s level of confidence in it.

It exploits a unique longitudinal firm-level database that covers all manufacturing firms in Turkey over the 1992–2001 period. Turkey is taken as an example of a developing economy that, in that period, had been technologically advancing and becoming increasingly integrated with the world market. The empirical analysis is performed at firm level within a dynamic framework using a model that depicts the employment and wage trends for skilled and unskilled workers separately. In particular, the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM-SYS) procedure is applied to a panel dataset of about 15,000 firms. Our results confirm the theoretical expectation that developing countries face the phenomena of skill-biased technological change and skill-enhancing trade, both leading to increasing the employment and wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers. In particular, a strong evidence of a relative skill bias emerges: both domestic and imported technologies increase the relative demand for skilled workers more than the demand for the unskilled. “Learning by exporting” also appears to have a relative skill- biased impact, while FDI imply an absolute skill bias." .

We first rank the touristic sites based on the spatial distribution of the visitors’ place of residence. The Taj Mahal, the Pisa Tower and the Eiffel Tower appear consistently in the top 5 in these rankings. We then pass to a coarser scale and classify the travelers by country of residence. Touristic site’s visiting figures are then studied by country of residence showing that the Eiffel Tower, Times Square and the London Tower welcome the majority of the visitors of each country. Finally, we build a network linking sites whenever a user has been detected in more than one site. This allow us to unveil relations between touristic sites and find which ones are more tightly interconnected." .

These workplaces, as many others, often offer the key ingredients for the emergence of stress and the performance drop of its long-term effects: long hours sitting, sustained cognitive effort, pressure from competitiveness, among others. This has a toll on productivity and work quality, with significant costs for both organizations and workers. Moreover, a tired workforce is generally more susceptible to negative feelings and mood, which results in a negative environment. This paper contributes to the current need for the development of non-intrusive methods for monitoring and managing worker performance in real time. We propose a framework that assesses worker performance and a case study in which this approach was validated. We also show the relationship between performance and mood." .

Takagi–Sugeno–Kang and hybrid multiple-input single-output fuzzy models are proposed to model the mechanism of token ordering in the token-based ordering policy. The main advantage of proposed fuzzy models is that they eliminate the exogenous and constant variables from the procedure of obtaining the optimal amount of tokens which should be ordered in every period. These fuzzy approaches model the mentioned mechanism through a push–pull policy.

The proposed MOP includes three conflicting objectives: maximization of total profit, minimization of supply disruption and opportunism risks, and minimization of carbon emission considering a number of supply chain constraints. Furthermore, this research analyses the effect of social relationship levels between different tiers of SCN on the profitability, risk, and emission over the time. In this regard, we focus on responding to the following questions. (1) How does the evolving social relationship affect the objectives of the supply chain (SC)? (2) How do the upstream firms’ relationships affect the relationships of downstream firms, and how these relationships influence the objectives of the SC? (3) How does the supply disruption risk interact with the opportunism risk through supply chain relationships, and how these risks affect the objectives of the SC? (4) How do these three conflicting objectives trade-off? A Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm–non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) has been employed to solve the presented problem. In order to improve the quality of solutions, tuning parameters of the NSGA-II are modulated using Taguchi approach. An illustrative example is presented to manifest the capability of the model and the algorithm. The results obtained evince the robust performance of the proposed MOP." .

Uncertainties in yield, quality, price, and infrastructure in one part of the supply chain can affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed industry, an appropriate supply chain risk management (SCRM) is needed. There are four critical steps in SCRM: identifying seaweed supply chains, identifying and categorizing risks, assessing risks, and mitigating risks. To identify seaweed supply chains, we conducted field research, in-depth interviews, and literature studies. The field survey was conducted in the Provinces of South Sulawesi, West Java, East Java, Banten, and West Nusa Tenggara. The seaweed supply chains were modeled by the software Umberto to get a better understanding of material and energy flows between the key members. To identify and categorize the risks, we started with the risks mentioned in the existing literature works, and then applied the Delphi method to analyze the potential risk sources, their causes, and their impacts. To assess risks, we used a semiquantitative approach through the face-to-face interviews to generate a risk map showing the likelihood, and impact of adverse events. Afterward, the risk intensity was categorized based on the value of the responses and classified into five categories: negligible, marginal, critical, most critical, and catastrophic risks. The mitigation strategies considered sustainability (environment, economy, and social) and risks criteria. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used to evaluate these strategies." .

Studies available at the regional level explore innovation and ICT use incorporating different variables, while those investigating ICT use mainly focus on that of households. This paper investigates the existence of common factors for innovation and ICT at the regional level, considering not only ICT use by households but also that of firms. Using factorial and spatial regression analysis, we find that although ICT use and innovation are mainly explained by different variables, knowledge-intensive services and the percentage of population aged 15–64 are common to all of them. In addition, ICT use by households and ICT use by firms are basically driven by different factors. Government quality is the main factor explaining ICT use at home, while ICT use by firms is mostly driven by employment in knowledge-intensive services. R&D is the main variable explaining innovation. We also find positive spatial effects, which are particularly notable in ICT use by households. The results stress the importance of promoting specialization strategies based on the knowledge economy that may contribute to creating synergies between innovation and ICT use in different environments." .

To complement the quantitative results, a further important aim was to examine the self-reported reasons behind manager turnover, and the associations of ethical organizational culture with these reasons. The participants were Finnish managers working in technical and commercial fields. Logistic regression analyses indicated that, of the eight virtues investigated, congruency of supervisors, congruency of senior management, discussability, and sanctionability were negatively related to manager turnover. The results also revealed that the turnover group is not homogeneous, and that there are several different reasons for leaving. The reasons given for turnover were grouped into five different categories: (1) lay-off, (2) career challenges, (3) dissatisfaction with the job or organization, (4) organizational change, and (5) decreased well-being/motivation. ANCOVA analyses showed that those managers who stayed in their organization perceived their ethical culture to be stronger than those in turnover groups, and especially compared to groups 3 and 5. The results acquired through different methods complemented and confirmed each other, showing that by nurturing ethical virtues an organization can decrease job changes and encourage managers and supervisors to want to remain in their organization." .

Environmental improvements, social responsibilities and economic opportunities led many manufacturers to implement different kinds of end-of-life (EoL) strategies. However, in many cases, these strategies are not supported by a correct commitment of top managers, but are implemented only in response to competitor’s actions. This paper aims to improve the understanding of management practices concerning remanufacturing activities. A mixed evaluation model based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed. Its final aim is the evaluation of top management commitment in driving remanufacturing as an overall sustainable initiative into three different sectors (automotive, aerospace and medical equipments). The survey allowed to define the most critical factors for each sector and, so, to analyse underlying remanufacturing strategies." .

The selection process starts with identifying the criteria based on literature review and interviewing industry experts. Weights to criteria are assigned using AHP, and suppliers are ranked using AHP and TOPSIS. Consistency tests are carried out to check the quality of expert’s inputs. Also, sensitivity analysis is done to check the robustness of the approach. The results address that fuzzy approaches could be effective and more accurate than the existing approaches for supplier selection problems." .

When shareholders are socially responsible, in the sense that they also value corporate social performance, it is not clear which incentives the manager should receive. Yet, in a standard principal–agent model, we show that the optimal contract is surprisingly simple: it consists in giving equity holdings to the manager. This is notably because the stock price will incorporate expected profits as well as the social performance of the firm, to the extent that it is valued by shareholders. Consequently, equity holdings give the manager incentives to jointly maximize the profits and the social performance of the firm according to shareholders’ preferences. To facilitate alignment of interests, more socially responsible firms will optimally hire more socially responsible managers. We conclude that neither the shareholder primacy model nor equity-based managerial compensation is necessarily inconsistent with the attainment of social objectives." .

Furthermore, past studies have empirically demonstrated that perceived fairness moderates the influence of corporate ethical values (CEV) on employee performance. In other words, high congruity between employees’ and an organization’s ethical values will result in superior employee performance outcome. This research aims to develop a broader perspective on the complex relationship between CEV and employee outcomes. The article will first examine the direct influence of CEV on organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and alienation from work (AFW), and then the moderating role of perceived fairness. The researcher found a significant direct effect of CEV on both OCBs and AFW, but that perceived fairness does not moderate these relationships. A key implication of findings of this research is that although perception of fairness may suppress the impact of organizational ethical transgressions on employee performance in the short run, as earlier studies have demonstrated, but in the long term, implications of perceived fairness are multifold." .

Demand is uncertain and unobservable to the supplier. We assume that the retailer is rational, that is, the retailer behaves opportunistically and underreports sales revenues to the supplier whenever such underreporting is profitable. Assuming the supplier has the ability to audit the retailer and learn about the actual sales revenues, we show that the supplier will never find it optimal to audit to the point that ensures truthful reporting for all demand realizations. By committing to an auditing policy, the supplier can exploit retailer opportunism and derive profits that at times even exceed those that could be obtained when dealing with a retailer that always strictly adheres to the agreed‐upon contract terms. We also show that the retailer's opportunistic behavior can increase total supply chain profits." .

To assess the innovation deficit in urban water organizations and to identify means for supporting innovation, we surveyed wastewater utility managers in California. Our results reveal insights about the attitudes towards innovation among decision makers, and how perceptions at the level of individual managers might create disincentives for experimentation. Although managers reported feeling relatively unhindered organizationally, they also spend less time on innovation than they feel they should. The most frequently reported barriers to innovation included cost and financing; risk and risk aversion; and regulatory compliance. Considering these results in the context of prior research on innovation systems, we conclude that collective action may be required to address underinvestment in innovation." .

The paper’s main objectives are to (1) analyze passenger flow characteristics and (2) evaluate travel time reliability for the Shanghai Metro network by visualizing the automatic fare collection (AFC) data. First, key characteristics of passenger flows are identified by examining three major aspects, namely, spatial distribution of trips over the network, temporal distribution of passenger entries at the line level and station inflow/outflow imbalances. Second, travel time reliability analyses from the users’ perspective are performed, after a new metric of travel time reliability is designed. Comparisons of travel time reliability at the OD level are provided and the network reliabilities across multiple periods are also evaluated. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive and holistic view of passenger travel experiences. Although the case study focuses on Shanghai Metro, the same analysis framework can be applied to other transit networks equipped with similar AFC systems." .

This paper considers a decentralized supply chain that comprises a random yield supplier and a manufacturer with a service level requirement. The supplier determines the production quantity while the manufacturer decides on the replenishment quantity. We investigate several game-theoretic models with respect to decision sequences of the supplier and manufacturer with a service level requirement. We compare firms’ equilibrium production/order quantity and profits under these models. Both firms achieve a higher payoff in the manufacturer-leader game than in the supplier-leader and simultaneous move games, which indicates that the manufacturer-leader game is Pareto efficient from the channel structure perspective. A critical value is observed at the service level, beyond which the supplier’s profit decreases, while the manufacturer’s profit increases in the service level requirement. Interestingly, the critical value is independent of the models and it just depends on the wholesale price and production cost. We also examine the decentralized random yield supply chain under the vendor-managed inventory arrangement. Finally, numerical computations are conducted to evaluate supply chain performance with respect to various parameters." .

The problems that firms have with regard to managing cultural diversity have been abundantly studied in recent decades from the perspectives of management theory and moral philosophy, but there are still open questions that require deeper reflection and broader empirical analysis. Managing cultural diversity in organisations is of prime importance because it involves harmonising different values, beliefs, credos and customs, and, in essence, human identity. Taking into consideration these cultural differences and harmonising them is a human rights issue (UNDP, Cultural liberty in today’s diverse world, 2004) and a central dimension of corporate social responsibility. Here we are going to focus on theoretical reflection about the ideas that lie behind corporate policies and organisational initiatives that deal with cultural diversity. The aim of our paper is twofold: to present a critical reflection on the ideology of tolerance, and propose an ideology of respect for dealing with cultural diversity. We start by presenting the plurality of interpretations of the concept of ideology, and justify its applicability to the field of cultural diversity. We then reflect on the differences between “tolerance” and “respect” and identifying the practical implications for managing cultural diversity. And finally, we propose a culture of respect that goes beyond tolerance and complements and legitimizes the “business case” perspective for managing cultural diversity in companies. The ideology of respect is based on the Kantian tradition and on the discursive approach where rational dialogue and argumentation are considered the legitimate process for creating a culture of intercultural respect. From this theoretical discussion of the key philosophical concepts we can suggest some general principles for managing cultural diversity in organisations." .

The steps of the model utilize time studies, expert opinions and past data. The proposed model is applied to a real case, and the results show that the proposed model has significant improvements on the performance of the department while decreasing the total human resources costs of housekeeping department and the requirement for the seasonal workers.

The waste is being generated throughout the supply chain viz. farmers, wholesalers/processors, logistics, retailers and consumers. The majority of waste occurs at the interface of retailers and consumers. Many global retailers are making efforts to extract intelligence from customer’s complaints left at retail store to backtrack their supply chain to mitigate the waste. However, majority of the customers don’t leave the complaints in the store because of various reasons like inconvenience, lack of time, distance, ignorance etc. In current digital world, consumers are active on social media and express their sentiments, thoughts, and opinions about a particular product freely. For example, on an average, 45,000 tweets are tweeted daily related to beef products to express their likes and dislikes. These tweets are large in volume, scattered and unstructured in nature. In this study, twitter data is utilised to develop waste minimization strategies by backtracking the supply chain. The execution process of proposed framework is demonstrated for beef supply chain. The proposed model is generic enough and can be applied to other domains as well." .

The IC disclosures in 75 published company reports of 15 listed Portuguese companies in a 5 year period of financial crisis, 2007–2011, are investigated using content analysis and the regression techniques. IC disclosures are found to increase with company size, dual corporate governance models, industry, listing on sustainability indexes and increases in board size up to a maximum point (beyond which disclosures decrease). IC disclosures are reduced by CEO duality and by a higher proportion of independent directors on boards. The year of reporting is not significant, suggesting that the period of financial crisis did not influence the level of IC disclosures. The evidence adduced is consistent with a view that highly visible companies acknowledge the importance of IC disclosures in maintaining their reputation and competitive advantage, even during a period of financial crisis. This article highlights the need for caution in believing that adding extra directors to an existing board will lead to improved disclosure outcomes. In addition, given the token number of females appointed to boards currently, the Portuguese capital market regulator should consider enforcing measures to ensure compliance with EU objectives." .

The findings demonstrate that Chinese expatriate managers working in the Middle East or Africa highly require self-maintenance skills to buffer negative influence of tough local work conditions, while interpersonal and communication skills are more important for those working in Europe or Australia to comprehend culturally different social expectations. Furthermore, Chinese expatriate managers’ home-development interpersonal and communication skills are not readily transferable to foreign contexts, mainly due to host perceptions that value work-life balance and a more equal relationship between leader and subordinates compared to the Chinese working values. This study extends expatriate skill literature by incorporating contextual factors to elaborate contextual influence on skills, and the findings have theoretical and practical significance for expatriate management from emerging market multinationals." .

Die von dieser Sensorik ermöglichte Sammlung von Fahrzeuglebenszyklusdaten erlaubt die Entwicklung völlig neuer Produkte, Services und Geschäftsmodelle. In den USA hat sich in diesem Kontext in Analogie zur Quantified-Self-Bewegung eine lebendige Quantified-Car-Startup-Szene etabliert, welche mit enormen Risikokapitalsummen von teilweise mehr als 20 Millionen USD ausgestattet ist. Diese Entwicklungen zeigen sehr deutlich, wie hoch der Marktwert eines Digitalen Ökosystems für Quantified Car durch Investoren eingeschätzt wird. Vor diesem Hintergrund liefert dieser Beitrag eine Einführung in das Phänomen Quantified Car und analysiert die Geschäftsmodelle der drei Startups Automatic, Mojio und Dash. Eine wesentliche Erkenntnis aus dieser Analyse besteht darin, dass sich die verfolgten Anwendungsszenarien, Dienste und Basistechnologien der Startups durchaus überdecken. Der Beitrag schließt mit einer kurzen Diskussion über den zunehmenden Wettbewerb zwischen der IKT-Industrie und den etablierten Automotive-Branchengrößen über die Vorherrschaft im Aufbau eines Digitalen Ökosystems für Quantified Car." .

Performance measurement defines the information or feedback on actions to meeting strategic objectives and client satisfaction. Generally, performance evaluation of the service provider is a time consuming complicated process, depends customer satisfaction. Over the past two decades several researchers have proposed methods to measure service and quality performance in order to improve the performance efficiency of the organization, since there is a considerable room exists. Hence, in this paper, we analyse efficient and inefficient levels of service performance using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and balance scorecard (BSC) techniques, to bridge the exist gap. The DEA approach has been used to measure the performance of automobile dealers from different areas to know their service levels and also treats the quality of service by making use of different cross-efficiency data envelopment analysis models to discriminate the units. Then, a BSC approach analyzes which aspects of decision making units are inefficient, grounded on four perspectives like as; customers, financial, internal business process and learning and growth, based on the study carried out on ten automobile dealers from various areas. The results identify that dealers are inefficient in learning about customer’s growth, which help the dealers to transform from inefficient into efficient. In addition, this study also focused on various insights related to performance evaluation and provide some useful recommendations which can be practiced in future." .

This interest is motivated by the need for achieving better integration of new technologies (hardware and software) with the business processes of an organization. Business processes have become more and more dependent on technologies because technology has a direct impact on business processes, changing the way they are performed and thus also affecting the way analysts design the software system. However, at the present time, there are still some gaps between the definition of business processes and the technologies used in the organization. In practice, organizations have carried out their business processes using different technologies; however, it is sometimes not possible to determine how technologies are useful in achieving current business goals. This is because business models do not explicitly consider the technologies in the organizational requirements. The goal of this paper is to present a systematic process for integrating business processes and technologies at the conceptual level. To validate our approach, we present a case study that describes the processes of the inventory management department of a public research center." .

An SLO can be defined as a contractarian basis for the legitimacy of a company’s specific activity or project. “SLO”, as a fashionable expression, has its origins in business practice. From a normative viewpoint, the concept is closely related to social contract theory, and, as such, it has a political dimension. After outlining the contractarian normative background to the SLO, we will show how academic concepts such as legitimacy and stakeholder management have a tendency to provide the intellectual underpinning for the business case for securing an SLO. While business case perspectives on the SLO may well be in line with the use of the term in business practice, we will highlight certain difficulties and ambiguities related to the instrumental use of the expression. In the final section, we briefly introduce the articles of this Special Issue to the reader and explain how they relate to the topic." .

Using a new dataset on all TBIs and incubated new technology-based firms from government surveys conducted over five consecutive years from 2009 to 2013 combined with archival and hand-collected data, we find the effects of incubator services on the early growth of new technology-based firms vary according to the local context. Technical support facilities and entrepreneurial mentoring from TBIs are found to have significantly and positively influenced the early development of the firms in the four most affluent tier 1 cities, whilst these effects become less pronounced for the tier 2 and tier 3 cities. These two services are also found to influence graduation performance in the government and university types of TBI respectively. Results support the notion that the effectiveness of an incubator’s services is shaped by the level of a city’s socio-economic development and that the city location of a TBI does impact the graduation performance of its incubatees." .

We develop a screening model that accounts for the following five facts: the existence of a tax incentive to borrow, the presence of asymmetric information in credit markets, the screening activity of lenders, the negative relationship between leverage and profitability, and the business cycle effects on the spread between high-yield and investment-grade interest rates on corporate loans. Assuming the existence of two types of firms, we show that either a separating or a pooling credit market equilibrium can arise, depending on the level of taxation. Finally, we analyze the joint effects of business cycle and taxation on the credit market equilibrium." .

With the understanding of the triple process of economic transition, this study explores the influence of global–local interaction and regional factors on business sustaining. Based on the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms in China during 1998–2005, this paper employs the Cox proportional hazard model to confirm that global, provincial and local forces are critical for the sustaining of large firms. Particularly, the presence of foreign firms shows strong competition effect at the prefecture city level but no spillover effect at the provincial level. Provincial market-oriented institutions and market potential however are crucial to sustain businesses in China. Non-state-owned enterprises such as private and foreign firms are more dependent on market-oriented institutions than state own enterprises. Firms which are able to reap from agglomeration economies and local governmental supports are more likely to sustain. In addition, local factors show different impacts on business sustaining in different regions. The findings indicate that both market and state can play a substantial role in sustaining businesses in transitional economies." .

It was developed by UN Global Compact, GRI and WBCSD. The SDG Compass focusses on large corporations and offers them a framework and method to translate the SDGs to their business. The SDG framework, with the goals and the implementation method, only partially meets the criteria of a hands-on and actionable tool. Much attention is being paid to external motivators instead of focusing on tangible business impact. Currently, prioritization of themes that matter most for European SMEs is not possible. Tools to link the SDGs with the business processes of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises or SMEs do not exist. SMEs lack resources, experience and incentives to implement sustainability in their daily management but their potential contribution to sustainable development is large. In this article we show how the SDGs can be linked bottom-up to the Sustatool, a practical PDCA-based management tool that offers SMEs the opportunity to implement sustainability in their daily practices. We have prioritized the SDGs that SMEs can impact most. We make SDG targets material by linking them to concrete actions in the thematic catalogue." .

In this context, understanding this distribution channel becomes a fundamental matter for both managers and academics. This paper examines determinants of online fashion retailing and proposes a model of the formation of online purchase intention. To this end, a total of 433 individuals were surveyed. Based on the hypothesised model developed through a detailed review of the literature on the constructs proposed, a set of measurement items was adapted to the context of this research, and a 30-item questionnaire was implemented. A regression analysis of latent variables was used based on the optimisation technique of the partial least squares. The results indicate that the key factors influencing online fashion purchase intention are perceived value, trust, and fashion innovativeness, whereas time saving and perceived security are the main antecedents predicting perceived value and trust, respectively. Electronic innovativeness was proven to not have the influence expected on online shopping, which could be explained by the fact that e-commerce is not an innovation any longer." .

The 1969 seminal paper by Bass [F.M. Bass, Manag. Sci. 15, 215 (1969)] introduced a model of product growth for consumer durables, which has been extensively used to predict innovation diffusion across a range of applications. Here, we propose a novel approach to study innovation diffusion, where interactions among individuals are mediated by the dynamics of a time-varying network. Our approach is based on the Bass’ model, and overcomes key limitations of previous studies, which assumed timescale separation between the individual dynamics and the evolution of the connectivity patterns. Thus, we do not hypothesize homogeneous mixing among individuals or the existence of a fixed interaction network. We formulate our approach in the framework of activity driven networks to enable the analysis of the concurrent evolution of the interaction and individual dynamics. Numerical simulations offer a systematic analysis of the model behavior and highlight the role of individual activity on market penetration when targeted advertisement campaigns are designed, or a competition between two different products takes place." .

LMC are defined here as brand building strategies that pair a brand with another object for the purpose of enabling the brand to benefit from the associations the target audience has with the object. We develop an integrative conceptual framework for understanding the factors that influence the brand effects of LMC that is informed by prior research findings on five different LMC strategies (celebrity endorsement, sponsorship, product placements, cause-related marketing, and cobranding) and their effects on the brand. The framework also draws on prior models of cobranding and Keller’s (1993) customer-based brand equity concept and it addresses weaknesses in previous LMC frameworks. The integrated framework contributes to the literature by allowing for an understanding of both when, and how, associations transfer from the branded object to the brand in the context of LMC. Specifically, the framework proposes that learning of brand awareness and transfer of associations from the LMC object to the brand take place via four different routes and that a broad range of brand-, object-, and campaign-related variables moderate these brand awareness and transfer effects. Managerial recommendations and an agenda for future research are offered." .

The more advanced the development of an individual, the more similar is its behavior to that of the adult. Studies have shown that the behavior of subadult and adult spiders are similar, but the similarity may be superficial, since the analytical approach usually adopted cannot evaluate important features, such as the organization of the foraging system. Systems are characterized by a modular organization, which needs appropriate analytical approaches to be properly evaluated. We tested whether there is a difference between the predatory sequences of adult and subadult spiders (Azilia histrio) and identified the most appropriate methodological procedure for the characterization of this difference. We used multivariate analysis, contrasting an approach that focuses on frequency of behavioral categories, taken independently, with an approach that directly evaluates the sequential organization of behavioral categories, thus allowing the analysis of the structure of the foraging system. While the independent variables approach did not show differences between ontogenetic stages, the organizational analytical approach resulted in a number of important differences between the ontogenetic stages. We describe the foraging system for the first time in the genus Azilia, while discussing hypotheses for the observed organizational change." .

We study a duopoly selling differentiated substitutable products with fixed capacities under demand uncertainty, where firms can either commit to a fixed price ex ante, or elect to price contingently ex post, e.g., to charge high prices in booming markets, and low prices in slack markets. Interestingly, we analytically show that even for completely symmetric model primitives, asymmetric equilibria of strategic pricing decisions may arise, in which one firm commits statically and the other firm prices contingently; in this case, there also exists a unique mixed strategy equilibrium. Such equilibrium behavior tends to emerge, when capacity is ampler, and products are less differentiated or demand uncertainty is lower. With asymmetric fixed capacities, if demand uncertainty is low, a unique asymmetric equilibrium emerges, in which the firm with more capacity chooses committed pricing and the firm with less capacity chooses contingent pricing. We identify two countervailing profit effects of contingent pricing under competition: gains from responsively charging high price under high demand, and losses from intensified price competition under low demand. It is the latter detrimental effect that may prevent both firms from choosing a contingent pricing strategy in equilibrium. We show that the insights remain valid when capacity decisions are endogenized. We caution that responsive price changes under aggressive competition of less differentiated products can result in profit‐killing discounting." .

However, the medical profession in Germany has inadequately developed structures. Little is known regarding the satisfaction of physicians working part-time (PT). MethodsThis Germany-wide on-line survey collected information on the working situation of PT employees (PTE) in gynecology. An anonymous questionnaire with 95 items, nine of which concerned PT work, was sent to 2770 residents and physicians undergoing further specialist training. ResultsOf the 481 participants, 104 (96 % female, 4 % male) stated they worked PT, which is greater than the national average. 94 % of all women and 60 % of all men would work PT for better compatibility between work and family life. The PTE regularly work night shifts (NS) (96 %) and weekends (98 %). The number of monthly NS (median 5–9) was not different between the full-time (FT) employees and the PTE who work >75 %. Only when the working hours are reduced by 25 % or more, there are fewer NS (median 1–4) PTE that have a desire for fewer NS. The classic PT model is seldom realized; over 70 % of PTE work whole days, while other working models do not play a major role in Germany. On-call models were subjectively declared to have the best family friendly work-life balance. OutlookThe results obtained indicated that structures must be developed that to address the problem of childcare and the long working hours to ensure comprehensive medical care from specialists." .

We focus on an important trade-off facing modern firms: firms can acquire the property of all the innovations developed by their employees and can greatly increase their profits, yet this type of private intellectual property rights regime can discourage the innovative effort of the very same workers. Allowing workers to carry their knowledge outside the firm eliminates this disincentive. Hence, strategic complementarities may exist between innovative partners and a disclosure driven intellectual property rights regime, and passive employees and a private intellectual property rights regime. An evolutionary game theoretic model demonstrates these strategic complementarities and shows when economies tend towards disclosure driven or private intellectual property rights regimes." .

The proposed model extends and complements the partial approaches studied in the economic, management and operations research literatures. The former emphasizes the role of the strategic knowledge spillovers that may take place among competing firms because of their incentives to introduce technologically superior products while assuming the acceptance of such products by customers as given. The second defines its technology acceptance model based on the demand side of the economic system without considering the resulting strategic interactions that arise among the firms. The latter addresses the effect that signals about a new technology have on the information acquisition behavior of decision makers (DMs) but does not consider the capacity of DMs to account for several product characteristics and their interaction when acquiring information. Using a duopolistic innovation game model we illustrate how the existence of loyal customer bases allows for higher expected payoffs when generating monopolized markets but decreases the incentives of firms to introduce the most technologically developed product available. The signaling equilibria of the game are determined by demand-based factors and the incentives of customers to acquire information on the existing products in the market. Among the main implications of our model is also the fact that the availability of decision support systems that can be used by DMs through their information acquisition processes would improve the quality of the technology being introduced in the market and increase the firms’ probability of success." .

And, financial contagion behavior analysis is an important subject in the field of international finance. This paper analyzes the financial contagion behavior of US subprime crisis and describes the co-movement behavior between US stock index return and the stock index returns of tested countries by complex network approach. The co-movement modes are defined by a coarse graining procedure, and then by weighted complex network models and evolutionary models transformation characteristics between the modes are analyzed. In order to analyze the sub-prime loan crisis contagion from US to other countries, we selected three main stock market indexes (China, Japan and Germany), S&P 500 index to present an empirical analysis, and the stock market index data is from 2006.1.1 to 2009.3.31. To analyze the contagion effect of the sub-prime crisis, the data is divided into three segments to be analyzed based on complex network approach. The empirical result shows that the co-movement modes of the S&P 500 index and the stock indexes of other countries are clustered around a few critical modes during the evolution. The co-movement modes have the characteristic of grouping, and the conversion of the co-movement modes requires an average of 3–5 days. This paper confirms the sub-prime crisis contagion behavior by comparing the parameters including degree, clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality in three stages. This research may provide further information between S&P 500 index and other stock indexes for the co-movement. More importantly, a new approach is provided for testing the financial contagion effect in this paper." .

It represents the total value that a customer produces during his or her lifetime, or better represents the measure of the potential profit generating by a customer. The companies use the customer lifetime value to segment customers, analyze probability of churn, allocate resources or formulate strategies and, therefore, they increasingly derive revenue from the creation and from sustenance of long-term relationships with their customers. For this reason, the customer lifetime value is increasingly considered a touchstone for the management of customer relationships. In this article, the authors deepen the concept and use of customer lifetime value and present some mathematical models for its determination. There is many models for this purpose but most of them are theoretic, complex and not applicable. Though not exhaustive, the major contribution of this paper is that it provides a general mathematical formulation to estimate the CLV and that it has a context less specific compared to papers, present in literature, on the customer lifetime." .

Over the last decade, increasing concerns about environmental impact have driven manufacturers to reconsider their product design processes from the view of sustainability. The blending of these concepts—modularity and sustainability—has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. The ways in which sustainability influences MPD are not fully understood, evidencing a gap that needs to be further researched. This review examines more than 100 studies addressing ways MPD is associated with sustainability factors and classifies these studies based on major sustainability themes. The initial review and analysis were conducted using literature summarization tables and a maturity index. Our search emphasized not only the performance of MPD methodologies with respect to sustainability factors but also the relationship between MPD and sustainability categories. Our review results indicate that from an academic perspective, research over the last 15 years has seen a significant increase in studies involving MPD and product life cycles, MPD and product innovation, and MPD and environmental management. Secondarily, our findings reveal that from an industry perspective, the literature shows that modularity has a positive impact on sustainability and identifies several social sustainability-related areas in MPD that could benefit from further investigation." .

This article claims that sponsorship is the ideal promotional communication method to apply the ELM principles. Sponsors should be using the knowledge of the ELM that explains how consumers evaluate messages when developing their activation programs and television commercials. The article provides an example how Citi has developed its Olympic activation program and television commercials to appeal to both high and low involvement product category customers. Citi promoted its mobile app and the Citi Thank You Visa card brand features to try to appeal to high involvement product category consumers, while promoting its Olympic brand association and its corporate social responsibility ‘Every Step of the Way’ initiative to try to appeal to low involvement product category consumers." .

However, despite the fact that it has been seen as a set of techniques to influence customer demand and exploit the consumer surplus, there has been a tendency for much of the research in the area to lack a consumer focus. What research there is tends to focus on three main areas, namely, the algorithm modelling of consumer behaviour, consumer trust and fairness and consumer-centric marketing. The purpose of this article therefore is to consolidate and synthesise existing consumer focused research in RM in these three key areas." .
