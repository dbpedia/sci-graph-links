Abstract Structural design for seismic excitation is usually based on peak values of forces and deformations over the duration of earthquake. In determining these peak values dynamic analysis is done which requires either response history analysis (RHA), also called time history analysis, or response spectrum analysis (RSA), both of which depend upon ground motion severity. In the past, PGA has been used to describe ground motion severity, because seismic force on a rigid body is proportional to the ground acceleration. However, it has been pointed out that single highest peak on accelerograms is a very unreliable description of the accelerograms as a whole. In this study, we are considering 0.2- and 1-s spectral acceleration. Seismic loading has been defined in terms of design spectrum and time history which will lead us to two methods of dynamic analysis. Design spectrum for Quetta will be constructed incorporating the parameters of ASCE 7-05/IBC 2006/2009, which is being used by modern codes and regulation of the world like IBC 2006/2009, ASCE 7-05, ATC-40, FEMA-356 and others. A suite of time history representing design earthquake will also be prepared, this will be a helpful tool to carryout time history dynamic analysis of structures in Quetta.
