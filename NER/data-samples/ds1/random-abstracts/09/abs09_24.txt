A model of odorizing a natural gas is built on the basis of the system of motion of viscous, compressible, heatconducting, two-component medium with account for the odorant diffusion. Calculations of convective and diffusional mixing, in a channel, of a gaseous methane main flow interacting with its side jets containing an odorizing gas has been performed. The regimes of flow at different gas velocities in the main and side channels are considered, and the process of the equalization of the odorant concentration by convective and diffusional mechanisms are considered.
