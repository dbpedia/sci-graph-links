The physicochemical and biomedical properties of plasma-sprayed biocomposite coatings based silver- and copper-substituted hydroxyapatite powders on a titanium substrate are comprehensively studied and compared. Infrared spectroscopy shows that powder samples of all types correspond mainly to synthetic hydroxyapatite. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of metal-substituted hydroxyapatite nanoparticles in all coatings. The coatings are characterized by marked hydrophilic properties, the greatest ones being shown by silver-substituted hydroxyapatite coatings. The coatings produced from copper-substituted hydroxyapatites exhibit greater biological activity and the highest adhesion properties, but pronounced antimicrobial properties are possessed only by silver-substituted hydroxyapatite coatings.
