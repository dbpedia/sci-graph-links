Abstract In the design of an aircraft at the stage of selecting its geometrical parameters, a method is proposed for evaluating the performance capabilities of manual control to ensure the quality of a given flight stabilization mode. The attainability of the given aircraft-pilot dynamic properties is evaluated by a frequency-domain method for permissible values of the aircraft and the pilot model parameters. The quality of the manual control for the longitudinal motion of the aircraft is evaluated.
