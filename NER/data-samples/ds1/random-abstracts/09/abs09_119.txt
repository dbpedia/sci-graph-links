Abstract The operating principles and characteristics of three devices for measuring or monitoring flows of bulk solids are outlined. These are a flowrate meter and a density meter for material in gravity flow, both based on load cell sensors, and a system, based on audio-frequency acoustic sensing, for measuring the flow rate of dilute flows in a pneumatic conveying pipeline. Common features are mechanical simplicity and robustness, ease of calibration, and high precision. These technologies have all been demonstrated under industrial conditions performing reliably and consistently, and are compatible with the wide ranging process requirements of different industrial sectors, including the minerals industry.
