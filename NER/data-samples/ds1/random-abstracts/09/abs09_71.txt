Abstract Urban flooding and waterlogging is becoming one of the foremost challenges in the process of rapid urbanization expansion in China. With a huge investment, the Chinese government presently is conducting a large project for the construction of “Sponge City,” aiming at the urban water disaster mitigation and efficient water management. However, the effects of present practices and actions are far beyond the expected, and a large number of troublesome and perplexing problems are waiting to be solved. It should be realized that the control of urban floods and waterlogs is a long-term and complexly systemic project, rather than a simple urban construction project. More meticulous and rational actions and policies should be taken by keeping patient, and both structural and non-structural measures are needed for the construction of Sponge City, by which the huge investment could achieve the desired targets and benefits for the mitigation of urban water disasters in China.
