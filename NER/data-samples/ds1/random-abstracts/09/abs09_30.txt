Abstract Thermal decomposition of Ce(ClO4)3 • 9H2O and Ce(ClO4)3 to give cerium(IV) dioxide in the temperature range 240–460°C was studied by DSC–TGA, X-ray powder diffraction, IR and mass spectroscopy. The thermolysis of these salts was shown to proceed through the stage of formation of intermediate product supposedly cerium oxoperchlorate. The thermal decomposition of cerium(III) perchlorate hydrate at 460°C leads to formation of nanocrystalline cerium dioxide with particle size of 13 nm.
