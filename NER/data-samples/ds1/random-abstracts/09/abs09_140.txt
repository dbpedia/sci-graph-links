Abstract Fenugreek has been recognized as the most important medicinal plant. The presence of diosgenin in fenugreek seed is known to have promising health benefits. In the present work the extraction of diosgenin from the fenugreek seed was performed and its supplementation in cookies was done. The ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) methods have been applied for extraction of diosgenin. In case of UAE, the maximum diosgenin was obtained from fenugreek seed powder with 80 % ethanol solution for 50 min, whereas the maximum diosgenin in MAE was obtained at 80 % ethanol solution for 4 min. Overall, the extract yield of UAE was higher than MAE. The UAE method with an ethanolic concentration of 80 % was considered as optimum for the determination of diosgenin in cookies. The diosgenin content of the cookies supplemented with fenugreek seed powder increased with its increase and the diosgenin content ranged from 0.099 to 0.191 g diosgenin equivalent/100 g of cookies. Further research on the incorporation of fenugreek seed powder and diosgenin in ready-to-eat foods are of great value because of health benefits of diosgenin and market demand of ready-to-eat foods.
