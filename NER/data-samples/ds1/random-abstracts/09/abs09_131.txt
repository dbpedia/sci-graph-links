Abstract Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are unique tools for underwater industrial exploration and scientific research of offshore areas and the deep ocean. With broadening application of ROVs, the study of factors that affect their safe operation is important. Besides the technical skills to control ROV movement, the dynamical ocean environment may also play a vital role in the safe operation of ROVs. In this paper, we investigate the influence of large-amplitude internal solitary waves (ISWs), focusing on the forces exerted on ROVs by ISWs. We present a methodology for modeling ISW-induced currents based on KdV model and calculate the ISW forces using the Morrison equation. Our results show that an extremely considerable load is exerted by the ISW on the ROV, resulting in a strong disturbance of the vehicleâ€™s stability, affecting the ROV control. The numerical results of this work emphasize the importance of considering dynamical conditions when operating underwater vessels, such as ROV. Further laboratory and field investigation are suggested to gain more understanding of this subject.
