AbstractEuropean Union has set a 70 % recycling goal for construction and demolition waste by 2020. In Finland, for example, 40 % of this waste is wood. The purpose of this study was to test the technical feasibility of pulping contaminated wood waste from the construction industry and using such pulps for fibre-based products outside of the conventional paper industry. It was found out that both chemical and thermo-mechanical pulping, and mechanical milling can be used for pulping contaminated wood waste chips received from construction waste treatment plant. The resulting pulps were then utilized successfully to prepare product demonstrations (wood fibre filaments and thick foam formed panel structures). There are no technical restraints for pulping contaminated construction wood waste, and the resulting pulp quality depends on the shape and size of the woodchips, dry content, wood species and type of contaminants. Although wood treated with copper preservatives can set special safety and process requirements, it does not necessarily impair the key properties of the final product. Graphical Abstract
