Abstract We present a numerical technique to model the buckling of a rolled thin sheet. It consists in coupling, within the Arlequin framework, a three dimensional model based on 8-nodes tri-linear hexahedron, used in the sheet part located upstream the roll bite, and a well-suited finite element shell model, in the roll bite downstream sheet part, in order to cope with buckling phenomena. The resulting nonlinear problem is solved by the Asymptotic Numerical Method (ANM) that is efficient to capture buckling instabilities. The originalities of the paper ly, first in an Arlequin procedure with moving meshes, second in an efficient application to a thin sheet rolling process. The suggested algorithm is applied to very thin sheet rolling scenarios involving “edges-waves” and “center-waves” defects. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our global approach.
