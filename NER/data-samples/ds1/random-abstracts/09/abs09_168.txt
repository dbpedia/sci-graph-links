Abstract In the present study, fine laser cutting of aluminium alloy 6061-T6 sheets, characterised by light reflection and heat conductivity, by means of a 150-W multimode lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser is investigated through an experimental testing campaign. Design of experiments (DoE) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are adopted to study the influence of the process parameters on the kerf geometry and surface roughness. The results show that the laser allows cutting 1-mm-thick AA6061-T6 sheets with a cutting speed up to 700 mm/min, obtaining narrow kerfs (smaller than 200 μm), a fine taper angle (lower than 4°), a low dross height (about 40 μm) and a roughness average, Ra, around 4 μm.
