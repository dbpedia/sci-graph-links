Abstract Mufulira underground mine has been facing great geotechnical challenges due to crown pillars left after mining which act similar to stress windows and these bring about high stress build up in the footwall drifts. A numerical analysis was performed with the objective to investigate how a change in mining method would affect the high stress levels. The numerical analysis was achieved using the software Flac 3D based on data corrected at the mine. One of the major aims of the analysis was to determine the change in mining height and its implications. Results from the numerical analysis showed that altering the mining technique would decrease the stress levels in the footwall.
