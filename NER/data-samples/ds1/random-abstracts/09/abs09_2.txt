Abstract The results of the investigations of the transformation of impurity defects in natural diamonds of various habits at the stage of high-temperature annealing at P = 6 GPa and T = 2200°C are presented. The studies conducted allowed us to ascertain that the transformations of Aand B-defects in diamonds of octahedral and cubic habits follow general regularities. This fact shows that most of the diamonds of cubic habit with low degree of aggregation of nitrogen centers were not really annealed over a long-term interval. Unlike octahedral diamonds, those of cubic habit are characterized by a pronounced increase in the peak of H-containing defects (3107 cm–1) after annealing.
