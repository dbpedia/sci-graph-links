Abstract Recently, there has been a shift in emphasis in bridge monitoring from instrumentation of the bridge to instrumentation of a passing vehicle, known by “drive-by bridge inspection”. This paper introduces a new method of identifying bridge damage using an instrumented truck; specifically using the truck acceleration histories to calculate changes in the “bridge displacement profile” which is shown to be sensitive to structural damage. The study includes three different bridges modeled as 1D FE beam elements and 2D FE plate elements. The simulation of the vehicle–bridge interaction is implemented in MATLAB. The truck is represented as a simple quarter car model crossing over a rough profile. The approach is also numerically tested for local damage in the bridge plate model. Finally, there is a study of sensitivity to signal noise, corrupted truck properties, initial conditions and transverse vehicle position.
