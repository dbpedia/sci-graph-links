Abstract In this paper, we consider a model of generalized derivative of nonlinear Schrödinger equation. By investigating the dynamical behavior and bifurcation of solutions of the traveling wave system, we derive all possible exact explicit traveling wave solutions under different parametric conditions. These results completely improve the study of traveling wave solutions for the mentioned model stated in Wang et al. (Commun Theor Phys 50:39–42, 2008).
