Abstract We perform resummation of soft gluon corrections to the total cross section for the process pp → tt¯H $$ t\overline{t}H $$. The resummation is carried out at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) accuracy using the Mellin space technique, extending its application to the class of 2 → 3 processes. We present an analytical result for the soft anomalous dimension for a hadronic production of two coloured massive particles in association with a colour singlet. We discuss the impact of resummation on the numerical prediction for the associated Higgs boson production with top quarks at the LHC.
