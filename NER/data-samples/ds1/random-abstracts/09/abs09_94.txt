Abstract Immobilization of nano-scaled TiO2 onto polymeric ultrafiltration (UF) membrane offers desirable antifouling and self-cleaning properties to the membrane, which is practical in wastewater purification only if the mechanical strength and long-term self-cleaning durability are realized. This paper reported the surface roughness, mechanical properties, thermal stability, and recycling self-cleaning performance of the novel TiO2/PAA/PTFE UF membranes, which were coated via an innovative plasma-intensified coating strategy. Through careful characterizations, the enhanced engineering properties and the self-cleaning performance were correlated with the surface chemical composition and the creative coating technique. In the recycling photocatalytic self-cleaning tests in photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) solution, about 90Â % MB photocatalytic capability of TiO2/PAA/PTFE composite membranes could be recovered with simple hydraulic cleaning combined with UV irradiation. The mechanical properties and thermal stability of TiO2/PAA/PTFE also satisfy the practical application in water and wastewater treatments, despite that the original engineering properties were slightly influenced by PAA grafting and TiO2 coating. The changed properties of the composite UF membrane relative to PTFE are reasonably attributed to the variation of the surface chemical species and chemical bonding, as well as the thickness and evenness of the surface functional layers.
