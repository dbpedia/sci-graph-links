Abstract Roll-forging process is widely used to fabricate the automobile front axle beams. The reasonable selection of the process parameters is significant to ensure the quality and improve the property of the automobile front axle beam owing to the complexity and importance of the preliminary roll-forging process. This paper developed a 3D Finite element (FE) model of the preliminary roll-forging process of the AISI-1045 automobile front axle beam under the Deform-3D platform. A corresponding experiment is subsequently conducted. Good agreement between the experimental and simulative results validates the employed model. Based on this dependable FE model, the influences of initial temperature of billet T 0 , rotational speed of rolls n and friction factor m on the geometric dimension, temperature inhomogeneity, deformation inhomogeneity, and roll-forging load are investigated comprehensively. The results can provide reliable guidelines for the selection of process parameters.
