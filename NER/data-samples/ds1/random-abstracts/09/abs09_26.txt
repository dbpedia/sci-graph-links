Abstract The ability of five kinetic equations to describe the sorption kinetics and expansion rate of solid coal samples was investigated. The conducted experiment included the measurements of sorption of methane and carbon dioxide on cuboidal hard coal samples at high pressure using volumetric method. Simultaneously the kinetics of coal sorption induced swelling was monitored. All of the approaches used to fit the experimental sorption and dilatometric data were literature-based equations. Two equations represent the traditional approach for sorption on powder and grain fractions based on the bidisperse gas transport model, and have been used to interpret and quantify the observed gas uptake rates in coal. The other three kinetic equations are the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, Elovich equation, and stretched exponential (SE) equation. Four of the five equations are suitable to describe the kinetics of methane and carbon dioxide sorption in the porous structure of solid coal samples and the kinetics of coal expansion that accompany the sorption processes. The SE equation gave the best fit to the experimental data.
