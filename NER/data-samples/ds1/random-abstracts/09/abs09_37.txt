Abstract In this paper, a mathematical model of the photovoltaic (PV) pumping systemâ€™s main components is firstly established. Then, the design of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) stage that ensures battery charging is described. This work is motivated by the need of photovoltaic generator (PVG) that efficiently extracts maximum power. The PVG is a special source of energy which has nonlinear current-voltage characteristics depending on variations in temperature and solar irradiance. In order to achieve the MPPT operating goals, a special interest is focused on the variable structure sliding mode (SM) control strategy and the classic perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm. The permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is selected as a pump driver. The field oriented control is performed as the motor drive strategy. Simulation results show a high level of efficiency, obtained with the proposed PV based pumping system. The performance comparison between SM controller and P&O controller has been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the former in drawing more energy and a fast response against irradiation disturbances.
