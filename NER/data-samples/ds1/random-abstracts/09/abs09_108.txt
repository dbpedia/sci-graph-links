Abstract Sculptured parts are broadly used in the aeronautical, automotive, and die/injection mold industry. Both machining productivity and quality of sculptured surface are important for finish milling. Curvature radius as the most obvious characteristic of sculptured surface has the noticeable significant effect on them. Curvature radius affects the machining productivity as it is correlated with tool path selection (step length and path interval). In the meantime, curvature radius affects the machining quality by affecting cutting force, which has directly influence on the deformation of cutting tool system. Experimental result shows that, curvature radius especially the normal curvature radius œÅ 2 which is perpendicular to the feeding direction on a CC point, has an obvious effect on machining productivity and quality.
