Abstract Proline accumulations in abiotically stressed plants is generally considered to benefit their stress tolerance. The Î”1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) gene family, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in proline biosynthesis pathway, usually contains two duplicated genes in most plants. However, three P5CS genes including LrP5CS1, LrP5CS2 as well as a third one, LrP5CS3, were isolated from Lilium regale. LrP5CS3 is highly identical to LrP5CS1 in amino acid sequences, indicating they could come from a paralogous duplication. The phylogenetic tree suggested that the duplication of LrP5CS occurred independently after the divergence of Liliales and commelinoids. The expression of LrP5CS1 was strongly induced in leaves and roots both under drought and salinity, while that of LrP5CS3 was upregulated more moderately. LrP5CS2 stayed almost constitutive under stress. LrP5CS1 exhibited the highest activity after expressed in E. coli. Overexpression of LrP5CS genes conferred enhanced osmotic, drought and salt tolerance on transgenic Arabidopsis without negative effects in unstressed condition. Under salt stress, lines LrP5CS2 accumulated fewer proline than others, and lines LrP5CS1 grew better in root elongation. The roots of lines LrP5CS3 grew better than all others under unstressed condition and osmotic stress. Our study suggests that the three LrP5CS genes play distinct roles respectively in proline accumulation and abiotic stress tolerance.
