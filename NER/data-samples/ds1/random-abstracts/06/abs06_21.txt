Abstract The present study was carried out to investigate the impact of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the growth of three different crop species, wheat (Triticum aestivum, var. UP2338), cowpea (Vigna sinensis, var. Pusa Komal), and Brassica (Brassica juncea, var. Pusa Jai Kisan), along with their impact on the rhizospheric bacterial diversity. Three different concentrations (0, 50 and 75 ppm) of AgNPs were applied through foliar spray. After harvesting, shoot and root parameters were compared, and it was observed that wheat was relatively unaffected by all AgNP treatments. The optimum growth promotion and increased root nodulation were observed at 50 ppm treatment in cowpea, while improved shoot parameters were recorded at 75 ppm in Brassica. To observe the impact of AgNPs on soil bacterial community, sampling was carried out from the rhizosphere of these crops at 20 and 40 days after the spraying of AgNPS. The bacterial diversity of these samples was analyzed by both cultural and molecular techniques (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). It is clearly evident from the results that application of AgNPs changes the soil bacterial diversity and this is further influenced by the plant species grown in that soil. Also, the functional bacterial diversity differed with different concentrations of AgNPs.
