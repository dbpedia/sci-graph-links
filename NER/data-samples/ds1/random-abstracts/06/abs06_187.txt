Abstract Putrajaya Lake and Wetlands being the centrepiece of Malaysiaâ€™s administrative city is an important destination for recreation, sports and tourism in the country. The urban water body system with a total surface area of 400 hectares was designed and built so as to encircle the core island creating a complex morphometry. To ensure the water quality remains in its highest-level condition since its beginning, to perform its multi-functional uses, managing the lake catchment is of paramount importance. This paper describes the application of numerical simulation of Putrajaya Lake using coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem model to assess the spatial dynamics of the lake water quality. The hydrodynamic model simulates the flow pattern under different meteorological forcing variables. The ecosystem model simulates the resulting spatial and diurnal water quality pattern. Wind is the dominant forcing variable driving the flow field. The lake exhibits spatial variation of physico-chemical variables with an overall high-quality of surface water. The model simulation illustrates the impact of potential discharges on the lake water quality, such as spread of pollutants, subsequently provides a useful tool to enhance the management of the lake sustainably under changing environment.
