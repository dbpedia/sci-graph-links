The enzymes that perform these reactions, polyisoprenyl-glycosyltransferases (PI-GTs) include dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (DPMS), which generates the mannose donor for glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report the 3.0Å resolution crystal structure of GtrB, a glucose-specific PI-GT from Synechocystis, showing a tetramer in which each protomer contributes two helices to a membrane-spanning bundle. The active site is 15 Å from the membrane, raising the question of how water-soluble and membrane-embedded substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis. A conserved juxtamembrane domain harbours disease mutations, which compromised activity in GtrB in vitro and in human DPM1 tested in zebrafish. We hypothesize a role of this domain in shielding the polyisoprenyl-phosphate for transport to the active site. Our results reveal the basis of PI-GT function, and provide a potential molecular explanation for DPM1-related disease." .

One route for establishment of endophytes in seedlings is transmission of bacteria from the parent plant to the seedling via the seed. In wheat seeds, it is not clear whether this transmission route exists, and the identities and location of bacteria within wheat seeds are unknown. We identified bacteria in the wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Hereward seed environment using embryo excision to determine the location of the bacterial load. Axenic wheat seedlings obtained with this method were subsequently used to screen a putative endophyte bacterial isolate library for endophytic competency. This absence of bacteria recovered from seeds indicated low bacterial abundance and/or the presence of inhibitors. Diversity of readily culturable bacteria in seeds was low with 8 genera identified, dominated by Erwinia and Paenibacillus. We propose that anatomical restrictions in wheat limit embryo associated vertical transmission, and that bacterial load is carried in the seed coat, crease tissue and endosperm. This finding facilitates the creation of axenic wheat plants to test competency of putative endophytes and also provides a platform for endophyte competition, plant growth, and gene expression studies without an indigenous bacterial background." .

A rice mutant line (MT58) was developed after mutagenesis of cv. Neda by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and selected for dwarfism (18 cm shorter than Neda). The extent of its molecular changes relative to parental cultivar was assessed by SSR and ISSR markers, and the response of the line along with parental cultivar and another mutant line (MTA) to mild and severe water deficit, was evaluated in a field experiment. A molecular assessment using 41 SSR markers showed that dwarf line MT58 had significant molecular difference with two other lines. ISSR assay also proved the considerable mutational effect of EMS on two mutant lines compared with the original wild line. Field experiments revealed that limited irrigation caused mild-to-severe decrease in all the studied traits, including chlorophyll contents. In mild water-stress mutant line, MT58 showed a low (3 %) yield loss as compared with cultivar Neda with a high (14 %) yield loss. Interestingly, in severe water-stress mutant line, MT58 showed a low (19 %) yield loss as compared with mutant line MTA and cv. Neda with high (33 and 31 %, respectively) yield loss. In severe stress, mutant MT58 had the highest values of panicle length, total kernels per panicle, fertile kernels, and chlorophyll contents, while cv. Neda had the highest values of plant height, tiller number, and plant yield, and reduction in chlorophyll content at drought stress condition was correlated with yield loss (0.64 and 0.697 for chl.a and chl.b, respectively). The results of this research obviously confirm that mutant line MT58 despite of its stunt figure shows a low yield loss due to drought stress and hence is a promising line for cultivation under drought condition." .

With this in view, a review of the processes induced/influenced by various biological activities that might impact the geomaterials and their performance, from the geotechnical engineering point of view, has been reported in this manuscript.

Their nitrogen fixation efficiency depends on their association with soil bacteria known as rhizobia. The aim of this work was to assess the diversity and symbiotic effectiveness of root nodule bacteria from Adesmia boronioides, Adesmia emarginata and Adesmia tenella from different regions of Chile. Adesmia spp. nodules were collected from seven sites obtaining 47 isolates, which resulted in 19 distinct strains. The diversity of the strains was determined via partial sequencing of the dnaK, 16srRNA and nodA genes. The strains were authenticated as root nodule bacteria on their original host and assessed for symbiotic effectiveness on A. emarginata and A. tenella. The strains from Adesmia tenella clustered within the Mesorhizobium clade. Adesmia boronioides nodulated with Mesorhizobium sp., Rhizobium leguminosarum and Bradyrhizobium sp. The rhizobia from A. emarginata were identified as Burkholderia spp, which was symbiotically ineffective on this species and on A. tenella. Strains isolated from Adesmia emarginata nodules, but unable to induce nodulation, were identified as Labrys methylaminiphilus. Labrys strain AG-49 significantly increased root dry weight in A. emarginata. The nodA genes from Adesmia strains were unique and correlated to legume host. A. emarginata was effectively nodulated by Bradyrhizobium AG-64 and A. tenella by Mesorhizobium strains AG-51 and AG.52. It is concluded that Adesmia emarginata, A. tenella and A. boronioides are associated to diverse bacterial symbionts and selection of an effective inoculant is a key step to assist Adesmia spp. adaptation and restoration." .

Located close to the heart at the tracheobronchial junction, vocal folds or membranes attached to modified mineralized rings vibrate to produce sound1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Syringeal components were not thought to commonly enter the fossil record6, and the few reported fossilized parts of the syrinx are geologically young8,9,10,11 (from the Pleistocene and Holocene (approximately 2.5 million years ago to the present)). The only known older syrinx is an Eocene specimen that was not described or illustrated12. Data on the relationship between soft tissue structures and syringeal three-dimensional geometry are also exceptionally limited5. Here we describe the first remains, to our knowledge, of a fossil syrinx from the Mesozoic Era, which are preserved in three dimensions in a specimen from the Late Cretaceous (approximately 66 to 69 million years ago) of Antarctica. With both cranial and postcranial remains, the new Vegavis iaai specimen is the most complete to be recovered from a part of the radiation of living birds (Aves). Enhanced-contrast X-ray computed tomography (CT) of syrinx structure in twelve extant non-passerine birds, as well as CT imaging of the Vegavis and Eocene syrinxes, informs both the reconstruction of ancestral states in birds and properties of the vocal organ in the extinct species. Fused rings in Vegavis form a well-mineralized pessulus, a derived neognath bird feature, proposed to anchor enlarged vocal folds or labia5. Left-right bronchial asymmetry, as seen in Vegavis, is only known in extant birds with two sets of vocal fold sound sources. The new data show the fossilization potential of the avian vocal organ and beg the question why these remains have not been found in other dinosaurs. The lack of other Mesozoic tracheobronchial remains, and the poorly mineralized condition in archosaurian taxa without a syrinx, may indicate that a complex syrinx was a late arising feature in the evolution of birds, well after the origin of flight and respiratory innovations." .

However, identification of the presence of tempering material and its taxonomic composition are still uncommon practices. This paper presents the results of a study of plant remains observed in pottery dated to the oldest Neolithic from south-eastern Poland, as a tool for detecting or confirming changes in the method of making the pottery. In previous studies, plant material was noticed sporadically in coarse ware and its identification was based on macroscopic plant morphology. On the other hand, remains of plants were not usually observed in the other finer ware types since their surfaces were frequently smoothed and decorated, while their sections were very thin. Therefore, in the present study, these groups of pottery have been studied in detail. A preliminary observation of surfaces and fresh sections of selected potsherds has shown that plant temper was neither evident nor abundant in them. However, with microscopy, small fragments of plant tissues and their imprints have been seen inside the clay. Their identification was not possible on the basis of plant morphology, but was carried out with the help of plant anatomy, especially by observing the microscopic features of plant epidermis. Previous archaeobotanical studies from the area indicated that the plants used as temper in coarse ware mostly included remnants of cereal chaff. Consequently, this paper will test this hypothesis in the case of the finer Neolithic ceramics." .

Likewise, their sister lineage (Arctiinae: Lithosiini) has been documented feeding on algae and lichens, and is known to sequester lichen-derived secondary compounds from the larval to adult stages. Prevalence of lichenivory in this early radiation (ca. 3000 species) may provide clues to the phylogenetic basis for storied chemical sequestration within all tiger moths. Despite the evolutionary significance of this trait, we lack a basic understanding of the extent of lichenivory among lithosiines, and the distribution of sequestered chemicals among life stages. The dynamics of chemical sequestration throughout the lifecycle for the lichen moth Crambidia cephalica were investigated by testing the hypothesis that lichen-derived metabolites are unequally distributed among life stages, and that laboratory-reared C. cephalica have less metabolite diversity than wild-caught individuals. Crambidia cephalica was reared on Physcia, and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Several putative lichen-derived metabolites were detected across three life stages, i.e., larval, pupal, and adult, and differences among life stages and lichen host were observed. These results provide evidence that multiple lichen-derived metabolites are sequestered by C. cephalica; some metabolites are retained through adulthood, and others are lost or modified in earlier life stages. The presence of differing lichen-derived metabolites across life stages may indicate functional properties of the metabolites for C. cephalica with regards to chemical protection from antagonists, and other physiological processes." .

In this study we have collected data from various studies on the aboveground woody biomass of 19 common tree species growing in Europe. The aim of this paper was to calculate species-specific biomass equations for the aboveground woody biomass of single trees in dependence of root-collar-diameter (RCD), height (H) and the combination of the two (RCD2 H). Next to calculating species-specific biomass equations for the species available in the dataset, we also calculated generic biomass equations for all broadleaved species and all conifer species. The biomass equations should be a contribution to the pool of published biomass equations, whereas the novelty is here that the equations were exclusively derived for young trees." .

Floral compounds are therefore of primary importance for reproductive isolation and species delimitations in this genus. In the fly orchid group, molecular, morphological, and ecological characters have been extensively studied, but a comprehensive survey of floral scents is still lacking. In the present study, the blends of floral compounds of its three members, Ophrys insectifera, Ophrys aymoninii, and Ophrys subinsectifera, were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 107 compounds were found, with a majority of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Significant differentiation, both qualitative and quantitative, was found among the three taxa. This result, pooled with those from the literature, forms a comprehensive and congruent dataset that allows us to elucidate the taxonomic rank of the three members of the fly orchid group." .

EPHA3 has been revealed to be the most frequently mutated Eph receptor gene in lung cancer with abnormal expression. Growing evidence indicates that the signaling proteins of EPHA3 downstream, including PI3K, BMX and STAT3, play crucial roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. To explore the possible role of EPHA3 in MDR, we assessed the influence of EPHA3 on chemoresistance, cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumor growth, as well as the relationship between EPHA3 and the expression of PI3K, BMX, and STAT3 in SCLC. We observed that overexpression of EPHA3 in SCLC cells decreased chemoresistance by increasing apoptosis and inducing G0/G1 arrest, accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of PI3K/BMX/STAT3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of EPHA3 expression generated a resistant phenotype of SCLC, as a result of decreased apoptosis and induced G2/M phase arrest. And re-expression of EPHA3 in these cells reversed the resistant phenotype. Meanwhile, increased phosphorylation of PI3K/BMX/STAT3 signaling pathway was observed in these cells with EPHA3 deficiency. Notably, both PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and BMX inhibitor (LFM-A13) impaired the chemoresistance enhanced by EPHA3 deficiency in SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, EPHA3 inhibited growth of SCLC cells in vivo and was correlated with longer overall survival of SCLC patients. Thus, we first provide the evidences that EPHA3 is involved in regulating the MDR of SCLC via PI3K/BMX/STAT3 signaling and may be a new therapeutic target in SCLC." .

Our six experimental climatic scenarios were: constant mean with zero variance or constant variance or increasing variance; changing mean with zero variance or constant variance or increasing variance. Our key result was that environments with changing thermal variance reduce the scope of thermal tolerance and survival. Heat tolerance seems to be conserved, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with mean low as well as changing environmental temperatures. Flies acclimated to scenarios of changing variance—with either constant or changing mean temperatures—exhibited significantly lower survival rate. Our results imply that changing and constant variances would be just as important in future scenarios of climate change under greenhouse warming as increases in mean annual temperature. To develop more realistic predictions about the biological impacts of climate change, such interactions between the mean and variance of environmental temperature should be considered." .

During a 16-wk. period in 2011, a total of 5075 moths caught by light traps in the field revealed a significant male-biased capture. However, the sex ratio of the natural population was not significantly different from 1:1 from July to October 2011.

Among the captured adults, the percentage of unmated females was significantly lower than that of the mated females and males. Experiments in the laboratory indicated that the time of activities for both sexes was consistent with the active patterns of oviposition and copulation. The percentage of flight-to-light of the unmated females was significantly lower than that of the mated females and males.

Although the composition of PRCs may vary considerably, it is well established that the embryonic ectoderm development (EED) 1, suppressor of zeste (SUZ) 12, and methyltransferase enhancer of zeste (EZH2)-containing complex, PRC2, which is abundant in highly proliferative cells (including cancer cells), establishes a repressive methylation mark on histone 3 (H3K27me3). From the perspective of molecular cancer pathogenesis, this effect, when directed towards a promoter of tumor suppressor genes, represents pro-tumorigenic effect. This mode of action was shown in several cancer models. However, EZH2 function extends beyond this scenario. The highly specific cellular background, related to the origin of cell and numerous external stimuli during a given time-window, may be the trigger for EZH2 interaction with other proteins, not necessarily histones. This is particularly relevant for cancer. This review provides a critical overview of the evolutional importance of PRC and discusses several important aspects of EZH2 functioning within PRC. The review also deals with mutational studies on EZH2. Due to the existence of several protein (and messenger RNA (mRNA)) isoforms, these mutations were stratified, using the protein sequence which is considered canonical. This approach showed that there is an urgent need for the uniformed positioning of currently known EZH2 mutations (somatic—in tumors, as well as germline mutations in the Weaver’s syndrome). Finally, we discuss EZH2 function with respect to amount of trimethylated H3K27, in a specific cellular milieu, through presenting the most recent data related to EZH2-H3K27m3 relationship in cancer. All these points are significant in considering EZH2 as a therapeutic target." .

Based on the results of polyphasic characterization, strain THG-SL1T represented a novel species within the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium horti sp. nov. is proposed.

It can be synthesized by heterologous expression of protoilludene synthase in Escherichia coli with overexpression of mevalonate (MVA) or methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase. Here, we present E. coli as a cell factory for protoilludene production. ResultsProtoilludene was successfully produced in E. coli by overexpression of a hybrid exogenous MVA pathway, endogenous FPP synthase (IspA), and protoilludene synthase (OMP7) of Omphalotus olearius. For improving protoilludene production, the MVA pathway was engineered to increase synthesis of building blocks isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by sequential order permutation of the lower MVA portion (MvL), the alteration of promoters and copy numbers for the upper MVA portion (MvU), and the coordination of both portions, resulting in an efficient entire MVA pathway. To reduce the accumulation of mevalonate observed in the culture broth due to lower efficiency of the MvL than the MvU, the MvL was further engineered by homolog substitution with the corresponding genes from Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, the highest protoilludene production of 1199 mg/L was obtained from recombinant E. coli harboring the optimized hybrid MVA pathway in a test tube culture. ConclusionsThis is the first report of microbial synthesis of protoilludene by using an engineered E. coli strain. The protoilludene production was increased by approx. Thousandfold from an initial titer of 1.14 mg/L. The strategies of both the sequential order permutation and homolog substitution could provide a new perspective of engineering MVA pathway, and be applied to optimization of other metabolic pathways." .

However, knowledge of the effect on ABA distribution and transport of water stress at different sites on the plant is limited. In this study, water stress imposed on peanut leaves or roots by treatment with PEG 6000 is termed “leaf stress” or “root stress”, respectively. Immunoenzyme localization technolony was first used to detect ABA distribution in peanut. Under root stress, ABA biosynthesis and distribution level were all more pronounced in root than in leaf. However, ABA transport and the ability to induce stomatal closure were still better in leaf than in root during root stress; However, ABA biosynthesis initially increased in leaf, then rapidly accumulated in the vascular cambium of leaves and induced stomatal closure under leaf stress; ABA produced in root tissues was also transported to leaf tissues to maintain stomatal closure. The vascular system was involved in the coordination and integration of this complex regulatory mechanism for ABA signal accumulation. Water stress subject to root or leaf results in different of ABA biosynthesis and transport ability that trigger stoma close in peanut." .

However, the response of the coupled water and carbon cycles to drought and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we provide the first global synthesis of the drought effect on ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE = gross primary production (GPP)/evapotranspiration (ET)). Using two observational WUE datasets (i.e., eddy-covariance measurements at 95 sites (526 site-years) and global gridded diagnostic modelling based on existing observation and a data-adaptive machine learning approach), we find a contrasting response of WUE to drought between arid (WUE increases with drought) and semi-arid/sub-humid ecosystems (WUE decreases with drought), which is attributed to different sensitivities of ecosystem processes to changes in hydro-climatic conditions. WUE variability in arid ecosystems is primarily controlled by physical processes (i.e., evaporation), whereas WUE variability in semi-arid/sub-humid regions is mostly regulated by biological processes (i.e., assimilation). We also find that shifts in hydro-climatic conditions over years would intensify the drought effect on WUE. Our findings suggest that future drought events, when coupled with an increase in climate variability, will bring further threats to semi-arid/sub-humid ecosystems and potentially result in biome reorganization, starting with low-productivity and high water-sensitivity grassland." .

Using 3D cultures of renal MDCK cells (cysts), we found that the Rab35 GTPase plays a crucial role in polarity initiation and apical lumen positioning during the first cell division of cyst development. At the molecular level, Rab35 physically couples cytokinesis with the initiation of apico-basal polarity by tethering intracellular vesicles containing key apical determinants at the cleavage site. These vesicles transport aPKC, Cdc42, Crumbs3 and the lumen-promoting factor Podocalyxin, and are tethered through a direct interaction between Rab35 and the cytoplasmic tail of Podocalyxin. Consequently, Rab35 inactivation leads to complete inversion of apico-basal polarity in 3D cysts. This novel and unconventional mode of Rab-dependent vesicle targeting provides a simple mechanism for triggering both initiation of apico-basal polarity and lumen opening at the centre of cysts." .

The structure shows that potent pharmacophore trans-Ned-19 (ref. 17) acts allosterically by clamping the pore domains to VSD2.

This was followed by tests with synthetic solutions to determine how specific phenolic compounds, vanillin, gallic acid, catechol and syringaldehyde, are degraded individually and in synergy. An evaluation of the simultaneous detoxification and enzymatic hydrolysis of the sugars was performed. The results showed that an enzyme dosage of at least 100 µL of laccase/g of phenol is required to obtain a significant detoxification of the prehydrolysate.

Although phytohormones, including cytokinins, are known to regulate plant development and physiology as well as plant immunity, their production by microorganisms has not been considered as a biocontrol mechanism. Here we identify the ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens G20-18 to efficiently control P. syringae infection in Arabidopsis, allowing maintenance of tissue integrity and ultimately biomass yield. Microbial cytokinin production was identified as a key determinant for this biocontrol effect on the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen. While cytokinin-deficient loss-of-function mutants of G20-18 exhibit impaired biocontrol, functional complementation with cytokinin biosynthetic genes restores cytokinin-mediated biocontrol, which is correlated with differential cytokinin levels in planta. Arabidopsis mutant analyses revealed the necessity of functional plant cytokinin perception and salicylic acid-dependent defence signalling for this biocontrol mechanism. These results demonstrate microbial cytokinin production as a novel microbe-based, hormone-mediated concept of biocontrol. This mechanism provides a basis to potentially develop novel, integrated plant protection strategies combining promotion of growth, a favourable physiological status and activation of fine-tuned direct defence and abiotic stress resilience." .

Unfortunately, few studies have investigated the effect of Ifrg15 in this process. In mammals, the fusion of male and female pronuclei generates a diploid zygote, and is an important step for subsequent cleavage and blastocyst formation. Here, by using RNA interference, rescue experiments, immunofluorescence staining and live cell observations, we found that preimplantation embryo development was arrested at the 1-cell stage after knocking down Ifrg15 expression. This induced DNA damage and prevented the cleavage of embryos. Furthermore, the effect of Ifrg15 deficiency in arresting preimplantation embryo development produced by specific short interfering RNA microinjection was concentration-dependent. Using transcriptome expression profiles, gene ontogeny functional annotation and enrichment analysis, we gained 197 enriched pathways based on 1445 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Of these, 12 pathways and about one third of the DEGs were involved in DNA damage, DNA repair, cell cycle, and developmental processes. Thus, the IFRG15 protein might be an important molecule for maintaining genomic integrity and stability through upregulating or downregulating a cascade of genes to permit normal preimplantation embryo development." .

Depending on study aims, non-wetland plants might be removed before analysis, affecting conclusions around biodiversity and community structure. We compared the native plant communities of seasonal wetlands in a predominately agricultural landscape as defined geographically (including all species) with that of the obligate wetland assemblage. We were primarily concerned with determining how this design decision affects ecological and conservation conclusions. We analysed a survey database containing >12,900 flora records from South Australia, developing a new area-based method to remove sampling bias to include only wetlands with a near-complete census. We modelled occupancy, species-area relationships, β-diversity and nestedness under our contrasting community definitions. Terrestrial species were 57.4 % of total richness. Removing these species reduced wetland α-diversity by 45 %, but did not affect the scaling of richness with area (power-law species-area relationship z = 0.21 ± 0.01). Occupancies for wetland plants were relatively uniform, but were heavily dominated by rare (satellite) species when terrestrial plants were included, and this also increased β-diversity. Nestedness for terrestrial species occupancies was marginally lower than predicted under null models, suggesting that rare species often do not co-occur with common species. An implication of these occupancy patterns is that twice as many wetlands (and 50 % more wetland area) would be needed to include every native species within at least one wetland compared with wetland-only species." .

During cultivation, the density of oospores in a sample of the nutrient solution was estimated one, three and five weeks after inoculation, using a haemocytometer, and the numbers of propagules in the nutrient solution and in the roots were also measured, by incubating serial dilutions of samples in a selective liquid medium. Six weeks after inoculation, plants were harvested, and their root and shoot characteristics recorded. With increasing root-zone temperature, the population densities of P. aphanidermatum in the roots and in the nutrient solution increased, while the growth of inoculated plants was reduced. Five weeks after inoculation, the pathogen density at 30 °C was 3.0 · 107 propagules per g dry mass in the roots and 6.6 · 104 propagules l−1 in the nutrient solution. At 20 °C, these quantities were 1.1 · 106 and 1.9 · 104, respectively. A high pathogen density at 30 °C resulted in significantly reduced photosynthesis, transpiration and dry mass of all plant components. Nitrogen and potassium concentration in the leaves decreased, which indicated limitations in the nutrient uptake of severely infected roots.

Transient over-expression of miR-204 by transfecting with miR-204 mimics suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and induced apoptosis and G1 arrest, whereas inhibition of miR-204 showed the converse effects. Additionally, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), an important transcription factor, was demonstrated as a potential target gene of miR-204. Subsequent investigations found a negative correlation between miR-204 level and ATF2 expression in NSCLC tissue samples.

Due to deforestation and frequent fires, degraded savannahs dominate the landscape in the study region. Here we provide a list of useful plants from these savannahs including quantitative data about cultural importance of the respective species, aiming on the one hand to conserve the local knowledge and on the other hand to create a reliable basis for research projects in the region. MethodsField work was conducted in April and May 2014 in 5 municipalities of Uíge province. The study is based on 32 semi-structured and free-listing interviews, group discussions of varying scope and 14 field trips, involving a total of 82 informants. Throughout the course of the study herbarium specimens of the useful species were collected for later identification. Cultural importance index was applied to analyse the data sets recorded and to determine the best-known useful species in the region. All data sets were compared to the literature available for the region. ResultsThe study documents a total of 498 citations for the use of 122 plants from 48 families, 34.0 % of which were unknown according to the literature used for comparison. The high amount (71 %) of medical use-reports indicates that plants still play a crucial role in rural health care. We identified 14 plant species of special interest for pharmacological analysis. Species of highest cultural importance are Annona senegalensis Pers. and Sarcocephalus latifolius (Sm.) E.A., both of which are frequently found in disturbed savannahs. ConclusionsThe study points out the importance of savannahs even if degraded in terms of useful plants and provides a valuable addition to current knowledge of plant use in Northern Angola. This is not only essential for further studies, i.e. regarding pharmaceutical agents, but also for the design of a planned botanical garden of the University Kimpa Vita in Uíge, which aims at communicating the findings to the local people." .

The mechanism of “same-stress” resistance (resistance to a second, strong stress after mild primary stress of the same type) probably depends on the activation of defense and repair mechanisms specific for a particular type of stress, while cross-stress resistance (i.e., resistance to a second, strong stress after a different type of mild primary stress) is the effect of activation of both a specific and general stress response program, which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is known as the environmental stress response (ESR). Advancements in research techniques have made it possible to study the mechanism of cross-stress resistance at various levels of cellular organization: stress signal transduction pathways, regulation of gene expression, and transcription or translation processes. As a result of this type of research, views on the cross-stress protection mechanism have been reconsidered. It was originally thought that cross-stress resistance, irrespective of the nature of the two stresses, was determined by universal mechanisms, i.e., the same mechanisms within the general stress response. They are now believed to be more specific and strictly dependent on the features of the first stress." .

Invasive plant removal is considered necessary where restoration of dynamic channels is needed to provide critical habitat for species of conservation concern. However, these programs are widely reported to be inefficient. Post-control reinvasion is frequent, suggesting increased attention is needed to prevent seed regeneration. To develop more effective responses to this invader in the Central Platte River (Nebraska, USA), we investigated several aspects of Phragmites seed ecology potentially linked to post-control reinvasion, in comparison to other common species: extent of viable seed production, importance of water transport, and regeneration responses to hydrology. We observed that although Phragmites seed does not mature until very late in the ice-free season, populations produce significant amounts of viable seed (>50 % of filled seed). Most seed transported via water in the Platte River are invasive perennial species, although Phragmites abundances are much lower than species such as Lythrum salicaria, Cyperus esculentus and Phalaris arundinacea. Seed regeneration of Phragmites varies greatly depending on hydrology, especially timing of water level changes. Flood events coinciding with the beginning of seedling emergence reduced establishment by as much as 59 % compared to flood events that occurred a few weeks later. Results of these investigations suggest that prevention of seed set (i.e., by removal of flowering culms) should be a priority in vegetation stands not being treated annually. After seeds are in the seedbank, preventing reinvasion using prescribed flooding has a low chance of success given that Phragmites can regenerate in a wide variety of hydrologic microsites." .

Generally, effects of minerals are partially thought to result from improvement of microbial metabolism, but their influence on the rumen microbiota has rarely been documented to date. In this study, we investigated the response of microbiota to mineral salt in heifer and adult cows and evaluated ruminal fermentation and enteric methane emissions of cows fed mineral salts. Twelve lactating Holstein cows and twelve heifers fed a total mixed ration (TMR) diet were randomly allocated into two groups, respectively: a treatment group comprising half of the adults and heifers that were fed mineral salt and a control group containing the other half fed a diet with no mineral salt supplement. Enteric methane emissions were reduced by 9.6% (P < 0.05) in adults ingesting a mineral salt diet, while concentrations of ruminal ammonia, butyrate, and propionate were increased to a significant extent (P < 0.05). Enteric methane emissions were also reduced in heifers ingesting a mineral salt diet, but not to a significant extent (P > 0.05). Moreover, the concentrations of ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were not significantly altered in heifers (P > 0.05). Based on these results, we performed high-throughput sequencing to explore the bacterial and archaeal communities of the rumen samples. Succiniclasticum and Prevotella, two propionate-producing bacteria, were predominant in samples of both adults and heifers. At the phylotype level, mineral salt intake led to a significant shift from Succiniclasticum to Prevotella and Prevotellaceae populations in adults. In contrast, reduced abundance of Succiniclasticum and Prevotella phylotypes was observed, with no marked shift in propionate-producing bacteria in heifers. Methanogenic archaea were not significantly abundant between groups, either in adult cows or heifers. The shift of Succiniclasticum to Prevotella and Prevotellaceae in adults suggests a response of microbiota to mineral salt that contributes to higher propionate production, which competes for hydrogen utilized by methanogens. Our data collectively indicate that a mineral salt diet can alter interactions of bacterial taxa that result in enteric methane reduction, and this effect is also influenced in an age-dependent manner." .

However, the paths of electron flow during propionate oxidation in the anode of MECs are unknown. Here, the paths of electron flow involved in propionate oxidation in the anode of two-chambered MECs were examined at low (4.5 mM) and high (36 mM) propionate concentrations. Electron mass balances and microbial community analysis revealed that multiple paths of electron flow (via acetate/H2 or acetate/formate) to current could occur simultaneously during propionate oxidation regardless of the concentration tested. Current (57–96 %) was the largest electron sink and methane (0–2.3 %) production was relatively unimportant at both concentrations based on electron balances. At a low propionate concentration, reactors supplemented with 2-bromoethanesulfonate had slightly higher coulombic efficiencies than reactors lacking this methanogenesis inhibitor. However, an opposite trend was observed at high propionate concentration, where reactors supplemented with 2-bromoethanesulfonate had a lower coulombic efficiency and there was a greater percentage of electron loss (23.5 %) to undefined sinks compared to reactors without 2-bromoethanesulfonate (11.2 %). Propionate removal efficiencies were 98 % (low propionate concentration) and 78 % (high propionate concentration). Analysis of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing revealed the dominance of sequences most similar to Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and G. sulfurreducens subsp. ethanolicus. Collectively, these results provide new insights on the paths of electron flow during propionate oxidation in the anode of MECs fed with low and high propionate concentrations." .

With the exception of O111, 5 O-types were recorded regularly and at high frequencies (O26: 33.3 %; O157: 33.3 %; O104: 66.6 %; O103: 72.2 %; O145: 94.4 %). Genes for Shiga-like-toxins and intimin were almost omnipresent (stx1: 77.8 %; stx2: 83.3 %; eae: 77.8 %). Strain isolation was undertaken for O-groups 26, 103, 104, 145 and 157. Sample selection for strain isolation was based on Cq-values for the O-groups and stx1, stx2 and eae. From selected samples, frozen enrichment cultures were cultivated on EHLY-agar and 50 typical colonies screened for the O-type and genes encoding for stx1, stx2 and eae. With this approach, only one virulent EHEC-strain could be isolated (Escherichia coli O103, stx1 +; stx2 −; eae +). We carried out one extensive testing with 800 colonies of O-group O145, and no virulent strain was isolated. Our findings showed that PCR-results are not sufficient to formulate epidemiological conclusions and that the isolation of strains is necessary. However, as the detection procedure of EHEC in foods is cumbersome and expensive, the appropriateness of such an approach in official food control is a matter of debate." .

Seventeen paired sites (each containing at least 40 years prior afforested and grassland plots) were investigated in the mountains of Central Spain and Western Austria. Topsoil CO2 effluxes were monitored under standardized conditions for six months as a proxy for soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralisation. The bulk C and nitrogen (N) concentrations and their isotopic composition in the soil and in the plants were assessed. The soil C:N ratio was consistently greater after afforestation in both regions, which in Spain was caused by a significant decrease in N concentration. No consistent effect was found on mineralisation rates due to vegetation change. Afforestation produced a more consistent soil 13C enrichment in the Spanish than in the Austrian sites. Our work strongly suggests that increasing altitude in Mediterranean mountain grasslands alleviates water limitation, favouring both plant growth and SOM decomposition, and ultimately accelerating C cycling. In contrast, temperate grassland areas at high altitudes were associated with severe temperature limitations, which constrained SOM transformation processes. In spite of the impact of afforestation on soil biogeochemical processes, C concentrations were marginally affected. We therefore conclude that grassland conversion to coniferous forests does not enhanced C sequestration in the mineral soil, for at least 40 years after land-use change." .

The constitutive expression in Arabidopsis thaliana of four MSRs which were induced by salt and drought in microarray assay showed that the product of one (TaMSRA2) heightened the plant’s tolerance to NaCl, methylviologen (MV), and abscisic acid, that of the second (TaMSRA5) enhanced salinity tolerance, that of the third (TaMSRB1.1) increased tolerance to salinity, MV and H2O2, and that of the fourth (TaMSRB5.1) increased tolerance to both salinity and mannitol. The effect of the presence in A. thaliana of TaMSRB1.1 was to suppress the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and to increase the intracellular content of soluble sugars." .

However, the challenges of increasing plant biomass yield and enhancing their stress tolerance, especially on marginal lands, have been existed for a long while. In the past several years, bacterial endophytes used as bio-fertilizers for improving crop production have offered an opportunity to facilitate high biomass yield of energy crops in a more sustainable manner. ResultsA total of 16 endophytic bacteria strains were isolated and purified from the roots of elephant grass, which were classified into four bacterial genera: Sphingomonas, Pantoea, Bacillus, and Enterobacter. Four strains, pp01, pp02, pp04, and pp06, represented four different genera, were then selected and tested in vitro for their plant growth promoting properties, effects on plant growth and salt stress tolerance of Hybrid Pennisetum. The inoculation with these four bacterial mixture demonstrated a significant plant growth promotion for Hybrid Pennisetum from the normal to salt stress conditions at 0, 50, 100, and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. The highest promotion rate for biomass yield was 116.01 and 81.72 % for shoot fresh weight and dry weight, respectively. The bacterial strains tested were shown to solubilize insoluble phosphate, fix nitrogen, produce indole acetic acid and ammonia, but only strains from Sphingomonas, Bacillus, and Enterobacter can produce siderophore. In addition, the endophyte strains tested were all able to successfully colonize the roots of Hybrid Pennisetum, reaching upto 12.12 ± 0.98 CFU/g fresh roots at the 3rd day of inoculation. ConclusionThe four endophytic bacteria from elephant grass significantly promoted plant growth and biomass yield, alleviated the harmful effects of salt stress on Hybrid Pennisetum. These bacteria have indicated some unique properties that are very valuable for exploiting bio-inoculants aiding in the efforts to establish a sustainable and large-scale feedstock production system for Hybrid Pennisetum, particularly, on the saline marginal lands." .

Forest roads can cause a variety of impacts on local wildlife that may lead to extirpation: facilitating the spread of invasive organisms, causing death or harm by vehicle strikes, and changing the behavior of animals to their detriment. Roads create improved access to forests, which can increase predation rates from hunters. Animals may move to avoid traffic noise, increasing their vulnerability to predation by other animals. One of the most significant impacts of forest roads is on water quality, through both catastrophic and chronic sources of water pollution, primarily from sediment. While it is not the case that every road will cause any or all of these impacts, for those that do, mitigation measures can be used to lessen these negative effects. These mitigation measures must begin during the location phase of the road and should continue through construction, use, and maintenance of the roads. Application of these mitigation measures allows forest managers to minimize the impacts from their forest roads when necessary." .

Twenty-day-old seedlings of C. pilosula were either inoculated with GB03 or without it (as a control). At the same time, plants were treated with NaCl (0, 50, 100, or 150 mM) for 40 days. Growth parameters, photosynthetic indexes, malondialdehyde concentration, and leaf osmotic potential were measured after treatments. The result indicated that GB03 improved plant biomass of C. pilosula under salt conditions and improved the photosynthetic capacity by increasing net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance and decreasing intercellular CO2 concentration under both 0 and 50 mM NaCl. The bacterium strain also decreased leaf osmotic potential and peroxidation of membrane lipids that could help the plant adapt to saline environments.

Currently existing uncertainties regarding carbon fluxes within terrestrial systems can be addressed by studies of past carbon cycle dynamics and related climate change recorded in sedimentary successions. Here we show an example from the Early Jurassic (early Toarcian, c. 183 mya) marginal-marine strata from Poland, tracking the hinterland response to climatic changes through a super-greenhouse event. In contrast to anoxia-related enhanced carbon storage in coeval open marine environments, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations in the Polish successions are substantially reduced during this event. Increasing temperature favoured fungal-mediated decomposition of plant litter – specifically of normally resistant woody tissues. The associated injection of oxidized organic matter into the atmosphere corresponds to abrupt changes in standing vegetation and may have contributed significantly to the amplified greenhouse climate on Earth. The characteristic Toarcian signature of multiple warm pulses coinciding with rapidly decreasing carbon isotope ratios may in part be the result of a radical reduction of the terrestrial carbon pool as a response to climate change." .

The male flowers of the tropical marine angiosperm Thalassia testudinum open-up and release pollen in mucilage at night when invertebrate fauna is active. Here we present experimental evidence that, in the absence of water-flow, these invertebrates visit the flowers, carry and transfer mucilage mass with embedded pollen from the male flowers to the stigmas of the female flowers. Pollen tubes are formed on the stigmas, indicating that pollination is successful. Thus, T. testudinum has mixed abiotic–biotic pollination. We propose a zoobenthophilous pollination syndrome (pollen transfer in the benthic zone by invertebrate animals) which shares many characteristics with hydrophily, but flowers are expected to open-up during the night." .

In the current work, previously published transcriptomic studies of Alnus nodules and of symbiotic Frankia were reexamined for TCA cycle related genes. The bacterial TCA enzyme genes were all upregulated, especially the succinyl-CoA synthase and the citrate synthase while on the plant side, none was significantly modified in nodules relative to non-inoculated roots. A preliminary metabolomics approach permitted to see that citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, malate and fumarate were all more abundant (FC (Fold change) = 5–70) in mature nitrogen-fixing nodules than in roots. In the evaluation of the uptake and metabolism of these organic acids, a significant change was observed in the morphology of nitrogen fixing vesicles in vitro: the dicarboxylates malate, succinate and fumarate induced the formation of larger vesicles than was the case with propionate. Moreover, the production of spores was also modified depending on the organic acid present. The assays showed that most C4 dicarboxylates were taken up while C6 tricarboxylates were not and citrate even partially blocked catabolism of reserve carbon. Tests were performed to determine if the change in membrane permeability induced by Ag5, a peptide previously shown to modify the membranes of Frankia, increased the uptake of specific organic acids. No effect was observed with citrate while an increase in nitrogen fixation was seen with propionate." .

IsoSource software was used to calculate the probable contribution of different water sources to the total plant water uptake. Stomatal conductance, stem water potential, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) of whole plant were also determined for evaluating the water status of lucerne growing at different slope positions. The results showed that soil water content increased as the elevation decreased. Oxygen compositions of soil water in the 0–40 cm profile fluctuated considerably. Soil water δ18O values in deep profile (>3.5 m) were similar to those in groundwater, implying the recharge of groundwater to this soil layer. Highest water utilization rate from deep soil profile (below 350 cm) was recorded for lucerne grown at the slope position 1 (groundwater table depth of 3.5–3.9 m) in April, June and July. The lucernes at slope position 2 (groundwater table depth of 5.8–6.4 m) and slope position 3 (groundwater table depth 7.1–8.3 m) mostly used water from deep soil layers (below 350 cm) during dry period, and turned to use water from superficial soil layer in wet period. Higher yield, Δ13C value of whole plant and stomatal conductance were observed for lucerne grown at the slope position 1 than those at other slope positions. These results indicated that groundwater is a significant water source for transpiration of lucerne grown in Ningxia semi-arid area with shallow groundwater table where lucerne grassland is suggested to be established so as to obtain better yield performance." .

They induce a multi-nucleate feeding site close to the vascular bundle in the roots of their host plant and remain sessile for the rest of their life. Nematode secretions, produced in the oesophageal glands and secreted through a hollow stylet into the host plant cytoplasm, are believed to play key role in pathogenesis. To combat these persistent pathogens, the identity and functional analysis of secreted effectors can serve as a key to devise durable control measures. In this review, we will recapitulate the knowledge over the identification and functional characterization of secreted nematode effector repertoire from phytoparasitic nematodes. ResearchDespite considerable efforts, the identity of genes encoding nematode secreted proteins has long been severely hampered because of their microscopic size, long generation time and obligate biotrophic nature. The methodologies such as bioinformatics, protein structure modeling, in situ hybridization microscopy, and protein-protein interaction have been used to identify and to attribute functions to the effectors. In addition, RNA interference (RNAi) has been instrumental to decipher the role of the genes encoding secreted effectors necessary for parasitism and genes attributed to normal development. Recent comparative and functional genomic approaches have accelerated the identification of effectors from phytoparasitic nematodes and offers opportunities to control these pathogens. ConclusionPlant parasitic nematodes pose a serious threat to global food security of various economically important crops. There is a wealth of genomic and transcriptomic information available on plant parasitic nematodes and comparative genomics has identified many effectors. Bioengineering crops with dsRNA of phytonematode genes can disrupt the life cycle of parasitic nematodes and therefore holds great promise to develop resistant crops against plant-parasitic nematodes." .

MethodsContinuous, steady-state 13CO2 labelling was applied throughout the growth period (60 d) of Lolium perenne. Exclusion meshes were used to control access of roots and AM hyphae to soil, and plant-derived C was quantified within microbial PLFA and NLFA, and soil CO2 efflux was partitioned into plant- and soil organic matter (SOM) derived components. ResultsPathways of C-flow through hyphosphere and mycorrhizosphere communities were distinct, as was the fate of plant-derived C from AM hyphae accessing soil through 37 and 1 μm meshes.

Phylogenetic data and morphological traits of octocorals were coupled with environmental factors to test hypotheses of community assembly in the deep (250–2500 m) Gulf of Mexico. We found lineage turnover at a depth of 800–1200 m, with isidids and chrysogorgiids at deeper depths and a diversity of species from across the phylogeny occupying shallower depths. Traits, including axis type, polyp shape, and polyp retraction, differed among species occupying the shallowest (250–800 m) and deepest (1200–2500 m) depths. Results also indicated that octocoral species sort along an environmental gradient of depth. Closely related octocoral species sorted into different depth strata on the upper to middle slope, likely due to barriers imposed by water masses followed by adaptive divergence. Within any given depth zone down to 2000 m, the phylogenetic relatedness of co-existing octocorals was random, indicating that stochastic processes, such as recruitment, also shape community structure. At depths >2000 m, octocorals were more closely related than expected by chance due to the diversification of chrysogorgiids and isidids, which retain conserved traits that impart survival at deeper and/or colder depths. Polyp density, size, and inter-polyp distance were significantly correlated with depth, particularly in plexaurids and isidids, highlighting trait lability across depth and supporting that environmental gradients influence octocoral morphology. Our community phylogenetics approach indicates that both environmental filtering and neutral processes shape community assembly in the deep sea." .

It is well established that photoperiodic flowering is intimately associated with the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. In support of this notion, many clock-defective mutants exhibit altered photoperiodic sensitivity in inducing flowering. LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and its functional paralogue CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) constitute the core of the circadian clock together with TIMING OF CAB EXPRSSION 1 (TOC1). While it is known that TOC1 contributes to the timing of flowering entirely by modulating the clock function, molecular mechanisms by which LHY and CCA1 regulate flowering time have not been explored. ResultsWe investigated how LHY and CCA1 regulate photoperiodic flowering through molecular genetic and biochemical studies. It was found that LHY-defective mutants (lhy-7 and lhy-20) exhibit accelerated flowering under both long days (LDs) and short days (SDs). Consistent with the accelerated flowering phenotypes, gene expression analysis revealed that expression of the floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is up-regulated in the lhy mutants. In addition, the expression peaks of GIGANTEA (GI) and FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX PROTEIN 1 (FKF1) genes, which constitute the clock output pathway that is linked with photoperiodic flowering, were advanced by approximately 4 h in the mutants. Furthermore, the up-regulation of FT disappeared when the endogenous circadian period is matched to the external light/dark cycles in the lhy-7 mutant. Notably, whereas CCA1 binds strongly to FT gene promoter, LHY does not show such DNA-binding activity. ConclusionsOur data indicate that the advanced expression phases of photoperiodic flowering genes are associated with the clock defects in the lhy mutants and responsible for the reduced photoperiodic sensitivity of the mutant flowering, demonstrating that LHY regulates photoperiodic flowering via the circadian clock, similar to what has been shown with TOC1. It is notable that while LHY regulates photoperiodic flowering in a similar manner as with TOC1, the underlying molecular mechanism would be somewhat distinct from that exerted by CCA1 in Arabidopsis." .

RCP 8.5 imposes more extreme climatic changes on CLMcrop, while simultaneously exposing the crops to higher CO2 fertilization than RCP 4.5. As a result CLMcrop simulates global to regional scale changes in yield and water requirements for RCP 8.5 that exceed and sometimes more than double the RCP 4.5 changes relative to today. Under RCP 4.5 then, human societies may confront easier adaptation to changes in crop yields and water requirements. Under both RCPs, CLMcrop projects declining global yields for C3 crops (e.g., wheat, soybean, rice) without CO2 fertilization and C4 crops (corn, sugarcane) without irrigation. Yield declines of 3 t ha−1 stand out in parts of tropical and subtropical Africa and South America (presently areas of rapid agricultural expansion) and are due to increasing plant respiration and decreasing soil moisture, both due to rising temperatures. Irrigation and CO2 fertilization mitigate yield losses and in some cases lead to gains, so irrigation may help maintain or increase current yields through the 21st century. However, simulated global irrigation requirements increase: as much as 23 % for C4 crops without CO2 fertilization under RCP 8.5 and as little as 3 % for C4 crops with CO2 fertilization under RCP4.5. Nitrogen fertilized crops display greater vulnerability to climate and environmental change than unfertilized crops in our simulations; still relative to unfertilized crops, they deliver significantly higher yields and remain indispensable in supporting a more populous and affluent humanity. These CLMcrop results broadly agree with previously published outcomes for the 21st century. We describe in this article a new version of CLMcrop that represents prognostic crop behavior not only in the mid-latitudes but also the tropics." .

Songbirds originated in Australia, but the evolutionary trajectory from a single species in an isolated continent to worldwide proliferation is poorly understood. Here, we combine the first comprehensive genome-scale DNA sequence data set for songbirds, fossil-based time calibrations, and geologically informed biogeographic reconstructions to provide a well-supported evolutionary hypothesis for the group. We show that songbird diversification began in the Oligocene, but accelerated in the early Miocene, at approximately half the age of most previous estimates. This burst of diversification occurred coincident with extensive island formation in Wallacea, which provided the first dispersal corridor out of Australia, and resulted in independent waves of songbird expansion through Asia to the rest of the globe. Our results reconcile songbird evolution with Earth history and link a major radiation of terrestrial biodiversity to early diversification within an isolated Australian continent." .

Hydraulic failure and carbon starvation in xylem sapwood are major hypotheses to explain drought-induced tree mortality. Because it is difficult to obtain enough field observations on drought-induced mortality in adult trees, the current understanding of the physiological mechanisms for tree die-offs is still controversial. However, the simultaneous examination of water and carbon uses throughout dehydration and rehydration processes in adult trees will contribute to clarify the roles of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation in tree wilting. Here we show the processes of the percent loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) and the content of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) of distal branches in woody plants with contrasting water use strategy. Starch was converted to soluble sugar during PLC progression under drought, and the hydraulic conductivity recovered following water supply. The conversion of NSCs is strongly associated with PLC variations during dehydration and rehydration processes, indicating that stored carbon contributes to tree survival under drought; further carbon starvation can advance hydraulic failure. We predict that even slow-progressing drought degrades forest ecosystems via carbon starvation, causing more frequent catastrophic forest die-offs than the present projection." .

To compare fruit development in these two types of squash, we sequenced the fruit transcriptome of two cultivars bred for different purposes: an acorn squash, ‘Sweet REBA’, and an oilseed pumpkin, ‘Lady Godiva’. Putative metabolic pathways were developed for carotenoid, starch, and sucrose synthesis in winter squash fruit and squash homologs were identified for each of the structural genes in the pathways.

To observe the impact of AgNPs on soil bacterial community, sampling was carried out from the rhizosphere of these crops at 20 and 40 days after the spraying of AgNPS. The bacterial diversity of these samples was analyzed by both cultural and molecular techniques (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis).

As a result, cork oak forests become susceptible to pest attack, which accelerates the onset of decline. Pest management strategies for this valuable and highly biodiverse ecosystem are examined in this review, taking into account the main insect pests and how their impact on cork oak forests is affected by climate change. While monitoring pests may provide the tools to predict the transition from endemic to epidemic insect populations, forestry practices (sanitary felling), biological control, and trapping are some of the most promising measures in protecting cork oak forests. Context Over the last decades, cork oak (Quercus suber L.) decline has affected millions of trees throughout its distribution range. Cork oak is a typically Mediterranean species remarkably relevant for the biodiversity and landscape conservation of vast evergreen oak forests. Cork oak is also well known and highly valued for cork production. Climatic changes, management practices, and biotic factors, particularly plant pathogens and insect pests, play a decisive role in tree death and market devaluation of cork. Aims Here, we review the major insect pests possibly involved in cork oak decline, while discussing pest management strategies. Methods A survey of the current literature was performed to identify major insect pests affecting cork oak trees, as well as to establish the most promising pest management strategies under climate change. Results Many authors seem to agree that the decline is triggered by both anthropogenic and abiotic factors, such as the mismanagement of cork oak forests and unfavorable climate (high temperatures and droughts). Consequently, trees become susceptible to pests and pathogens, which accelerate the onset of decline. Conclusion Since a further increase in temperatures and droughts is expected, developing adequate management strategies to adapt cork oak trees to climate change, while simultaneously preventing and reducing insect pest attacks, is of foremost importance in the effort to conserve these unique and highly diverse ecosystems." .

Its complexity is reflected by extensive genetic heterogeneity and much of the genetic liability remains unaccounted for. We applied a combined strategy involving detection of copy number variants (CNVs), whole-genome mapping, and exome sequencing to identify the genetic basis of autosomal-dominant SCZ in a Chinese family. To rule out pathogenic CNVs, we first performed Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis on samples from two patients and one psychiatrically healthy family member, but no pathogenic CNVs were detected. In order to further narrow down the susceptible region, we conducted genome-wide linkage analysis and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 7q21.13-22.3, with a maximum multipoint logarithm of odds score of 2.144. Whole-exome sequencing was then carried out with samples from three affected individuals and one unaffected individual in the family. A missense variation c.9575 C > G (p.Thr3192Ser) was identified in RELN, which is known as a risk gene for SCZ, located on chromosome 7q22, in the pedigree. This rare variant, as a highly penetrant risk variant, co-segregated with the phenotype. Our results provide genetic evidence that RELN may be one of pathogenic gene in SCZ." .

An attempt was made to assess the biomass production, carbon sequestration potential (tree + soil) and nutrient stocks of six multipurpose tree species (age: 22 years) used for trailing black pepper vines (Acacia auriculiformis, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Grevillea robusta, Macaranga peltata, Ailanthus triphysa and Casuarina equisetifolia). Results indicate that G. robusta showed the highest total biomass production (365.72 Mg ha−1), with A. triphysa having the least value (155.13 Mg ha−1). Biomass allocation among tissue types followed the order stemwood > roots > branchwood > twigs > leaves. Total C stocks were also highest for G. robusta (169 Mg C ha−1), followed by A. auriculiformis (155 Mg C ha−1). Mean annual carbon increment also followed a similar trend. Among the various tissue fractions, stemwood accounted for the highest N, P and K stocks, implying the potential for nutrient export from the site through wood harvest. All the support trees showed significantly higher soil carbon content compared to the treeless control. Soil N, P and K contents were higher under A. auriculiformis than other species. Nitrogen fixation potential, successional stage of the species, stand age and tree management practices such as lopping may modify the biomass allocation patterns and system productivity." .

In the human pathobiont Helicobacter pylori a plethora of trans- and cis-encoded sRNAs have been pinpointed by a global transcriptome study. However, only two have been studied in depth at the functional level. Here we report the characterization of CncR1, an abundant and conserved sRNA encoded by the virulence-associated cag pathogenicity island (cag-PAI) of H. pylori. Growth-phase dependent transcription of CncR1 is directed by the PcagP promoter, which resulted to be a target of the essential transcriptional regulator HsrA (HP1043). We demonstrate that the 213 nt transcript arising from this promoter ends at an intrinsic terminator, few bases upstream of the annotated cagP open reading frame, establishing CncR1 as the predominant gene product encoded by the cagP (cag15) locus. Interestingly, the deletion of the locus resulted in the deregulation en masse of σ54-dependent genes, linking CncR1 to flagellar functions. Accordingly, the enhanced motility recorded for cncR1 deletion mutants was complemented by ectopic reintroduction of the allele in trans. In silico prediction identified fliK, encoding a flagellar checkpoint protein, as likely regulatory target of CncR1. The interaction of CncR1 with the fliK mRNA was thus further investigated in vitro, demonstrating the formation of strand-specific interactions between the two RNA molecules. Accordingly, the full-length translational fusions of fliK with a lux reporter gene were induced in a cncR1 deletion mutant in vivo. These data suggest the involvement of CncR1 in the post-transcriptional modulation of H. pylori motility functions through down-regulation of a critical flagellar checkpoint factor. Concurrently, the cncR1 mutant revealed a decrease of transcript levels for several H. pylori adhesins, resulting in a phenotypically significant impairment of bacterial adhesion to a host gastric cell line. The data presented support a model in which the cag-PAI encoded CncR1 sRNA is able to oppositely modulate bacterial motility and adhesion to host cells." .

They are well-known as precursors for constitutive defence compounds such as cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates, but are also released as volatiles after insect feeding. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) of the CYP79 family catalyze the formation of aldoximes from the corresponding amino acids. However, the majority of CYP79s characterized so far are involved in cyanogenic glucoside or glucosinolate biosynthesis and only a few have been reported to be responsible for nitrogenous volatile production. ResultsIn this study we analysed and compared the jasmonic acid-induced volatile blends of two Erythroxylum species, the cultivated South American crop species E. coca and the African wild species E. fischeri. Both species produced different nitrogenous compounds including aliphatic aldoximes and an aromatic nitrile. Four isolated CYP79 genes (two from each species) were heterologously expressed in yeast and biochemically characterized. CYP79D62 from E. coca and CYP79D61 and CYP79D60 from E. fischeri showed broad substrate specificity in vitro and converted L-phenylalanine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-tryptophan, and L-tyrosine into the respective aldoximes. In contrast, recombinant CYP79D63 from E. coca exclusively accepted L-tryptophan as substrate. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that CYP79D60, CYP79D61, and CYP79D62 were significantly upregulated in jasmonic acid-treated Erythroxylum leaves. ConclusionsThe kinetic parameters of the enzymes expressed in vitro coupled with the expression patterns of the corresponding genes and the accumulation and emission of (E/Z)-phenylacetaldoxime, (E/Z)-indole-3-acetaldoxime, (E/Z)-3-methylbutyraldoxime, and (E/Z)-2-methylbutyraldoxime in jasmonic acid-treated leaves suggest that CYP79D60, CYP79D61, and CYP79D62 accept L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-tryptophan as substrates in vivo and contribute to the production of volatile and semi-volatile nitrogenous defence compounds in E. coca and E. fischeri." .

Applied to mouse conventional dendritic cell (cDC) progenitors, Mpath constructs multi-branching trajectories spanning from macrophage/DC progenitors through common DC progenitor to pre-dendritic cells (preDC). The Mpath-generated trajectories detect a branching event at the preDC stage revealing preDC subsets that are exclusively committed to cDC1 or cDC2 lineages. Reordering cells along cDC development reveals sequential waves of gene regulation and temporal coupling between cell cycle and cDC differentiation. Applied to human myoblasts, Mpath recapitulates the time course of myoblast differentiation and isolates a branch of non-muscle cells involved in the differentiation. Our study shows that Mpath is a useful tool for constructing cell lineages from single-cell data." .

The European turtle dove, Streptopelia turtur, is a warm-temperature adapted species and a long distance migrant that uses multiple flyways to move between Europe and Africa. Despite being abundant, it is categorized as vulnerable because of a long-term demographic decline. We studied the demographic history and population genetic structure of the European turtle dove using genomic data and mitochondrial DNA sequences from individuals sampled across Europe, and performing paleoclimatic niche modelling simulations. ResultsOverall our data suggest that this species is panmictic across Europe, and is not genetically structured across flyways. We found the genetic signatures of demographic fluctuations, inferring an effective population size (Ne) expansion that occurred between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, followed by a decrease in the Ne that started between the mid Holocene and the present. Our niche modelling analyses suggest that the variations in the Ne are coincident with recent changes in the availability of suitable habitat. ConclusionsWe argue that the European turtle dove is prone to undergo demographic fluctuations, a trait that makes it sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, especially when its numbers are decreasing. Also, considering the lack of genetic structure, we suggest all populations across Europe are equally relevant for conservation." .

Eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylases are 250 kDa single-chain, multi-domain enzymes and function as dimers and higher oligomers.

Here we show that yeast ACC is directly phosphorylated by the protein kinase SNF1 at residue Ser1157, which potently inhibits the enzyme. Crystal structure of three ACC central domains (AC3–AC5) shows that the phosphorylated Ser1157 is recognized by Arg1173, Arg1260, Tyr1113 and Ser1159. The R1173A/R1260A double mutant is insensitive to SNF1, confirming that this binding site is crucial for regulation. Electron microscopic studies reveal dramatic conformational changes in the holoenzyme upon phosphorylation, likely owing to the dissociation of the biotin carboxylase domain dimer. The observations support a unified molecular mechanism for the regulation of ACC by phosphorylation as well as by the natural product soraphen A, a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic ACC.

This growth increase was probably brought by cell proliferation, not by cell enlargement. AbstractRecent increase in carbon dioxide emissions is causing global climate change. The use of plant biomass as alternative energy source is one way to reduce these emissions. Therefore, reinforcement of plant biomass production is an urgent key issue to overcome both depletion of fossil energies and emission of carbon dioxide. Here, we created transgenic Arabidopsis with a 2-fold increase in above-ground growth by forced expression of the rice 45S rRNA gene using the maize ubiquitin promoter. Although the size of guard cells and ploidy of leaf-cells were similar between transgenic and control plants, numbers of stomata and pavement cells were much increased in the transgenic leaf. This data suggested that cell number, not cell expansion, was responsible for the growth increase, which might be brought by the forced expression of exogenous and full-length 45S rRNA gene. The expression level of rice 45S rRNA transcripts was very low, possibly triggering unknown machinery to enhance cell proliferation. Although microarray analysis showed enhanced expression of ethylene-responsive transcription factors, these factors might respond to ethylene induced by abiotic/biotic stresses or genomic incompatibility, which might be involved in the expression of species-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences within rice 45S rRNA transcripts.

Here we map the question of the number of different possible SUs a community can support to the geometric problem of finding maximal cliques of the corresponding graph. This enables us to solve for the number of SUs as a function of the species richness in the regional pool, N, showing that the growth of this number is subexponential in N, contrary to long-standing wisdom.

Such maps along with larger experimental populations are needed before we can obtain sufficient accuracy to make marker-trait association studies useful in practice. Here, we describe a method to create genetic linkage maps for an autotetraploid species with large numbers of markers and apply it to an F1 population of tetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) of 235 individuals genotyped using a 20K SNP array. SNP intensity values were converted to allele dosages after which we calculated pairwise maximum likelihood estimates of recombination frequencies between all marker segregation types under the assumption of random bivalent pairing. These estimates were used in the clustering of markers into linkage groups and their subsequent ordering into 96 homologue maps. The homologue maps were integrated per chromosome, resulting in a total map length of 1061 cM from 6910 markers covering all 12 potato chromosomes. We examined the questions of marker phasing and binning and propose optimal strategies for both. We also investigated the effect of quadrivalent formation and preferential pairing on recombination frequency estimation and marker phasing, which is of great relevance not only for potato but also for genetic studies in other tetraploid species for which the meiotic pairing behaviour is less well understood." .

We describe here the effects of four biochars (conifer and poplar wood, grape marc, wheat straw) at increasing application rates (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 % w/w) on both germination and root elongation of Cucumis sativus L., Lepidium sativum L. and Sorghum saccharatum Moench. The tested biochars varied in chemical properties, depending on the type and quality of the initial feedstock batch, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) being high in conifer and wheat straw, Cd in poplar and Cu in grape marc. We demonstrate that electrical conductivity and Cu negatively affected both germination and root elongation at ≥5 % rate biochar, together with Zn at ≥10 % and elevated pH at ≥20 %. In all species, germination was less sensitive than root elongation, strongly decreasing at very high rates of chars from grape marc (>10 %) and wheat straw (>50 %), whereas root length was already affected at 0.5 % of conifer and poplar in cucumber and sorghum, with marked impairment in all chars at >5 %. As a general interpretation, we propose here logarithmic model for robust root phytotoxicity in sorghum, based on biochar Zn content, which explains 66 % of variability over the whole dosage range tested. We conclude that metal contamination is a crucial quality parameter for biochar safety, and that root elongation represents a stable test for assessing phytotoxicity at recommended in-field amendment rates (<1–2 %)." .

The origin of these variations has been a central topic in evolutionary biology. Up to now, it was commonly accepted that standing genetic variation is the only cause of phenotypic variants. However, epigenetic information is emerging as a complementary source of heritable phenotypic variation that contributes to evolution. The relative importance of genetics and epigenetics in generating heritable phenotypic variation is nevertheless a matter of debate. ResultsWe used a host–parasite system to address this question. The human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni can adapt rapidly to new intermediate snail hosts. The interaction between parasite and mollusk is characterized by a compatibility polymorphism illustrating the evolutionary dynamics in this system. The principal molecular marker for compatibility (infection success) is the expression pattern of a group of polymorphic mucins (SmPoMuc) in the parasite. We show here that chromatin structure changes as the SmPoMuc promoters are the cause for SmPoMuc transcription polymorphism leading to phenotypic novelty and increase in infection success, i.e., fitness. ConclusionWe establish that epigenetic changes can be the major if not only cause of adaptive phenotypic variants in Schistosoma mansoni, suggesting that epimutations can provide material for adaptive evolution in the absence of genetic variation in other systems. In addition, our results indicate that epidrugs can be used to control parasite development but also parasite evolution." .

Due to its ubiquitous role in the energy metabolism, both the oxidation and reduction of the enzyme’s substrate co-enzyme Q has been studied vigorously. Here, this vast amount of data is reassessed after probing the substrate reduction steps at the Qi-site of the cyt bc1 complex of Rhodobacter capsulatus using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations suggest that the Lys251 side chain could rotate into the Qi-site to facilitate binding of half-protonated semiquinone – a reaction intermediate that is potentially formed during substrate reduction. At this bent pose, the Lys251 forms a salt bridge with the Asp252, thus making direct proton transfer possible. In the neutral state, the lysine side chain stays close to the conserved binding location of cardiolipin (CL). This back-and-forth motion between the CL and Asp252 indicates that Lys251 functions as a proton shuttle controlled by pH-dependent negative feedback. The CL/K/D switching, which represents a refinement to the previously described CL/K pathway, fine-tunes the proton transfer process. Lastly, the simulation data was used to formulate a mechanism for reducing the substrate at the Qi-site." .

Here, we demonstrate that HSV-1 infection increases NEAT1 expression and paraspeckle formation in a STAT3-dependent manner. NEAT1 and other paraspeckle protein components, P54nrb and PSPC1, can associate with HSV-1 genomic DNA. By binding with STAT3, PSPC1 is required for the recruitment of STAT3 to paraspeckles and facilitates the interaction between STAT3 and viral gene promoters, finally increasing viral gene expression and viral replication. Furthermore, thermosensitive gel containing NEAT1 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA effectively healed the skin lesions caused by HSV-1 infection in mice. Our results provide insight into the roles of lncRNAs in the epigenetic control of viral genes and into the function of paraspeckles." .

Uncertainty over the nature and extent of change creates challenges for how to manage ecosystems subject to altered structure and function under climate change. Using montane forests in south-eastern Australia as a case study, we addressed this issue by developing an ecosystem state-and-transition model based on a synthesis of expert knowledge and published data, with fire frequency and intensity as drivers. We then used four steps to determine future adaptation options: (1) estimation of changes in ecosystem services under each ecosystem state to identify adaptation services: the ecosystem processes and services that help people adapt to environmental change; (2) identification and sequencing of decision points to maintain each ecosystem state or allow transition to an alternative state; (3) analysis of interactions between societal values, scientific and management knowledge and institutional rules (vrk) required to reframe the decision context for future management, and (4) determining options for an adaptation pathway for management of montane forests under climate change. Our approach is transferable to other ecosystems for which alternative states can be predicted under climate change." .

Such advances open up a range of opportunities for research on non-model organisms and individuals drawn from wild populations. This has resulted in exciting new research seeking to identify the genetic polymorphisms important in adaptation and speciation and how they are organised within the genome. Building on this, there is great interest in the extent to which similar evolutionary patterns are found across multiple populations, particularly whether consistent genetic mechanisms are associated with recurrent phenotypes. A powerful context for disentangling these mechanisms is to focus on highly diverse radiations, where phenotypes vary in and across environments. Therefore, the high diversity found within and among species of salmonid fishes such as charr (Salvelinus) make for an ideal ‘non’-model for genomic research. This paper outlines some of the current approaches available in ecological genomics and highlights some recent advances in salmonid research. It also suggests avenues for the sort of predictions that can be derived from ecological genomics, with the aim of understanding the genetics behind the fantastic diversity of salmonid fishes." .

The results from the public opinions showed a significant increase in temperature compared to a decade earlier, winters are getting warmer, water springs are drying up, change in concept of spring-water recharge (locally known as Mul Phutnu), changes in spring season, low crop yields, incidences of mosquitoes during winter, and decrease in rainfall in last 10 years. In addition, study also showed significant positive correlations of increase in temperature with other climate change indicators viz. spring-water recharge concept (R 2 = 0.893), warmer winter (R 2 = 0.839), drying up of water springs (R 2 = 0.76), changes in spring season (R 2 = 0.68), low crop yields (R 2 = 0.68), decrease in rainfall (R 2 = 0.63), and incidences of mosquitoes in winter (R 2 = 0.50).

In terms of interaction networks, where traits are a major determinant, related species should therefore interact with other species which are also related. However, this prediction is challenged by current evidence that there is a weak, albeit significant, phylogenetic signal in species’ taxonomic niche, i.e., the identity of interacting species. We studied mutualistic and antagonistic plant–insect interaction networks in species-rich alpine meadows and show that there is instead a very strong phylogenetic signal in species’ functional niches—i.e., the mean functional traits of their interactors. This pattern emerges because related species tend to interact with species bearing certain traits that allow biotic interactions (pollination, herbivory) but not necessarily with species from all the same evolutionary lineages. Those traits define a set of potential interactors and show clear patterns of phylogenetic clustering on several portions of plants and insect phylogenies. Thus, this emerging pattern of low phylogenetic signal in taxonomic niches but high phylogenetic signal in functional niches may be driven by the interplay between functional trait convergence across plants’ and insects’ phylogenies and random sampling of the potential interactors." .

Single or combined applications of Cd and Zn resulted in significant reduction of total root length, root surface area, root volume, average root diameter and root activity.

Use of resistant cultivars is an effective strategy for managing FHB and reducing mycotoxin production in wheat. Understanding of the histochemical, physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in FHB resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars is limited so far. In this research, we investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants in basal resistance of wheat to the hemi-biotrophic and necrotrophic Fusarium species causing FHB. Gaskozhen and Falat plants were used as partially resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars against Fusarium spp., respectively. Accumulation of H2O2 and O2 − was higher in Gaskozhen compared to Falat cultivar. The obtained results revealed considerably higher levels of non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants after inoculation with Fusarium spp. in Gaskozhen compared to Falat cultivar at most of the time points investigated. No significant increase in the accumulation and activity of various antioxidants was observed in the uninoculated control plants in most cases during the time period tested. Significantly higher disease progress in the leaves of both cultivars treated with KCN, as an inhibitor of not only GPOX but also CuZnSOD and MnSOD, revealed the major role of these antioxidantive enzymes compared to FeSOD, APX and CAT in wheat defense responses to Fusarium species. Expression analysis of the genes responsible for production of enzymatic antioxidants using RT-PCR revealed a direct correlation between enzyme activities and expression of the corresponding genes. Application of ROS generating systems increased disease progress in both cultivars. Investigating wheat-Fusarium spp. interaction showed that F. culmorum isolate induced higher levels of ROS and antioxidants compared to F. graminearum.

While extensive literature about insect seasonality has revealed morphologic, metabolic and physiological changes in many species, only a few studies have explored the responses following exposure to the stressful dry season conditions in major malaria vectors. Here, we explored morphological changes triggered by exposure to dry season conditions in An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes by comparing females reared in climatic chambers reflecting environmental conditions found in mosquito habitats during the rainy and dry seasons in a savannah area of Burkina Faso (West Africa). ResultsUsing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal imaging, we revealed significant changes in morphological features of the spiracles in females An. gambiae s.l. exposed to contrasted environmental conditions. Hence, the hairs surrounding the spiracles were thicker in the three species when raised under dry season environmental conditions. The thicker hairs were in some cases totally obstructing spiracular openings. Specific staining provided evidence against contamination by external microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. However, only further analysis would unequivocally rule out the hypothesis of experimental artifact. ConclusionMorphological changes in spiracular features probably help to limit body water loss during desiccating conditions, therefore contributing to insect survival. Differences between species within the An. gambiae complex might therefore reflect different survival strategies used by these species to overcome the detrimental dry season conditions in the wild." .

This pathway is often disrupted in cancer, providing tumours with a mechanism to avoid cell death and promote growth and survival. The putative tumour suppressor, SASH1 (SAM and SH3 domain containing protein 1), has been previously implicated in the regulation of apoptosis; however, the molecular role of SASH1 in this process is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that SASH1 is cleaved by caspase-3 following UVC-induced apoptosis. Proteolysis of SASH1 enables the C-terminal fragment to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it associates with chromatin. The overexpression of wild-type SASH1 or a cleaved form of SASH1 representing amino acids 231–1247 leads to an increase in apoptosis. Conversely, mutation of the SASH1 cleavage site inhibits nuclear translocation and prevents the initiation of apoptosis. SASH1 cleavage is also required for the efficient translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the nucleus. The use of the NF-κB inhibitor DHMEQ demonstrated that the effect of SASH1 on apoptosis was dependent on NF-κB, indicating a codependence between SASH1 and NF-κB for this process." .

Animals possessing a visual system can sense particular wavelengths of light emanating from objects and their surroundings and perceive their environments by processing information contained in these visual perceptions of light. Visual perception in individuals varies with the absorption spectra of visual pigments and the expression levels of opsin genes, which may be altered according to the light environments. However, which light environments and the mechanism by which they change opsin expression profiles and whether these changes in opsin gene expression can affect light sensitivities are largely unknown. This study determined whether the light environment during growth induced plastic changes in opsin gene expression and behavioral sensitivity to particular wavelengths of light in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). ResultsIndividuals grown under orange light exhibited a higher expression of long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin genes and a higher sensitivity to 600-nm light than those grown under green light. In addition, we confirmed that variations in the expression levels of LWS opsin genes were related to the behavioral sensitivities to long wavelengths of light. ConclusionsThe light environment during the growth stage alters the expression levels of LWS opsin genes and behavioral sensitivities to long wavelengths of light in guppies. The plastically enhanced sensitivity to background light due to changes in opsin gene expression can enhance the detection and visibility of predators and foods, thereby affecting survival. Moreover, changes in sensitivities to orange light may lead to changes in the discrimination of orange/red colors of male guppies and might alter female preferences for male color patterns." .

We consider different specifications of impacts arising from the forest dieback tipping point, specifications such as changes in the system dynamics of the forests, changes in the forest mass, and impacts on economic output. We also consider endogenous and exogenous tipping point probabilities. For each specification we compute the optimal policies for forest management and emission control. Our results show qualitative differences in patterns of post-tipping event, optimal forest harvest, and either precautionary or aggressive pre-tipping event harvest patterns, a feature consistent with the findings of the existing literature. Optimal control of deforestation and carbon dioxide emission reduction also exhibits varied patterns of post- and pre-tipping levels depending on the nature of the tipping risk. Still, today’s optimal policy is one of more stringent emissions control in presence of a potential forest dieback tipping point." .

Results of pot experiments revealed that inoculation with the test isolate significantly increased the plant biomass by 10–42 % as compared to their respective uninoculated control. An ability of the isolate to alleviate the effect of salt stress was also evident by significant increase of chlorophyll content (33–41 %), reduction in toxic Na+ ionic content (19–41 %), increase in K+ uptake (23–31 %), thereby favoring the K+/Na+ ratio and a significant decrease in leaf proline and malondialdehyde content in bacteria-treated plants exposed to salt stress. These results indicated that the selected isolate SBP-6 can be used for promoting the plant growth under salinity stress." .

The magnitude of these effects appears likely to be related to invader abundance. In the Fuscospora beech forests of New Zealand, dispersal of the most abundant ant species, Prolasius advenus (Fr.Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), coincides with the peak abundance of the invasive predatory wasp Vespula vulgaris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae). Dispersing winged ant queens can comprise more than 25 % of the wasps’ diet. We hypothesised that the predation of wasps on queen ants could increase genetic drift on ant populations when wasps were at high density, which would erode genetic diversity and potentially fitness. We used six microsatellite markers to examine genetic diversity, population genetic structure and to test for evidence of a genetic bottleneck in P. advenus populations from seven sites with varying levels of wasp infestation. Populations of ants at high wasp densities showed evidence of a genetic bottleneck, which we suggest is the result of intense predation on dispersing queens by Vespula wasps. The seven sites examined were broadly divided into two distinct populations with some evidence of either limited admixture or derivation from a common ancestral population. Our results are consistent with a short term effect of high levels of predation by an invasive species with long-term implications for the recipient species." .

Those results suggested that thick filament mechano-sensing might constitute a novel regulatory mechanism in striated muscles that acts independently of the well-known thin filament-mediated calcium signalling pathway. Here we test that hypothesis using probes attached to the myosin regulatory light chain in demembranated muscle fibres. We show that both the extent and kinetics of thick filament activation depend on thick filament stress but are independent of intracellular calcium concentration in the physiological range. These results establish direct control of myosin motors by thick filament mechano-sensing as a general regulatory mechanism in skeletal muscle that is independent of the canonical calcium signalling pathway." .

Personality, however, defined as consistent individual differences in behaviour related to exploration, caution, and neophobia, is a good behavioural candidate character to study natural selection in relation to the urban habitat due to its heritable variation. The aim of this paper was to analyse variation in personality by comparing urban and forest great tits Parus major using standard tests of exploratory behaviour and boldness. We studied personality in 130 wild great tits captured in Barcelona city and nearby forests and found that urban birds were more explorative and bolder towards a novel object than forest birds. Genotype frequencies of the DRD4 SNP830 polymorphism, a gene region often associated with personality variation, varied significantly between forest and urban birds. Behavioural scores, however, were not correlated with this polymorphism in our population. Exploration scores correlated to boldness for forest birds but not for urban birds. Our findings suggest that the novel selection pressures of the urban environment favour the decoupling of behavioural traits that commonly form behavioural syndromes in the wild." .

Removal of diseased intestinal segments results in substantial catabolic stress and might require complex reconstructive surgery to maintain the functional continuity of the intestinal tract. As gastrointestinal surgery necessarily involves a breach of an epithelial barrier colonized by microorganisms, preoperative intestinal antisepsis is used to reduce infection-related complications. The current approach to intestinal antisepsis varies widely across institutions and countries with little understanding of its mechanism of action, effect on the gut microbiota and overall efficacy. Many of the current approaches to intestinal antisepsis before gastrointestinal surgery run counter to emerging concepts of intestinal microbiota contributing to immune function and recovery from injury. Here, we review evidence outlining the role of gut microbiota in recovery from gastrointestinal surgery, particularly in the development of infections and anastomotic leak. To make surgery safer and further reduce complications, a molecular, genetic and functional understanding of the response of the gastrointestinal tract to alterations in its microbiota is needed. Methods can then be developed to preserve the health-promoting functions of the microbiota while at the same time suppressing their harmful effects." .

The microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations were also measured at the end of experiment. Our results showed that the effect of modified attapulgite on DBP dissipation was related to its dosage in soil. The DEHP dissipation was both inhibited by MA at the 5 and 10 % rates in soils. The application of MA changed the content percentages but did not change the concentration order of phthalate acid esters (PAEs) in soil particle-size fractions. The total microbial PLFA content was significantly increased by 5 and 10 % MA in the contaminated soils. Meanwhile, the gram-negative (GN)/gram-positive (GP) ratios increased when MA was applied at the dosages of 5 and 10 % in DBP and 10 % in DEHP-contaminated soils. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the change of bacteria PLFA, especially the GN bacterial PLFA, depended on the dosages of MA added into soil.

Limited numbers of this subpopulation, however, hinder translation into autologous cell-based therapy. Here, we demonstrate rapid and efficient conditioning with hypoxia to enrich for these neural progenitor cells prior to further expansion in neurosphere culture. MethodAdherent cultures of BMSCs (rat/human) were subjected to 1 % oxygen for 24 h and then subcultured as neurospheres with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor supplementation. Neurospheres and cell progeny were monitored immunocytochemically for marker expression. To generate Schwann cell-like cells, neurospheres were plated out and exposed to gliogenic medium. The resulting cells were co-cultured with purified dorsal root ganglia (rat) neurons and then tested for commitment to the Schwann cell fate. Fate-committed Schwann cells were subjected to in vitro myelination assay. ResultsTransient hypoxic treatment increased the size and number of neurospheres generated from both rat and human BMSCs. This effect was EGF-dependent and attenuated with the EGF receptor inhibitor erlotinib. Hypoxia did not affect the capacity of neurospheres to generate neuron- or glia-like precursors. Human Schwann cell-like cells generated from hypoxia-treated BMSCs demonstrated expression of S100β /p75 and capacity for myelination in vitro.

One-leaf plants show an extremely reduced body plan: the adult above-ground photosynthetic tissue consisting of a single cotyledon, a macrocotyledon enlarged by the basal meristem (BM), but lacking a SAM. To investigate the origin and evolution of the BM and one-leaf plants, the meristem activity and KNOX1 SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) expression in cotyledons and leaves were systematically studied by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization across the family Gesneriaceae, Jovellana in Calceolariaceae (sister family to Gesneriaceae), and Antirrhinum in Plantaginaceae, all families of order Lamiales (asterids), in comparison to Arabidopsis (Brassicales, rosids). In all examined Lamiales samples, unlike Arabidopsis, BM activity accompanied by STM expression was found in both cotyledons in early stages. Foliage leaves of Gesneriaceae and Jovellana also showed the correlation of BM and STM expression. An extension of BM activity was found following a phylogenetic trajectory towards one-leaf plants where it is active throughout the lifetime of the macrocotyledon. Our results suggest that KNOX1 involvement in early cotyledon expansion originated early on in the diversification of Lamiales and is proposed as the prerequisite for the evolution of vegetative diversity in Gesneriaceae.

Its diverse cichlid assemblage offers a unique opportunity for studying a deep-water host-parasite model in freshwater. Low host specificity and a broad host range including representatives of the Bathybatini tribe in the only monogenean parasite described from this habitat, Cichlidogyrus casuarinus Pariselle, Muterezi Bukinga & Vanhove, 2015 suggest a link between lower specificity and lower host density. Conversely, high host specificity and species richness are reported for monogeneans of the lake’s littoral cichlids. We further investigated whether the deep-water environment in Lake Tanganyika is really monogenean species-depauperate by investigating the monogenean fauna of Trematocara unimaculatum (a representative of the tribe Trematocarini, the sister lineage of the Bathybatini) and Benthochromis horii, a member of the tribe Benthochromini, found in the same deep-water habitat as the already known hosts of C. casuarinus. MethodsSclerotised structures of the collected monogenean individuals were characterised morphologically using light microscopy and morphometrics. ResultsBoth examined cichlid species are infected by a single monogenean species each, which are new to science. They are described as Cichlidogyrus brunnensis n. sp., infecting T. unimaculatum, and Cichlidogyrus attenboroughi n. sp., parasitising on B. horii. Diagnostic characteristics include the distal bifurcation of the accessory piece in C. brunnensis n. sp. and the combination of long auricles and no heel in C. attenboroughi n. sp. In addition C. brunnensis n. sp. does not resemble C. casuarinus, the only species of Cichlidogyrus thus far reported from the Bathybatini. Also Cichlidogyrus attenboroughi n. sp. does not resemble any of the monogenean species documented from the pelagic zone of the lake and is among the few described species of Cichlidogyrus without heel. ConclusionsAs two new and non-resembling Cichlidogyrus species are described from T. unimaculatum and B. horii, colonisation of the deep-water habitat by more than one morphotype of Cichlidogyrus is evident. Based on morphological comparisons with previously described monogenean species, parasite transfers with the littoral zone are possible. Therefore, parasites of pelagic cichlids in the lake do not seem to only mirror host phylogeny and the evolutionary history of this host-parasite system merits further attention." .

Enriched rearing was designed to mimic the variability of the natural environment using river water, natural photoperiod, substrate, variable water current and depths. Traditional rearing was carried out with bare tanks, underground water, dark conditions, without current and at constant depth. Fish survival was determined monthly and growth was estimated weekly. Behavior was assessed with exploration and novel prey tests in solitary using video tracking. Results demonstrated that enriched condition resulted in bigger fish from the first month. Growth curve analysis revealed that enriched environment made both fish crossings grow in a similar manner. In contrast, crossings growth differed in traditional rearing which may reflect a genotype-environment interaction. Behavioral data highlighted that enriched-reared fish were slower to explore a new environment but more individuals engaged on doing so than traditional-reared fish. Results also showed that survival was high (>80 %) during all the trial. However, survival was lower during the second month in enriched environment. Our findings advocate for the integration of enriched rearing practices within the juvenile production for release in order to boost the performance linked to fitness. Stocking practices and life history research must work together to favor adaptive aquaculture approaches, which support species conservation." .

Here we report the identification of photosystem biogenesis regulator 1 (PBR1), a nuclear-encoded chloroplast RNA-binding protein that regulates the concerted biogenesis of NDH, PSI and Cytb6f complexes. We identified Ycf1, one of the two largest chloroplast genome-encoded open reading frames as the direct downstream target protein of PBR1. Biochemical and molecular analyses reveal that PBR1 regulates Ycf1 translation by directly binding to its mRNA. Surprisingly, we further demonstrate that relocation of the chloroplast gene Ycf1 fused with a plastid-transit sequence to the nucleus bypasses the requirement of PBR1 for Ycf1 translation, which sufficiently complements the defects in biogenesis of NDH, PSI and Cytb6f complexes in PBR1-deficient plants. Remarkably, the nuclear-encoded PBR1 tightly controls the expression of the chloroplast gene Ycf1 at the translational level, which is sufficient to sustain the coordinated biogenesis of NDH, PSI and Cytb6f complexes as a whole. Our findings provide deep insights into better understanding of how a predominant nuclear-encoded factor can act as a migratory mediator and undergoes selective translational regulation of the target plastid gene in controlling biogenesis of photosynthetic complexes.\n" .

(alfalfa) ‘Zhaodong’ is an important forage legume that can safely survive in northern China where winter temperatures reach as low as −30 °C. Survival of alfalfa following freezing stress depends on the amount and revival ability of crown buds. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of frost tolerance in alfalfa, we used transcriptome sequencing technology and bioinformatics strategies to analyze crown buds of field-grown alfalfa during winter. We statistically identified a total of 5605 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in freezing stress including 1900 upregulated and 3705 downregulated DEGs. We validated 36 candidate DEGs using qPCR to confirm the accuracy of the RNA-seq data. Unlike other recent studies, this study employed alfalfa plants grown in the natural environment. Our results indicate that not only the CBF orthologs but also membrane proteins, hormone signal transduction pathways, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways indicate the presence of a special freezing adaptation mechanism in alfalfa. The antioxidant defense system may rapidly confer freezing tolerance to alfalfa. Importantly, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and phenylalanine metabolism, which is of potential importance in coordinating freezing tolerance with growth and development, were downregulated in subzero temperatures. The adaptive mechanism for frost tolerance is a complex multigenic process that is not well understood. This systematic analysis provided an in-depth view of stress tolerance mechanisms in alfalfa." .

Through each cell cycle phase, the regulation of chromatin organization is essential for natural cell proliferation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. During mitosis, the chromatin morphology is dramatically changed to have a “thread-like” shape and the condensed chromosomes are segregated equally into two daughter cells. Disruption of the mitotic chromosome architecture physically impedes chromosomal behaviors, such as chromosome alignment and chromosome segregation; therefore, the proper mitotic chromosome structure is required to maintain chromosomal stability. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that mitotic chromosome condensation is induced by condensin complexes. Moreover, recent studies have shown that condensin also modulates interphase chromatin and regulates gene expression. This review mainly focuses on the molecular mechanisms that condensin uses to exert its functions during the cell cycle progression. Moreover, we discuss the condensin-mediated chromosomal organization in cancer cells." .

To simulate adaxial and abaxial surfaces alternant irradiation (ad-ab-alt irradiation), the adaxial or abaxial surface of leaves were exposed to light regimes that fluctuated between 100 and 1,000 μmol m−2 s−1. Compared with constant adaxial irradiation, simulated ad-ab-alt irradiation suppressed net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and transpiration (E) but not water use efficiency. These suppressions were aggravated by an increase in alternant frequency of the light intensity. When leaves were transferred from constant light to simulated ad-ab-alt irradiation, the maximum Pn and E during the high light period decreased, but the rate of photosynthetic induction during this period remained constant. The sensitivity of photosynthetic gas exchange to simulated ad-ab-alt irradiation was lower on abaxial surface than adaxial surface. Under simulated ad-ab-alt irradiation, higher Pn and E were measured on abaxial surface compared with adaxial surface.

We studied food selection and other ecological factors shaping the ranging behaviour of crested porcupines in a suburban area, where a high poaching pressure could be expected. We monitored radio-tagged adult, paired crested porcupines throughout 1 year. Over 70% of individually marked porcupines were poached. Despite the local absence of predators, but in presence of poaching pressure, porcupines avoided clear moonlight nights and daylight activity, establishing dens in thorny thickets. Deciduous woodlands and shrubwood were positively selected for feeding throughout the year, while farmlands and fallows were underused. Although the crested porcupine has been confirmed as a “generalist” species in terms of food selection, with adaptations to dig underground storage organs, a strong preference for fruits and epigeal parts of plants was detected in our study. Porcupines evolved in Asia and Africa with a number of competing grazing herbivores, as well as in presence of a heavy predation risk leading to development of quills. This might have confined them to exploit roots and rhizomes as food, as well as scrub habitats for protection.

AbstractIn hybrid rye breeding, application of genome-based prediction is expected to increase selection gain because of long selection cycles in population improvement and development of hybrid components. Essentially two prediction scenarios arise: (1) prediction of the genetic value of lines from the same breeding cycle in which model training is performed and (2) prediction of lines from subsequent cycles. It is the latter from which a reduction in cycle length and consequently the strongest impact on selection gain is expected. We empirically investigated genome-based prediction of grain yield, plant height and thousand kernel weight within and across four selection cycles of a hybrid rye breeding program. Prediction performance was assessed using genomic and pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP and PBLUP). A total of 1040 S2 lines were genotyped with 16 k SNPs and each year testcrosses of 260 S2 lines were phenotyped in seven or eight locations. The performance gap between GBLUP and PBLUP increased significantly for all traits when model calibration was performed on aggregated data from several cycles. Prediction accuracies obtained from cross-validation were in the order of 0.70 for all traits when data from all cycles (N CS = 832) were used for model training and exceeded within-cycle accuracies in all cases. As long as selection cycles are connected by a sufficient number of common ancestors and prediction accuracy has not reached a plateau when increasing sample size, aggregating data from several preceding cycles is recommended for predicting genetic values in subsequent cycles despite decreasing relatedness over time." .

A methodology is described in which a brief exposure of the animal to the mucolytic agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) solution triggers the dislodging of the ectodermis from its underlying basement membrane and mesoglea. These extracted fragments of cell sheets adherent to culture-dish substrates, initially form 2D monolayers that are transformed within 24 h post-isolation into 3D structures. These ectodermal tissues were sustained in vitro for several months, retaining their 3D structure while continuously releasing cells into the surrounding media. Cultures were then used for cell type characterizations and, additionally, the underlying organization of actin filaments in the 3D structures are demonstrated. Incorporation of BrdU and immunohistochemical labeling using p-histone H3 primary antibody were performed to compare mitotic activities of ectodermal cells originating from intact and from in vivo regenerating animals. Results revealed no change in mitotic activities at 2 h after bisection and a 1.67-, 1.71- and 3.74-fold increase over 24, 48 and 72 h of regeneration, respectively, depicting a significant correlation coefficient (p < 0.05; R 2 = 0.74). A significant difference was found only between the control and 3-day regenerations (p = 0.016). Cell proliferation was demonstrated in the 3D ectodermis after 6 culturing days. Moreover, monolayers that were subjected to Ca++/Mg++ free medium for the first 2 h after isolation and then replaced by standard medium, showed, at 6 days of culturing, profuse appearance of positive p-histone H3-labeled nuclei in the 3D tissues. Cytochalasin administered throughout the culturing period abolished all p-histone H3 labeling. This study thus depicts novel in vitro tissue culturing of ectodermal layers from a model marine invertebrate, demonstrating the ease with which experiments can be performed and cellular and molecular pathways can be revealed, thus opening studies on 2D tissue organizations and morphogenesis as well as the roles of cellular components in the formation of tissues in this organism." .

Two rHPLs were studied: HPL full-length and HPL with its chloroplast transit peptide deleted (matured HPL). Both olive rHPLs are relatively stable at 4 °C, and enzyme activity can be preserved (about 100% of the rHPL activities are maintained) during 5 weeks of storage at −20 or at −80 °C in the presence of glycerol (10%, v/v). Among the additives used in this study, glycine (2.5% w/v), NaCl (0.5 M), and Na2SO4 (0.25 M) provided the highest activation of HPL full-length activity, while the best matured HPL activity was obtained with Na2SO4 (0.25 M) and NaCl (1 M). Although the inactivation rate constants (k) showed that these additives inactivate both rHPLs, their use is still relevant as they strongly increase HPL activity. Results of C6-aldehyde production assays also showed that glycine, NaCl, and Na2SO4 are appropriate additives and that NaCl appears to be the best additive, at least for hexanal production." .

The wealth of structure-related information about glutamine synthetase across the species is endorsing it as emerging potential drug target. Owing to its well-characterized role in metabolism of Mycobacterium, various high throughput screening studies have been aimed at the identification of inhibitors against MtGS. The present work is focussed on comparative sequence and structural studies of glutamine synthetase and its evaluation as drug target against the infectious diseases. We have done molecular modeling studies of glutamine synthetase of Leishmania and Plasmodium. The structure models and molecular dynamics simulations studies shed light on to the binding modes of substrates viz. adenosine diphosphate, glutamate, ammonia, and metal ions. The comparative studies of MtGS, HsGS, LmGS, and PvGS helped in better understanding of prospects of structure-based inhibitor design. The results suggest that amino acid-binding site is highly conserved, whereas nucleotide-binding site possess subtle variations and thus offers opportunity for specific inhibitor design. Therefore, present study suggests that broad spectrum glutamine synthetase inhibition is feasible and it is potential drug target against infectious diseases." .

However, little is known about Black-necked Cranes’ habitat requirements or the causes of their population decline. We identified Black-necked Cranes’ winter roost and foraging preferences of Black-necked Cranes in Bhutan during the winter of 2013–2014. Black-necked Cranes’ roosts were recorded using Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, while foraging preferences and threats to the birds were identified based on a survey of household heads (n = 107) residing within a 3 km radius of roost sites. We grouped the threats identified by the communities into four major categories, viz. biological, social, political and natural threats based on the relevance. Of the four major threats, communities residing within the roosting and foraging habitat of the Black-necked Crane reported biological threat as major. Biological threats as reported by communities include loss of habitat, food shortage and competition from other animals. We recommend the present roosting areas be designated as part of the conservation areas for Black-necked Crane wintering in Bumthang district. In addition to preserving these areas, government should also encourage farming in foraging habitats of Black-necked Crane, because they mainly feed on barley, wheat, paddy, potatoes and buckwheat, besides roots, tubers and insects in the wetlands." .

Primary sleep is represented by the three major sleep-like immobility states: catalepsy, catatonia and cataplexy. The main behavioral, somatovegetative and neurophysiological characteristics of primary sleep and the ancient activation pattern during primary sleep are described. The issues of which of these sleep manifestations are homologous to SWS, PS, hibernation and stress response are discussed.

While some corals may increase autotrophy under ocean acidification, another potential mechanism to alleviate some of the adverse effects on their physiology is to increase heterotrophy. We compared the feeding rates of Galaxea fascicularis colonies that have lived their entire lives under ocean acidification conditions at natural carbon dioxide (CO2) seeps with colonies living under present-day CO2 conditions. When provided with the same quantity and composition of zooplankton as food, corals acclimatized to high CO2 showed 2.8 to 4.8 times depressed rates of zooplankton feeding. Results were consistent over four experiments, from two expeditions and both in field and chamber measurements. Unless replenished by other sources, reduced zooplankton uptake in G. fascicularis acclimatized to ocean acidification is likely to entail a shortage of vital nutrients, potentially jeopardizing their health and survival in future oceans." .

They were developed recently for plant genetics and breeding and have become especially useful. This mini-review contains an analysis of the information on the application of CAPS markers from the past 3–5 years. In the study presented, special attention was focused on CAPS markers linked with genes controlling important agricultural traits in different crops. The main principles of the development and analysis of CAPS markers as well as advantages and disadvantages of this type of molecular markers are briefly addressed in the beginning of this review. CAPS markers are based on PCR-amplifications of DNA fragments with specific primers, after the digestion of restriction enzymes and separation of the products in an agarose gel. Functional CAPS markers can be developed on the known sequence of a Gene of Interest for the analysis of its structure, function, expression and regulation. CAPS closely linked to the Gene of Interest are especially helpful for Marker-Assisted Selection, and they are widely used in the breeding of wheat, barley, soybean, potato, tomato and other crops for the tolerance to various pathogens. CAPS markers are often used for the preparation of genetic maps and fine mapping of studied genes. Molecular-genetic maps were prepared for some plants using CAPS. This method was also successfully used for the mapping of both individual genes and QTLs controlling such important traits as plant development, grain quality and tolerance to pathogens in cereals, as well as shape of tomato fruit. CAPS have important applications in the analyses of genetic polymorphism and phylogeny, especially in closely related species. Thus CAPS can be used as an effective tool for molecular-genetic study and plant breeding." .

Since potential seed longevity depends on initial quality, genebank curators need to be aware of the best management practices that contribute to the production of high quality seed during routine germplasm regeneration/multiplication. Among the factors influencing initial seed quality, those related to crop management, including plant nutrient and water supply during crop growth, climatic conditions during seed development and maturation, as well as the harvest and drying practices are of considerable significance. Seeds of high quality can be obtained by planting in suitable areas/fields and at appropriate times, applying good crop management practices, adoption of proper harvesting and drying techniques, careful handling and processing to minimize mechanical injuries and unwanted seed mixing with other accessions, and ensuring minimum deterioration before reaching the designated storage. However, seed production and post-harvest handling highly depend on the biology and agronomy of the species. As germplasm collections contain a wide range of diversity for morphological and agronomic characters and that there might well be critical gaps in knowledge among genebank staff or about the species in question, genebanks may also need to embark on research to gain crop specific knowledge on optimal seed production procedures to improve seed quality." .

We studied genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) after 5 days of HFO and after a control diet in 40 young men, of whom 16 had LBW. MethodsmRNA expression was analysed using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays and DNA methylation using Illumina 450K BeadChip arrays. ResultsWe found differential DNA methylation at 53 sites in SAT from LBW vs normal birthweight (NBW) men (false discovery rate <5%), including sites in the FADS2 and CPLX1 genes previously associated with type 2 diabetes. When we used reference-free cell mixture adjustments to potentially adjust for cell composition, 4,323 sites had differential methylation in LBW vs NBW men. However, no differences in SAT gene expression levels were identified between LBW and NBW men. In the combined group of all 40 participants, 3,276 genes (16.5%) were differentially expressed in SAT after HFO (false discovery rate <5%) and there was no difference between LBW men and controls. The most strongly upregulated genes were ELOVL6, FADS2 and NNAT; in contrast, INSR, IRS2 and the SLC27A2 fatty acid transporter showed decreased expression after HFO. Interestingly, SLC27A2 expression correlated negatively with diabetes- and obesity-related traits in a replication cohort of 142 individuals. DNA methylation at 652 CpG sites (including in CDK5, IGFBP5 and SLC2A4) was altered in SAT after overfeeding in this and in another cohort. Conclusions/interpretationYoung men who had a LBW exhibit epigenetic alterations in their adipose tissue that potentially influence insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes. Short-term overfeeding influences gene transcription and, to some extent, DNA methylation in adipose tissue; there was no major difference in this response between LBW and control participants." .

Seeds were collected from non-saline habitats in Egypt and saline habitats in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The seeds of the two populations were germinated in 0, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mM NaCl, and incubated at 25°C/15°C in both 12-h light and 12-h darkness regimes and continuous darkness. Significantly more seeds germinated in the Egyptian population than in the UAE population. Salinity tolerance was significantly greater with the Egyptian population than with the UAE population, especially under the conditions of higher salinities. The difference in salinity tolerance between the seeds of two populations was attributed to their seed mass. In addition, germination was significantly faster for the Egyptian population than for the UAE population. Most of the saline treated seeds were able to recover their germination when transferred to distilled water, but this depended on their maternal salinity and light incubation. Recovery from higher salinities was significantly better for the seeds under darkness than for those under light in the UAE population, but the reverse was true for the seeds in the Egyptian population. The higher salinity tolerance for the A. setifera seeds from the non-saline Egyptian population and the lower salinity tolerance for the seeds from the saline UAE population cannot explain their natural distribution. Further studies about other possible roles, such as levels of different promoting and inhibiting phytohormones, are needed to understand the importance of salinity as an environmentally induced maternal effect." .

A major focus of today’s research is still the identification of key proteins of both diseases and the development of corresponding inhibitors. In this study we combined the two-stage BALB/c-3T3 cell transformation assay (BALB-CTA) with the IR/IGF-1R inhibitor OSI-906 (linsitinib) and analyzed alterations in protein activity and energy parameters in non-transformed as well as transformed cells. OSI-906 successfully inhibited the phosphorylation of IR/IGF-1R and decreased cell growth in non-transformed cells. In the BALB-CTA, a permanent treatment with OSI-906 reduced cellular transformation dose-dependently, whereas a temporary treatment gave evidence for a preventive effect in the promotion phase. Furthermore, even though several key proteins were affected, it was possible to show that the phosphorylation of GSK3, Erk 1/2 and the S6 protein are not crucial for the cell foci reducing effect of OSI-906. Taken together, the BALB-CTA confirmed results of OSI-906 from animal studies and enhanced the knowledge of its mode of action.

Mass production of mosquitoes for large-scale releases demands a huge amount of water. Yet, many arid and/or seasonally arid countries face the difficulties of acute water shortage, deterioration of water quality and environmental constraints. The re-use of water to rear successive generations of larvae is attractive as a way to reduce water usage and running costs, and help to make this control method viable. MethodsTo determine whether dirty larval water was a suitable rearing medium for Anopheles arabiensis, in place of the ‘clean’ dechlorinated water routinely used, a series of three experiments was carried out to evaluate the effect of dirty water or mixed clean and dirty water on several parameters of insect quality. Batches of 100 fresh eggs were distributed in dirty water or added to clean water to test the effect of dirty water on egg hatching, whereas first-instar larvae were used to determine the effect on immature development time, pupation, adult emergence, body size, and longevity. Moreover, to assess the effect of dirty water on larval mortality, pupation rate, adult emergence, and longevity, L4 larvae collected after the tilting or larvae/pupae separation events were returned either to the dirty water or added to clean water. ResultsResults indicated that reusing dirty water or using a 50:50 mix of clean and dirty water did not affect egg hatching. Moreover, no difference was found in time to pupation, larval mortality or sex ratio when first-instar larvae were added to clean water, dirty water, or a 75:25, 50:50 or 25:75 mix of clean and dirty water and reared until emergence. When late-instar larvae were put back into their own rearing water, there was no effect on pupation rate, emergence rate or female longevity, though male longevity was reduced. When reared from first-instar larvae, however, dirty water decreased pupation rate, emergence rate, body size, and adult longevity. ConclusionsRe-used larval-rearing water has no impact on egg hatching, development time or mortality of the immature stages of An. arabiensis. However, dirty water is not suitable for the production of high quality adult mosquitoes. Recycling processes to improve water quality and increase insect quality will be investigated, since it may have important implications for the implementation of the SIT in areas where clean water is a scarce or costly resource." .

The clone libraries constructed by 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that most phylotypes retrieved from the Indian Ocean were highly divergent from those retrieved from other oceans. Vertical differences were observed based on the analysis of natural bacterial community populations derived from the 16S rRNA gene sequences.

The need for the specific identification and detection of microorganisms encourages the development of advanced, rapid, sensitive and highly specific methods for the monitoring of pathogens and management of potential risk to human health. The rapid molecular assays based on detection of specific molecular signatures offer advantages over conventional methods in terms of specificity and sensitivity but require complex instrumentation and skilled personnel. Nanotechnology is an emerging area and provides a robust approach for the identification of pathogenic microorganism utilizing the peculiar properties of nanomaterials, i.e. small size (1–100 nm) and large surface area. This emerging technology promises to fulfill the urgent need of a novel strategy to enhance the bacterial identification and quantitation in the environment. In this context, the peculiar properties of gold nanoparticles, their plasmonic shifts, and changes in magnetic properties have been utilized for the simple and cost-effective detection of bacterial nucleic acids, antigens and toxins with quite improved sensitivity. One of the promising leads to develop an advance detection method might be the coupling of nucleic acid aptamers (capable of interacting specifically with bacteria, protozoa, and viruses) with nanomaterials. Such aptamer-nano conjugate can be used for the specific recognition of infectious agents in different environmental matrices.

The research was based on a pot experiment established on sandy soil with pHKCl 7.0. The herbicide was applied to soil once, in the form of liquid emulsion dosed as follows: 0.67, 13.4, 26.9, 53.8, 108, 215, and 430 mg kg−1 of soil, converted per active substance (M + T + S). The control sample consisted of soil untreated with herbicide. The results showed that the mixture of the above active substances caused changes in values of the colony development (CD) indices of organotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi and ecophysiological diversity (EP) indices of fungi. Changes in the ecophysiological diversity index of organotrophic bacteria and actinomycetes were small. The M + T + S mixture was a strong inhibitor of dehydrogenases, to a less degree catalase, urease, β-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, while being a weak inhibitor of phosphatases. The actual impact was correlated with the dosage. The M + T + S mixture inhibited the growth and development of maize. The herbicide Lumax 537.5 SE should be applied strictly in line with the regime that defines its optimum dosage. Should its application adhere to the manufacturer’s instructions, the herbicide would not cause any serious disturbance in soil homeostasis. However, its excessive quantities (from 13.442 to 430.144 mg kg−1 DM of soil) proved to be harmful to the soil environment." .

However, their stoichiometry in relation to climatic variables and vegetation organization levels has not been comprehensively characterized. N and P concentrations were measured for 329 leaf samples collected at 132 sites along the 5000 km long China Grassland Transect that traverses the Inner Mongolian and Qinghai-Tibet Plateaus. The patterns of these measurements were analyzed with reference to climate factors, plant species, plant functional groups, grassland communities and grassland ecosystems. The aim was to explore whether geographical patterns of plant leaf elements are related to zonal climatic variables, and at which vegetation organization levels changes of plant leaf N and P stoichiometric characteristics and pattern occur. Results showed that interspecific differences of N and P concentrations were most significant for the three vegetation organization levels of species, community and ecosystem. Plant leaf N and P concentrations were higher, coefficients of variation of N and P lower, and N/P, C/N and C/P ratios were also lower for leaf samples from the cold high altitude Qinghai-Tibet Plateau than for those from the relatively lower altitude and warmer Inner Mongolian Plateau. Correlation of N and P for Inner Mongolian grassland was higher than that for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The study indicates plant species are the most basic unit influencing plant stoichiometric geographic patterns, and that climatic variables affect leaf element concentrations mainly through their effect on changes of plant species composition of vegetation." .

Males had higher rates of increase in leaf P content than hermaphrodites. This study suggests that stoichiometry patterns may be significantly affected by gender." .

Recently, we have reported a novel WRKY-related protein (GmWRP1) and a new clade of Exo70 proteins (GmExo70J) from soybean with homologs found only in legumes. GmWRP1 and some of the GmExo70J proteins are localized to Golgi apparatus through a novel N-terminal transmembrane domain. Here, we report further analysis of expression and functions of the novel GmWRP1 and GmExo70J genes. Promoter-GUS analysis in Arabidopsis revealed distinct tissue-specific expression patterns of the GmExo70J genes not only in vegetative but also in reproductive organs including mature tissues, where expression of previously characterized Exo70 genes is usually absent. Furthermore, expression of some GmExo70J genes including GmExo70J1, GmExo70J6 and GmExo70J7 increases greatly in floral organ-supporting receptacles during the development and maturation of siliques, indicating a possible role in seed development. More importantly, suppression of GmWRP1, GmExo70J7, GmExo70J8 and GmExo70J9 expression in soybean using virus- or artificial microRNA-mediated gene silencing resulted in accelerated leaf senescence and reduced nodule formation. These results strongly suggest that legume-specific GmWRP1 and GmExo70J proteins play important roles not only in legume symbiosis but also in other processes critical for legume growth and development." .

During the measurement period, warming increased annual soil temperature by 2.1 °C, and increased annual mean RH by 22.9%. Warming effect on soil temperature (WET) showed very similar pattern with warming effect on RH (WERH), decreasing yearly. Regression analyses suggest that WERH was controlled by WET and also regulated by the soil water content. These results showed that the decrease of WERH was not caused by acclimation to the warmer temperature, but was instead due to decrease of WET. We therefore suggest that global warming will accelerate soil carbon efflux to the atmosphere, regulated by the change in soil water content in subtropical forests." .

The Δ1-Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) gene family, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in proline biosynthesis pathway, usually contains two duplicated genes in most plants. However, three P5CS genes including LrP5CS1, LrP5CS2 as well as a third one, LrP5CS3, were isolated from Lilium regale. LrP5CS3 is highly identical to LrP5CS1 in amino acid sequences, indicating they could come from a paralogous duplication. The phylogenetic tree suggested that the duplication of LrP5CS occurred independently after the divergence of Liliales and commelinoids. The expression of LrP5CS1 was strongly induced in leaves and roots both under drought and salinity, while that of LrP5CS3 was upregulated more moderately. LrP5CS2 stayed almost constitutive under stress. LrP5CS1 exhibited the highest activity after expressed in E. coli. Overexpression of LrP5CS genes conferred enhanced osmotic, drought and salt tolerance on transgenic Arabidopsis without negative effects in unstressed condition. Under salt stress, lines LrP5CS2 accumulated fewer proline than others, and lines LrP5CS1 grew better in root elongation. The roots of lines LrP5CS3 grew better than all others under unstressed condition and osmotic stress. Our study suggests that the three LrP5CS genes play distinct roles respectively in proline accumulation and abiotic stress tolerance." .

Ten numbers of healthy seeds of C. pallida were sown in three pots of each concentration for germination, and after 15 days of germination, single healthy seedling in each pot was kept for the study. A control setup was also maintained without adding crude oil. The duration of the experiment was fixed for 6 months. The results showed that uptake of hydrocarbon by the plants was increased with increasing the concentration of crude oil in the soil up to 60,000 ppm. After that, uptake of hydrocarbon by the plants was found to be lower with increasing doses of crude oil concentration. Uptake of hydrocarbon by the shoot was found to be maximum, i.e., 35,018 ppm in 60,000 ppm concentration. Dissipation of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) from the soil was also gradually increased with increasing concentration of crude oil in the soil up to 60,000 ppm. Maximum dissipation, i.e., 78.66 %, occurred in 60,000 ppm concentration of crude oil-mixed soil. The plant could not survive in 100,000 ppm concentration of crude oil-mixed soil. The results also demonstrated that there was a reduction in plant shoot and root biomass with an increase of crude oil concentration. Furthermore, results revealed that the shoot biomass was higher than root biomass in all the treatments." .

The period between harvest and leaf-fall (the post-harvest period) is a key period for carbohydrate accumulation in relatively warmer grape-growing regions. The level of carbohydrate reserves available for utilisation in the following season has an important effect on canopy growth and yield potential and is therefore an important consideration in vineyard management. In a warming climate, the post-harvest period is lengthening and becoming warmer, evidenced through studies in wine regions worldwide that have correlated recent air temperature increases with changing grapevine phenology. Budbreak, flowering, veraison, and harvest have all been observed to be occurring earlier than in previous decades. Additionally, the final stage of the grapevine phenological cycle, leaf-fall, occurs later. This study explored the potential for increased post-harvest carbohydrate accumulation by modelling heat accumulation following harvest dates for the recent climate (1975–2004) and two warmer climate projections with mean temperature anomalies of +1.26 and +2.61 °C. Summaries of post-harvest heat accumulation between harvest and leaf-fall were produced for each of Australia’s Geographical Indications (wine regions) to provide comparisons from the base temperatures to projected warmer conditions across a range of climates. The results indicate that for warmer conditions, all regions observe earlier occurring budbreak and harvest as well as increasing post-harvest growing degree days accumulation before leaf-fall. The level of increase varies depending upon starting climatic condition, with cooler regions experiencing the greatest change." .

The objectives of this study were to (i) to evaluate the genetic diversity and to detect the patterns of LD, (ii) to estimate the levels of population structure and (iii) to identify a ‘core collection’ suitable for association genetic studies in sweet cherry. ResultsA total of 210 genotypes including modern cultivars and landraces from 16 countries were genotyped using the RosBREED cherry 6 K SNP array v1. Two groups, mainly bred cultivars and landraces, respectively, were first detected using STRUCTURE software and confirmed by Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). Further analyses identified nine subgroups using STRUCTURE and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC). Several sub-groups correspond to different eco-geographic regions of landraces distribution. Linkage disequilibrium was evaluated showing lower values than in peach, the reference Prunus species. A ‘core collection’ containing 156 accessions was selected using the maximum length sub tree method. ConclusionThe present study constitutes the first population genetics analysis in cultivated sweet cherry using a medium-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) marker array. We provided estimations of linkage disequilibrium, genetic structure and the definition of a first INRA’s Sweet Cherry core collection useful for breeding programs, germplasm management and association genetics studies." .

These viruses show rapid replication and strong cytopathic effects in mosquito C6/36 cells. Whole-genome analysis of these viruses demonstrated that both viruses belong to the negevirus group. One of the viruses, from Culex vishunui mosquitoes, is a new strain of Negev virus. The other virus, from a Mansonia sp. mosquito, is a new negevirus designated Bustos virus. Gene expression analysis of the Bustos virus revealed that infected cells contain viral subgenomic RNAs that probably include open reading frame (ORF) 2 or ORF3. Purified Bustos virus particles contained at least three proteins, and the major component (a probable major capsid protein) is encoded by ORF3. Bustos virus did not show infectivity in mammalian BHK-21 cells, suggesting that it is an insect-specific virus, like other known negeviruses." .

These shifts could alter productivity and interactions among species or genetic lineages, ultimately leading to changes in distributions and abundance. In particular, cosmopolitan species are predicted to increase growth with decreasing latitude due to differences in climate and temperature. The pattern of changes in growth may vary among genotypes within species, leading to different responses with latitude. To evaluate whether climate can affect geographically distinct genotypes of cosmopolitan invasive species differently, we evaluated the trait responses of two lineages of the common reed, Phragmites australis, to variation in environmental conditions spanning North America’s Atlantic coast. Using three reciprocal transplant common gardens, we tested for the effects of garden location and plant lineage on traits related to biomass production, flowering frequency, leaf morphology, and leaf-level physiology. We found that aboveground biomass, stem density, and flowering frequency responded non-linearly to increasing latitude in one or both lineages. These results suggest that measures of plant traits over narrow latitudinal ranges may not accurately reflect organismal-level responses to global change at broad spatial scales. Given the responses to latitude that we observed in P. australis, we propose that feedbacks between growth and reproductive rate will influence range shifts in these two lineages. Such range shifts could lead to genetic admixtures, subsequently yielding more productive, locally-adapted genotypes." .

Besides CK2, the compounds can inhibit, with similar activity, other classical eukaryotic protein kinases (e.g. PIM, DYRK, and PKD). The present results show that a majority of the most common CK2 inhibitors can affect the atypical kinase Rio1 in a nanomolar range. Kinetic data confirmed the mode of action of benzimidazoles as typical ATP-competitive inhibitors. In contrast to toyocamycin—the first discovered small-molecule inhibitor of Rio1—the most potent representative of benzimidazoles TIBI (IC50 = 0.09 µM, K i  = 0.05 µM) does not influence the oligomeric state of the Rio1 kinase.

Classical metacommunity models have recently explored how food web dynamics respond to patch loss, but the effects of patch fragmentation have largely been overlooked. Here we develop an extended patch-dynamic model that tracks the patch occupancy of the various trophic links subject to colonization-extinction-predation dynamics by incorporating species dispersal with patch connectivity. We found that, in a simple food chain, species at higher trophic level become extinct sooner with increasing patch loss and fragmentation due to the constraint in resource availability, confirming the trophic rank hypothesis. Yet, effects of fragmentation on species occupancy are largely determined by patch loss, with maximal fragmentation effects occurring at intermediate patch loss. Compared to the spatially explicit simulations that we also performed, the current model with pair approximation generates similar community patterns especially in spatially clustered landscapes. Overall, our extended framework can be applied to model more complex food webs in fragmented landscapes, broadening the scope of existing metacommunity theory." .

Testing the magnitude of such effects and the resilience of the impacted communities is difficult, however, because large-scale disturbances are generally unpredictable and thus available data are rare. Here, we studied the spatiotemporal variation of intertidal sandy-shore communities in relation to the Maule earthquake and tsunami that hit the south-eastern Pacific shore on the 27 February 2010. We analysed a dataset of four sampling times conducted over a period of 23 months, in which macrobenthic (>1 mm) species abundances were sampled before and consecutively three times after the Maule earthquake and tsunami took place. Our results indicated that the Maule earthquake and tsunami triggered abrupt and significant changes in species richness, total abundance, and community structure within the southern rupture area. Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami, sites within the southern rupture area of the earthquake showed significant changes in community structure, reaching up to 91 % dissimilarity with the pre-earthquake state. However, this high dissimilarity gradually decreased throughout time, indicating that the community subsequently tended to return toward its pre-event structure. Accordingly, a statistical model predicting a return toward the initial multivariate structure significantly fitted to our dataset. We suggest that the changes of intertidal sandy-shore communities are the result of the high abundance of species with high mobility and short generation times, producing populations that are highly dynamics. These traits may constitute therefore a negative feedback preventing the establishment of alternative community states after large-scale disturbances." .

However, a physical explanation for transitions between long-lasting global oscillations and localized short-term elevations (puffs) of cytoplasmic Ca2+ is still lacking. Here we introduce a phenomenological, coarse-grained model for the calcium variable, which is represented by ordinary differential equations. Due to its small number of parameters, and its simplicity, this model allows us to numerically study the interplay of multi-scale calcium concentrations with stochastic ion channel gating dynamics even in larger systems. We apply this model to a single cluster of inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor channels and find further evidence for the results presented in earlier work: a single cluster may be capable of producing different calcium release types, where long-lasting events are accompanied by unbinding of IP 3 from the receptor (Rückl et al., PLoS Comput. Biol. 11, e1003965 (2015)). Finally, we show the practicability of the model in a grid of 64 clusters which is computationally intractable with previous high-resolution models. Here long-lasting events can lead to synchronized oscillations and waves, while short events stay localized. The frequency of calcium releases as well as their coherence can thereby be regulated by the amplitude of IP 3 stimulation. Finally the model allows for a new explanation of oscillating [IP 3], which is not based on metabolic production and degradation of IP 3. Graphical abstract" .

In transgenic plants with increased SBPase activity, photosynthetic rates were increased and in parallel an increase in sucrose and starch accumulation was evident. Total biomass and leaf area were increased in SBPase sense plants, while they were reduced in SBPase antisense plants compared with equivalent wild-type tomato plants. Under chilling stress, when compared with plants with decreased SBPase activity, tomato plants with increased SBPase activity were found to be more chilling tolerant as indicated by reduced electrolyte leakage, increased photosynthetic capacity, and elevated RuBP regeneration rate and quantum efficiency of photosystem II. Collectively, our data suggest that higher level of SBPase activity gives an advantage to photosynthesis, growth and chilling tolerance in tomato plants.

We evaluated 15 allometric models using destructively sampled Pinus ponderosa (Lawson & C. Lawson) data from field windbreaks in Nebraska and Montana. Several goodness-of-fit metrics were used to select the optimal model. The Jenkins’ et al. model was then used to estimate biomass for 16 tree species in windbreaks projected over a 50 year time horizon in nine continental U.S. regions.

Normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultured with the spirochetes of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent. The analysis of the expression profiles of TLRs and TLR-related genes was performed using commercially available oligonucleotide microarrays of HG-U133A. The GeneSpring 12.0 platform and significance analysis of microarrays were used for the statistical analysis of microarray data. The analyses using the oligonucleotide microarray and QRT-PCR techniques permitted to identify the genes encoding TLR4 and TLR6 as specific for infection with B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. In turn, TLR3 was only characteristic for an infection with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. There were no changes in the TLR gene expression after infection with B. garinii. Our findings confirm that Borrelia has a major effect on fibroblast gene expression. Further characterization of changes in gene expression may lead to valuable insights into the role of the toll-like receptor in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and may provide guidelines for the development of diagnostic markers for an infection with a particular Borrelia genospecies.

The results showed that folic acid use was effective for eliciting rosmarinic acid (RA), salvianolic acid B (SAB), caffeic acid (CA), and total phenolics from S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots and that 50 μM is the most effective folic acid concentration for elicitation.

We challenged populations of Escherichia coli carrying the blaTEM-1 β-lactamase gene on either the chromosome or a multicopy plasmid (19 copies per cell) with increasing concentrations of ceftazidime. The plasmid accelerated resistance evolution by increasing the rate of appearance of novel TEM-1 mutations, thereby conferring resistance to ceftazidime, and then by amplifying the effect of TEM-1 mutations due to the increased gene dosage. Crucially, this dual effect was necessary and sufficient for the evolution of clinically relevant levels of resistance. Subsequent evolution occurred by mutations in a regulatory RNA that increased the plasmid copy number, resulting in marginal gains in ceftazidime resistance.

AbstractPerennial ryegrass and Italian ryegrass are the most important temperate forage species for global agriculture, and are represented in the commercial pasture seed market by numerous cultivars each composed of multiple highly heterozygous individuals. Previous studies have identified difficulties in the use of morphophysiological criteria to discriminate between these two closely related taxa. Recently, a highly multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genotyping assay has been developed that permits accurate differentiation between both species and cultivars of ryegrasses at the genetic level. This assay has since been further developed into an amplicon-based genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach implemented on a second-generation sequencing platform, allowing accelerated throughput and ca. sixfold reduction in cost. Using the GBS approach, 63 cultivars of perennial, Italian and interspecific hybrid ryegrasses, as well as intergeneric Festulolium hybrids, were genotyped. The genetic relationships between cultivars were interpreted in terms of known breeding histories and indistinct species boundaries within the Lolium genus, as well as suitability of current cultivar registration methodologies. An example of applicability to quality assurance and control (QA/QC) of seed purity is also described. Rapid, low-cost genotypic assays provide new opportunities for breeders to more fully explore genetic diversity within breeding programs, allowing the combination of novel unique genetic backgrounds. Such tools also offer the potential to more accurately define cultivar identities, allowing protection of varieties in the commercial market and supporting processes of cultivar accreditation and quality assurance." .

Much progress in xylan biosynthesis has been gained in the model plant species Arabidopsis. Two homologous pairs Irregular Xylem 9 (IRX9)/9L and IRX14/14L from glycosyltransferase (GT) family 43 have been proved to play crucial roles in xylan backbone biosynthesis. However, xylan biosynthesis in grass such as Miscanthus remains poorly understood. ResultsWe characterized seven GT43 members in M. lutarioriparius, a promising bioenergy crop. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the expression of MlGT43 genes was ubiquitously detected in the tissues examined. In-situ hybridization demonstrated that MlGT43A-B and MlGT43F-G were specifically expressed in sclerenchyma, while MlGT43C-E were expressed in both sclerenchyma and parenchyma. All seven MlGT43 proteins were localized to Golgi apparatus. Overexpression of MlGT43A-E but not MlGT43F and MlGT43G in Arabidopsis irx9 fully or partially rescued the mutant defects, including morphological changes, collapsed xylem and increased xylan contents, whereas overexpression of MlGT43F and MlGT43G but not MlGT43A-E complemented the defects of irx14, indicating that MlGT43A-E are functional orthologues of IRX9, while MlGT43F and MlGT43G are functional orthologues of IRX14. However, overexpression of all seven MlGT43 genes could not rescue the mucilage defects of irx14 seeds. Furthermore, transient transactivation analyses of MlGT43A-E reporters demonstrated that MlGT43A and MlGT43B but not MlGT43C-E were differentially activated by MlSND1, MlMYB46 or MlVND7. ConclusionThe results demonstrated that all seven MlGT43s are functionally conserved in xylan biosynthesis during secondary cell wall formation but diversify in seed coat mucilage xylan biosynthesis. The results obtained provide deeper insight into xylan biosynthesis in grass, which lay the foundation for genetic modification of grass cell wall components and structure to better suit for next-generation biofuel production." .

A potential link between dysregulation of RNA metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction is recently emerged in TDP-43 disease models. To further investigate the possible relationship between these two pathogenetic mechanisms in ALS/FTD, we studied mitochondria functionality in human mutant TARDBP(p.A382T) and C9ORF72 fibroblasts grown in galactose medium to induce a switch from a glycolytic to an oxidative metabolism. In this condition we observed significant changes in mitochondria morphology and ultrastructure in both mutant cells with a fragmented mitochondria network particularly evident in TARDBP(p.A382T) fibroblasts. From analysis of the mitochondrial functionality, a decrease of mitochondria membrane potential with no alterations in oxygen consumption rate emerged in TARDBP fibroblasts. Conversely, an increased oxygen consumption and mitochondria hyperpolarization were observed in C9ORF72 fibroblasts in association to increased ROS and ATP content. We found evidence of autophagy/mitophagy in dynamic equilibrium with the biogenesis of novel mitochondria, particularly in mutant C9ORF72 fibroblasts where an increase of mitochondrial DNA content and mass, and of PGC1-α protein was observed. Our imaging and biochemical data show that wild-type and mutant TDP-43 proteins do not localize at mitochondria so that the molecular mechanisms responsible for such mitochondria impairment remain to be further elucidated. For the first time our findings assess a link between C9ORF72 and mitochondria dysfunction and indicate that mitochondria functionality is affected in TARDBP and C9ORF72 fibroblasts with gene-specific features in oxidative conditions. As in neuronal metabolism mitochondria are actively used for ATP production, we speculate that TARDBP and C9ORF72 mutations might trigger cell death by impairing not only RNA metabolism, but also mitochondria activity in ALS/FTD neurons." .

Some other peptides belonging to this superfamily of defensive peptides are indistinguishable from “defensins,” but have been assigned other names, making it unclear what, if any, criteria must be met to qualify as an “invertebrate defensin.” In addition, there are other groups of defensins in invertebrates and vertebrates that are considered to be evolutionarily unrelated to those in the CS-αβ superfamily. This complicates analyses and discussions of this peptide group. This paper investigates the criteria for classifying a peptide as an invertebrate defensin, suggests a reference cysteine array that may be helpful in discussing peptides in this superfamily, and proposes that the superfamily (rather than the name “defensin”) is the appropriate context for studying the evolution of invertebrate defensins with the CS-αβ fold. MethodsCS-αβ superfamily sequences were identified from previous literature and BLAST searches of public databases. Sequences were retrieved from databases, and the relevant motifs were identified and used to create a conceptual alignment to a ten-cysteine reference array. Amino acid sequences were aligned in MEGA6 with manual adjustments to ensure accurate alignment of cysteines. Phylogenetic analyses were performed in MEGA6 (maximum likelihood) and MrBayes (Bayesian). ResultsAcross invertebrate taxa, the term “defensin” is not consistently applied based on number of cysteines, cysteine spacing pattern, spectrum of antimicrobial activity, or phylogenetic relationship. The analyses failed to reveal any criteria that unify “invertebrate defensins” and differentiate them from other defensive peptides in the CS-αβ superfamily. Sequences from various groups within the CS-αβ superfamily of defensive peptides can be described by a ten-cysteine reference array that aligns their defining structural motifs. ConclusionsThe proposed ten-cysteine reference array can be used in addition to current nomenclature to compare sequences in the CS-αβ superfamily and clarify their features relative to one another. This will facilitate analysis and discussion of “invertebrate defensins” in an appropriate evolutionary context, rather than relying on nomenclature." .

Can a high parasite load overload this immune response? If so, how is the melanisation response distributed among the individual parasites? MethodsWe considered these questions with the mosquito Anopheles gambiae by inoculating individuals simultaneously with one, two or three negatively charged Sephadex beads, and estimating the melanisation as the darkness of the bead (which ranges from about 0 for unmelanised beads to 100 for the most melanised beads of our experiment). ResultsAs the number of beads increased, the average degree to which beads were melanised decreased from 71 to 50. While the darkness of the least melanised bead in a mosquito decreased from an average of 71 to 35, the darkness of the most strongly melanised one did not change with the number of beads. ConclusionsAs the number of beads increased, the mosquito’s immune response became overloaded. The mosquito’s response was to prioritise the melanisation of one bead rather than distributing its response over all beads. Such immune overloading may be an important factor underlying the evolution of resistance against vector-borne diseases." .

Vitamin C exists predominantly as an ascorbate anion under physiological pH conditions. Ascorbate was discovered as a cofactor for methylcytosine dioxygenases that are responsible for DNA demethylation, and also as a likely cofactor for some JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases that catalyze histone demethylation. Variation in ascorbate bioavailability thus can influence the demethylation of both DNA and histone, further leading to different phenotypic presentations. Ascorbate deficiency can be presented systematically, spatially and temporally in different tissues at the different stages of development and aging. Here, we review how ascorbate deficiency could potentially be involved in embryonic and postnatal development, and plays a role in various diseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer through epigenetic dysregulation." .

To decrease the period of the start-up, the setup was initially inoculated with two types of activated sludge (nitrifying sludge from a KWTP aeration tank and sludge from a sequencing batch reactor enriched with anammox bacteria). The start-up and adjustment stage was therefore decreased to 35–40 days, and nitrogen removal efficiency reached 80% after 120 days of the setup operation. Taxonomic analysis of the composition of the microbial community was carried out by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA fragments obtained using the universal and planctomycetes-specific primers. In the course of adaptation of activated sludge to increasing nitrogen load, microbial community of the setup became less diverse and more specialized. The contribution of anammox bacteria of the family Brocadiaceae, closely related to Candidatus “Brocadia caroliniensis,” increased gradually. Members of the order Nitrosomonadales were involved in ammonium oxidation to nitrite. While nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Nitrospira were also detected, their share decreased with accumulation of the activated sludge. The contribution of other bacteria varied as well: the shares of the phyla Ignavibacteria, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria increased significantly (up to 13, 12, and 10%, respectively of the total number of reads), while relative abundance of the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Synergistetes, Aminicenantes, Thermotogae, and Cloacimonetes decreased.

After generating NSC from the NS, they induced into MNLC by treating them with Shh and RA, then with GDNF, CNTF, BDNF, and NT-3.

The induced ADSC adopted multipolar motor neuron morphology, and they expressed ISLET1, Olig2, and HB9.

A sexual stage has not been described, but several lines of evidence suggest the occurrence of sexual reproduction. Therefore, a comparative genomics approach was carried out to disclose the evolutionary relationship of the species and to identify genes demonstrating the potential for a sexual cycle. Furthermore, due to the evolutionary very young age of the five species currently known, this genus appears to be well-suited to address the question at the molecular level of how pathogenic fungi adapt to their hosts. ResultsThe genomes of the different Rhynchosporium species were sequenced, assembled and annotated using ab initio gene predictors trained on several fungal genomes as well as on Rhynchosporium expressed sequence tags. Structures of the rDNA regions and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms provided a hypothesis for intra-genus evolution. Homology screening detected core meiotic genes along with most genes crucial for sexual recombination in ascomycete fungi. In addition, a large number of cell wall-degrading enzymes that is characteristic for hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi infecting monocotyledonous hosts were found. Furthermore, the Rhynchosporium genomes carry a repertoire of genes coding for polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases. Several of these genes are missing from the genome of the closest sequenced relative, the poplar pathogen Marssonina brunnea, and are possibly involved in adaptation to the grass hosts. Most importantly, six species-specific genes coding for protein effectors were identified in R. commune. Their deletion yielded mutants that grew more vigorously in planta than the wild type. ConclusionBoth cryptic sexuality and secondary metabolites may have contributed to host adaptation. Most importantly, however, the growth-retarding activity of the species-specific effectors suggests that host adaptation of R. commune aims at extending the biotrophic stage at the expense of the necrotrophic stage of pathogenesis. Like other apoplastic fungi Rhynchosporium colonizes the intercellular matrix of host leaves relatively slowly without causing symptoms, reminiscent of the development of endophytic fungi. Rhynchosporium may therefore become an object for studying the mutualism-parasitism transition." .

In parasites with complex life cycles, speciation may be driven by adaptation to different intermediate hosts, yet diverging lineages can still share the same definitive host where reproduction takes place. In these cases, prezygotic isolation mechanisms should evolve very early and be particularly strong, preventing costly unfavourable matings.In this study, we investigated the importance of prezygotic barriers to reproduction in two cestode species that diverged 20–25mya and show an extraordinary degree of specificity to different intermediate hosts. Both species share the same definitive hosts and hybridize in the laboratory. Yet, natural hybrids have so far not been detected. MethodsWe used a combination of different experiments to investigate the role of prezygotic barriers to reproduction in the speciation of these parasites. First, we investigated whether hybridization is possible under natural conditions by exposing lab-reared herring gulls (Larus argentatus, the definitive hosts) to both parasites of either sympatric or allopatric combinations. In a second experiment, we tested whether the parasites prefer conspecifics over parasites from a different species in dichotomous mate choice trials. ResultsOur results show that the two species hybridize under natural conditions with parasites originating either from sympatric or allopatric populations producing hybrid offspring. Surprisingly, the mate choice experiment indicated that both parasite species prefer mates of the different species to conspecifics. ConclusionsNeither fundamental constraints against hybridization in a natural host nor assortative mate choice sufficiently explain the persistent segregation of the two tapeworm species in nature. Hence, postzygotic ecological selection against hybrids is presumably the more important driving force limiting gene flow between the two parasite sister species." .

Following samples of blood, liver and muscle were taken from the fish and were analyzed for stress and metabolic indicators. After an air exposure, plasma cortisol levels in fish fed with Trp and Phe diets were lower compared to the fish fed the control diet. Diets containing both amino acids increased significantly the liver transaminase activities in juvenile cod. During thermal stress, high Trp contents had significant effects on fructose biphosphatase activity though Phe did not. Overall, activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphofructokinase increased significantly for both amino acid diets. For the thermal stress, fish had the highest values of those activities for the 3Trp diet. Trp content in the diet had significant effects on the transaminase activity in muscle during air stress compared to fish fed control and Phe diets. Muscle alanine transaminase activity for thermal stress in fish fed any diet was not significantly different from the control.

Two thermal regimes (ambient and +4 °C) and three irrigation levels (partial, normal and excess) were used in environmental control chambers. The gas exchange parameters, light response curves and A/Ci curves were determined. The elevated temperature and partial irrigation reduced the net photosynthetic rate due to a limitation in the photosynthetic capacity instead of the intercellular CO2 concentration. Partial irrigation decreased Rubisco activation and limited RuBP regeneration. The reduction in Vcmax increased with increasing temperature. Excess irrigation offset the negative effect of drought and led to a partial recovery of the photosynthetic capacity. Although its light use efficiency was restricted, the use of light and dark respiration by Stipa baicalensis was unchanged. We concluded that nonstomatal limitation was the primary reason for photosynthesis regulation in Stipa baicalensis under relative long-term climate change conditions.

C4 leaves have less dense tissues, allowing more leaves to be produced for the same carbon cost. Consequently, C4 plants invest more in roots than C3 species.

Since these are underrepresented in plant proteins, the usage of plants as feed is limited. The heterologous production of the cyanobacterial storage polymer cyanophycin granule polypeptide (CGP) in plastids increases the amount of arginine substantially (Huhns et al. 2008; Huhns et al. 2009; Nausch et al. 2016a). CGP degradation releases arginine-aspartate dipeptides. CGP is stable in plants because its degradation is exclusively restricted to bacterial cyanophycinases (CGPases; Law et al. 2009). Since animals are also unable to digest CGP, CGPases need to be co-delivered with CGP-containing plant feed in order to release the dipeptides in the gastrointestinal tract of animals during digestion. Therefore, an extracellular CGPase, CphE from Pseudomonas alcaligenes DIP-1, was targeted to the cytosol, ER, and apoplasm of Nicotiana benthamiana. Translocation to the chloroplast was not successful. Although CphE accumulated in high amounts in the cytosol, only moderate levels were present in the ER, while the enzyme was nearly undetectable in the apoplasm. This correlates with the higher instability of post-translationally modified CphE in crude plant extracts. In addition, the production in the ER led to an increased number and size of necroses compared with cytosolic expression and might therefore interfere with the endogenous metabolism in the ER. Due to the high and robust enzyme activity, even moderate CphE concentrations were sufficient to degrade CGP in plant extracts." .

TIR-NB-LRR genes (TNL genes) constitute a major family of ETI R genes in dicots. The putative functions or roles of the TIR, NB and LRR domains of the proteins they encode (TNLs) are well documented, but TNLs also have a poorly characterised C-terminal region, the function of which is unknown in most cases. We characterised this prevalent stress-response protein family in a perennial plant, using the genome of peach (Prunus persica), the model Prunus species. The first TNL gene from this genus to be cloned, the Ma gene, confers complete-spectrum resistance to root-knot nematodes (RKNs) and encodes a protein with a huge C-terminal region with five duplicated post-LRR (PL) domains. This gene was the cornerstone of this study. ResultsWe investigated the role of this C-terminal region, by first describing the frequency, distribution and structural characteristics of i) TNL genes and ii) their PL domains in the peach genome, using the v1.0 Sanger sequence together with the v2.0 sequence, which has better genome annotation due to the incorporation of transcriptomic data. We detected 195 predicted TNL genes from the eight peach chromosomes: 85 % of these genes mapped to chromosomes 1, 2, 7 and 8. We reconstructed the putative structure of the predicted exons of all the TNL genes identified, and it was possible to retrieve the PL domains among two thirds of the TNL genes. We used our predicted TNL gene sequences to develop an annotation file for use with the Gbrowse tool in the v2.0 genome. The use of these annotation data made it possible to detect transcribed PL sequences in two Prunus species. We then used consensus sequences defined on the basis of 124 PL domains to design specific motifs, and we found that the use of these motifs significantly increased the numbers of PL domains and correlative TNL genes detected in diverse dicot genomes. Based on PL signatures, we showed that TNL genes with multiple PL domains were rare in peach and the other plants screened. The five-PL domain pattern is probably unique to Ma and its orthologues within Prunus and closely related genera from the Rosaceae and was probably inherited from the common ancestor of these plants in the subfamily Spiraeoideae. ConclusionsThe first physical TNL gene map for Prunus species can be used for the further investigation of R genes in this genus. The PL signature motifs are a complementary tool for the detection of TNL R genes in dicots. The low degree of similarity between PL domains and the neighbouring LRR exons and the specificity of PL signature motifs suggest that PL and LRR domains have different origins, with PL domains being specific to TNL genes, and possibly essential to the functioning of these genes in some cases. Investigations of the role of the oversized Ma PL region, in ligand binding or intramolecular interactions for example, may help to enrich our understanding of NB-LRR-mediated plant immunity to RKNs." .

The biodiversity of coral reef ecosystems depends on a functional symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the highly diverse genus Symbiodinium, which reside in coral host cells and continuously support their nutrition. The mechanisms underlying symbiont selection to establish a stable endosymbiosis in non-symbiotic juvenile corals are unclear. Here we show for the first time that symbiont selection patterns for larvae of two Acropora coral species and the model anemone Aiptasia are similar under controlled conditions. We find that Aiptasia larvae distinguish between compatible and incompatible symbionts during uptake into the gastric cavity and phagocytosis. Using RNA-Seq, we identify a set of candidate genes potentially involved in symbiosis establishment. Together, our data complement existing molecular resources to mechanistically dissect symbiont phagocytosis in cnidarians under controlled conditions, thereby strengthening the role of Aiptasia larvae as a powerful model for cnidarian endosymbiosis establishment." .

Agencies responsible for deregulating GMOs require that levels of the newly expressed protein(s) be characterized. Ideally, the quantitation methods used will be validated according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) that are accepted by these global regulatory agencies. Targeted protein quantitation may be performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with commercial kits or specially produced and validated antibodies. Proteins may also be quantitated by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Although some scientific guidance exists for validation of ELISA, the need remains for a harmonized set of protocols for protein quantitation in testing of GMOs, particularly for LC-MS/MS. We surveyed various industry experts to determine current practices for assay linearity, accuracy, and precision; assay specificity; detection limits; and methods to assess analyte stability for both ELISA and LC-MS/MS. We compared the survey results with assay criteria suggested in the literature and governmental guidance documents." .

Depending on tide and river inflows, particles originating from rivers or from the remobilization of sediments accumulate in the water column. Due to the salinity gradient and the high heterotrophic activity in the estuarine plume, hypoxic and anoxic microniches may form in oxygenated waters, sustaining favorable conditions for resuspended anaerobic microorganisms. In this context, we tested the hypothesis that anaerobic sulfate-reducing prokaryotes may occur in the water column of the Adour River. Using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and dsrAB-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) techniques, we characterized total prokaryotic and sulfate-reducing communities along a gradient from estuarine to marine bay waters. Sulfate-reducing prokaryotes were further characterized by the description of dsrB genes and the cultivation of sulfidogenic anaerobic microorganisms. As a result, physical-chemical parameters had a significant effect on water bacterial diversity and community structure along the studied gradient. The concentration of cultured sulfidogenic microorganisms ranged from 1 to 60 × 103 cells l−1 in the water column. Sulfate-reducing prokaryotes occurring in estuarine waters were closely related to microorganisms previously detected in freshwater sediments, suggesting an estuarine origin, mainly by the remobilization of the sediments. In the marine bay station, sediment-derived sulfate-reducing prokaryotes were not cultured anymore, probably due to freshwater dilution, increasing salinity and extended oxic stress. Nevertheless, isolates related to the type strain Desulfovibrio oceani were cultured from the diluted plume and deep marine waters, indicating the occurrence of autochthonous sulfate-reducing bacteria offshore." .

In this sense, acorns have been known as a foodstuff in written sources since antiquity, as well as from scientific analyses in archaeobotany and ethnobotany. We have tried to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire in the preparation of acorn cake, with experiments using materials similar to those potentially used in the western Pyrenees in the past. Furthermore, we have considered some ethnographic data which are available for this area. The results show that the treatment of pre-selected acorns by raw-roasting and leaching is feasible and we emphasise their nutritional value. The results of the experiments improved considerably with the use of pottery and optimal storage conditions. In addition, several by-products useful for other daily tasks were generated which may have been used as well in the past." .

SR3 with bread wheat cv. JN177 as the parent via asymmetric somatic hybridization, and found that the tolerance is partially attributed to the superior photosynthesis capacity. Here, we compared the proteomes of two cultivars to unravel the basis of superior photosynthesis capacity. In the maps of two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), there were 26 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 18 cultivar-based and 8 stress-responsive ones. 21 of 26 DEPs were identified and classified into four categories, including photosynthesis, photosynthesis system stability, linolenic acid metabolism, and protein synthesis in chloroplast. The chloroplast localization of some DEPs confirmed that the identified DEPs function in the chloroplast. The overexpression of a DEP enhanced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In line with these data, it is concluded that the contribution of chloroplast to high salinity tolerance of wheat cv. SR3 appears to include higher photosynthesis efficiency by promoting system protection and ROS clearance, stronger production of phytohormone JA by enhancing metabolism activity, and modulating the in chloroplast synthesis of proteins." .

This paper reports in vitro and in silico detection and characterization of irritans mariner-like elements (MLEs) in the genome and transcriptome of Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Eleven irritans MLE sequences have been isolated in vitro using terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) as primers, and 215 have been extracted in silico from the sequenced genome of B. oleae. Additionally, the sequenced genomes of Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) and Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) have been explored to identify irritans MLEs. A total of 129 sequences from B. tryoni have been extracted, while the genome of B. cucurbitae appears probably devoid of irritans MLEs. All detected irritans MLEs are defective due to several mutations and are clustered together in a monophyletic group suggesting a common ancestor. The evolutionary history and dynamics of these TEs are discussed in relation with the phylogenetic distribution of their hosts. The knowledge on the structure, distribution, dynamic, and evolution of irritans MLEs in Bactrocera species contributes to the understanding of both their evolutionary history and the invasion history of their hosts. This could also be the basis for genetic control strategies using transposable elements." .

The urban water body system with a total surface area of 400 hectares was designed and built so as to encircle the core island creating a complex morphometry. To ensure the water quality remains in its highest-level condition since its beginning, to perform its multi-functional uses, managing the lake catchment is of paramount importance. This paper describes the application of numerical simulation of Putrajaya Lake using coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem model to assess the spatial dynamics of the lake water quality. The hydrodynamic model simulates the flow pattern under different meteorological forcing variables. The ecosystem model simulates the resulting spatial and diurnal water quality pattern. Wind is the dominant forcing variable driving the flow field. The lake exhibits spatial variation of physico-chemical variables with an overall high-quality of surface water. The model simulation illustrates the impact of potential discharges on the lake water quality, such as spread of pollutants, subsequently provides a useful tool to enhance the management of the lake sustainably under changing environment." .

An analysis of the figures provided by the IPCC reveals they lead to different outcomes measured in CO2-eq., depending on whether or not biogenic CO2 emissions are considered neutral. In this article, we discuss this inconsistency and propose a correction. MethodsWe propose a simple framework to account for methane oxidation in GWP and GTP in a way that is independent on the accounting rules for biogenic carbon. An equation with three components is provided to calculate metric values, and its application is tested, together with the original IPCC figures, in a hypothetical example focusing on GWP100. Results and discussionThe hypothetical example shows that the only set of GWP100 values consistently leading to the same outcome, regardless of how we account for biogenic carbon, is the one proposed in this article. Using the methane GWP100 values from the IPCC report results in conflicting net GHG emissions, thus pointing to an inconsistency. ConclusionsIn order to consistently discriminate between biogenic and fossil methane sources, a difference of 2.75 kg CO2-eq. is needed, which corresponds to the ratio of the molecular weights of CO2 and methane (44/16). We propose to correct the GWP and GTP values for methane accordingly." .

In the case of sperm cells from males with the correct somatic karyotype but with deficient spermatogenesis, resulting in a high degree of sperm DNA fragmentation, we observed changes in the preferential topology of the chromosome 7, 9, 15, 18, X and Y centromeres. The changes occurred in radial localization and may have been directly linked to the sperm chromatin damage. This conclusion is mainly based on a comparison of FISH signals that were observed simultaneously in the TUNEL-positive and TUNEL-negative sperm cells. The analyzed cells originated from the same ejaculated sample and FISH was performed on the same slides, after in situ TUNEL reaction. Based on the observed changes and previous data, it appears that the sperm nucleus architecture can be disrupted by a variety of factors and has a negative influence on spermatogenesis at the same time. Often, these factors coexist (e.g. chromosomal translocations, aneuploidies, a higher DNA fragmentation, abnormal seminology), but no direct correlations between the factors were observed." .
