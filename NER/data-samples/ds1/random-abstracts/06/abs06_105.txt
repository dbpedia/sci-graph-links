Summary We calculate the long-distance contribution to $$K^ + \to \pi ^ + v\bar v$$ using chiral perturbation theory. The leading contribution comes from O(p4) tree terms. The branching ratio of the O(p4) long-distance contribution is found to be of order 10-3 smaller than the short-distance contribution.
