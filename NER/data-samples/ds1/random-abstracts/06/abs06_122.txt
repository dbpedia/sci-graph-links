Abstract Background and aimsArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) hyphae represent an important route for input of plant-derived C to soil, but impacts of these inputs on microbial communities and processes are poorly understood. In this study we characterised pathways of C-flow through microbial communities associated with AM hyphae and quantified impacts on mineralisation of native SOM. MethodsContinuous, steady-state 13CO2 labelling was applied throughout the growth period (60 d) of Lolium perenne. Exclusion meshes were used to control access of roots and AM hyphae to soil, and plant-derived C was quantified within microbial PLFA and NLFA, and soil CO2 efflux was partitioned into plant- and soil organic matter (SOM) derived components. ResultsPathways of C-flow through hyphosphere and mycorrhizosphere communities were distinct, as was the fate of plant-derived C from AM hyphae accessing soil through 37 and 1 μm meshes. Mineralisation of native SOM was increased in all treatments, relative to unplanted controls, and this priming effect was largest for AM hyphae accessing soil through the 1 μm mesh size. ConclusionsWe demonstrated that AM hyphae can strongly increase mineralisation of native SOM and identified distinct pathways of C-flow through hyphosphere communities. Our results suggest that, in addition to affecting rates of litter decomposition, AM hyphae may have a significant influence on turnover of native SOM.
