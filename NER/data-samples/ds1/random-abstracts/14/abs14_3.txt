Abstract The maximum selection principle allows to give expansions, in an adaptive way, of functions in the Hardy space $$\mathbf H_2$$ H2 of the disk in terms of Blaschke products. The expansion is specific to the given function. Blaschke factors and products have counterparts in the unit ball of $$\mathbb C^N$$ CN , and this fact allows us to extend in the present paper the maximum selection principle to the case of functions in the Druryâ€“Arveson space of functions analytic in the unit ball of $$\mathbb C^N$$ CN . This will give rise to an algorithm which is a variation in this higher dimensional case of the greedy algorithm. We also introduce infinite Blaschke products in this setting and study their convergence.
