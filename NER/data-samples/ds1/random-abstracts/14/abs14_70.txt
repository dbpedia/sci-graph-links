Abstract Economic theory relates prices to quantities via ” market curves.” Typically, such curves are monotone, hence they admit functional representations. The latter invoke linear pricing of quantities so as to obtain market values. Specifically, if higher prices call forward greater supply, a convex function, bounded below by market values, represents the resulting supply curve. Likewise, if demand decreases at higher prices, a concave function, bounded above by market values, represents the attending demand curve. In short, grantedmonotonicity, market curves are described by bivariate functions, either convex or concave, appropriately bounded by linear valuations of quantities. The bounding supply (demand) function generates ask (resp. bid)valuations. Exchange and trade, as modelled here, are driven by valuation differentials, called bid-ask spreads. These disappear, and market equilibrium prevails, if all ”inverse market curves” intersect in a common price. A main issue is whether and how market agents, by themselves, may reach such equilibrium. The paper provides positive and constructive answers. As vehicle it contends with bilateral transactions.
