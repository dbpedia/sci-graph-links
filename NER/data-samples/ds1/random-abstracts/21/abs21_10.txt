Abstract Let X be a stationary process with values in some $$\sigma $$ σ -finite measured state space $$(E,{\mathcal {E}},\pi )$$ (E,E,π) , indexed by $${{\mathbb {Z}}}$$ Z . Call $${{\mathcal {F}}}^X$$ FX its natural filtration. In Ceillier (Ann Probab 40(5):1980–2007, 2012), sufficient conditions were given for $${{\mathcal {F}}}^X$$ FX to be standard when E is finite, and the proof used a coupling of all probabilities on the finite set E. In this paper, we construct a coupling of all laws having a density with regard to $$\pi $$ π , which is much more involved. Then, we provide sufficient conditions for $${{\mathcal {F}}}^X$$ FX to be standard, generalizing those in Ceillier (Ann Probab 40(5):1980–2007, 2012).
