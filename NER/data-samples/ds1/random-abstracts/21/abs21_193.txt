Abstract A new medieval culture called the “Shay culture” has recently been described in Ethiopia: it is characterised by hypogean and megalithic funerary structures, collective burial practices and a highly distinctive material culture including funerary potteries. These characteristics indisputably define a “Pagan” culture, in a region and at a time (tenth to fourteenth century ad) where Pagans could only face the expansion of Christianity and the development of neighbouring Muslim polities. While documenting some aspects of this cultural entity on archaeological grounds, this article re-envisions the Ethiopian Pagans no longer as “pre-Christians” and/or “pre-Muslims” but as historical competitors with, and economic partners of, their neighbours.
