Abstract IntroductionIn 1894, Giuseppe Muscatello described what we believe to be the only case of an occipitocervical encephalocele with a communication to the stomach. This case and its history and context compared to the Chiari 3 malformation as described 3Â years earlier by Hans Chiari are presented. ConclusionsBased on the uniqueness of this case, we propose the term Chiari 3.5 malformation be used to describe its anatomical derailment.
