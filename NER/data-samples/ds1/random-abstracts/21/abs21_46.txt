Abstract The America urban setting presents a variety of problems in the execution of archaeological surveys and assessments, while it also provides a promising and unique set of resources. Using the MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) Project as an example, some of these problems and promises are discussed. Survey, testing, and mitigation procedures are described and evaluated. Also, consideration is given to the potential uses of the urban archaeological resource, with examples of hypothesis testing, pattern delineation, identification of formation processes, and public education.
