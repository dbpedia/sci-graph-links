Abstract We continue the study of the local structure of monoids in which $$\mathscr {J}$$ J -related idempotents are conjugate. For a regular $$\mathscr {J}$$ J -class J, its Graham blocks of idempotents are determined in terms of the associated parabolic subgroups, and then necessary and sufficient conditions are found for J to be generated by its idempotents. We further introduce a generalization to include the full transformation semigroup. The local monoids and the Graham blocks are again determined.
