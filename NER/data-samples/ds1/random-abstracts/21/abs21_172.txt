Abstract This article makes the case for considering “unevenness” as a central theoretical concept for anthropology. By closely examining three case studies, from Latin American and the US, we develop a fourfold approach to the study of unevenness: the histories of particular connections and disconnections; spatial/scalar differentiation; state formation; and the development of labor. This approach is located at the intersection of history, geography, and anthropology and, we contend, is particularly useful for exploring the political struggles that lie at the heart of capitalist development and that unfold over time and across space in divergent, irregular ways.
