Abstract This essay provides a personal and somewhat polemical assessment of recent developments in the historical archaeology of sites occupied by indigenous groups, and very tentatively predicts future trends. Three conceptual areas—holism, vantage point, and the social practice of archaeology—are identified as zones for future improvement. In terms of holism, greater empirical and analytical attention needs be paid to the full range of interacting parties, including both settler and indigenous interlocutors, in order to better understand processes of mutual influence. Vantage-point analysis can be used to better capture the details of historical settings through attempts to understand the spatial dimensions of power relations and, also, to further the deployment of local indigenous concepts in scholarship. In terms of the social practice of archaeology, trends in authorship and the lack of integration of “dirt” archaeology and decolonizing methods in archaeological writing remain problematic.
