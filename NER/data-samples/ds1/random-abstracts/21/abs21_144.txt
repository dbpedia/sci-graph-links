Abstract Like other rivers in European cities, Brussels’ Senne River was ‘buried’ and ‘covered’ in the second half of the 19th century (1866–1871). The main reason given by authorities for undertaking such huge urban works was the terrible water quality of the river. Filled with dirt and trash, the Senne was systematically associated with insalubrity, even danger. However, beyond the general opinion expressed at that time, it is hard to find any data that reflects the nature, extent, and origins of the pollution at the moment of covering, and in the years after. By addressing the question of water quality in the second half of the 19th century, this paper raises other issues related to the history of industrialisation and the silent transformation of environmental conditions. Reinterpreting an interdisciplinary study by hydro-biologists and historians on the pollution of the Senne, it also enhances the potential of such studies in renewing historical questions.
