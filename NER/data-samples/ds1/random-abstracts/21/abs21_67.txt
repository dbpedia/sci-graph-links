Abstract If S is a semigroup, the global (or the power semigroup) of S is the set $$\mathcal {P}(S)$$ P(S) of all nonempty subsets of S equipped with the naturally defined multiplication. A class $$\mathcal {K}$$ K of semigroups is globally determined if any two semigroups of $${\mathcal {K}}$$ K with isomorphic globals are themselves isomorphic. We study properties of globals of normal orthogroups and show, in particular, that the class of normal orthogroups is globally determined.
