Abstract Regarding drawing perspective, Spanish tradition has hidden singularities that greatly distinguish it from other European traditions. Spanish tradition, however, simultaneously nurtures ideas from these traditions, such as those of Italy and France, creating multiple variations and novelties. This study presents a brief journey through the lesser-known exempla, which are lesser studied in the scientific community. The study focuses on the ‘angular perspective’ by architect Hernán Ruiz the Younger (el Joven), the innovative construction of figures in perspective by the carpenter Antonio de Torreblanca and the singular contributions to the anonymous manuscript Artes Exçelençias dela Perspectiba. All three studies are similar in that they feature novel and heterodox premises within the general theory.
