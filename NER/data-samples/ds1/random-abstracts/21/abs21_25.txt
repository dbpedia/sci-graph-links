Abstract In the paper four stratifications in the reduction modulo p of a general Shimura variety are studied: the Newton stratification, the Kottwitz–Rapoport stratification, the Ekedahl–Oort stratification and the Ekedahl–Kottwitz–Oort–Rapoport stratification. We formulate a system of axioms and show that these imply non-emptiness statements and closure relation statements concerning these various stratifications. These axioms are satisfied in the Siegel case.
