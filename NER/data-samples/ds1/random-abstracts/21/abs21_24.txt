Abstract The goal of this paper is the study of a transformation concerning the general K-fold finite sums of the form $$\begin{aligned} \sum _{N\ge n_1\ge \cdots \ge n_K\ge 1}\frac{1}{b_{n_K}}\cdot \prod _{j=1}^{K-1}\frac{1}{a_{n_j}}, \end{aligned}$$ ∑N≥n1≥⋯≥nK≥11bnK·∏j=1K-11anj, where $$(K,N)\in \mathbb {N}^2$$ (K,N)∈N2 and $$\{a_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty }$$ {an}n=1∞ , $$\{b_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty }$$ {bn}n=1∞ are appropriate real sequences. In the application part of our paper we apply the developed transformation to two special parametric multiple zeta-type series that generalize the well-know formula $$\zeta ^\star (\{2\}_K,1)=2\zeta (2K+1)$$ ζ⋆({2}K,1)=2ζ(2K+1) , $$K\in \mathbb {N}$$ K∈N . As a corollary of our parametric results, we also prove several sum formulas involving multiple zeta-star values.
