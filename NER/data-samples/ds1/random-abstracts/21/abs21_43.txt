Background Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) may cause septicemia in immunocompromised hosts, but endophthalmitis due to this agent is quite rare. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of A. hydrophila endophthalmitis in Japan. We report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by Aeromonas hydrophila. CaseThe patient was a previously healthy 71-year-old man and no source of the endogenous endophthalmitis was found. A diagnostic/therapeutic vitrectomy was performed, but it was impossible to successfully treat this case because of extended retinal necrosis. A. hydrophila was isolated from the vitreous specimen. ConclusionEndophthalmitis due to A. hydrophila had a rapid clinical course and poor prognosis. Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi (J Jpn Ophthalmol Soc 107:535â€“537, 2003)
