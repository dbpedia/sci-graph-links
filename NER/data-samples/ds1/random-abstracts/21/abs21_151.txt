Abstract IntroductionOur knowledge and understanding of vertebral fusion, defined and eponymously known as Klippel–Feil syndrome in the early 1900s, have a long history. This uncommon finding has been identified as early as 500 B.C. in an Egyptian mummy. Many more examples of spinal vertebra fusion have been described by Greek historians and recovered by archeologists demonstrating this entity’s rich history. ConclusionsKlippel–Feil syndrome is a rare skeletal anomaly characterized by abnormal fusion of two or more vertebrae. With the advent of newer molecular technology and genetic discoveries, we now have a better understanding of the etiology and possible pathogenesis of this disease.
