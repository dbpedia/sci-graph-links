Abstract The original questions of archæology have been mostly answered. In the wake of this grand accomplishment, archæology developed a number of tools. These tools can now be used to investigate the very recent past. For this study, we need to draw upon the ideas of people usually not cited in archæology, including artists, documentary film makers, and urban designers. We have a chance to uncover the history of the inarticulate, and to contribute toward an understanding of man’s present relationship to the man-made world.
