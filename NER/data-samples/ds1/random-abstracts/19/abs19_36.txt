Abstract Within the music information retrieval community, many studies and applications have focused on tag-based music categorization. The limitation in employing music tags is the ambiguity of each tag. Thus, a single music tag covers too many sub-categories. To circumvent this, multiple tags can be used simultaneously to specify music clips more precisely. However, in conventional music recommendation systems, this might not be achieved because music clips identified by the system might not be prototypical to both or each tag. In this paper, we propose a new technique for ranking proper tag combinations based on the acoustic similarity of music clips. Based on empirical experiments, proper tag combinations are suggested by our proto-typicality analysis.
