Abstract The paper attempts to assess and analyze the economics of Brazilian contemporary theatre, focusing on financing and employment indicators. It was considered only the official data published by public institutions. The reason for it is as economic as cultural: although Brazilian theatre is at least 500Â years old and is inseparable part of Brazilian culture, it has never been a subject of an in-depth economic analysis.
