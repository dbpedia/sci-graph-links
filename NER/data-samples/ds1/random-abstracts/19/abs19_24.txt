The properties of composites for the photothermoplastic recording of holograms based on cooligomers with common naphthyl and different (fluorenylidene, anthracenyl) fragments were investigated. It was found that increase in the amount of halogen substituent Clin the cooligomer reduces the diffraction efficiency of the holograms. The possible practical application of such recording media was demonstrated.
