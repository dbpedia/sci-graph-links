AbstractIn this article, we study the dynamic response of a soap film under continuous electromagnetic forcing. The dynamics presented here describe the forcing of a monopole vortex during its generation at the center of the film. This response is quantified by the dimensionless Reynolds and Chandrasekhar numbers. When Chandrasekhar number reaches values near 800, Reynolds number reaches a damping rate. An analysis of the kinetic energy throughout the film shows that its response can be explained by Gibbs and Marangoni elasticity. Upon small forcing, the film shows an fast response after which it maintains its initial speed at all times (Marangoni). For a large forcing however, the speed of the film increases continuously throughout the experiment (Gibbs). Graphical Abstract
