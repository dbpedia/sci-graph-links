Abstract A polarization equation is derived for a thin-film electrode based on a silicon nanocomposite. The shallow thickness of the active layer (several micrometers) allows making some simplifying assumptions when deriving this equation and makes it possible to consider the case of weak polarization. For the polarization equation, a boundary problem is formulated, solutions are obtained, and system parameters for galvanostatic discharge are evaluated. It is shown that the parameters of the solutions meet the test conditions for experimental thin-film Si–O–Al samples and the condition of weak polarization.
