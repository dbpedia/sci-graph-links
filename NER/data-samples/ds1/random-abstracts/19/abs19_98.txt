Abstract Using Lacan as a heuristic model, this article investigates how the double, as the speciously diaphanous sign of the self, deceives its reader into believing that reciprocity if not identity can be established between signifier and signified.Jean Paul, wary of the lure of specular mastery, seeks to counteract it by articulating the bar separating these two parts of the Saussurian sign. The Vorschule as well as Titan demonstrate that for Jean Paul the impossibility of adequate representation becomes both the enabling condition and crux of writing.
