Abstract Of Note features notable books, articles, publications, films, and other media that may be useful for dance/movement therapists to reference to inform theory and practice. In this issue, Of Note includes ten publications, featuring topics such as principles and practices in trauma care, the body in adolescence, and somatic movement practices. A new, comprehensive text is also included which overviews the arts and health, featuring a chapter by art therapist, Amy Bucciarelli, distinguishing the creative arts therapies from arts and health practices.
