The work is devoted to investigation of noise in reconstructed holographic images in the form of a system of fringes parallel to the hologram frame boundaries. Mathematical and physical interpretation is proposed together with an algorithm for reduction of this effect by extrapolation of digital holograms using bicubic splines. The efficiency of the algorithm is estimated and examples of its application are presented.
