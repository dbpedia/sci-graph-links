Abstract The transformation properties of dynamic χ(2) holograms generating at the difference frequency are analyzed as applied to the position and scales of reconstructed images. Some regularities are established for the spatial localization and scales of images for different combinations of frequencies and positions of the reference and object point sources, involved in the formation of a holographic image. The formation of amplitude transparency images, reconstructed by dynamic χ(2) holograms with a decrease or conservation of the object beam frequency, and their transformations are experimentally demonstrated.
