Abstract The mechanism of transformation of developed naturally formed large waves into thermocapillary wave structures on a vertical downflow of heated water film is experimentally studied. It is shown that the combination of thermocapillary and inertial effects in a wavy liquid film leads to deformation of large waves and their decay into narrower waves.
