Abstract This paper investigates using a Cellular Automata (CA) as a generative design strategy that creates a design framework for a contemporary house. This is done in a way to reflect the unique spatial configuration of the Han-ok with Chae and Madang. When the Han-ok, the traditional Korean house, was modified to adapt to social change and urbanization in the modern era, the spatial diversity and order of the Han-ok with Chae and Madang were lost. This study aims to define the spatial configurations of the Han-ok, then uses CA to offer numerous possibilities that accommodate todayâ€™s life-style while keeping these core relationships. The significance of this study is in seeking the application of CA in a generative design process for modernization of the Han-ok.
