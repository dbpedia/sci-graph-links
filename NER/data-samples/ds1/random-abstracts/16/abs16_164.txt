Abstract With the processes of globalization, the local availability of knowledge and skills and the transfer of technology and innovation to the wider society have become increasingly important. Hoping to create better and stronger contributions by higher education institutions to the knowledge society, many governments nowadays develop policies of less state control and more autonomy. This contribution focuses on current higher education policies in Lithuania and in Mykolas Romeris University. The paper highlights the economic and social benefits of partnership with universities and public institutions, when this activity may allow a successful achievement of public policy objectives. It is also very important that the university gives attention to public service needs. This relationship with their external environment is one of the dimensions of universities’ mission that has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. The academic potential at the university, as specialists of social sciences, law and humanities, corresponding to the highest professional requirements, should be ready to fulfil the needs for society. The stakeholders can use the academic potential for organizing staff training. The cooperation is mutually beneficial: academic staff gain practical knowledge, deepen their experience and establish contacts outside the university. The experience of many institutions indicates that this dimension of service to society is an important part of universities activities. The university should strengthen its connections with the stakeholders, local community, regional business and industry. This paper discusses how higher education institutions can strengthen human capital development in public sector. Finally, a survey identifies the most significant areas for the customs auditors’ professional development.
