Abstract We present some new explicit range and kernel relations of $$P\pm Q$$ P±Q , as well as the range and kernel relations of $$ PQ\pm QP $$ PQ±QP for a pair of projections P and Q. The sufficient and necessary conditions among the various relations to be equal are analysed. Moreover, the stabilities of the range and kernel of linear combinations $$P-aQ$$ P-aQ , or $$aP+bQ-cPQ$$ aP+bQ-cPQ , or $$aP+bQ-cP^{m-1}Q$$ aP+bQ-cPm-1Q are investigated when P and Q are two m-potents.
