Abstract We investigate the Baire category of $${\mathcal{I}}$$ I -convergent subsequences and rearrangements of a divergent sequence s = (s n ) of reals if $${\mathcal{I}}$$ I is an ideal on $${\mathbb{N}}$$ N having the Baire property. We also discuss the measure of the set of $${\mathcal{I}}$$ I -convergent subsequences for some classes of ideals on $${\mathbb{N}}$$ N . Our results generalize theorems due to H. Miller and C. Orhan [16].
