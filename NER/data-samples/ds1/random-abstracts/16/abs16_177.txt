Abstract In this article, a systemic perspective compares emigration to a process of uprooting, because everyone is rooted in a particular social and cultural context. The act of emigration leaves behind an ecological gap or hole, requiring a process of re-defining, re-growth and re-distribution. This ecological analogy for the social world emphasizes that various systems are rooted in reciprocal relationships. I illustrate that emigration is never an isolated individual event, but rather a systemic phenomenon which affects several systems. This qualitative study explores the impact of emigration on South African emigrantsâ€™ family life and social networks. It clearly shows the systemic interconnectedness of the emigration process, providing a useful theoretical frame for those working in the field of emigration and family life. The results highlight the reciprocal, often conflicting, experiences of those who emigrate and of those who stay behind, underscoring the strong sense of ambivalence and loss that characterizes emigration. Ways in which family members attempt to re-negotiate relationships postemigration are also described, drawing attention to occasional ambivalence regarding the use of technology as a way of maintaining transnational relationships.
