Two practitioners address their participation in an online discussion concerning psychoanalysis and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One speaks from the perspective of a Palestinian-American and the other as a Jewish-Australian. They address several personal questions including why they joined the discussion, what was it like to be in it, how they came to work together, and who they are to each other as Palestinian and Jew. Larger questions are also posed: Where do psychoanalysis and politics meet? What is to be made of family trauma in public space? Where do loss and mourning come in? What can mutual recognition achieve applied to large, political contexts?
