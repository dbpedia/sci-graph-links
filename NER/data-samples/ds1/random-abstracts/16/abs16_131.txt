Abstract Let $$\mu $$ μ be the self-similar measure supported on the self-similar set K with the weak separation condition, which is weaker than the open set condition. This article uses Hausdorff dimension and packing dimension to investigate the multifractal structure of several sets of divergence points of $$\mu $$ μ in the iterated function system.
