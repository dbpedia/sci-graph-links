Abstract The paper examines the role of the Singapore state and Buddhist organisations and their welfare arm in the provision of eldercare services. It argues that the Singapore State plays a significant role in establishing a welfare framework and through its various policies; it encourages voluntary welfare organisations, including the religious welfare organisations to play an increased role in welfare provision. In face of new challenges to become socially relevant in the 21st century, the Buddhist organisations, in seeking new roles, have carved out a new niche in the provision of welfare services and Buddhist welfarism. Through collaboration between the state and the Buddhist voluntary welfare organisations, these Buddhist voluntary welfare organisations have embarked on an expanded welfare space and served as an important social capital for the public and the state to tapped into. In so doing, they have transformed themselves into key players in welfare provisions in a modern Singapore state.
