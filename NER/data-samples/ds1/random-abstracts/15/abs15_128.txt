Abstract We show that the union of n translates of a convex body in $$\mathbb {R}^3$$ R3 can have $$\varTheta (n^3)$$ Θ(n3) holes in the worst case, where a hole in a set X is a connected component of $$\mathbb {R}^3 \setminus X$$ R3\X . This refutes a 20-year-old conjecture. As a consequence, we also obtain improved lower bounds on the complexity of motion planning problems and of Voronoi diagrams with convex distance functions.
