Abstract This study examines the inner influencing mechanism and boundary conditions of the association between CEO relationship-focused leadership behaviors and organizational performance. Using data from top managers, HR directors, and operational level employees at 286 companies in seven provinces of China, this paper finds that CEO relationship-focused leadership behaviors have a positive effect on organizational performance. Specifically, CEO relationship-focused leadership behaviors relate directly and positively to firm performance in organically-structured firms and indirectly and positively to firm performance in mechanistically-structured firms via the chain-mediating role of employee relations climate and employeesâ€™ attitudes. The findings offer theoretical contributions to the leadership and employee relations climate literature and provide practical value to Chinese enterprises.
