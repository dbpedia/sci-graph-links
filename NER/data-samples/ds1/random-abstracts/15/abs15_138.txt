Abstract The goal of this study is to present a DEA-based fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model for firms in the health care industry in order to enhance their business performance. The study demonstrates a real-life use of the proposed model, mainly designed for hospitals. Data envelopment analysis enhanced with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process are collectively utilized to quantify the data and structure the model in decision-making. The juxtaposition of the two methods is used to compile a ranked list of multiple proxies containing diverse input and output variables which occur in two stages. This hybrid model provides several benefits, one of which is the ability to make the most appropriate decision considering the value of the weights determined by the data from the hybrid model.
