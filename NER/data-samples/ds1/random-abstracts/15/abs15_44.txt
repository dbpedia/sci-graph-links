Abstract Enterprise systems consist of numerous integrated applications including manufacturing, logistics, distribution, accounting, marketing, finance, human resources, and others. Enterprise system is intended to enable automation as it offers the availability of real-time data, improved process visibility, and an increased level of automation. In this paper, we propose to use cloud computing technologies to share computing resources and support advanced features such as on demand payments in human resource management (HRM) sub-system, and we focus on the applications in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The presented work consists of the following four parts. First, we discuss the cloud computing concept extensively in terms of the definitions, the classifications, and main characteristics, as well as its applications. Second, we perform the game analysis on the cloud computing of HRM in SMEs. Third, we propose new infrastructure of cloud computing to implement HRM in SMEs. Fourth, we illustrate the applications of the proposed infrastructure in HRM; in particular, we discuss some cloud-computing-based enterprise systems application systems including human resources management alliance, human resources management consulting services, and human resources shared services for process reengineering. Our innovation is the primary attempt of applying cloud computing technologies to elevate HRM sub-system in enterprise systems for SMEs.
