Abstract High performance HR (human resources) practices are well understood to positively impact employee behavior and performance. However, much is still not known about the implementation of effective HR practices and their specific impact on employee behaviors. In this regard, this study identifies the significance of HR practice consistency, develops direct measures of that consistency, and examines the impact on employee role performance. This study also explores how consistency affects shared perceptions of procedural justice and employeesâ€™ role performance by employing a cross-level research design. The data in the study were collected from 355 employees of 42 companies within the manufacturing and service industries in Taiwan. This study makes theoretical and methodological contributions by identifying the significance of HR practice consistency, and provides empirical evidences for its potential influences. It also offers practical suggestions that can be used as important reference points by organizations, particularly those in Asia seeking to implement high performance HR practices.
