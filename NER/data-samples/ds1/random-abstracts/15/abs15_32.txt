Abstract Considering the contribution of small and medium enterprises to the national economic development, employment opportunities generation and total manufacturing output, their role cannot be overemphasized. SMEs have more ability to innovate and flexibility as compared to large organizations irrespective of their size as well as organizational structure. Therefore, it is important to improve their competitiveness and performance. This may be done by the implementation of computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), because it plays a vital role in SMEs from all aspects of competitiveness both in terms of products and production techniques. An effort has been made in this paper to develop a model by considering four parameters such as top-management support and strategic alliance, business structure, structural attributes and integration of systems. Furthermore, multiple case studies have been conducted in British SMEs to explore the potential of CIM with the help of the proposed model. The result shows that there is lack of long-term strategic vision of the top management in HHW company. Whereas, a survey of SMEs have pointed out increase in reliability of delivery date, throughput/production volume, level of product customisation, reduction in manufacturing costs, WIP inventory and improvement in the image of the companies with the implementation of CIM.
