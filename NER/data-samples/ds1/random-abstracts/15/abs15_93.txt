This paper examines the returns accruing to the bank holding company (BHC) stockholders when an acquisition is initiated by the BHC. There is a significant, positive abnormal return to these shareholders when the acquisition is announced. The magnitude of this return does not depend on the relative size of the acquired firm. Further, the regulatory environment for these BHC acquisitions introduces uncertainty about the eventual outcome of the review process. Upon approval from the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the BHC stockholders earn an additional, significantly positive abnormal return.
