Abstract The approximation by diffusion and homogenization of the initial-boundary value problem of the Vlasov–Poisson–Fokker–Planck model is studied for a given velocity field with spatial macroscopic and microscopic variations. The L1-contraction property of the Fokker–Planck operator and a two-scale Hybrid-Hilbert expansion are used to prove the convergence towards a homogenized Drift–Diffusion equation and to exhibit a rate of convergence.
