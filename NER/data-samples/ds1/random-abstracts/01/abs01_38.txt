Abstract We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schrödinger equations of fractional order $$\left\{\begin{array}{l}i\partial _{t}u-2\left( -\partial _{x}^{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \, u=F\left( u\right) \\ u\left( 0,x\right) =u_{0} \left( x\right),\end{array}\right.$$ i∂tu-2-∂x214u=Fuu0,x=u0x, where $${F\left( u\right) }$$ Fu is the cubic nonlinearity $$F\left( u\right) =\lambda \left| u\right| ^{2}u$$ Fu=λu2u with $${\lambda \in \mathbf{R}}$$ λ∈R . We find the large time asymptotics of solutions to the Cauchy problem. We use the factorization technique similar to that developed for the Schrödinger equation.
