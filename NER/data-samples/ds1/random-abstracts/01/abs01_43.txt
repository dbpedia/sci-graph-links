Abstract In this paper we consider the differential inclusion problem in $${\mathbb{R}^N}$$ RN involving the $${p(x)}$$ p(x) -Laplacian of the type $$-\triangle_{p(x)} u+V(x)|u|^{p(x)-2}u\in \partial F(x,u)\,\,\,{\rm {in}} \, \mathbb{R}^N.$$ -▵p(x)u+V(x)|u|p(x)-2u∈∂F(x,u)inRN. Some new criteria to guarantee that the existence of infinitely many solutions for the considered problem is established by using the genus properties in nonsmooth critical point theory, which extend and complement previously known results in the literature.
