Abstract Oriented area functions are functions defined on the set of ordered triangles of an affine plane which are antisymmetric under odd permutations of the vertices and which behave additively when triangles are cut into two. We compare several elementary properties which such an area function may have (roughly speaking shear invariance, equality of area of the two triangles obtained by cutting a parallelogram along a diagonal, and equality of area of the two triangles obtained by cutting a triangle along a median). It turns out purely by arguments of elementary affine geometry (if cleverly arranged) that these properties are grosso modo equivalent, although one has to be careful about “pathological” situations. Furthermore, all oriented area functions satisfying these properties are explicitly determined. Finally they are compared with so-called geometric valuations.
