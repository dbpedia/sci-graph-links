Optimization models in airline revenue management (RM) systems have evolved from single flight leg to network revenue maximization to marginal revenue optimization for less restricted fare structures. This article reviews the most common optimization approaches that have been widely implemented in airline RM systems, with a focus on how the mismatch between model assumptions and reality can affect achievable revenue performance. Simulation findings from the Passenger Origin‚ÄêDestination Simulator are used to illustrate how robustness and revenue gains, as opposed to theoretical optimality, have driven the widespread adoption of practical optimization models in RM systems.
