Abstract New results are obtained for global regularity and long-time behavior of the solutions to the 2D Boussinesq equations for the flow of an incompressible fluid with positive viscosity and zero diffusivity in a smooth bounded domain. Our first result for global boundedness of the solution $${(u, \theta)}$$ (u,θ) in $${D(A)\times H^1}$$ D(A)×H1 improves considerably the main result of the recent article (Hu et al. in J Math Phys 54(8):081507, 2013). Our second result on global boundedness of the solution $${(u, \theta)}$$ (u,θ) in $${V\times H^1}$$ V×H1 for both bounded domain and the whole space $${\mathbb{R}^{2}}$$ R2 is a new one. It has been open and also seems much more challenging than the first result. Global regularity of the solution $${(u, \theta)}$$ (u,θ) in $${D(A)\times H^{2}}$$ D(A)×H2 is also proved.
