Abstract We determine all possible minors of the Desargues configuration, their embeddings in projective spaces, and their ambient automorphism groups (i.e., the group of all projective collineations that leave the embedded configuration invariant) in Pappian projective spaces. Examples show that the latter problem becomes hard if the extra condition (Pappian) is dropped.
