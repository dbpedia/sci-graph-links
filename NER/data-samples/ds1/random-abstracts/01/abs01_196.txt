Abstract This note concerns the nodal sets of eigenfunctions of semiclassical Schrödinger operators acting on compact, smooth, Riemannian manifolds, with no boundary. In the case of real analytic surfaces, we obtain sharp upper bounds for the number of intersections of the zero sets of Schrödinger eigenfunctions with a fixed curve that lies inside the classically forbidden region.
