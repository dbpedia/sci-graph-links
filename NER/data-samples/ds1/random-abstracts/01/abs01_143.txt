Abstract Let G/K be an orbit of the adjoint representation of a compact connected Lie group G, σ be an involutive automorphism of G and G˜ $$ \tilde{G} $$ be the Lie group of fixed points of σ. We find a sufficient condition for the complete integrability of the geodesic ow of the Riemannian metric on G˜/G˜∩K $$ \tilde{G}/\left(\tilde{G}\cap K\right) $$ which is induced by the bi-invariant Riemannian metric on G˜ $$ \tilde{G} $$. The integrals constructed here are real analytic functions, polynomial in momenta. It is checked that this sufficient condition holds when G is the unitary group U(n) and σ is its automorphism determined by the complex conjugation.
