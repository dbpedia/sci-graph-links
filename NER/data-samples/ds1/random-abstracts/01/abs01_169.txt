Abstract In this paper, we study Riemannian, anti-invariant and Lagrangian submersions from locally product Riemannian manifolds onto Riemannian manifolds. We first give a characterization theorem for Riemannian submersions. It is proved that the fibers of a Lagrangian submersion are always totally geodesic. We also consider the first variational formula of anti-invariant Riemannian submersions and give a new condition for the harmonicity of such submersions.
