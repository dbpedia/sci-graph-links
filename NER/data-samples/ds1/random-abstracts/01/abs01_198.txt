Abstract A graph G is 5/2-critical if G has no circular 5/2-coloring (or equivalently, homomorphism to C 5), but every proper subgraph of G has one. We prove that every 5/2-critical graph on n ≥ 4 vertices has at least $$\frac{{5n - 2}}{4}$$ 5n−24 edges, and list all 5/2-critical graphs achieving this bound. This implies that every planar or projective-planar graph of girth at least 10 is 5/2-colorable.
