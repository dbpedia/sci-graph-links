Abstract We use the isotropic projection of Laguerre geometry in order to establish a correspondence between plane curves and null curves in the Minkowski 3-space. We describe the geometry of null curves (Cartan frame, pseudo-arc parameter, pseudo-torsion, pairs of associated curves) in terms of the curvature of the corresponding plane curves. This leads to an alternative description of all plane curves which are Laguerre congruent to a given one.
