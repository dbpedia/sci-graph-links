Abstract This paper presents an application of the spectral element method for the stability analysis of regenerative machine tool chatter models in milling operations. An extension of the spectral element method is introduced in order to handle the discontinuities in the cutting force in an efficient way. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on some well-known machine tool chatter models taken from the literature. Efficiency is characterized by the computational time, the convergence of the stability boundaries, and the convergence of critical characteristic multipliers. Results show that compared to the most widespread methods in machining literature, the spectral element method provides significant improvements in computational time while maintaining high accuracy levels.
