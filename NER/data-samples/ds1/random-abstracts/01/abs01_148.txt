Abstract In this manuscript, we consider a nonlinear system governed by fractional differential equations in a Banach space. Used the semigroup theory of linear operators and Gronwalâ€™s inequality to show the trajectory controllability of the system. Also, we extend our results to nonlocal and integro-differential equations. Finally, we give an example to illustrate the applications of these results.
