Abstract In this paper, we obtain an explicit formula for the two-point correlation function for the solutions to the stochastic heat equation on ‚Ñù $\mathbb {R}$. The bounds for p-th moments proved in Chen and Dalang (Ann. Probab. 2015) are simplified. We validate the Feynman-Kac formula for the p-point correlation function of the solutions to this equation with measure-valued initial data.
