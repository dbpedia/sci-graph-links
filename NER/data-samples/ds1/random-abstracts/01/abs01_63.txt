Abstract This paper is concerned with the problem of admissibility analysis of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy singular systems with time-varying delay. The time-delay is assumed to be available online and interval-like type. Based on delay partitioning technique and the free-weighting-matrix approach combined with the constructed Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a sufficient condition is obtained such that the system is regular, impulse free, and asymptotically stable. All obtained conditions are dependent on time-delay and partitioning number. These conditions are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theories.
