Abstract This note provides a C *-algebraic framework for supersymmetry. Particularly, we consider fermion lattice models satisfying the simplest supersymmetry relation. Namely, we discuss a restricted sense of supersymmetry without a boson field involved. We construct general supersymmetric C *-dynamics in terms of a superderivation and a one-parameter group of automorphisms on the CAR algebra. (We do not introduce Grassmann numbers into our formalism.) We show several basic properties of superderivations on the fermion lattice system. Among others, we establish that superderivations defined on the strictly local algebra are norm-closable. We show a criterion of superderivations on the fermion lattice system for being nilpotent. This criterion can be easily checked and hence yields new supersymmetric fermion lattice models.
