Abstract This paper considers the reliable control design for T-S fuzzy systems with probabilistic actuators faults and random time-varying delays. The faults of each actuator occurs randomly and its failure rates are governed by a set of unrelated random variables satisfying certain probabilistic distribution. In terms of the probabilistic failures of each actuator and time-varying random delays, new fault model is proposed. Based on the new fuzzy model, reliable controller is designed and sufficient conditions for the exponentially mean square stability (EMSS) of T-S fuzzy systems are derived by using Lyapunov functional method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. It should be noted that the obtained criteria depend on not only the size of the delay, but also the probability distribution of it. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
