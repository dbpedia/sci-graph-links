Optimisation of sand casting process involves the adjustment of parameters as well as the improvement of optimisation process procedures and measures. Analysis of various critical process parameters and the interaction among them is carried out with the help of Taguchis method of experimental design, response surface methodology (RSM). This paper proposes a Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) method based on the process window approach (PWA) is to make the analysis more precise, cost effective and evaluating the robustness of a process set up quickly. The successful sand casting process parameters optimisation demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method. The objective of this article is to provide foundry personnel with innovative design ideas under research and for practical application.
