Abstract This paper concerns matrix “convex” functions of (free) noncommuting variables, $${x = (x_1, \ldots, x_g)}$$ x=(x1,…,xg) . It was shown in Helton and McCullough (SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 25(4):1124–1139, 2004) that a polynomial in $${x}$$ x which is matrix convex is of degree two or less. We prove a more general result: that a function of $${x}$$ x that is matrix convex near $${0}$$ 0 and also that is “analytic” in some neighborhood of the set of all self-adjoint matrix tuples is in fact a polynomial of degree two or less. More generally, we prove that a function $${F}$$ F in two classes of noncommuting variables, $${a = (a_1, \ldots, a_{\tilde{g}})}$$ a=(a1,…,ag~) and $${x = (x_1, \ldots, x_g)}$$ x=(x1,…,xg) that is both“analytic” and matrix convex in $${x}$$ x on a “noncommutative open set” in $${a}$$ a is a polynomial of degree two or less.
