This work is devoted to modeling of operation of low-capacity (0.5 W at 77 K) Stirling microcryogenic gas cooler (MCGC). A mathematical model of the cooler, a system of equations, and methods of solution of the equations system are given. The results of computational study of the operating conditions of the cooler are furnished. The design modifications for realizing heat removal from the MCGC compressor chamber cover are analyzed and calculated.
