Abstract We consider the motion of a viscous incompressible liquid crystal flow in the N-dimensional whole space. We prove the global well-posedness of strong solutions for small initial data by combining the maximal $${L_p-L_q}$$ Lp-Lq regularities and $${L_p-L_q}$$ Lp-Lq decay properties of solutions for the Stokes equations and heat equations. As a result, we also proved the decay properties of the solutions to the nonlinear equations.
