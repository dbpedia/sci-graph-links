Abstract We propose a continuous interior penalty finite element method designed for a third-order singularly perturbed problem. Using higher order polynomials on Shishkin-type layer-adapted meshes, a robust convergence has been proved in the corresponding energy norm. Moreover, we show numerical experiments which support our theoretical findings.
