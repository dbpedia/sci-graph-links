Abstract The immaculate basis of the non-commutative symmetric functions was recently introduced by the first and third authors to lift certain structures in the symmetric functions to the dual Hopf algebras of the non-commutative and quasi-symmetric functions. It was shown that immaculate basis satisfies a positive, multiplicity free right Pieri rule. It was conjectured that the left Pieri rule may contain signs but that it would be multiplicity free. Similarly, it was also conjectured that the dual quasi-symmetric basis would also satisfy a signed multiplicity free Pieri rule. We prove these two conjectures here.
