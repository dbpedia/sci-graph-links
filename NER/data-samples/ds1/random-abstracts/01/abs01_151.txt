Abstract In this paper, we study the low Mach number limit of the compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic equations. It is justified rigorously that, for the well-prepared initial data, the classical solutions of the compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic equations converge to that of the incompressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic equations as the Mach number tends to zero.
