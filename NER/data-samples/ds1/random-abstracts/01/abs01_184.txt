Abstract This paper is concerned with the following time-harmonic semilinear Maxwell equation: $$\left\{\begin{array}{l@{\quad }l}\nabla\times (\nabla\times u)+\lambda u=f(x,u), &\mbox{in}\ \Omega\\ \nu \times u=0, &\mbox{on} \ \partial\Omega,\end{array}\right.$$ ∇×(∇×u)+λu=f(x,u),inΩν×u=0,on∂Ω, where $${\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{3}}$$ Ω⊂R3 is a bounded, convex domain and $${\nu : \partial \Omega\to \mathbb{R}^{3}}$$ ν:∂Ω→R3 is the exterior normal. Motivated by recent work of Bartsch and Mederski and based on some observations and new techniques, we study above equation by developing the generalized Nehari manifold method. Particularly, existence of ground-state solutions of Nehari–Pankov type for the equation is established with asymptotically linear nonlinearity.
