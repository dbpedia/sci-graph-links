Abstract The purpose of this paper is to establish some fixed point results for cyclic contractions in the setting of dislocated quasi-b-metric spaces. We verify that some previous cyclic contraction results in dislocated quasi-b-metric spaces are just equivalent to the non-cyclic ones in the same spaces. Moreover, by using two examples, we highlight the superiority of the results obtained.
