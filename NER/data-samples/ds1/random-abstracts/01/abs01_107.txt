                In this paper we deal with the use of local searches within global optimization algorithms. We discuss different issues, such as the generation of new starting points, the strategies to decide whether to start a local search from a given point, and those to decide whether to keep the point or discard it from further consideration. We present how these topics have been faced in the existing literature and express our opinion on the relative merits of different choices.
