Abstract We consider a one point extension algebra B of a quiver algebra A q over a field k defined by two cycles and a quantum-like relation depending on a nonzero element q in k. We determine the Hochschild cohomology ring of B modulo nilpotence and show that if q is a root of unity, then B is a counterexample to Snashall-Solbergâ€™s conjecture.
