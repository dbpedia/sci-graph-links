Abstract In this paper, the third in the series, we study the properties of the generalized orthocenter H corresponding to a point P, defined to be the unique point for which the lines HA, HB, HC are parallel, respectively, to QD, QE, QF, where DEF is the cevian triangle of P and $${Q = K \circ \iota(P)}$$ Q=K∘ι(P) is the isotomcomplement of P, both with respect to a given triangle ABC. We characterize the center Z of the cevian conic $${\mathcal{C}_P}$$ CP on the 5 points ABCPQ as the center of the affine map $${\Phi_{P} = T_{P} \circ K^{-1} \circ T_{P'} \circ K^{-1}}$$ ΦP=TP∘K-1∘TP′∘K-1 , where T P is the unique affine map for which T P (ABC) = DEF; T P' is defined similarly for the isotomic conjugate $${P' = \iota(P)}$$ P′=ι(P) of P; and K is the complement map. The point Z is the point where the nine-point conic $${\mathcal{N}_H}$$ NH for the quadrangle ABCH and the inconic $${\mathcal{I}}$$ I of ABC, tangent to the sides at D, E, F, touch. This theorem generalizes the classical Feuerbach theorem.
