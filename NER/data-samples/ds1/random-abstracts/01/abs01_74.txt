Abstract In this paper, an active fault tolerant control (FTC) approach based on transient performance index is proposed for the attitude control systems of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with actuator fault. The nonlinear attitude control system model for UAV with actuator faults is given, which represents the dynamic characteristics of UAV. A fault diagnosis component is used for fault detection and estimation. According to the fault estimation information obtained during the fault diagnosis, the fault tolerant control scheme is developed by adopting the adaptive dynamic surface control technique, which guarantees the asymptotic output tracking and ultimate uniform boundedness of the closed-loop attitude control systems of UAV in actuator faulty case. Further, a prescribed transient performance of the FTC attitude control systems is considered which characterizes the convergence rate and maximum overshoot of the attitude tracking error. Finally, simulation results are shown that the attitude control system states remain bounded and the output tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of zero.
