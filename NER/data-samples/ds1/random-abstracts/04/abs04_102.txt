                Hydrothermal vent systems host microbial communities among which several
                    microorganisms have been considered endemic to this type of habitat. It is still
                    unclear how these organisms colonize geographically distant hydrothermal
                    environments. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, we compare the bacterial
                    communities of sixteen Atlantic hydrothermal vent samples with our own and
                    publicly available global open ocean samples. Analysing sequences obtained from
                    63 million 16S rRNA genes, the genera we could identify in the open ocean waters
                    contained 99.9% of the vent reads. This suggests that previously observed
                    vent exclusiveness is, in most cases, probably an artefact of lower sequencing
                    depth. These findings are a further step towards elucidating the role of the
                    open ocean as a seed bank. They can explain the predicament of how species
                    expected to be endemic to vent systems are able to colonize geographically
                    distant hydrothermal habitats and contribute to our understanding of whether
                    ‘everything is really everywhere’.
