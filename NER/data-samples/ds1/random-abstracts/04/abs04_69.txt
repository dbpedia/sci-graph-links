Abstract The time of concentration for a watershed is an essential parameter to the design of any hydrological project. In this study, a time of concentration estimation-model that uses variables obtained by monitoring rainfall-runoff events in a rural watershed of a tropical climate is proposed. In developing the model, the relationship between the time of concentration and independent variables was verified using a linear correlation matrix. Two variables with the highest correlation coefficient were selected to derive a model that can estimate the time of concentration. The Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm was employed to optimize the model parameters. The performance of the model was evaluated based on the Nashâ€“Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient, which yielded a value greater than 0.80. The proposed model allows one to estimate the time of concentration using only the hydrograph of an event at the base level of a watershed, without the use of rainfall data.
