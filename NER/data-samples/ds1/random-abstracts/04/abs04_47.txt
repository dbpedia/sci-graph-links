Abstract The seismic crisis that hit Calabria (South Italy) since the beginning of 1783, lasted 3 years with strong earthquakes concentrated in the first 2 months, causing many fatalities and great destruction, as reported by several detailed historical reports. Following an earthquake that occurred on February 6, 1783, a mass with volume of about 6 Mm3 detached from the flank of Mount Pacì and collapsed into the sea. In 1 min, huge waves attacked the nearby village of Scilla and killed most of the people that had gathered in the wide shore named Marina Grande to escape from seismic danger. More than 1500 people died due to the tsunami, many buildings were destroyed. In the paper, such catastrophic event is studied by means of numerical models. First we reconstruct the initial sliding mass and compute its motion through a Lagrangian model; then, we simulate the tsunami generation, propagation and flooding on the coast of Scilla by means of a nonlinear shallow-water equations model. The results of the simulation are compared against the detailed description of the tsunami effects available from several historical accounts and are found to be in a very satisfactory agreement with the 6–8 m inundation height reported in the Marina Grande beach.
