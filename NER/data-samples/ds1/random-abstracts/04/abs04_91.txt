Abstract The beds composing an unconformity at the boundary of the Mikhailovian and Venevian horizons in the Polotnyanyi Zavod quarry (Kaluga Region) are investigated. A detailed study has shown that, at the base of black “rhizoid” limestone, a pedocomplex of two paleosols of different genesis is formed. From below upwards, rocks of subaerial (Paleosol 1 of the rendzina type), subaerial–subaquatic (Paleosol 2 on bog marl), and palustrine genesis replace each other. Both paleosols display a horizontal structure of profiles; the presence of the root systems, imprints of plants, and traces of animal’s activity; the presence of soil new formations (micritic calcite with a light isotopic composition of C, Fe-concretions ). In paleosols, some geochemical indices (PWI, CIA, CIA-K), the ratios Ba/Sr, Rb/Sr, and concentration of Ga increase. The soil complex was formed under conditions of a warm subhumid climate. In the structure and lateral scale of distribution, the object investigated is comparable to the Everglades marsh landscape of Florida (United States).
