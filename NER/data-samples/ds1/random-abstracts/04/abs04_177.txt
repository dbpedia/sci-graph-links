Abstract The thermodynamic and geometric parameters of isomeric macrotricyclic Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) complexes that can form upon the complexation of the corresponding hexacyanoferrates( II) with thiooxamide H2N–C(=S)–C(=O)–NH2 and glyoxal HC(=O)–CH(=O) in gelatin-immobilized matrices have been calculated by the OPBE/TZVP DFT method with the use of the Gaussian09 program package. It has been found that a complex with the MN4 chelate core is most stable for M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn, and the MN2S2 core is most stable for M = Cu. Bond lengths and bond angles have been reported, and it has been noted that in all complexes, except the Zn(II) one, the chelate core and three fivemembered chelate rings are almost planar.
