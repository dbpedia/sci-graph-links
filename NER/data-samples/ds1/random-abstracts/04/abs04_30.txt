Abstract The physical (turbidity, color, smell, taste, pH, and conductivity) and geochemical properties (Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Al, K, Cl−, HCO3 −, SO4 2−, Fe, Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cr) of the drinking water in Gümüşhane city center were determined. This city center constitutes the study area. The pH levels of the water samples ranged from 6.3 to 8.2, and their conductivities ranged between 240 and 900 μS. These findings were concordant with the drinking water standards of the Turkey Standard Institute and the World Health Organization. The hardness of the water samples in the study area was between 18.1 and 115.1 °Fr. These samples were classified as extremely hard, hard, and quite hard. In addition, an assessment using the criteria for Inland Surface Water Classification indicated that considering certain parameters (pH levels, amount of Na, SO4 2−, Fe, Mn, Al, Co, Ni, Cu, and Cr), the samples belonged to class I (high quality) water. When Cl− amount and conductivity were considered, the samples belonged to the first and second classes (less polluted) of water. The water in the study area was generally classified as carbonated and sulfated (Ca + Mg > Na + K) water classes. This water contained more weak acids than strong acids (HCO3 − + CO3 2− > Cl− + SO4 2−). The pH levels (6.3–8.2) of the water in the study area were unrelated to the varying concentrations of metals in the water. Elements such as Fe, Ni, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu increase in the water through the water–rock interaction in the area in which water rises or through the mixture of water with either mine or industrial wastes. In addition, several water samples belonged to an acceptable water class for drinking and usage.
