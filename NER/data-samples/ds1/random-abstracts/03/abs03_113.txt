Abstract Nanoparticle Al2O3/Cr2O3 was successfully incorporated into Zn rich by electrodeposition technique to produce Zn-Al2O3-Cr2O3 ternary coatings. The morphology and structural characteristics of the fabricated electrodeposits were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) affixed with energy-dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical behavior of the coatings was studied by potentiodynamic polarization. The wear and microhardness properties of the coatings were tested using ball-on-disk sliding wear tester and diamond base microhardness indenter, respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of the nanoparticles into the Zn matrix refines the morphology and modifies the crystallographic orientation of the Zn coatings. The nanocomposite coatings exhibited improved microhardness properties, wear resistance, and thermal stability. Corrosion studies revealed that the incorporation of the mixed-oxide nanoparticles has no significant effect on the corrosion resistance of Zn coatings.
