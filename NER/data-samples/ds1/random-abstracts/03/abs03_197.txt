Abstract Complexes [Ph3(i-Pr)P]+ 2[Ag2I4]2- and [Ph3MeP]+ n [Ag3I4]– n were synthesized by the reaction of alkyl (triphenyl)phosphonium iodides with silver iodide in dimethyl sulfoxide. Triphenylalkylphosphonium cations have a tetrahedral configuration. Silver atoms in binuclear anions [Ag2I4]2- are characterized by trigonal coordination, the iodine coordination number being 2 or 1. In the polymeric anions [Ag3I4]– n the silver coordination number is 4 and that of iodine, 2, 3, or 4.
