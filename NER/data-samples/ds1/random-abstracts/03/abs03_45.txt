Abstract The syntheses of two compounds Cu2In3VO9 and CuInVO5, forming in the ternary system V2O5–CuO–In2O3, are described. The compound CuInVO5 has been for the first time obtained as the pure phase. The temperatures and modes of melting of the compounds are determined, and their IR spectra are analysed. The phase diagram of V2O5–CuO–In2O3 system in subsolidus area is constructed by DTA and XRD methods. This system is shown to consist of 11 subsidiary subsystems in which three solid phases coexist at equilibrium. The melting temperatures of these subsystems are also determined.
