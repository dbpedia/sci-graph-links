A solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) for doxycycline hydrochloride determination is proposed. A construction feature is a plasticized membrane ionâ€”electron transducer containing polyaniline. The transducer is situated between the current conductor and ion-selective membrane. The main metrological characteristics of the electrode are determined. It is established that the transducer increases the stability of the electrode potential during the measurements. It is demonstrated that the ISE can be used in practice for quantitative determination of doxycycline hydrochloride in dosage forms.
