Instability of emerging perovskite organometallic halide in humidity environment is the biggest obstacle for its potential applications in solar energy harvest and electroluminescent display. Understanding the detailed decay mechanism of these materials in moisture is a critical step towards the final appropriate solutions. As a model study presented in this work, in situ synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction was combined with microscopy and gravimetric analysis to study the degradation process of CH3NH3PbI3 in moisture, and the results reveal that: 1) intermediate monohydrated CH3NH3PbI3Â·H2O is detected in the degradation process of CH3NH3PbI3 and the final decomposition products are PbI2 and aqueous CH3NH3I; 2) the aqueous CH3NH3I could hardly further decompose into volatile CH3NH2, HI or I2; 3) the moisture disintegrate CH3NH3PbI3 and then alter the distribution of the decomposition products, which leads to an incompletely-reversible reaction of CH3NH3PbI3 hydrolysis and degrades the photoelectric properties. These findings further elucidate the picture of hydrolysis process of perovskite organometallic halide in humidity environment.
