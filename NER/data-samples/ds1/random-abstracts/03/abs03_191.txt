Abstract Eleven compounds, including a new sesquiterpene, were isolated from the culture medium of Aspergillus oryzae incubated with capsaicin. The structure of the new compound was determined to be 1,3,5a,6,7,8,9,9a-octahydro-9-hydroxy-9-(hydroxymethyl)-6-isopropyl-1-oxobenzo[c]oxepine-4- carboxylic acid, a heptelidic acid derivative. In addition, 10 known compounds were identified, namely 5-(hydroxymethyl)-3-furancarboxylic acid (flufuran), 3-hydroxypropanoic acid, 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2- furancarboxylic acid, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethanol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2-furanol, hydroheptelidic acid, and trichoderonic acid A, using spectroscopic data from nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray ionizationâ€“mass spectroscopy.
