Defining chiral centres is addressed by introducing a pair of chiral auxiliary groups. Ions of diastereomeric pairs of molecules could be distinguished utilising energy-resolved mass spectrometry, and the applicability of the method to a series of compounds carrying amine, carboxylic acid, alcohol, and all the amino acids was verified. The method was further strengthened by distinguishing diastereomeric ions that did not undergo fragmentation. Mass spectrometric evaluation of the dissociation process of adducted sodium cations from the diastereomeric precursors agreed with the theoretical calculations, indicating the potential usefulness of the method for the determination of absolute configurations.
