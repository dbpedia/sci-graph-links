Abstract The possible hydrolysis mechanisms for acetamiprid (AAP) with H3O+, H2O and OH− in the gas phase were studied by employing the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and MP2/6-311+G(d,p) levels. In each case, two different pathways were taken into account in our calculations. Moreover, the solvent effect of water was estimated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level by using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). The calculated results clearly showed that hydrolysis of AAP with OH− could readily take place in comparison with hydrolysis with H3O+, H2O. The most favorable pathway in the gas phase is the proton transfer toward the N atom in the single bond of AAP in the hydrolysis with OH−. The solvent effect does not significantly change the conclusion. The free energy barrier height of 25.74 kcal/mol (107.6 kJ/mol) is in excellent agreement with the available experimental value (106.3 kJ/mol).
