Abstract Heavy metal removal from industrial wastewaters has been intensively studied, since it is well known that they can cause severe problems to human health and aquatic life, even at very low concentrations. In this work, it was demonstrated that electrodeposition in fluidized bed electrode (FBE) can be efficiently employed to remove metal ions from solution, avoid contamination, and recover the metal. Copper electrodeposition from diluted solutions was efficiently performed using a membraneless FBE. The average current efficiency (ACE), average energy consumption (AEC), and space–time yield (AY) was optimized taking into account the operational and process variables. It was noted that for all response variables studied, the raise of supporting electrolyte concentration (C s) contributed to improvements in the process. The operational conditions current (I) and bed expansion (E) determined the values of CE, Y, and EC under activated control, but the initial copper concentration (C 0) determined how long the electrodeposition process will work under activated or mass transfer control, thus affecting the average values of CE, Y, and EC. Considering C 0 of 500 mg L−1, copper can be optimally recovered with ACE >60 %, AY >38 kg h−1 m−3, and AEC <4.0 kWh kg−1 by applying the lowest I and the highest levels of E and C s. It was concluded that the electrochemical technology using a membraneless FBE reactor is economically competitive and be applied for the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with copper or other metals.
