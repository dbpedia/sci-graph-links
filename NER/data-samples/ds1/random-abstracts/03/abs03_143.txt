It is shown that the thermodynamics characteristics of uranium hexafluoride solutions with volatile hexaand pentafluoride elements are a consequence of the strictly symmetric configuration of their molecular structure in the gaseous and liquid states. Simple methods are proposed for evaluating the properties of binary mixtures of elemental penta- and hexafluorides. These methods are based on a comparison of the elementâ€“fluorine bond length in the constituent molecules of system and the known enthalpy of mixing of one solution with the potential energy in the formation of a pair of unlike molecules of a different solution.
