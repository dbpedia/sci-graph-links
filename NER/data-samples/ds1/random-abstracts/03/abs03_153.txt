Abstract Structural DNA nanotechnology, an emerging technique that utilizes the nucleic acid molecule as generic polymer to programmably assemble well-defined and nano-sized architectures, holds great promise for new material synthesis and constructing functional nanodevices for different purposes. In the past three decades, rapid development of this technique has enabled the syntheses of hundreds and thousands of DNA nanostructures with various morphologies at different scales and dimensions. Among them, discrete three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanostructures not only represent the most advances in new material design, but also can serve as an excellent platform for many important applications. With precise spatial addressability and capability of arbitrary control over size, shape, and function, these nanostructures have drawn particular interests to scientists in different research fields. In this review article, we will briefly summarize the development regarding the synthesis of discrete DNA 3D nanostructures with various size, shape, geometry, and topology, including our previous work and recent progress by other groups. In detail, three methods majorly used to synthesize the DNA 3D objects will be introduced accordingly. Additionally, the principle, design rule, as well as pros and cons of each method will be highlighted. As functions of these discrete 3D nanostructures have drawn great interests to researchers, we will further discuss their cutting-edge applications in different areas, ranging from novel material synthesis, new device fabrication, and biomedical applications, etc. Lastly, challenges and outlook of these promising nanostructures will be given based on our point of view.
