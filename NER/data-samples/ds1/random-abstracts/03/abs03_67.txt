The Taguchi robust design method is implemented for the optimization of experimental conditions in the synthesis of high-purity ultrafine copper powder (HUCP) in mass-production by the chemical reduction method. A reducing agent, reaction temperature, reducing agent weight, and a stirring rate are chosen as the major optimization factors and the conversion rate, particle size, and reaction time are chosen as the desired targets. It is established that the reducing agent and the reaction temperature are the most significant factors that affect the desired targets. Among the selected or designed factors, the optimal conditions for producing the HUCP are: NaH2PO2 · H2O as the reducing agent (level 2), temperature 70°C (level 3), a reducing agent weight of 8.14 kg (level 3), and a stirring rate 300 rpm (level 2). The study results for the three desired targets are in agreement with the prediction made by the Taguchi method. Furthermore, the pure (impurity <0.06%) facecentered cubic structure of the HUCP with 1.51 μm average particle size is extensively characterized and determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer (ICP–OES), laser particle-size analyzer (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. This surfactant-free facility method is suitable for the synthesis of highpurity ultrafine copper powder by mass-production method.
