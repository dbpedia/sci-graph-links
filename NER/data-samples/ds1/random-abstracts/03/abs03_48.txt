AbstractA novel ferrocene-labeled Merrifield resin-supported ionic liquid phase catalysts has been synthesized and successfully utilized for the selective oxidation of primary alcohols into corresponding aldehydes. The catalysts were recovered by simple filtration which greatly simplified the purification step and allowed successive reuse for multiple times without significant loss in activity.
