Abstract Cobalt and nickel complexes (1a-1d and 2a-2d, respectively) supported by 2-imidate-pyridine ligands were synthesized and used for 1,3-butadiene polymerization. The complexes were characterized by IR and element analysis, and complex 1a was further characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The solid state structure of complex 1a displayed a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Upon activation with ethylaluminum sesquichloride (EASC), all the complexes showed high activities toward 1,3-butadiene polymerization. The cobalt complexes produced polymers with high cis-1,4 contents and high molecular weights, while the nickel complexes displayed low cis-1,4 selectivity and the resulting polymers had low molecular weights. The catalytic activities of the complexes highly depended on the ligand structure. With the increment of polymerization temperature, the cis-1,4 content and the molecular weight of the resulting polymer decreased.
