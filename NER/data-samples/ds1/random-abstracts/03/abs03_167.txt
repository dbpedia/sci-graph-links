Abstract The process of plasma chemical conversion of isotopic enriched 98MoF6 in RF (13.56Â MHz) capacitive-coupled and arc discharges was investigated. In both types of discharges the formation of metal (bulk) and powder nano-dispersed molybdenum as well as of fluoromolybdens of 98MoFn fluorides was found. The mechanism of plasma chemical reduction of 98MoF6 by hydrogen under considered experimental conditions was suggested. The isotopic and impurity composition of prepared nano-powder and bulk samples of 98Mo as well as of their structure was determined.
