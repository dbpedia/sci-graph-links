Abstract A series of novel substituted pyridine derivatives have been synthesized via the reaction of 3-indole carboxaldehyde with 3-aminoacetophenone. The products structures have been elucidated from elemental analysis as well as IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MS spectroscopy data. All the synthesized compounds have shown anticancer activity against HEPG2 and MCF-7 in vitro; some of them have exhibited the in vivo activity.
