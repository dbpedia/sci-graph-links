Abstract When plasmon electron gas of nanoparticles (gold or silver) is exposed to electromagnetic wave, they can absorb it and hastily convert it into heat. This phenomenon has many applications such as destructing tumor cancer (one method of thermal therapy) or the application in near-field regime. However, in any application, recognizing the limited area of absorption frequency is very important. The paper investigates the dependence of maximum absorption frequency of gold and silver nanorods on size and aspect ratio (length/radius). The principal role of this property is due to the skin effect and self-magnetism on plasmon oscillation. In the bulk system, the plasmon gas oscillation regions are in order to micrometer in metal. When the size of particles becomes smaller than a micrometer, the influence of particle size on plasmon gas oscillation starts (the plasmon electron gas restricted by size particle), and the self-magnetism of skin effect operated. Decreasing of nanorod size leads to increasing of effective density of electron current causing blue shift. The presented model predicts the blue shift of transversal mode of nanorods. The theoretical results acquired from this model are comparable to the experimental result of gold and silver.
