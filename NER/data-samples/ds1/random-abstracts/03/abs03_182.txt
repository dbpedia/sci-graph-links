Abstract Cycloalumination of methylenecyclobutane terpene derivatives (d(+)-camphor, (+)-camphene, β-pinene, and l(–)-menthol) with Et3Al catalyzed by Cp2ZrCl2 produced novel spirofused organoaluminum compounds in high yields. The synthesized compounds were in situ transformed into the corresponding spiro tetrahydroselenophenes and spiro phospholanes.
