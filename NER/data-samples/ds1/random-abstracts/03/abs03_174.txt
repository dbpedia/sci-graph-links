Abstract The interactions between human serum albumin (HSA) and 5-epi-taiwaniaquinone G (G2) or its isomeride (G1) was investigated by fluorescence, UVâ€“visible absorption, resonance light scattering, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and 3D spectroscopy under mimic physiological conditions in combination with molecular modeling. The results revealed that G1 and G2 caused the fluorescence quenching of HSA by the formation of G1-HSA and G2-HSA complex, respectively. The binding constants and thermodynamic parameters at three different temperatures were obtained. Hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions played a role in the binding process of HSA and G1. Van der Waals force and hydrogen bond interaction played a role in the binding process of HSA and G2. Results showed that G2 was the stronger quencher and the position of methyl influenced the binding process between HSA and G1 (G2).
