Abstract Rapid increase in antibiotic resistance has posed a worldwide threat, due to increased mortality, morbidity, and expenditure caused by antibiotic-resistant microbes. Recent development of the antimicrobial peptides like viscotoxin (Vt) has been successfully comprehended as a substitute for classical antibiotics. A structurally stable peptide, Vt can enhance antimicrobial property and can be used for various developmental purposes. Thus, structural stability among the antimicrobial peptides, Vt A1 (3C8P), A2 (1JMN), A3 (1ED0), B (1JMP), and C (1ORL) of Viscus album was computationally analyzed. In specific, the static confirmation of VtA3 showed high number of intramolecular interactions, along with an increase in hydrophobicity than others comparatively. Further, conformational sampling was used to analyze various geometrical parameters such as root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and ovality which also revealed the structural stability of VtA3. Moreover, the statistically validated contours of surface area, lipophilicity, and distance constraints of disulfide bonds also supported the priority of VtA3 with respect to stability. Finally, the functional activity of peptides was accessed by computing their free energy of membrane association and membrane interactions, which defined VtA3 as functionally stable. Currently, peptide-based antibiotics and nanoparticles have attracted the pharmaceutical industries for their potential therapeutic applications. Thereby, it is proposed that viscotoxin A3 (1ED0) could be used as a preeminent template for scaffolding potentially efficient antimicrobial peptide-based drugs and nanomaterials in future.
