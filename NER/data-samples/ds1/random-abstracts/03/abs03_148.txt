Abstract 5-Hydroxyphenyl-11,15,20-triphenylporphyrin H2Pp(1), and its six corresponding metalloporphyrins MnPp(2), FePp(3), CoPp(4), NiPp(5), CuPp(6), ZnPp(7) were synthesized and characterized. Their improvements to the Li/SOCl2 battery were tested. The results show that the discharge voltages of the battery catalyzed by 1–5 are increased by approximately 20–120 mV except 6 and 7. And the discharge time is lengthened by 26.7–157.6 s for 1, 2, 5 and 7. The maximum initial discharge voltages of battery in the presence of 1–7 are also increased. It shows that the central metal ion influences the charge transfer process during the reduction of thionyl chloride.
