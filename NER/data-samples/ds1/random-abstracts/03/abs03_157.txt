Abstract Graphene-like dichalcogenides with huge surface area and nanostructured transition metal oxides with extraordinarily high theoretical capacities could be composited as promising electrode candidates for supercapacitors. In this work, monolayer and few-layers WS2 nanosheets were exfoliated by combination of ball-milling and sonication. A facile strategy for the hierarchical self-assembly of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4NPs) on WS2 nanosheets was developed to synthesize Fe3O4NPs@WS2 nanocomposites via hydrothermal method. Fe3O4NPs are uniformly dispersed on the WS2 nanosheets without aggregation. The particle size of Fe3O4NPs is about 3 nm. The nanocomposite shows strong enhancements of electrochemical behaviors. This self-assembly synthesis strategy may have great prospects for other 0D/2D nanocomposites in supercapacitors and other energy devices.
