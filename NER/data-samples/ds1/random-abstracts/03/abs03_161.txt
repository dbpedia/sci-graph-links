Abstract Reactions of substituted 2-hydroxyalkyl-1,3-thiazole-5-carbaldehydes and 5-hydroxyalkyl-1,3-thiazole-2-carbaldehydes with phenylhydrazine, isoniazid, N-substituted rhodanines were performed as well as Biginelli reaction with acetoacetic ester and urea. As a result, new 1,3-thiazole derivatives were obtained. They are of interest as potential bioactive substances.
