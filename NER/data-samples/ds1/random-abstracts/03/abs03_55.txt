Abstract Reaction direction of N-sulfonyl derivatives of 1,4-benzoquinone monoimine with substituted hydrazines depends on the redox potential of the quinone imine and on the basicity of the hydrazine. Aryl (alkyl)hydrazines of high basicity favor the reduction of quinone monoimine. In reactions with less basic aroylhydrazones N'-(4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dienylidene)aroylhydrazides were obtained only from the alkylsubstituted in the quinoid ring N-sulfonyl derivatives possessing a lower redox potential.
