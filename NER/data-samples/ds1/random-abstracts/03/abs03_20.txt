Abstract The use of synthetic adhesives in the wood-based panels industry has been influenced by environmental and health restrictions. The main adhesives used in the industry have been urea–formaldehyde and phenol–formaldehyde. However, as these raw materials are petroleum products and natural gas, their processes are related to global warming and they may not be available in the future. Even formaldehyde affects human health. These issues have promoted the use of natural raw materials from sustainable origin in the manufacture of adhesives, such as lignin, tannins and proteins. This research proposes the use of single cell protein extract from yeast (SCPey) as a raw material to produce novel wood adhesives. The protein contents, amino acidic composition and the molecular weight distribution of protein extracts from Rhodotorula rubra, Pichia pastoris and Sacharomyces cerevisiae were investigated. Adhesive solutions were characterized and tested through a dynamic thermo mechanical analysis (DMA). Lap joints of wood veneers were assembled using adhesive solutions in order to perform mechanical tests and evaluate the adhesive performance. Protein content of R. rubra, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae were 72.4, 71.0 and 64.6 %, respectively. The amino acidic composition of SCPey samples promotes the content of reactive functional groups with the ones present in wood polymers. Molecular weight distribution of proteins from protein extracts ranged from 8 to 130 kDa. DMA showed that the adhesive solutions of the SCPey have a proper performance enhancing the wood adhesion. The joint strength under dry conditions with adhesives based on SCPey ranged from 2.40 to 2.99 MPa, which is similar to those obtained with UF and based on a protein isolated soy flour adhesive. Hence, the results showed that SCPey is a promising natural raw material to produce alternative wood adhesives with superior performance.
