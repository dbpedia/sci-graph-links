Abstract This paper reconstructs human model from multi-view RGB-D images of an Xbox One Kinect. We preprocess the depth images by implicit surface de-noising and then part-wisely register them into a point cloud. A template model is selected from the human model database to fit the registered point cloud of a human body by Laplacian deformation. Skin detection of RGB-D images helps to tightly constrain the skin parts of human body in template fitting step in order to get more precise and lifelike human model. We propose a robust skin detection method that is not affected by clothing pattern and background. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
