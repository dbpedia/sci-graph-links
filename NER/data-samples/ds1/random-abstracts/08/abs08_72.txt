Abstract Delivery of information to highly dynamic nodes is a big challenge in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Existing location management protocols for VANET maintain locations of mobile nodes, but they exploit mobile vehicles as location servers, which increases location server changes and reduces stability. In this paper collaborative vehicle location management service (CVLMS) for an enhanced hybrid reactive and proactive multicast (EHRPM) facilitates knowing the location information of the moving destinations. EHRPM uses speeds, length, and densities of roads to choose the least delivery delay path. Existing information dissemination in VANETs does not discuss how location servers are used in localization. CVLMS exploits roadside units (RSUs) in cashing and dissemination of locations and dissemination of multicast messages. CVLMS guarantees stability using static RSUs that maintain locations to overcome multiple location server change problem. Location tables are stored in multiple RSUs which maintain load distribution. CVLMS provides an infrastructure platform which enables collaboration of RSUs to exchange locations. Scalability of the CVLMS is provided by increasing the number of vehicles and still gives high-performance results. Results demonstrate that CVLMS outperforms grid location service, intersection location service, Dynamic MANET On-demand with RSUs, and time-based vehicle-to-roadside unit communication in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, end-to-end delay, and overhead.
