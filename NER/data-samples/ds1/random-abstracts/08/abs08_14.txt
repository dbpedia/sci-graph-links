Abstract Computational complexity of the semigroup fragment (of the algebraic semantics) and the implicational fragment of some fuzzy logics is studied, from the perspective of the complexity of the full logic. The available results appear to confirm the key role of the implicational fragments. Some other language fragments, as well as the notion of language fragment itself, are discussed.
