Abstract Virtualization plays a vital role in the construction of cloud computing. However, various vulnerabilities are existing in current virtualization implementations, and thus there are various security challenges at virtualization layer. In this paper, we investigate different vulnerabilities and attacks at virtualization layer of cloud computing. We examine the proposals of cloud intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion detection and prevention system frameworks. We recommend the cloud IDS requirements and research scope to achieve desired level of security at virtualization layer of cloud computing.
