Abstract A computing grid interconnects resources such as high performance computers, scientific databases, and computercontrolled scientific instruments of cooperating organizations each of which is autonomous. It precedes and is quite different from cloud computing, which provides computing resources by vendors to customers on demand. In this article, we describe the grid computing model and enumerate the major differences between grid and cloud computing.
