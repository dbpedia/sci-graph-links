Abstract This article describes a novel approach to verification of articulated arm coordinate measuring machines (AA CMMs) based on ISO 10360-2 standard. The approach utilizes the LaserTracer (LT) system as standard of length and automation of calibration procedure using an industrial robot. In this method, the robot is programmed to repeatedly move the AA CMM. The retroreflector is integrated with the stylus of AA CMM. Location of the retroreflector is constantly tracked by LaserTracer and, in select positions, the measurements of distance are performed by both the AA CMM and LT system. The verification of AA CMM accuracy is carried out through the comparison of the two measurement values. The developed procedure is recommended mainly for checking AA CMMs with large measuring volume, where the application of common artefacts is usually insufficient, or time-consuming, due to the fact that measurements have to be performed for several subspaces in the AA CMM measuring volume.
