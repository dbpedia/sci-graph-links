Abstract To improve localization accuracy, device-free passive localization studies usually deploy a number of sensor nodes in indoor environments, which causes redundant features and produces large data volumes and high deployment costs. This paper proposes the concept of a two-level redundancy and formulates the node reduction problem as a redundancy control problem. With the goal of using fewer nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy, a method is proposed to control the two-level redundancy efficiently and reduce the number of nodes greatly. Experiments are performed in two completely different environments. The proposed method is able to maintain accuracy levels above 90% and can efficiently reduce the total number of nodes by 59.09% in a large room (150 $${\mathrm{m}}^2$$ m2 ) and by 68.75% in a small room (25 $${\mathrm{m}}^2$$ m2 ). Furthermore, due to reduced nodes the proposed method can drastically reduce the needed amount of localization data and the hardware costs.
