Abstract Our purpose is to study the pairings of edges of hyperbolic polygonswith p edges, who are associated with a tessellation {p, q} = {12gâˆ’6, 3}, where g corresponds to the genus of the surface.We will define surgeries of pairings of edges associated with this tessellation, which allows us to get families of pairings graphs, for all g.
