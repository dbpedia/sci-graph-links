Abstract The fastest known algorithms for computing the R* consensus tree of k rooted phylogenetic trees with n leaves each and identical leaf label sets run in $$O(n^{2} \sqrt{\log n})$$ O(n2logn) time when $$k = 2$$ k=2 (Jansson and Sung in Algorithmica 66(2):329–345, 2013) and $$O(k n^{3})$$ O(kn3) time when $$k \ge 3$$ k≥3 (Bryant in Bioconsensus, volume 61 of DIMACS series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. American Mathematical Society, pp 163–184, 2003). This paper shows how to compute it in $$O(n^{2})$$ O(n2) time for $$k = 2, O(n^{2} \log ^{4/3} n)$$ k=2,O(n2log4/3n) time for $$k = 3$$ k=3 , and $$O(n^{2} \log ^{k+2} n)$$ O(n2logk+2n) time for unbounded k.
