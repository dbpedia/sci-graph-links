Abstract Untethered and wirelessly-controlled micro-robots have been catching substantial attention for a long time due to their great potentials in biomedical areas. Their small sizes and property of wireless magnetic actuation and control make them fit in tiny and closed environments both in vitro and in vivo such as lab-on-a-chip and human blood vessels for micromanipulations, minimum/non-invasive theoretical and diagnostic applications, respectively. In recent years, micro-robots driven by magnetic fields become a hotspot due to their good controllability and motion performance they have shown in both wet and dry environments. And they hardly bring harm under magnetic actuation and control, which qualify them especially for biomedical applications. This paper reviews the state of the art of hjbvmagnetic-micro-robot systems, including the related knowledge and theories, design works of magnetic micro-robots and magnetic navigation systems. For a straightforward understanding, several types of magnetic micro-robot systems are presented. And some applications of magnetic micro-robot systems are introduced at the end to show their great potentials. However, for further developments, many obstacles still need to be solved.
