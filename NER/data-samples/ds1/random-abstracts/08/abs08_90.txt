Abstract In order to fully utilize all potential available network resources and make the interoperability of systems possible, we propose to integrate cloud computing and peer-to-peer (P2P) computing environments together. We utilize the mobile multi-agent technology to construct an effective hierarchical integration model named Cloud-P2P. As the original management mechanisms for traditional cloud computing and P2P computing systems are no longer applicable to Cloud-P2P, we propose a novel hybrid collaborative management ring based on mobile multi-agent in order to ensure the efficiency and success rate of task implementation in the Cloud- P2P environment. This mechanism needs to divide the system into core ring, cloud inner rings and several peer rings. In each ring, every node is in collaboration with its neighbor nodes with multi-agent, or uses mobile agent moving from node to node with string or parallel methods to monitor the statuses and performances of all nodes, in order to avoid problems of performance bottleneck and single point failure. This paper analyses the node conditions of cloud computing and P2P computing environments in-depth, then elaborates on Cloud-P2P and the hybrid collaborative management ring based on mobile multi-agent (HCMRMMA). After that, the construction method of the network ring topology for Cloud-P2P is introduced. Finally, experimental results and performance analysis of HCMRMMA are presented.
