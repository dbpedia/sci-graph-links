Abstract A semi-matching in a bipartite graph $$G = (U, V, E)$$ G=(U,V,E) is a set of edges $$M \subseteq E$$ M⊆E such that each vertex in U is incident to exactly one edge in M, i.e., $$deg_M(u)=1$$ degM(u)=1 for each $$u \in U$$ u∈U . An optimal semi-matching is a semi-matching with the minimal value of the cost function $$\sum _{v \in V} \frac{deg_M(v) \cdot (deg_M(v)+1)}{2}$$ ∑v∈VdegM(v)·(degM(v)+1)2 . Exploiting the divide-and-conquer nature of the semi-matching problem, we reduce the problem to a simpler problem whose objective is to compute a maximum weak bounded-degree semi-matching. Using the reduction we derive three algorithms for the optimal semi-matching problem. The first one runs in time $$O(\sqrt{n} \cdot m \cdot \log {n})$$ O(n·m·logn) on a graph with n vertices and m edges. The second one is randomized and computes an optimal semi-matching with high probability in time $$O(n^{\omega } \cdot \log ^{1+o(1)} n)$$ O(nω·log1+o(1)n) , where $$\omega $$ ω is the exponent of the best known matrix multiplication algorithm. Since $$\omega < 2.38$$ ω<2.38 , this algorithm breaks through $$O(n^{2.5})$$ O(n2.5) barrier for dense graphs. In the case of planar graphs, the third one computes an optimal semi-matching in deterministic time $$O(n\cdot \log ^4{n})$$ O(n·log4n) .
