Abstract Let $$P$$ P and $$Q$$ Q be two simple polygons in the plane of total complexity n, each of which can be decomposed into at most k convex parts. We present a $$(1-\varepsilon )$$ (1-ε) -approximation algorithm, for finding the translation of $$Q$$ Q , which maximizes its area of overlap with $$P$$ P . Our algorithm runs in $$O\left( {c n}\right) $$ Ocn time, where c is a constant that depends only on k and $$\varepsilon $$ ε . This suggests that for polygons that are “close” to being convex, the problem can be solved (approximately), in near linear time.
