Abstract A new general method of computational electromagnetism based on extremizing the electromagnetic action using the geometric algebra of space-time is described. Special cases include a boundary element method and a finite element method. These methods are derived and discussed, computational examples given, and compared with some well known methods of computational electromagnetism.
