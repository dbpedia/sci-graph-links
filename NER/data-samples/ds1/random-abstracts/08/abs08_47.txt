Abstract Mobile cloud storage service is used for usersâ€™ multimedia content data sharing or synchronization in effective way with several mobile devices. To save various content data in the mobile cloud storage, the matters of security should be treated in the process of data sharing to provide flexibility and expandability for solving its heterogeneousness. Currently, the cloud storage service generally encrypts the content data for the security. However, this method is not perfectly safe for it manages ID, password, and encryption key simply with software; thus it may accept unauthorized users. This research suggests the data access control model and the method for multimedia content sharing and security based on XMDR-DAI in the mobile cloud storage. It supports key management based on hardware, identification for the integrity of client software, and security key sharing. Also, the suggested model saves/manages different types of multimedia content, thus it establishes XMDR-DAI-based metadata relationship for the problems that occurred in searching to increase the reliability. And this research suggests the prototype using TPM emulator that is operated in secure world of ARM TrustZone and TrustZone environment.
