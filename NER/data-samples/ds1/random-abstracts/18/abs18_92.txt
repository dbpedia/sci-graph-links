Abstract We consider the discrete Gaussian Free Field in a square box in $${\mathbb{Z}^2}$$ Z2 of side length N with zero boundary conditions and study the joint law of its properly-centered extreme values (h) and their scaled spatial positions (x) in the limit as $${N \to \infty}$$ N→∞ . Restricting attention to extreme local maxima, i.e., the extreme points that are maximal in an r N -neighborhood thereof, we prove that the associated process tends, whenever $${r_N \to \infty}$$ rN→∞ and $${r_N/N \to 0}$$ rN/N→0 , to a Poisson point process with intensity measure $${Z{(\rm dx)}{\rm e}^{-\alpha h} {\rm d}h}$$ Z(dx)e-αhdh , where $${\alpha:= 2/\sqrt{g}}$$ α:=2/g with g: = 2/π and where Z(dx) is a random Borel measure on [0, 1]2. In particular, this yields an integral representation of the law of the absolute maximum, similar to that found in the context of Branching Brownian Motion. We give evidence that the random measure Z is a version of the derivative martingale associated with the continuum Gaussian Free Field.
