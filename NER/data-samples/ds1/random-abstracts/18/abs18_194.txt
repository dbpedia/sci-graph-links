Abstract We introduce a property which we denote by NZ$${(\kappa)}$$ (κ) , where $${\kappa}$$ κ is a cardinal. We show that chain neighborhood (F) spaces and monotonically metacompact spaces satisfy NZ(1), and that NZ$${(\kappa)}$$ (κ) implies D if $${\kappa \leq \omega}$$ κ≤ω . Also, NZ$${(\kappa)}$$ (κ) is closed under arbitrary subspaces and finite products, and countable products if $${\kappa}$$ κ is infinite. It follows that any countable product of chain neighborhood (F) spaces and monotonically metacompact spaces is hereditarily a D-space. This provides a strong positive answer to a question of X. Yuming. We also prove that spaces satisfying NZ$${(\kappa)}$$ (κ) are metacompact if $${\kappa}$$ κ is finite, and meta-Lindelöf if $${\kappa = \omega}$$ κ=ω .
