One of the central claims in the international constitutionalism literature posits that, through the process of constitutionalisation, the nation-state can be overcome. Drawing on John Agnew, this paper shows that the international constitutionalism literature is caught in a ‘territorial trap’. It argues that our conception of constitutionalism is profoundly shaped by the territorial logic of the state, and that, as a result, the linkage between constitutionalism and the state is deeper and more complex than has been previously acknowledged. By leaving the underlying territorial assumptions of constitutional law unproblematised, international constitutionalism, as it stands today, reinforces and re-enacts the state rather than overcoming it.
