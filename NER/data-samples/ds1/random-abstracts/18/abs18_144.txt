Abstract In this paper we explore f(T,T) $f(T, \mathcal{T})$, where T $T$ and T $\mathcal {T}$ denote the torsion scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor respectively. We impose the covariant conservation to the energy-momentum tensor and obtain a cosmological f(T,T) $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ respectively. We impose the covariant conservation to the energy-momentum tensor and obtain a cosmological f(T,T) $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ model. Then, we study the stability of the obtained model for power-law and de Sitter solutions and our result show that the model can be stable for some values of the input parameters, for both power-law and de Sitter solutions.
