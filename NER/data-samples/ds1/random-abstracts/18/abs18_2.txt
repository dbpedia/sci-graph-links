Abstract Experimental data demonstrating the correlation of parameters in the power-law dependence of the burning rate of composite solid propellants on pressure are reported. The reasons for changes in the burning rate due to changes in propellant mixing conditions are discussed. The deviation of the pressure in the combustor of a solid-propellant rocket motor is analyzed with due allowance for the correlation of parameters in the burning rate law. It is shown that the relative deviation of the burning rate depends on pressure at which propellant combustion occurs. Moreover, for each propellant, there exists a pressure level at which the burning rate deviation is theoretically equal to zero, regardless of the differences in propellant compositions and properties.
