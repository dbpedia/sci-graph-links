Abstract We find the solutions of the cosine addition law with an additional term, including the case of the cosine addition law on semigroups. They are expressed in terms of multiplicative functions and solutions of the sine addition law, apart from an obvious exception. On groups multiplicative and additive functions suffice. As an application we solve extensions of Butlerâ€™s problem on semigroups.
