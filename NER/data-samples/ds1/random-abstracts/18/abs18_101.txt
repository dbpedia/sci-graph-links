Abstract A single-crystal gradient plasticity model is presented that includes a power-law type defect energy depending on the gradient of an equivalent plastic strain. Numerical regularization for the case of vanishing gradients is employed in the finite element discretization of the theory. Three exemplary choices of the defect energy exponent are compared in finite element simulations of elastic-plastic tricrystals under tensile loading. The influence of the power-law exponent is discussed related to the distribution of gradients and in regard to size effects. In addition, an analytical solution is presented for the single slip case supporting the numerical results. The influence of the power-law exponent is contrasted to the influence of the normalization constant.
