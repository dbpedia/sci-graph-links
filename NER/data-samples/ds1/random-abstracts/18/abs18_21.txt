Abstract In this Note, we aim at proving a theorem on a new conservation law for the dynamics of a position-dependent mass particle. This new conservation law has the significant particularity of being concisely written in terms of the total energy of the problem. Here, we will consider the special case in which the absolute velocity of mass ejection or aggregation is a linear function of the generalized velocity. Our result is an original contribution in the traditional research field of variable-mass systems.
