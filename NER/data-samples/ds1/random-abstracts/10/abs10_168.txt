Abstract Braess’s paradox exposes a counterintuitive phenomenon that when travelers selfishly choose their routes in a network, removing links can improve the overall network performance. Under the model of nonatomic selfish routing, we characterize the topologies of k-commodity undirected and directed networks in which Braess’s paradox never occurs. Our results strengthen Milchtaich’s series-parallel characterization (Milchtaich, Games Econom. Behav. 57(2), 321–346 (2006)) for the single-commodity undirected case.
