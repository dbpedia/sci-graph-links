Abstract It has become the hot research issue that solves the bottleneck of resource management in the development of Internet through virtualization. However, there are the challenges of mobility management, resource management, and network overhead management in the virtualization of the Internet. First, based on the mobile Internet network construction and management mode, the mobile Internet virtual model was proposed for managing the differences of the port communication between the mobile Internet protocol layer and protocol layer. Secondly, based on the network management cost control and the reconstruction of the Internet virtualization, we designed the network overhead crowd optimization space and management vector. The network overhead crowd management mechanism is proposed, which will transport the mobile virtualization Internet topology to point-to-point structure. Finally, the simulation results verified the advantages of the network overhead management mechanism of the virtual mobile Internet in terms of the cost and real time of the network overhead management.
