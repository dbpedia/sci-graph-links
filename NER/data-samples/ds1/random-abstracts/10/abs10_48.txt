Abstract The results of solution of the inverse problem of determining the distance to the reflector in the case of current modulation of the laser radiation wavelength are presented. It is shown that current modulation of the autodyne signal amplitude can reduce the inverse problem of finding the distance to the reflector to a state of affairs characteristic only of phase modulation. The technique that we propose provides a higher range-finding accuracy than does direct analysis of the autodyne signal.
