Abstract An 8-bit passive chipless RFID using metamaterial structure with dimension of 25 × 50 mm which operates between 3.4 and 7.4 GHz is proposed. The chipless RFID is designed using complementary split ring resonator (SRR) with a transmission line feeding network of 50 Ω. The modified complementary split ring resonator (MCSRR) is located at the backside of the substrate. The MCSRR has narrow bandwidth which can maximize the amount of bit capacity. To enhance the bit capacity, the frequency shifting is introduced by the allocation of bit conditions (00, 01, 10 and 11) at the specific resonance frequency. The polyethylene terephthalate material with ε r  = 3.0 and tan δ = 0.002 is a suitable candidate for body identification due to the flexibility and the robustness of the material.
