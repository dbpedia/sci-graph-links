Abstract In this work, the 2-turn spiral resonator (2-SR) is proposed as an electrically small antenna for passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags at the European ultra-high frequency (UHF) band. The radiation properties are studied in order to explore the viability of the 2-SR applied to tag antenna design. Based on analytical calculations, the radiation pattern is found to provide a cancelation of the radiation nulls. This results in a mitigation of the blind spots in the read range, which are present in typical UHF-RFID tags as an undesired feature. As a proof of concept, a passive tag of size 35 mm × 40 mm (λ 0/10 × λ 0/9) based on the 2-SR antenna is designed and fabricated. Good radiation efficiency (75 %) and a quasi-isotropic radiation pattern are obtained. The experimental tag read range for different directions is in good agreement with the simulation results. The measured read range exhibits maximum and minimum values of 6.7 and 3.5 m, respectively.
