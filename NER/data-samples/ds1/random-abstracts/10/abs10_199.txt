Abstract In this proposed work a compact dual band and wideband slot loaded multilayered patch antennas are presented for WLAN and WiMAX applications. The antenna parameters such as return loss, radiation pattern, gain, frequency ratio, VSWR, efficiency, group delay and beam-width are discussed. The bandwidth of the proposed dual band antenna at lower resonant frequency is 9.53 % (simulated) and 13.2 % (experimental) whereas at upper resonance frequency is 6.95 % (simulated), and 13.32 % (experimental) while for wideband it is 26.7 % (simulated) and 25.09 % (experimental). The proposed antenna structures are simulated by HFSS tool, fabricated and the simulated results are verified by experiment.
