Abstract In a resource-constrained wireless sensor network, energy efficiency is a principle issue for monitoring the movement of continuous objects, such as wild fire and hazardous chemical material. In this paper, a continuous object tracking scheme with two-layer grid model (TGM-COT) is proposed. To address the problem of boundary distortion caused by uneven node distribution, we put forward a novel mechanism for boundary nodes identification. Furthermore, a streamlining mechanism is designed to reduce the amount of uploaded data. Simulation results demonstrate that, without sacrificing additional energy consumption, TGM-COT is able to achieve high tracking accuracy and significantly reduce the communication overhead.
