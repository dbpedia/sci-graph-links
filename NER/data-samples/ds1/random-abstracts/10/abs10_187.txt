Abstract To solve the problem of unreasonable distribution of cluster heads in wireless sensor network (WSN) clustering routing methods, as well as to optimize data transferring between clusters, the novel predictive efficient energy consumption reclaim (PEECR)-based clustering routing approach for wireless sensor network has been presented in this paper. On how to select cluster head, a new energy-efficient clustering method based on degree, relative distance and residual energy of nodes is designed, which guarantees that distribution of cluster heads is uniform, scale of clusters is balanced, and nodes with high energy act as cluster head preferentially. By using swarm colony optimization idea, we design PEECR strategy for data transferring. A predictive data transferring strategy between clusters is designed. Taking expected energy consumption on a road, hops and propagation delay into account, definition of good ratio of a road is given, according to which we choose optimal road. In reception mode, energy consumption of transceivers from source node to sink node of wireless sensor network is similar to energy consumption from sink node to source node, and both can be minimized by our approach. Our experimental tests show that novel optimized clustering routing approach can improve quality of clusters and whole performance of network, reduce and balance energy consumption of the whole network, and prolong lifetime of WSN as well.
