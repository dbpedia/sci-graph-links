It was established that the insertion of gold nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by an organic (thiophenol) or inorganic (silicon dioxide) shell into films of conjugated copolymer SuperYellow helps to increase its photoluminescence [the metal-enhanced fluorescence effect (MEF)], which may result from interaction between the components of the nanocomposites. It was shown that the maximum emission intensity of SuperYellow in the obtained nanocomposite films is observed with Au nanoparticle content between 1 and 5 wt.%. It was found that the magnitude of the MEF effect depends on the nature of the shell of the Au nanoparticle, reaching 250%.
