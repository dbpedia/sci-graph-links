Abstract Genetic algorithm was applied for optimization of dispersion properties in semiconductor Bragg reflectors for applications in femtosecond lasers. Broadband, large negative group-delay dispersion was achieved in the optimized design: The group-delay dispersion (GDD) as large as $$-3500\,\hbox {fs}^{2}$$ -3500fs2 was theoretically obtained over a 10-nm bandwidth. The designed structure was manufactured and tested, providing GDD $$-3320\,\hbox {fs}^{2}$$ -3320fs2 over a 7-nm bandwidth. The mirror performance was verified in semiconductor structures grown with molecular beam epitaxy. The mirror was tested in a passively mode-locked Yb:KYW laser.
