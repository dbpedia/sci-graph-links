Abstract Multilayer on-chip inductor and capacitor are proposed in this paper. These passive on-chip components are combined to form series LC on-chip band pass filter and are designed based on VLSI multilayer design concepts to operate at high frequency range applications. Development in RF-VLSI circuits demanded low size on-chip filters to operate at higher order frequency range with better tuning response. Design and simulation of on-chip passive components is carried out in high frequency structural simulator to obtain scattering parameters required for analysis. The designed filter model has good compromise between S 11 and S 21 parameters against frequency satisfying basic conditions of on-chip band pass filter. Proposed filter circuit has centre frequency at 39.5 GHz, bandwidth of 3.17 GHz, loaded Q value of 12.5, fractional bandwidth of 8 % which is suitable for narrow band operations and occupies an on-chip area of 0.0256 mm2. This miniature on-chip band pass filter reduces the size and cost of the chip significantly at radio frequencies when compared with existing models.
