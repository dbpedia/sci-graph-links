Abstract One approach in swarm robotics is homogeneous system which is embedded with sensing, computing, mobile and communication components. In this study, a target detection problem, which is one of navigation problems, was employed. Once a robot detects a target, robots immediately communicate with a base station via intermediate relay robots due to the multi-hop transmission of wireless communication. Therefore, this control task is completed with connectivity of the network. In a target detection problem, we must improve the performance of exploration as well as connectivity of the network. This study investigates the performances of the two types of random walk algorithm in navigation while loosely ensuring connectivity of the robotic network based on our previous study.
