Abstract With the increasing application of machine-to machine (M2M) communication through cellular networks, such as telematics, smart metering, point-of-sale terminals, and home security, more data traffice has been produced in the cellular network. Although many schemes have been proposed to reduce data traffic, they are inefficient in practical application due to poor adaption. In this paper, we focus on how to adaptively offload data traffic for cellular M2M networks. To this end, we propose an adaptive mobile data traffic offloading model (AOM). This model can decide whether to adopt opportunistic communications or communicate via cellular networks adaptively. In the AOM, we introduce traffic offloading rate (called TOR) and local resource consumption rate (called LRCR) and analyze them based on continue time Markov chain. Theory proof and extensive simulations demonstrate that our model is accurate and effective, and can adaptively offload data traffic of cellular M2M networks.
