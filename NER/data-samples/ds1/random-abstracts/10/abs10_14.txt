Abstract Two textile antennas namely diamond dipole and coplanar waveguide (CPW) monopole are designed to test the proposed textile artificial magnetic conductor (AMC). Performance comparison including return loss, radiation pattern, and gain between the two antennas above AMC is observed. Results show gain improvement with reduced backlobes when having AMC. Bending and wetness measurements are also conducted. Bending is found not to cause performance disruption, while wetness influences performance distortion. However, once the antennas and AMC dried out, the original performance is retrieved.
