Abstract Of late, many synthesis processes have been studied to develop irregular nano-morphologies of gold nanostructures for biomedical applications in order to increase the efficacy of nanoparticle theranostics, tune the plasmonic absorbance spectra, and increase the sensitivity of biomolecule detection through surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Here we report, a novel, non-seed mediated versatile single pot synthesis method capable of producing hyperbranched gold “nano-polyvilli” with more than 50–90 branching nanowires propagating from a single origin within each structure. The technique was capable of achieving precise tuning of the branch propagation where the branching could be controlled by varying the duration of incubation, temperature, and hydrogen ion concentration.
