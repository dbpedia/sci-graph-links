Abstract A T-shaped polarization beam splitter based on two-dimensional photonic crystal is proposed, which is composed of three waveguides: one input and two output. Unpolarized beams incident from the input port will be separated into two different polarization modes and outputted individually by two different coupling structures. Simulation results can be obtained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In the normalized frequency range of 0.3456 < $$\omega \alpha /2\pi {}c$$ ωα/2πc < 0.37, multiple frequencies can obtain high transmission efficiency simultaneously for both TE and TM modes. And the degree of polarization is very closed to 1 for both output ports at this frequency range. When the normalized frequency $$f=0.3534 \omega \alpha /2\pi {}c$$ f=0.3534ωα/2πc , the transmission efficiency, respectively, is 88 % and $$91$$ 91 % for TE modes and TM modes. The extinction ratio is all 30dB for both modes. The polarization beam splitter attains the requirement we expected by analyzing simulation results.
