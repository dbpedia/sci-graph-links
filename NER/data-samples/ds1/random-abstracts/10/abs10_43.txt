Abstract In this study, ZnO nanoparticles were fabricated using a simple and novel combustion method without calcination. The sensor material was structurally and morphologically characterized using simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The sample containing 3 mol tartaric acid (ZTC-3) exhibited excellent ethanol sensing properties at the optimum temperature of 330Â°C. The relationships among the gas response, temperature, response time (recovery time), concentration, and gas species were investigated. The ZTC-3 exhibited response and recovery times of 7 and 38 s to 100 ppm ethanol, as well as excellent response and good selectivity to ethanol gas. Such a ZnO nanoparticle structure could be potentially use for fabricating ethanol sensors.
