Abstract The aim of the present contribution is to show that metasurfaces such as reactive impedance surfaces (RIS) and artificial magnetic conductors can be efficiently used in the design of low-profile circularly polarized L-band antennas. We present the design and simulation of the compact and low-profile antennas. The solution based on RIS will be compared to a circularly polarized microstrip patch antenna using the same materials in order to prove the benefit of metasurfaces. The engineered metasurfaces allow increasing the bandwidths with few modifications on the thickness and the overall antenna size.
