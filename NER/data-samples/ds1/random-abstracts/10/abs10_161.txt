Abstract The thin-film transistors (TFTs) with InGaZnO active layer with different oxygen partial pressures are fabricated by radio frequency sputtering. The influence of the oxygen partial pressure on the density of states (DOS) for InGaZnO-TFT is investigated by using temperature-dependent field-effect measurements. It indicates that the DOS become smaller with increasing oxygen partial pressure. The results are verified by the threshold voltage shift of InGaZnO-TFT with different oxygen partial pressures. The trend of the variation of DOS is consistent with that of the threshold voltage shift for InGaZnO-TFT. Thus, the gate bias instability is attributed to the charge trapping mechanism based on DOS. Therefore, this work offered a brief and accurate method to calculate DOS for demonstrating the bias stability of transistor.
