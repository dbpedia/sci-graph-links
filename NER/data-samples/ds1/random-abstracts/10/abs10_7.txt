Abstract The deployment of an under water acoustic sensor network (UWASN) is constrained by the sensor node resources such as power, memory and processing speed, and is affected by dynamically varying channel characteristics. The sensor nodes in a static UWASN may have link breakages due to adverse channel and environmental conditions. Thus, there is a need to develop a low cost, high quality, easily deployable and self configurable platform for UWASN that will automate information collection to reduce the latency through better coverage and connectivity, and utilize the resources efficiently. This paper proposes a deployment scheme based on 3D network architecture which consists of the following major components: (1) nodes for event detection (events like, antisubmarine, chemical spill, biological hazards, etc.), (2) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for collecting information and relaying to the surface gateways (SGs), and (3) multiple SGs on the surface of sea which are responsible for collecting the information from AUVs and nodes in its vicinity, and relaying to the control center. The proposed scheme employs mathematical models that are designed based on parameters associated with underwater channel characteristics. The use of multiple AUVs and SGs enhances the coverage area of the sensor nodes and network connectivity. AUVs patrol the areas where connectivity is likely to be poor due to channel conditions. These AUVs assist in overcoming interference problems, and also does the work on behalf of the drained sensor nodes until they are repaired. The scheme is simulated for analysis of area coverage, connectivity, resource requirement, and delays for various cases of AUVs route planning. Simulation results show better coverage, connectivity, resource utility as compared to purely distributed node deployment scheme based on connected dominating set based depth computation approach.
