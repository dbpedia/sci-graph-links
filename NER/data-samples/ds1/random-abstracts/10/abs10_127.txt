Abstract Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) application melted barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) spherical nanoparticle capsids. Synergistic therapeutic effects for plant virus resistance were induced by interaction with binding units of prepared AuNPs in a water solution which was characterized and evaluated by zeta sizer, zeta potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The yield of purified nanoparticles of BYDV-PAV was obtained from Hordeum vulgare (Barley) cultivars, local and Giza 121/Justo. It was 0.62 mg/ml from 27.30 g of infected leaves at an A260/A280 ratio. Virus nanoparticle has a spherical shape 30 nm in size by TEM. BYDV-PAV combined with AuNPs to challenge virus function in vivo and in vitro. Dual AuNPs existence in vivo and in vitro affected compacted configuration of viral capsid protein in the interior surface of capsomers, the outer surface, or between the interface of coat protein subunits for 24 and 48 h incubation period in vitro at room temperature. The sizes of AuNPs that had a potentially dramatic deteriorated effect are 3.151 and 31.67 nm with a different intensity of 75.3% for the former and 24.7% for the latter, which enhances optical sensing applications to eliminate virus infectivity. Damages of capsid protein due to AuNPs on the surface of virus subunits caused variable performance in four different types of TEM named puffed, deteriorated and decorated, ruined and vanished. Viral yield showed remarkably high-intensity degree of particle symmetry and uniformity in the local cultivar greater than in Giza 121/Justo cultivar. A high yield of ruined VLPs in the local cultivar than Justo cultivar was noticed. AuNPs indicated complete lysed VLPs and some deteriorated VLPs at 48 h.
