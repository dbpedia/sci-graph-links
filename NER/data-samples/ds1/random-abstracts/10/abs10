Based on the regularities of the weighting factors, a method is proposed and the vertical and horizontal weighting filters are developed. The whole frequency range is divided several times into two parts with respective regularity. For each division, a parallel filter constituted by a low- and a high-pass filter with the same cutoff frequency and the quality factor is utilized to achieve section factors. The cascading of these parallel filters obtains entire factors. These filters own a high order. But, low order filters are preferred in some applications. The bilinear transformation method and the least P-norm optimal infinite impulse response(IIR) filter design method are employed to develop low order filters to approximate the weightings in the standard. In addition, with the window method, the linear phase finite impulse response(FIR) filter is designed to keep the signal from distorting and to obtain the staircase weighting. For the same case, the traditional method produces 0.330 7 m • s–2 weighted root mean square(r.m.s.) acceleration and the filtering method gives 0.311 9 m • s–2 r.m.s. The fourth order filter for approximation of vertical weighting obtains 0.313 9 m • s–2 r.m.s. Crest factors of the acceleration signal weighted by the weighting filter and the fourth order filter are 3.002 7 and 3.011 1, respectively. This paper proposes several methods to design frequency weighting filters for automotive ride comfort evaluation, and these developed weighting filters are effective." .

However, most of these algorithms focus only on energy efficiency in which each node finds a shortest path to the base station (BS), but remain silent about energy balancing which is equally important to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose particle swarm optimization-based routing and clustering algorithms for WSNs. The routing algorithm builds a trade-off between energy efficiency and energy balancing, whereas the clustering algorithm takes care of the energy consumption of gateways as well as sensor nodes. We develop an efficient particle-encoding scheme and derive a multi-objective fitness function for each of the proposed routing and clustering algorithms. The algorithms are also capable of tolerating the failure of cluster heads. We perform extensive simulations on the proposed schemes and the results are compared with the existing algorithms to demonstrate their superiority in terms of various performance metrics." .

Considering the high data rates required by this standard, parallel decoding architecture is used. The parallel decoding latency is reduced N times compared with the serial decoding latency, N being the parallelization factor, usually a power of 2. The decoding performances are similar for both serial and parallel schemes, when very low decoding latency is added to this theoretical parallel latency value. Taking advantage of the quadratic permutation polynomial interleaver properties, and considering some specific FPGA block memory characteristics, a novel simplified parallel decoding scheme is proposed, including only one interleaver, independently of the N value. Moreover, for the single interleaver, we propose a solution that exploits key arithmetic properties of the corresponding equation to perform the address computation in a recursive manner. The proposed method replaces divisions and multiplications by comparisons and subtractions. In addition, an even-odd merge sorting network provides correct data to all N decoding units." .

The goal of PTT is to induce rapid heating in tumor tissues while minimizing thermal diffusion to normal brain. PTT efficacy is sensitively dependent on both nanoparticle concentration and distribution in tumor tissues. Nanoparticle delivery via passive approaches such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is unlikely to achieve sufficient nanoparticle concentrations throughout tumor volumes required for effective PTT. A simple approach for improving tumor biodsitribution of nanoparticles is the use of cellular delivery vehicles. Specifically, this review focuses on the use of monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Ma) as gold nanoparticle delivery vectors for PTT of brain tumors. Although the efficacy of this delivery approach has been demonstrated in both in vitro and animal PTT studies, its clinical potential for the treatment of brain tumors remains uncertain." .

An advantage of this approach is that corrected iPSCs that are free of off-target modifications can be identified before differentiating the cells into hematopoietic progenitors for transplantation. In order for this approach to be practical, iPSC generation must be rapid and efficient. Therefore, we developed a novel helper-dependent adenovirus/Epstein-Barr virus (HDAd/EBV) hybrid reprogramming vector, rCLAE-R6, that delivers six reprogramming factors episomally. HDAd/EBV transduction of keratinocytes from SCD patients resulted in footprint-free iPSCs with high efficiency. Subsequently, the sickle mutation was corrected by delivering CRISPR/Cas9 with adenovirus followed by nucleoporation with a 70 nt single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) correction template. Correction efficiencies of up to 67.9% (βA/[βS+βA]) were obtained. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of corrected iPSC lines demonstrated no CRISPR/Cas modifications in 1467 potential off-target sites and no modifications in tumor suppressor genes or other genes associated with pathologies.

Therefore, RF pulses have phase coherency but NQR signals after each RF pulse have different initial phase. In this case, a phase-sensitive detection (PSD) using the same continuous RF wave is necessary to accumulate NQR signal. Meanwhile, recent improvement of device technology enables a phase controlled RF pulse and a direct sampling of NQR signal in the laboratory frame. We developed a new pulse NQR system using phase controlled RF pulse, in which RF pulses with the same initial phase are produced and NQR signal after each pulse is directly acquired in the laboratory frame, and then the accumulated signal is processed by digital quadrature detection and fast Fourier transform. This paper provides and compares the feature of NQR signals from both types of pulse NQR system. Main findings are that NQR signal obtained by a train of phase coherent pulses and PSD shows the periodical variation of the intensity depending on the offset frequency of the irradiation RF pulse from the resonance frequency but the signal obtained by the phase controlled RF pulse train does not. This feature would be important for the application of NQR to detection system for such as explosives." .

Use of adenoviral vectors in gene therapy is, however, limited by the lack of adenoviral receptors on targeted cell types, induction of neutralizing antibodies, short blood circulation half-life of adenovirus (Ad), hepatotoxicity and low selective accumulation in the target disease site. Researchers have shown that chemical modification of the Ad surface may be an effective means to overcome the current limitations of Ad-mediated gene transfer. In comparison, a small number of studies have addressed these issues by developing cationic lipid-based nanoparticles as an Ad-complexing formulation. Findings from these studies indicate that Ad complexation with cationic lipid-based nanoparticles is an effective and simple means to overcome the lack of receptors in target cells in vitro and to reduce the immunogenicity and hepatotoxicity of Ad vectors in vivo. In contrast, findings about the effect of cationic nanoparticle complexation in increasing the Ad accumulation in the target site in vivo are not consistent among studies. A definitive conclusion cannot be drawn at the current state due to the limited number of studies but the reasons for the discrepancy may include the differences in the lipid composition and the structure of cationic lipid-based nanoparticles. This review gives a comprehensive overview of current status in the development of cationic lipid-based nanoparticles as a vehicle to overcome the challenges of adenoviral vectors." .

This fact further complicates the task of network intrusion detection, especially when advanced machine learning (ML) operations are involved in the process. In wireless environments, the monitored data are naturally distributed among the numerous sensor nodes of the system. Therefore, the analysis of data must either happen in a central location after first collecting it from the sensors or locally through collaboration by viewing the problem through a distributed ML perspective. In both cases, concerns are risen regarding the requirements of this demanding task in matters of required network resources and achieved security/privacy. This paper proposes TermID, a distributed network intrusion detection system that is well suited for wireless networks. The system is based on classification rule induction and swarm intelligence principles to achieve efficient model training for intrusion detection purposes, without exchanging sensitive data. An additional achievement is that the produced model is easily readable by humans. While these are the main design principles of our approach, the accuracy of the produced model is not compromised by the distribution of the tasks and remains at competitive levels. Both the aforementioned claims are verified by the results of detailed experiments withheld with the use of a publicly available security-focused wireless dataset." .

We present and analyze new anti-sybil algorithms for establishing trusted identities, specifically, that guarantee, with high probability, that each honest device accepts a set of trusted and unforgeable identities that include all other honest devices and a bounded number of fake (sybil) identities.

A common type of application for wireless sensor networks is the event-driven reactive application, which requires reactive actions to be taken in response to events. In such applications, the interest is in the higher-level information described by complex event patterns, not in the raw sensory data of individual nodes. Although the central processing of information produces the most accurate results, it is not an energy-efficient method because it requires a continuous flow of raw sensor readings over the network. As communication operations are the most expensive in terms of energy usage, the distributed processing of information is indispensable for viable deployments of applications in wireless sensor networks. This method not only helps in reducing the total amount of packets transmitted in the network and the total energy consumed by the sensor nodes, but also produces scalable and fault-tolerant networks. For this purpose, we present two schemes that distribute information processing to appropriate nodes in the network. These schemes use reactive rules, which express relations between event patterns and actions, in order to capture reactive behavior. We also share the results of the performance of our algorithms and the simulations based on our approach that show the success of our methods in decreasing network traffic while still realizing the desired functionality." .

Most of the existing approaches assume that the nodes are dense enough and ignore the coverage holes which are very common in WSNs because of random deployment of the sensor nodes, block of obstacles, etc. Besides, predicting the target’s location of the next time instance is unwise because of the quite a lot random factors. In this paper, we propose a novel target tracking approach without any predicting, called k-nearest neighbors tracking (k-NNT), to tackle the problems of energy efficiency, continuity and coverage holes. In k-NNT, only the k-nearest neighbors keep active and track the target when more than k nodes can sense the target; the k′-nearest neighbors work when there are only k′ nodes (k′ < k) can sense the target. A sophisticated rotation mechanism is designed to improve the continuity of the tracking process. In the worst case, none of the nodes can sense the target, i.e., the target enters into the coverage holes, and then k-NNT recovers by the Round Up mode (RU mode). The nodes on the perimeter of the coverage hole always keep active for a time threshold t and sense the around environment to find the target in time. Once a node finds the target, the RU mode is over and the irrelevant nodes turn into inactive mode. A series of simulation show that k-NNT performs superiorly compared with several existing approaches in terms of tracking accuracy, continuity and energy efficiency." .

The core of the implemented UHF RFID reader is a software defined radio (SDR) that enables rapid prototyping and thus a fast verification of localization techniques. The localization is realized by a single input multiple output (SIMO) antenna configuration and the exploitation of phase difference of arrival (PDoA) techniques. The implemented PDoA techniques allow to estimate the direction and the range of a tag. A sensor fusion of direction and range estimates enables a two dimensional tag localization.

In addition, the reducing (H2S) and the oxidizing (O2, NO2, and SO2) gas sensing performances of these O2-assisted CuO NWs were compared with those of CuO NWs grown in static air. The response to the reducing H2S of the sensors based on CuO NWs grown using O2 at 40 sccm showed a higher electrical change and faster response and recovery times than the sensors based on CuO NWs grown using lower O2 flow rates, including the ones grown in static air and/or used for sensing oxidizing gases (O2, NO2, and SO2) did. On the basis of their growth and their gas-sensing applications, the possible mechanisms characteristic of the density-controlled CuO NWs grown using various O2 partial pressures are discussed." .

The RS codes are known to achieve better sum-rate than the SU codes. However, if the individual user’s reliability requirements are considered in a two-user Z-channel, it is unknown whether the RS codes achieve better performance than SU codes. To this end, the diversity gain region (DGR), which characterizes the diversity order tradeoff between the two users, is characterized for the Nakagami-m faded Z-channel. The DGRs for the RS codes under different operating modes such as altruistic and selfish modes are derived. The RS codes can operate in the altruistic mode for a large range of multiplexing gains compared to that of the SU codes. On the other hand, in the selfish mode, the SU codes achieve better DGR than the RS codes. Moreover, orthogonalization is shown to perform better than SU and RS codes-based interference-limited Z-channel for an only limited multiplexing gain region." .

The minimum detection limits of Myo, CK-MB and cTn I were experimentally found out to be as low as 6, 20 and 50 fg/ml respectively. No response was observed when the nanofibers were exposed to a non-specific protein, demonstrating excellent specificity to the targeted detection.

The biological concept of regenerative endodontics involves the triad of stem cells, scaffold, and signaling molecules. In preclinical studies, researchers are looking for mesenchymal stem cells not only capable of differentiating into odontoblast-like cells but also highly angiogenic/vasculogenic and neurogenic for complete pulp regeneration. Tremendous efforts are also dedicated to search for three-dimensional biomimetic scaffolds to enhance stem cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation as well as tissue structure support.

For B2B systems, emerging ‘product-service’ offerings are requiring greater visibility, alignment and integration across an increasingly complex network of multiple partners and collaborators, in order to deliver a better service and customer ‘experience’. To support the design and operation of these multi-organisational service networks, we outline a concept of operations architecture here, underpinned by the literature and network theory, and demonstrate application using a series of exemplar case studies. Focusing on relational elements and the processes key to network integration within service supply networks, the cases inform a set of operating principles and protocols—applicable to all stakeholders ‘cooperating’, within a ‘shared’ environment. Equally critical is to understand how digital technologies may influence future operating philosophies. This article extends our theoretical understanding of network organisations, from a traditional ‘product’ perspective to that of ‘services’, and presents the case for developing a common, unified approach to designing diverse forms of multi-partner service networks." .

The multi-frequency AOM was developed with phased array-type transducers, achieving a wider bandwidth of over 160 MHz. The design consisted of a simultaneous three beams generation with interlace scan to avoid the beat effect by adjacent Doppler-shifted beams, which consequently attained the fastest recording speed of 5.0 mm/s compared with 2.0–3.0 mm/s of existing systems in those days. Furthermore, a couple of critical parameters of the multi-frequency AOM are studied, for example, a treatment of third-order intermodulation and also beat effect in connection with photosensitive media. As a result, the necessity of interlaces scanning to obtain good image quality without beat effect and also to allow a lower laser power to apply is proposed." .

This is one of the major reasons that GLONASS could hardly reach the orbit precision of GPS, both in terms of consistency among individual International GNSS Service (IGS) analysis centers and discontinuity at the overlapping day boundaries. Based on the fact that the GLONASS phase IFB is similar on L1 and L2 bands in unit of length and is a linear function of the frequency number, several approaches have been developed to estimate and calibrate the IFB for integer ambiguity resolution. However, they are only for short and medium baselines. In this study, a new ambiguity resolution approach is developed for GLONASS global networks. In the approach, the phase ambiguities in the ionosphere-free linear combination are directly transformed with a wavelength of about 5.3 cm, according to the special frequency relationship of GLONASS L1 and L2 signals. After such transformation, the phase IFB rate can be estimated and corrected precisely and then the corresponding double-differenced ambiguities can be directly fixed to integers even for baselines up to several thousand kilometers. To evaluate this approach, experimental validations using one-month data of a global network with 140 IGS stations was carried out for GLONASS precise orbit determination. The results show that the GLONASS double-difference ambiguity resolution for long baselines could be achieved with an average fixing-rate of 91.4 %. Applying the fixed ambiguities as constraints, the GLONASS orbit overlapping RMS at the day boundaries could be reduced by 37.2 % in ideal cases and with an averaged reduction of about 21.4 %, which is comparable with that by the GPS ambiguity resolution. The orbit improvement is also confirmed by the better agreement with the independent satellite laser ranging observations." .

The closed form expressions are not available for the fractal antennas, so the use of artificial intelligence techniques for their design is appropriate. As the size reduction in rectenna systems used in wireless devices is a significant research domain to meet the demand for reduced size handheld devices, so the geometry of the antenna is selected to achieve this objective and a size reduction of 34.39 % is attained.

The structural studies are correlated with microwave dielectric properties of BZT. The maximum values of dielectric constant ϵ r = 30, Q × f 0 = 102 THz and near zero temperature coefficient of resonance frequency were obtained for BZT ceramics sintered at the temperature of 1550 °C for 4 h. The measured results are used to design a tapered transition from air filled waveguide to narrow (reduced width and height) dielectric filled waveguide using Heckens linear taper at a specific frequency. The simulation result shows that the lower reflection loss is obtained for the tapered transition of the narrow BZT window as compared to the standard waveguide BZT window. The return loss of –34 dB is obtained for S-band waveguide window with a bandwidth of 675 MHz. The return loss observed in the narrow BZT window is –46 dB with a bandwidth of 570 MHz at a center frequency of 3.63 GHz.

In this paper, we study the secure and efficient ECC speeding up algorithms for fast authentication in wireless sensor networks. We propose two fast algorithms based on constrained triple base number system to improve the efficiency for situations with and without precomputations. These new algorithms combine the sparsity of constrained TBNS with Yao algorithm to reduce the cost of scalar multiplication. Several experiments have been conducted using Magma software to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms. Our experiments show that the two algorithms are more efficient than existing algorithms. Furthermore, the improvement of efficiency will reduce the energy consumption and thus prolong the network lifetime due to the decrease of computation overhead in signature verification." .

It provides a living area for six astronauts and also represents a laboratory in which scientific experiments are conducted in an extraordinary environment. The deployed sensor technology contributes significantly to the operational and scientific success of the station. The sensors on board the ISS can be thereby classified into two categories which differ significantly in their key features: (1) sensors related to crew and station health, and (2) sensors to provide specific measurements in research facilities. The operation of the station requires robust, long-term stable and reliable sensors, since they assure the survival of the astronauts and the intactness of the station. Recently, a wireless sensor network for measuring environmental parameters like temperature, pressure, and humidity was established and its function could be successfully verified over several months. Such a network enhances the operational reliability and stability for monitoring these critical parameters compared to single sensors. The sensors which are implemented into the research facilities have to fulfil other objectives. The high performance of the scientific experiments that are conducted in different research facilities on-board demands the perfect embedding of the sensor in the respective instrumental setup which forms the complete measurement chain. It is shown that the performance of the single sensor alone does not determine the success of the measurement task; moreover, the synergy between different sensors and actuators as well as appropriate sample taking, followed by an appropriate sample preparation play an essential role. The application in a space environment adds additional challenges to the sensor technology, for example the necessity for miniaturisation, automation, reliability, and long-term operation. An alternative is the repetitive calibration of the sensors. This approach, however, increases the operational overhead significantly. But meeting especially these requirements offers unique opportunities for testing these sensor technologies in harsh and dedicated environments which are not available on Earth, therefore pushing the related technologies and methodologies to their limits. The scientific objectives for selected experiments, representing a wide range of research fields, are presented, including the instrument setups and the implemented sensor technologies, and where available, the first scientific results are presented." .

When conventional integrators are utilized to reject such high frequency and narrow-band disturbance, the benefits are quite small despite their acceptable capabilities to reject atmospheric turbulence. In our case, two suits of complete adaptive optics systems called double overlapped adaptive optics systems (DOAOS) are used to counteract both optical jitters and atmospheric turbulence. A novel algorithm aiming to remove vibrations is proposed by resorting to combine the Smith predictor and notch filer. With the help of loop shaping method, the algorithm will lead to an effective and stable controller, which makes the characteristics of error transfer function close to notch filters. On the basis of the spectral analysis of observed data, the peak frequency and bandwidth of vibrations can be identified in advance. Afterwards, the number of notch filters and their parameters will be determined using coordination descending method. The relationship between controller parameters and filtering features is discussed, and the robustness of the controller against varying parameters of the control object is investigated. Preliminary experiments are carried out to validate the proposed algorithms. The overall control performance of DOAOS is simulated. Results show that time delays are a limit of the performance, but the algorithm can be successfully implemented on our systems, which indicate that it has a great potential to reject jitters." .

The unit cell of the MMA consists of three different sizes of electric split ring resonators (eSRRs) and continuous metal film separated by only 1 mm dielectric substrate. The single-band MMA of this structure is firstly investigated. Then, by tuning the scale factor of the unit cells, the proposed triple-band MMA achieves absorption peaks at 9.85 GHz, 13.05 GHz and 14.93 GHz, respectively. Electric field distributions at three resonant frequencies are investigated to qualitatively analyze the loss mechanism. The further simulated and experimental results indicate that the proposed MMA is also polarization- and incident angle-independent. Finally, the interference theory is introduced to quantitatively analyze the MMA, which provides good insight into the physics behind the absorbing structure. To calculate the absorption rates accurately, we employ a simulation strategy make the near-field coupling between two metallic layers get back (compensation method). The measured absorption spectra show an excellent agreement with the theoretical calculation and simulation results. Therefore, the explanation to the physical mechanism of the triple-band MMA is presented and verified." .

We focus on accurate detection of GPS jammers in the frequency domain where fast Fourier transform (FFT) is predominantly used. An innovative high-resolution frequency estimation method to accurately detect single and multiple in-band continuous-wave jamming signals transmitted at very close-by frequencies is proposed. The proposed method utilizes orthogonal search that provides robust nonlinear spectral estimation to detect dominant jammer frequencies. The Spirent GSS 6700 GPS simulator was utilized in this study to generate several cases for the GPS L1 signal. The output of the GSS 6700 was acquired using the Novatel FireHose GPS frontend receiver that digitizes and down-converts the signal into in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) samples. The results demonstrated its capabilities of simultaneously detecting more than one GPS jammer existing at close-by frequencies. It is also shown that jammer frequency estimates obtained for a single jammer are more accurate than those obtained by FFT. Furthermore, FOS yields more accurate results than FFT at considerably smaller window sizes." .

With such a scheme, the room, which is fully coverage by light, is divided into several microcells according to the layout of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the directionality of light arises new challenges in keeping the connectivity between the mobile devices and light source under the mobile circumstances. The simplest solution is that all LEDs broadcast data of every user simultaneously, but it wastes too much bandwidth resource, especially when the amount of users increases. To solve this key problem, we utilize the optical positioning assisting handover procedure in this paper. In the positioning stage, the network manager obtains the location information of user device via downlink and uplink signal strength information, which is white light and infrared, respectively. After that, a Kalman filter is utilized for improving the tracking performance of a mobile device. Then, the network manager decides how to initiate the handover process by the previous information. Results show that the proposed scheme can achieve low-cost, seamless data communication, and a high probability of successful handover." .

The developed optical manipulation tool allows for programmable transport routing of NPs to around, surround or impact on objects in the host environment. An additional advantage is that the proposed confinement mechanism works for off-resonant but also resonant NPs paving the way for transport with simultaneous heating, which is of interest for targeted drug delivery and nanolithography.

Furthermore, in order to amplify the CCD signals to proper amplitude, an extra variable-gain amplifier (VGA) circuit is also necessary for providing gain. In traditional works, for conciseness and efficiency, those separated CDS and VGA circuits are combined together into a single circuit. However, such a CDS circuit with embedded VGA can provide only several different gain values and 12-bit sampling resolution at most, which cannot meet the increasing demands from the users. Hence, for this reason, a new CDS circuit with embedded VGA has been proposed in this paper. This new CDS circuit has five advantages: high resolution of VGA-gain programming (512 different gain values), wide span of VGA-gain range (0–18 dB), good linearity of VGA-gain curve (linear-in-dB), fast sampling rate (80 MHz), and high sampling resolution (14-bit). Furthermore, this new CDS circuit can automatically convert “single-ended input signal” into “dual-ended output signal,” facilitating subsequent signal processing.

One of the basic requirements of IoT is the global communication connectivity between smart objects. LTE-A has been considered as the main communication channel for connecting devices. For this reason, the machine-type communication (MTC) has been defined in the 3GPP LTE-A specification. With the rapid growth of the IoT devices, MTC in LTE-A faces many challenges. The primary design of a LTE-A network is to support the human-type communication (HTC). However, MTC and HTC have different characteristics, such as packet size, traffic arrival rate, and delay tolerance. How to accommodate a large amount of MTC traffic without affecting the grade of service of the HTC is challenging. More specifically, before accessing the LTE-A network, a random access (RA) procedure needs to be performed by a device to synchronize in the uplink of an eNB. Since the number of MTC devices is expected to be much greater than the HTC devices, without suitable access control, the success rate of the RA requests from the HTC devices can be significantly degraded. Therefore, this research aims to design an appropriate RA procedure to relieve this problem. The authors propose an Adaptive RACH Resource Allocation (ARRA) which integrates several control schemes, including a Resource Allocation scheme, an Access Class Barring scheme, and a Priority Device Setting scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed ARRA is able to achieve a higher access success rate and a lower latency for HTC devices while providing a different quality of service to different types of MTC devices." .

A timely example includes the auctioning off of radio spectrum by licensed primary users to unlicensed secondary users. A licensed primary user may not use the spectrum all of the time, but may not know in advance whether or not he will need the spectrum himself and thus whether or not he will have spectrum bandwidth available to rent out. We consider two types of auctions: an ex-post auction which takes place after each seller learns about the availability of the good and an ex-ante auction which takes place before each seller learns about availability. The expected payoffs to buyers, sellers, and to society are then compared. The ex-ante auction can cause buyers to bid on multiple expected units to ensure that they end up with at least one actual unit. Such over purchasing can create a loss to society. Sellers will prefer the ex-post auction since if fewer units are actually available to sell, then they can be sold at a higher price. Whereas in the ex-ante auction all sellers have one expected unit available to sell which results in a lower price. However, if high value buyers are common, then a buyer may prefer the ex-ante auction as it can be easier to win an expected unit than an ex-post actual unit. In contrast, if a buyer has a high valuation and if high value buyers are uncommon, then he may prefer the ex-post auction since he has a strong chance to win an actual unit." .

Trust evaluation is conducted in four stages viz., Direct, Indirect, Integrated and Overall trust and in each stage, suitable equations are suggested to measure the trust of each node. A novel technique based on fuzzy set theory is used to route the packet through the trusted channel. Hop count, reliability and capacity of the link are the parameters considered for constructing if-then rules and membership function. A qualitative reasoning is performed using inference mechanism and a defuzzication strategy is applied on the calculated trust value to make decision. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by varying the trust threshold and malicious nodes.

In the current study, we aimed not only to compare the osteogenic effects of BMSCs induced by ESW to those of TDSCs and ADSCs; but also to investigate the underlying mechanisms.

The enhancement of osteogenesis in these MSCs was consistently abolished when the cells were pretreated with one of the following conditions: overexpression of miR-138, FAK knockdown using specific siRNA, and U0126, implying that all of these elements are indispensable for mediating the effect of ESW. Moreover, our study provides converging genetic and molecular evidence that the miR-138-FAK-ERK1/2-RUNX2 machinery can be generally activated in ESW-preconditioned MSCs, suggesting that ESW may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the enhancement of osteogenesis of MSCs, regardless of their origins." .

Internet presence is a challenging issue that requires thorough analysis. A communications audit that makes competent assessment of a university’s Internet presence is necessary to ensure successful communication by universities on the Internet. This communications audit includes: assessment of Web site traffic of a university, assessment of user activity on the university’s social networking sites, assessment of frequency of mention of the university on expert and educational Web portals, and justification for the university’s presence in virtual cities and Web blogs. This research explores different techniques of assessment of universities’ Internet presence: content analysis, press clippings, and Internet services such as Google PR, Alexa Ranking, IQBuzz, and others. This research presents an analysis of several universities: Tomsk State University (Tomsk, Russia), Tomsk Polytechnic University (Tomsk, Russia), Moscow State University (Moscow, Russia), Harvard University (Massachusetts, USA), Oxford University (Oxford, England), and other universities. The technique developed for auditing a university’s communications includes an invariable component, which consists of assessment of universities’ Internet presence and their exposure in scientific and educational portals and analysis of their social media profiles, and a variable component, which is determined by the researcher and depends on the objective of the audit." .

In this work, an automatic method to design lossless matching networks driven by an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that considers the sensitivities of the network parameters during the synthesis process is presented. To this end, a closed-form expression for the transducer power gain (TPG) sensitivity with respect to the component values is employed in such a way that the effects of the components tolerance on the matching network performance can easily be quantified. A 3D data structure based on the adjacency matrix is conveniently used to represent any type of network topologies. The proposed EA employs a novel set of topology variation operators, tailored for changing the circuit topology, and an association step, with the aim of reducing the number of nodes of the matching circuit. The efficiency of the proposed EA is tested in the synthesis of an impedance matching network for a VHF monopole whip antenna. This study’s results indicate a matching bandwidth improvement, a more uniformly distributed TPG along the operation frequency band and a more stable TPG regarding the components tolerance compared to the results obtained by previous approaches." .

Along with the increase in WSN indoor applications, indoor localization has become a hot research topic and many localization algorithms have been studied. Among these algorithms, the localization method based on compressive sensing theory emerges as a popular approach to indoor localization. In this approach, the nodes are sparse when compared to the number of grids utilized to represent the locations of the nodes, so the locations are considered as sparse signal and can be reconstructed using the compressive sensing techniques. The localization problem is formulated as the sparse reconstruction of sparsifying matrix which is comprised of measurement of received signal at grids. In order to improve the localization accuracy and meet the real-time requirement of localization applications in large indoor area, an indoor localization algorithm based on dynamic measurement compressive sensing for wireless sensor networks is proposed. Using the bounding-box method, we firstly identify a potential area that possesses the independent features. Instead of using the entire node deployment region as the measurement area, our method can decrease the number of meshing and also the dimension of measurement matrix. Meanwhile, we assume that only the anchor nodes which have communication relationship with the unknown nodes can be used as the measuring nodes; the measurement matrix of unknown nodes which need to be localized can be dynamically constructed according to the potential area and the received anchor node information, and the maximum number of measurement is decided by the number of grids of potential area. The proposed algorithm can mitigate the measurement redundancy and improve the real-time feature. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the time complexity and also maintain good localization accuracy and localization efficiency." .

Here we show that co-administration of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) with glucose enhances exon-skipping activity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mdx mice. We identify a glucose–fructose (GF) formulation that potentiates PMO activity, completely corrects aberrant Dmd transcripts, restores dystrophin levels in skeletal muscles and achieves functional rescue without detectable toxicity. This activity is attributed to enhancement of GF-mediated PMO uptake in the muscle. We demonstrate that PMO cellular uptake is energy dependent, and that ATP from GF metabolism contributes to enhanced cellular uptake of PMO in the muscle. Collectively, we show that GF potentiates PMO activity by replenishing cellular energy stores under energy-deficient conditions in mdx mice. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into hexose-mediated oligonucleotide delivery and have important implications for the development of DMD exon-skipping therapy." .

The goal of these efforts was to monitor the reference point of the Onsala 20 m radio telescope during normal telescope operations. Parts of the local site network as well as a number of reflectors that were mounted on the 20 m radio telescope were observed in an automated and continual way using the in-house-developed software package HEIMDALL. The analysis of the observed data was performed using a new concept for a coordinate-based network adjustment to allow the full adjustment process in a true Cartesian global reference frame. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to select the preferable functional model for the network adjustment. The comprehensive stochastic model of this network adjustment process considers over 25 parameters, and, to describe the persistence of the observations performed during the monitoring with a very high measurement frequency, includes also time-dependent covariances. In total 15 individual solutions for the radio telescope reference point were derived, based on monitoring observations during the normal operation of the radio telescope. Since the radio telescope was moving continually, the influence of timing errors was studied and considered in the adjustment process. Finally, recursive filter techniques were introduced to combine the 15 individual solutions. Accuracies at the sub-millimeter level could be achieved for the radio telescope reference point. Thus, the presented monitoring concept fulfills the requirement proposed by the global geodetic observing system." .

Photosensitizers such as the small cationic molecule EtNBS (5-ethylamino-9-diethyl-aminobenzo[a]phenothiazinium chloride) have proven potent against cancer cells that reside within acidic and hypoxic tumour microenvironments. At higher doses, however, these photosensitizers induce “dark toxicity” through light-independent mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the use of nanoparticle encapsulation to overcome this limitation. Interestingly, encapsulation of the compound within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (PLGA-EtNBS) was found to significantly reduce EtNBS dark toxicity while completely retaining the molecule’s cytotoxicity in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This dual effect can be attributed to the mechanism of release: EtNBS remains encapsulated until external light irradiation, which stimulates an oxygen-independent, radical-mediated process that degrades the PLGA nanoparticles and releases the molecule. As these PLGA-encapsulated EtNBS nanoparticles are capable of penetrating deeply into the hypoxic and acidic cores of 3D spheroid cultures, they may enable the safe and efficacious treatment of otherwise unresponsive tumour regions." .

This work presents a method of P2P Bot detection based on an adaptive multilayer feed-forward neural network in cooperation with decision trees. A classification and regression tree is applied as a feature selection technique to select relevant features. With these features, a multilayer feed-forward neural network training model is created using a resilient back-propagation learning algorithm. A comparison of feature set selection based on the decision tree, principal component analysis and the ReliefF algorithm indicated that the neural network model with features selection based on decision tree has a better identification accuracy along with lower rates of false positives. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by conducting experiments on real network traffic datasets.

This excessive collagen deposition, which is seen in aged and diseased muscle5,6,7, interferes with muscle function and limits the effectiveness of gene- and cell-based therapies for muscle disorders8,9. Although compelling evidence exists for the role of PDGFRα in fibrosis, little is known about the cells through which this pathway acts. Here we show in mice that PDGFRα signalling regulates a population of muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) that play a supportive role in muscle regeneration but may also cause fibrosis when aberrantly regulated10,11,12,13. We found that FAPs produce multiple transcriptional variants of Pdgfra with different polyadenylation sites, including an intronic variant that codes for a protein isoform containing a truncated kinase domain. This variant, upregulated during regeneration, acts as a decoy to inhibit PDGF signalling and to prevent FAP over-activation. Moreover, increasing the expression of this isoform limits fibrosis in vivo in mice, suggesting both biological relevance and therapeutic potential of modulating polyadenylation patterns in stem-cell populations." .

We identify efficiency maxima that originate from resonant absorption of photons through the HE11 and the HE12 waveguide modes in the top cell.

This paper presents a computational model of information aggregation in such settings in which agents’ utilities depend on an unknown event. Agents initially receive a noisy signal about the event and take actions repeatedly while observing the actions of their neighbors in the network at each round. Such settings characterize many distributed systems such as sensor networks for intrusion detection and routing systems for Internet traffic. Using the model, we show that (1) agents converge in action and in knowledge for a general class of decision-making rules and for all network structures; (2) all networks converge to playing the same action regardless of the network structure; and (3) for particular network configurations, agents can converge to the correct action when using a well-defined class of myopic decision rules.

The proposed method provides an effective approach to reducing the significant phase mismatch and obtaining more accurate carrier phase measurements in applications where high dynamics or long integration intervals may influence the tracking performance of the GNSS receivers." .

The unit cell of the proposed absorber consists of closed-ring resonator with a metallic patch inside it, and the two are diagonally connected by a metallic arm. The unit cell of the proposed absorber fits in a volume of 6 × 6 × 1.6 mm3. The C-band absorber is having peak absorptivities of 95.7, 99, and 98.9 % at 4.69, 5.19, and 7.15 GHz, respectively. The two lower resonances are overlapped and provide the wide full width at half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of 1.08 GHz. Another obtained band in the C-band region is having FWHM of 1.05 GHz. For X-band absorber, the peak absorptivity of 99.81 and 99.77 % is obtained at 8.94 and 10.68 GHz, and broad FWHM absorption bandwidth of 3.69 GHz is achieved. The simulated results are verified with the experimental results and found in close agreement. The proposed absorber shows identical absorption characteristics for TE- and TM-polarized wave and working well up to an incident angle of 45°.

Each device encapsulated as a real-world service which provides functionality and exchanges information with other devices. This large-scale information exchange results in new interactions between things and people. Unlike traditional web services, internet of services is highly dynamic and continuously changing due to constant degrade, vanish and possibly reappear of the devices, this opens a new challenge in the process of resource discovery and selection. In response to increasing numbers of services in the discovery and selection process, there is a corresponding increase in number of service consumers and consequent diversity of quality of service (QoS) available. Increase in both sides’ leads to the diversity in the demand and supply of services, which would result in the partial match of the requirements and offers. This paper proposed an IoT service ranking and selection algorithm by considering multiple QoS requirements and allowing partially matched services to be counted as a candidate for the selection process. One of the applications of IoT sensory data that attracts many researchers is transportation especially emergency and accident services which is used as a case study in this paper. Experimental results from real-world services showed that the proposed method achieved significant improvement in the accuracy and performance in the selection process." .

However, very high levels of vector expression may be necessary for the treatment of conditions such as Stargardt disease where a dual vector approach is potentially needed, or in optogenetic strategies for end-stage degeneration in order to achieve maximal light sensitivity. In this study, we assessed two vectors with single capsid mutations, rAAV2/2(Y444F) and rAAV2/8(Y733F) in their ability to transduce retina in the Abca4−/− and rd1 mouse models of retinal degeneration. We noted significantly increased photoreceptor transduction using rAAV2/8(Y733F) in the Abca4−/− mouse, in contrast to previous work where vectors tested in this model have shown low levels of photoreceptor transduction. Bipolar cell transduction was achieved following subretinal delivery of both vectors in the rd1 mouse, and via intravitreal delivery of rAAV2/2(Y444F). The successful use of rAAV2/8(Y733F) to target bipolar cells was further validated on human tissue using an ex vivo culture system of retinal explants. Capsid mutant AAV vectors transduce human retinal cells and may be particularly suited to treat retinal degenerations in which high levels of transgene expression are required." .

With regard to ad hoc networks, this paper presents an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and an ant colony algorithm (ACA) to serve as the basis for a QoS multicast routing algorithm (EA-ACA-QMRA). This algorithm combines the rapid global search capability and robustness of EAs with the pheromone feedback factors of ACAs while accounting for multiple constraints, including constraints related to delay, delay jitter, packet delivery ratio, bandwidth and cost. For the case of self-adapting ad hoc networks in particular, our new algorithm is far superior to traditional ACAs. Our experimental results show that the EA-ACA-QMRA can address multiple constraints in the QoS multicast routing problem and can achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence than can traditional ACAs in terms of the end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio. The proposed algorithm provides an effective means of solving the QoS multicast routing problem for ad hoc networks, and it is better than the traditional methods at avoiding network congestion." .

In the limit of ρ → 1 the blocks of the partition are squared, the connections amont the blocks are short range, the LN is more regular and the relation l ∝ √N is observed. For the limit ρ → 0 the blocks are strongly asymmetric, long range connections appear, and the topologic distance follows l ∝ (log N) α , a weak small world phenomenon. For any network size we calculate analytically the size of the minimum distance l min (ρ → 0) and the maximal distance l max (ρ → 1). The distance in the weak small world regime is calculated using the number of vertices inside a radius of length l and taking into account the network average connectivity and the exponent α." .

The bandwidth and front-to-back ratio tunability is accomplished by altering the complex conductivity of graphene controlled by chemical potential. For verification, a 2-THz FIQYA using both perfect electric conductor (PEC) and graphene with two different controllable chemical potentials (μ c1 and μ c2) is simulated.

The aim of this study was to design a usability assessment method and assess the usability of communication devices in elderly Malaysians. This cross-sectional study was conducted on elderly Malaysians (aged 55–74 years old). A questionnaire was developed to assess the usability issues of mobile phones (MP), home telephones (HT) and Internet/E-mail (I/E) usage. A total of 303 elderly subjects (148 males and 155 females) from urban and rural areas in the state of Selangor participated in this study based on stratified random sampling. I usage was found to be 10 % while the usage of MP and HT were 73 and 50 %, respectively. The main concern of the participants was the “durability of the devices” followed by “ease of use” in MP and “ergonomic features” in HT. Factor analysis was carried out to identify the number of latent factors for MP and HT. The relative weights for the extracted factors were then evaluated by six experts using the GAHP technique. “Adjustability to user needs and abilities” for MP and “ease of operation” for HT was weighted most. A total of ten products including 6 MPs and 4 HTs were assessed by five elderly subjects. The usability index for each MP and HT family of products was then obtained by TOPSIS which was used to select the best product. None of the four common designs of HT complied with the usability factors indicating that the design of current HT products is unsuitable for the elderly, for communication. Moreover, this study revealed that the low usage of I/E might be due to inappropriate design and lack of knowledge. However, the design of communication products should be based on the identified weighted factors to provide more usable products for the elderly population." .

Since the scheduling algorithm does not perform high-load operations such as time stamping and sorting, it can be implemented easily and is suitable for resource-limited WSNs.

The design of wireless networking is challenging due to the highly dynamic environmental condition that makes parameter optimization a complex task. Due to the dynamic, and often unknown, operating conditions, modern wireless networking standards increasingly rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a well-established framework for implementing artificial intelligence tasks such as classification, learning, and optimization. GAs are well known for their remarkable generality and versatility and have been applied in a wide variety of settings in wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the applications of GAs in wireless networks. We provide both an exposition of common GA models and configuration and provide a broad-ranging survey of GA techniques in wireless networks. We also point out open research issues and define potential future work. While various surveys on GAs exist in the literature, our paper is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, which focuses on their application in wireless networks." .

Specifically, we study synchronization and entrainment in networks of heterogeneous RvdP oscillators and contrast the effects of diffusive linear coupling strategies with the nonlinear Haken–Kelso–Bunz coupling, originally introduced to study human bimanual experiments. We show how convergence of the error among the nodes’ trajectories toward a bounded region is possible with both linear and nonlinear coupling functions.

The variable-gain amplifier proposed here consists of an exponential control block, a current squarer and an amplifier block with both input and load degeneration. With the help of current squarer which gets square function of the output current from exponential control block, the VGA achieves the maximum linear gain range in single stage. Current squarer is proposed, which is designed with compensation technique to minimize the second-order effect caused by carrier mobility reduction in short channel MOSFET. To avoid the poor linearity performance of the $$g_{{m}}$$ gm -ratio amplifiers, the distortion is analyzed and the linearity is improved by applying input and load degenerating technique. At the same power consumption, the input 1 dB compression point can be improved by nearly 8.78 dB. Simulation results show that the VGA can provide a gain variation range of 64.09 dB (from $$-35.59$$ -35.59 to 28.5 dB) with a 3-dB bandwidth from 47 to 640 MHz.

One of the most important challenges in MIMO communication is combating MIMO multipath channel. MIMO blind equalizers and channel estimators combat MIMO multipath channels without the use of training or pilot sequences. First, the multipath channel is converted into instantaneous mixture channel (IMC), using second-order statistics of the data. Then using higher-order statistics, these mixtures are separated. However, proper selection of IMC is a major challenge. In this paper, a novel blind algorithm for choosing the best IMC is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on the cumulant value of the received signal." .

However, many applications fail to realize their full potential because of limitations in current location technologies. Current frameworks work well outdoors but fare poorly indoors. In this paper, we present LoCo, a new framework that can provide highly accurate room-level indoor location. LoCo does not require users to carry specialized location hardware—it uses radios that are present in most contemporary devices and, combined with a boosting classification technique, provides a significant runtime performance improvement. We provide experiments that show the combined radio technique can achieve accuracy that improves on current state-of-the-art Wi-Fi-only techniques. LoCo is designed to be easily deployed within an environment and readily leveraged by application developers. We believe LoCo’s high accuracy and accessibility can drive a new wave of location-driven applications and services." .

These results emphasize the necessity to explore effective approaches for enhancement of AAV transduction. Initially, we found that incubation of all AAV vectors with human serum enhanced AAV transduction. Complementary analytical experiments demonstrated that human serum albumin (HSA) directly interacted with the AAV capsid and augmented AAV transduction. The enhanced transduction was observed with clinical grade HSA. Mechanistic studies suggest that HSA increases AAV binding to target cells, and that the interaction of HSA with AAV does not interfere with the AAV infection pathway. Importantly, HSA incubation during vector dialysis also increased transduction. Finally, HSA enhancement of AAV transduction in a model of hemophilia B displayed greater than a fivefold increase in vector-derived circulating FIX, which improved the bleeding phenotype correction. In conclusion, incubation of HSA with AAV vectors supports a universal augmentation of AAV transduction and, more importantly, this approach can be immediately transitioned to the clinic for the treatment of hemophilia and other diseases." .

Two workload models are commonly used to allow VPN clients to specify the communication capacity they need, the hose and the pipe workload models. As opposed to the pipe model, where bandwidth needs between every pair of endpoints must be specified as a matrix, the hose model has the advantage of simple specification where only one ingress and egress bandwidths per hose endpoint are specified. However, the tree bandwidth costs obtained with the hose workload model are higher by a factor of as much as 2.5 compared to those obtained with pipe workloads Duffield et al. (SIGCOMM Comput Commun Rev 29(4):95108, 1999). In this work, we propose a two-step exact approach to design a VPN tree with minimum bandwidth cost. The first step derives a pipe workload from the user specified hose workload using an exact algorithm. The second step formulates the pipe-based VPN tree bandwidth minimization as a 0–1 integer linear program, which is solved using the exact approach proposed in Thabti et al. (1–6, 2012). The bandwidth costs of VPN trees obtained using this two-step approach are lower by a factor varying between 1.31 and 2.23 compared to VPN trees obtained using the original hose workload. Furthermore, we show that tree solutions obtained using the derived pipe workload satisfy the original hose workload." .

A review of the specific operating conditions for the UHF RFID link is given and associated privacy issues are addressed. We introduce a low-complexity approach to safeguard the privacy of passengers.

This is the first reported utilization of the fluorescence of OPD oxidation product catalyzed by HRP for immunoassay. Optimization of conditions afforded a low detection limit of 0.5 pg/mL (3σ) for p24 with a linear range of 1.4–90.0 pg/mL.

The assay can be completed in less than 90 min. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied to detect p24 in spiked serum. This method overcomes the interference of MBs to the fluorescence signal and demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection of p24 than conventional ELISA kits.

Moreover, based on the investigation on the adsorption kinetics and the effect of pH value on MB adsorption, we propose a two-step adsorption kinetics for PGO, which involved in two interactions between MB molecular and porous graphene oxide-based carbon: electrostatic force and π-π stacking. Besides, the calculation of the activation energies indicates that chemisorption dominates the adsorption for PGO in comparison with physisorption for three-dimensional porous graphene materials which has low adsorption capacity because of the removal of functional groups.

Although its deterministic and randomized communication complexity were settled decades ago, we find several new things to say about the problem by focusing on three subtle aspects. The first is to consider the expected communication cost (at a worst-case input) for a protocol that uses limited interaction—i.e., a bounded number of rounds of communication—and whose error probability is zero or close to it. The second is to treat the false negative error rate separately from the false positive error rate. The third is to consider the information cost of such protocols. We obtain asymptotically optimal rounds-versus-cost tradeoffs for equality: both expected communication complexity and information complexity scale as $$\\Theta ({{\\mathrm{ilog}}}^{r-1} n)$$ Θ(ilogr-1n) , where r is the number of rounds and $${{\\mathrm{ilog}}}^k n = \\log \\log \\cdots \\log n$$ ilogkn=loglog⋯logn , with k logs. These bounds hold even when the false negative rate approaches 1. For the case of zero-error communication cost, we obtain essentially matching bounds, up to a tiny additive constant. We also provide some applications. As an application of our information cost bounds, we obtain new bounded-round randomized lower bounds for the Intersection problem, in which there are two players who hold subsets $$S,T \\subseteq [n]$$ S,T⊆[n] . In many realistic scenarios, the sizes of S and T are significantly smaller than n, so we impose the constraint that $$|S|, |T| \\le k$$ |S|,|T|≤k . We study the minimum number of bits the parties need to communicate in order to compute the entire intersection set $$S \\cap T$$ S∩T , using r rounds. We show that any r-round protocol has information cost (and thus communication cost) $$\\Omega (k {{\\mathrm{ilog}}}^r k)$$ Ω(kilogrk) bits. We also give an O(r)-round protocol achieving $$O(k{{\\mathrm{ilog}}}^r k)$$ O(kilogrk) bits, which for $$r = \\log ^* k$$ r=log∗k gives a protocol with O(k) bits of communication. This is in contrast to other basic problems such as computing the union or symmetric difference, for which $$\\Omega (k\\log (n/k))$$ Ω(klog(n/k)) bits of communication is required for any number of rounds." .

However, the tracking error in one channel may corrupt other channels and lead to an increasing degradation in the tracking performance. An adaptive GPS vector tracking loop with the detection and isolation of contaminated channels is proposed to suppress the propagation of tracking error and to make the vector-based receiver less vulnerable in poor signal quality environments resulting from signal attenuation, interference and jamming. The vectorial transfer function models and the noise bandwidths of both the vector frequency lock loop and the vector delay lock loop are established to accurately calculate bandwidths and optimally design parameters for VTL. The autonomous fault detection algorithm based on uniformly most powerful test for VTL is designed to detect and isolate contaminated channels (with large tracking error due to the poor signal quality) by monitoring the bandwidth statistics of all tracking loops. The results of trials in harsh situations show that the proposed adaptive VTL is superior to baseline VTL, allowing the accuracy, the availability and the reliability of the vector-based receiver to be improved. In conclusion, the proposed adaptive VTL with the detection and isolation of contaminated channels is a powerful method for applications in GPS-challenged environments." .

Two kinds of nanowires with different boundary conditions are discussed. It is demonstrated that the new continuum theory can predict the buckling behavior of nanowires very well. Similar to the prediction of the classical elasticity theory, the critical compressive load of axial buckling of nanowires predicted by the new continuum theory increases with an increasing characteristic length, such as the diameter or height of nanowires. With the same aspect ratio, a nanowire with a rectangular cross section possesses a larger critical buckling load than that with a circular one. However, the surface effect could enhance the critical buckling load not only for a fixed–fixed nanowire but also for a cantilevered one in contrast to the classical elastic model. All the results predicted by the new continuum theory agree well with predictions by the surface elasticity models. The present research not only verifies the validation of the new continuum theory, but also gives a much more convenient characterization of buckling behaviors of nanowires. This should be helpful for the design of nanodevices based on nanomaterials, for example, nanobeams in NEMS or high-precision instruments." .

Postulated factors that affected the poor clinical outcomes include the lack of proper treatment controls and clinically relevant animal models. This failure of lab-to-clinic translation has plagued many neuroprotective drugs for stroke. With this in mind, the stem cell therapy field has cautiously approached translating stem cell products for clinical application, in that a negative clinical trial may hinder the entire regenerative medicine therapeutics.

In a mobile offloading system, cloud computing is utilized to complete some heavy tasks which are migrated from resource-constrained mobile devices to the Cloud. To assure system performance, the quality of the wireless network connection plays an important role. In previous work we experimentally explored the impact of packet loss and delay in wireless networks on the completion time of an offloading task. We investigated a local restart mechanism to mitigate these effects. In the presence of unreliable communication, once the waiting time for the response of a cloud server exceeds a given threshold, exploiting the local resources of a mobile client can accelerate the task completion. In this paper, we upgrade the restart mechanism by allowing several offloading retries before a job eventually is locally restarted and finally completed in the client device itself. This is an adaptive restart scheme which aims first at completing the job using restart with offloading. If several successive offloading attempts fail the job is completed locally. Adaptively selecting the right retry threshold and automatically restarting at the appropriate moment can balance out undesired effects. This paper extends Wang and Wolter (Proceedings of the 6th ACM/SPEC international conference on performance engineering. ACM, pp 3–13, 2015) by adding an adaptive retry scheme, a mathematical derivation of the optimal limit for offloading attempts so as to minimize the task completion time using a greedy method, and by the results of a practical evaluation study which shows the efficiency and benefits of the adaptive restart scheme." .

This information is sent to base station (BS), where, it is processed and analyzed by the underlying application. Functioning of WSN highly depend on the deployment strategy and the coordination among the sensor nodes. Preserving the energy is an important goal that must be considered when developing a routing protocol for WSNs. Radio communication in sensor nodes is highly expensive operation in terms of energy usage. Energy can be conserved in an efficient way with specifically customized routing techniques. Data aggregation methods when applied to sensor nodes, clusters are created where data generated from cluster members is aggregated. This kind of data collection strategy results into energy efficient communication. Integration of data aggregation and clustering approach is enabled through customized hierarchical routing strategies. Clustering technique is key to apply and exploit, the advantages in-network data processing offers. This paper compares various clustering protocols like LEACHC, K-means and its variants. The protocols are compared with respect to network lifetime, data delivery and energy consumption. These protocols only consider intra cluster distance of members while doing clustering, due to this non-uniform clusters are created. These kind of clusters do not deliver data periodically and uniformly from every corner of the field. A density control based approach is proposed which does balancing of cluster members assignment in a loose way. A loose density control (LDC) based approach is integrated with K-means clustering method. LDC based approach exhibits improved average data delivery per node, ensuring regular data availability from every corner of the deployment area as long as the nodes are alive. Not only it improves the amount of data delivered, it also improves the network lifetime considerably. This performance improvement is achieved with almost similar energy expenditure compared to other protocols." .

To provide better services, it is quite necessary for MISPs to analyze the information hidden in the big data stream generated by users. Therefore, processing the real-time big data stream efficiently has become increasingly important. However, traditional static data storage technology fails to meet the demands of real-time data processing. To improve processing capacity, many parallel processing structures are proposed, which brings up the problem about how the parallel devices can be scheduled to maximize their efficiency. Accordingly, a dynamic assignment scheduling algorithm for big data stream processing in mobile Internet services is proposed, and a stream query graph is built to calculate the weight of every edge. The edge with the minimum weight is selected to send tuples. Simulation results show that the proper number of the logic devices can dramatically reduce system response time. Furthermore, system context switching is reduced by increasing the number of tuples sent each time." .

In order to reduce this fraction, we propose a mathematical model to optimize on-chip memory configurations for minimal power. We exploit the power reduction effect of splitting memory into subunits with frequently accessed addresses mapped to small memories. The definition of an integer linear programming model enables us to solve the twofold problem of allocating an optimal set of memory instances with varying size on the one hand and finding an optimal mapping of application segments to allocated memories on the other hand. Experimental results yield power reductions of up to 82 % for instruction memory and 73 % for data memory.

Due to the severity of this disease, several methods have been devised for diagnostics. However, time-consuming, low sensitivity and expensiveness are major problems of those techniques. Recently, High Resolution Melting (HRM) has been developed and proven to be an effective method for DNA genotyping, mutation scanning and sequence matching. Hence, in this study a multiplex HRM has been developed aiming at detecting these two mutations concurrently. Methods:At first, a singleplex HRM was designed for each mutation. Then, conditions for these singleplex assay were combined and optimized again in order to get the optimal condition for multiplex HRM. Results:This method showed a promising potential with a high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, it is impractial to continue developing this method because of the lack of controls.

The literature does neither address how the factors, including the line-of-sight (LOS) jerk, the local oscillator error, and the measurement noise, impact on the performance of the KF. Furthermore, there is no the rule-of-thumb threshold for the KF up to now. We prove that the steady KF is equivalent to a 3rd-order PLL in the sense of the minimum covariance in the continuous KF form, which makes it possible to compare the KF and the PLL loops in terms of the equivalent bandwidth. The factors that impact the performance of the KF are further investigated by error budgeting and suboptimal analysis. The analysis results show that the oscillator error, the LOS jerk, and the measurement error affect the steady KF error significantly while the initial state covariance has little effect on the convergence of the KF. A rule-of-thumb threshold for the KF, which is determined by the root mean squares of the loop thermal noise and the dynamic stress noise, is presented by analyzing the counterpart for the PLL. Four KF tracking loops are designed upon the proposed rule-of-thumb analysis, which are further validated by the Monte Carlo simulations." .

Four doses of 106 MSC-Adsflt-1/MSC-AdV0 were administered to the model and therapeutic anti-angiogenic ability was analyzed by lesion size measurement, microvessel density, immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. Approximately 86% of transduced MSCs expressed and secreted sFlt-1. MSC-Adsflt-1-treated animals exhibited significant reduction (52.8±1.8%) in size of endometriotic lesions. We observed a 2.3-fold decrease in the number and a 10-fold decrease in the size of endometrial glands in MSC-Adsflt-1-treated animals. A two-fold decrease in stromal cell densities was also observed in MSC-Adsflt-1-treated animals compared with the MSC-AdV0 group.

However, instrument-based detection methods are usually more adequate for detecting small variations in the signal compared to naked-eye detection schemes, and consequently the limit of detection of the latter is usually higher than the former. Here, we demonstrate that the limit of detection of colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassays can be decreased several orders of magnitude when using naked-eye detection instead of a spectrophotometer for detecting the signal. The key step to lower the limit of detection is adding a small volume of chromogenic substrate during the signal generation step. This generates highly colored solutions that can be easily visualized with the naked eye and recorded with the camera of a mobile phone. The proposed method does not require expensive equipment or complex protocols to enhance the signal, and therefore it is a universal approach to lower the limit of detection of colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassays." .

In order to mitigate the error-propagation due to the erroneous decoding at the relay, a method is proposed for modelling the soft estimated symbols at the output of the soft encoder which is mathematically convenient to work with. The signal-to-noise ratios of the equivalent one-hop channels towards each end-node are derived.

The reflection loss of the single-layer and double-layer absorbers with different thicknesses and orders was investigated. The results show that double-layer absorbers have better microwave absorption properties than single-layer absorbers. The microwave absorption properties of the double-layer structure are influenced by the coupling interactions between the matching and absorption layers. As the pure ferrite used as matching layer and the composite of BF-5CI used as absorption, the minimum RL of absorber can achieve to −55.4 dB and the bandwidth of RL <−10 dB ranged from 5.6 to 10.8 GHz when the thicknesses of matching layer and absorption layer were 0.9 and 1.4 mm, respectively." .

The sensor nodes in a static UWASN may have link breakages due to adverse channel and environmental conditions. Thus, there is a need to develop a low cost, high quality, easily deployable and self configurable platform for UWASN that will automate information collection to reduce the latency through better coverage and connectivity, and utilize the resources efficiently. This paper proposes a deployment scheme based on 3D network architecture which consists of the following major components: (1) nodes for event detection (events like, antisubmarine, chemical spill, biological hazards, etc.), (2) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for collecting information and relaying to the surface gateways (SGs), and (3) multiple SGs on the surface of sea which are responsible for collecting the information from AUVs and nodes in its vicinity, and relaying to the control center. The proposed scheme employs mathematical models that are designed based on parameters associated with underwater channel characteristics. The use of multiple AUVs and SGs enhances the coverage area of the sensor nodes and network connectivity. AUVs patrol the areas where connectivity is likely to be poor due to channel conditions. These AUVs assist in overcoming interference problems, and also does the work on behalf of the drained sensor nodes until they are repaired. The scheme is simulated for analysis of area coverage, connectivity, resource requirement, and delays for various cases of AUVs route planning. Simulation results show better coverage, connectivity, resource utility as compared to purely distributed node deployment scheme based on connected dominating set based depth computation approach." .

The method can be considered as a two complementary steps. In the first step, the support of the adaptive filter shall be defined. In the second step, the angle between the sample under test and the interference fringe system generated by the utilized interferometer has to be determined. Thus, the support of the optical filter associated with the implementation of the adaptive spatial carrier frequency method is accordingly rotated. This method is experimentally verified by measuring optical properties of polypropylene (PP) fibre with the help of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. The results show that errors resulting from rotating the fibre with respect to the interference fringes of the interferometer are reduced compared with the traditional band pass filter method. This conclusion was driven by comparing results of the mean refractive index of drown PP fibre at parallel polarization direction obtained from the new and adaptive spatial carrier frequency method." .

Different scalable video layers prefer different protection degrees, and user equipments (UEs) in different locations experience different packet loss rates in wireless networks. Guaranteeing that all UEs experience a certain level of video quality is one of the biggest challenges in scalable video multicast. Using the number of satisfied UEs as a metric, the proposed efficient scalable video multicast based on network-coded cooperation (SVM-NC) scheme, combined with adaptive modulation and coding, enhances the attainable system performance under strict time and bandwidth resource constraints for guaranteed smooth playback. Various simulations were performed for performance evaluation. The proposed scheme ensures that the expected percentage of satisfied UEs approximately achieves the maximum number of UEs in a multicast group by using network-coded cooperation over dedicated relay-based cellular networks. In addition, the peak signal-to-noise ratio metric is asymptotic to the maximum performance of high-resolution video quality offered by service providers." .

One of such schemes is the adaptive bandwidth allocation technique. QoS is improved by minimizing the probability of dropping and blocking calls and by allocating channels, optimally. In this paper, reserved channel technique has been considered for High Altitude Platform (HAP) based communication services deployment. Such implementation is especially feasible in HAP as, on a single HAP, multiple mobile cells are created and optimal resource allocation could be done, centrally. By varying the value of reserved channels and reserved channels for hand-off, we report that the probability of blocking of a new call and successful hand-off of an ongoing call is greatly improved." .

Moreover, its performance is much better than that of the Passive Power Factor Correction circuit. However, few of the previous studies focus on determining the values of major parameters of the LFAPFC circuit and their corresponding performance. To conduct an in-depth study on the LFAPFC circuit, this paper proposes a systematic design method based on analyzing the characteristics of a symmetric trapezoidal current waveform. Using the proposed method, output performance indices such as total harmonics distortion and power factor of the LFAPFC circuit can be estimated. In addition, the relationship among the output performance, inductance and conduction parameters of the power switch is derived and investigated. Using the proposed method, designers can determine suitable values of conduction parameters and inductance for specific applications. Computer simulations and real experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method." .

Quantum simulations show FET operation with voltage swing of ~0.2 V. Incorporation of cladded quantum dots, such as SiO x –Si and GeO x –Ge, under the gate tunnel oxide results in electrical transport in one or more quantum dot layers which form a quantum dot superlattice (QDSL). Long-channel QDC FETs have experimental multistate drain current (I D)–gate voltage (V G) and drain current (I D)–drain voltage (V D) characteristics, which can be attributed to the manifestation of extremely narrow energy minibands formed in the QDSL. An approach for modeling the multistate I D–V G characteristics is reported. The multistate characteristics of QDC FETs permit design of compact two-bit multivalued logic circuits." .

In this paper, we focus on how to adaptively offload data traffic for cellular M2M networks. To this end, we propose an adaptive mobile data traffic offloading model (AOM). This model can decide whether to adopt opportunistic communications or communicate via cellular networks adaptively. In the AOM, we introduce traffic offloading rate (called TOR) and local resource consumption rate (called LRCR) and analyze them based on continue time Markov chain. Theory proof and extensive simulations demonstrate that our model is accurate and effective, and can adaptively offload data traffic of cellular M2M networks." .

Swarm intelligence algorithms (nature-inspired) such as ant colony optimization (ACO) have been proposed for developing routing protocols in VANETs. In this paper, we propose an enhanced framework for ACO protocol based on fuzzy logic for VANETs. To indicate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed protocol, the network simulator NS-2 is used for simulation.

An anti-jamming system is proposed, which employs two wavelet packet transform (WPT)-based interference mitigation blocks. The proposed pre-/post-correlation mitigation technique employs lower decomposition levels for the WPT-based denoising algorithms because it shares the responsibility of the interference mitigation between two blocks. Moreover, the first block can be deactivated in low-power jamming situations. The performance of the anti-jamming system is evaluated for the cases of single-tone continuous wave interference and linear chirp interference. Experiments and theory prove that the computational cost of the proposed method is significantly less than similar WPT-based mitigation methods and thus it is a fast interference mitigation technique. Experiments also show that it has a considerable decrease in terms of positioning error and thus it is an accurate suppression method." .

Phenotypic and genotypic analyses demonstrated that these hESCs/hiPSCs are similar in their osteogenic differentiation efficiency and they generate osteogenic cells comparable to osteogenic cells derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). However, expression of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in these osteogenic progenitor cells are markedly different, suggesting distinct pro-angiogenic potential of these stem cell derivatives.

It indicates that the DOS become smaller with increasing oxygen partial pressure. The results are verified by the threshold voltage shift of InGaZnO-TFT with different oxygen partial pressures. The trend of the variation of DOS is consistent with that of the threshold voltage shift for InGaZnO-TFT. Thus, the gate bias instability is attributed to the charge trapping mechanism based on DOS.

Here, we demonstrate that CAR T cells can be engineered through non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition of CAR genes from minimalistic DNA vectors called minicircles (MCs). We analyzed genomic distribution of SB and LV integrations and show that a significantly higher proportion of MC-derived CAR transposons compared with LV integrants had occurred outside of highly expressed and cancer-related genes into genomic safe harbor loci that are not expected to cause mutagenesis or genotoxicity. CD19-CAR T cells engineered with our enhanced SB approach conferred potent reactivity in vitro and eradicated lymphoma in a xenograft model in vivo. Intriguingly, electroporation of SB MCs is substantially more effective and less toxic compared with conventional plasmids, and enables cost-effective rapid preparation of therapeutic CAR T-cell doses.

The proposed routing strategy is a combination of a global static routing strategy (based on the shortest path algorithm) and local dynamic queue length management, in which, instead of using an infinite buffer, the queue length of each node i in the proposed routing strategy is limited by a critical queue length Q ic . When the network traffic is lower and the queue length of each node i is shorter than its critical queue length Q ic , it forwards packets according to the global routing table. With increasing network traffic, when the buffers of the nodes with higher degree are full, they do not receive packets due to their limited buffers and the packets have to be delivered to the nodes with lower degree. The global static routing strategy can shorten the transmission time that it takes a packet to reach its destination, and the local limited queue length can balance the network traffic. The optimal critical queue lengths of nodes have been analysed. Simulation results show that the proposed routing strategy can get better performance than that of the global static strategy based on topology, and almost the same performance as that of the global dynamic routing strategy with less complexity." .
