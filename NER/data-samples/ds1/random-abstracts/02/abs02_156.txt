Abstract We demonstrate that for quantum dot (QD) based electrochemiluminescence (ECL), the commonly used co-reactant does not perform as effectively as potassium persulfate. By exploiting this small change in co-reactant, ECL intensity can be enhanced dramatically in a cathodic-based ECL system. However, TPA remains the preferential co-reactant-based system for anodic ECL. This phenomenon can be rationalised through the relative energy-level profiles of the QD to the co-reactant in conjunction with the applied potential range. This work highlights the importance of understanding the co-reactant pathway for optimising the application of ECL to bioanalytical analysis, in particular for near-infrared (NIR) QDs which can be utilised for analysis in blood.
