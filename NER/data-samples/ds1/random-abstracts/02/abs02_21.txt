Abstract The motion of collisional plasmas can be governed either by the Euler-Maxwell system with damping at the fluid level or by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system at the kinetic level. In the note, we present some recent results in [8] and [7] for the study of the non-trivial large-time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem on the related models in perturbation framework.
