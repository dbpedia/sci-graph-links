Abstract We analytically compute the two-loop scattering amplitude gg â†’ Hg assuming that the mass of the quark, that mediates the ggH interaction, is vanishingly small. Our computation provides an important ingredient required to improve the theoretical description of the top-bottom interference effect in Higgs boson production in gluon fusion, and to elucidate its impact on the Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution.
