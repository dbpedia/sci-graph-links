Abstract The first model-independent measurement of the charm mixing parameters in the decay D 0 → K S0 π + π − is reported, using a sample of pp collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The measured values are x=−0.86±0.53±0.17×10−2,y=+0.03±0.46±0.13×10−2, $$ \begin{array}{l}x=\left(-0.86\pm 0.53\pm 0.17\right)\times {10}^{-2},\hfill \\ {}y=\left(+0.03\pm 0.46\pm 0.13\right)\times {10}^{-2},\hfill \end{array} $$ where the first uncertainties are statistical and include small contributions due to the external input for the strong phase measured by the CLEO collaboration, and the second uncertainties are systematic.
