Abstract Double parton scattering, occurring in high energy hadron–hadron collisions, e.g. at the LHC, is usually investigated through model dependent analyses of the so called effective cross section $${\sigma_{eff}}$$ σeff . We present a dynamic approach to this fundamental quantity making use of a Light-Front model treatment. Within such a framework $${\sigma_{eff}}$$ σeff is initially evaluated at low energy scale using the model and then, through QCD evolution, at high energy scale to reach the experimental conditions. Our numerical outcomes are consistent with the present experimental analyses of data in kinematical region we investigate. An important result of the present work is the $${x_i}$$ xi dependence of $${\sigma_{eff}}$$ σeff , a feature directly connected to double parton correlations and which could unveil new information on the three dimensional structure of the proton.
