Carrier-induced nature of ferromagnetism in a ferromagnetic semiconductor, (Ga,Mn)As, offers a great opportunity to observe novel spin-related phenomena as well as to demonstrate new functionalities of spintronic devices. Here, we report on low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission studies of the valence band in this model compound. By a direct determination of the distance of the split-off band to the Fermi energy EF we conclude that EF is located within the heavy/light hole band. However, the bands are strongly perturbed by disorder and disorder-induced carrier correlations that lead to the Coulomb gap at EF, which we resolve experimentally in a series of samples, and show that its depth and width enlarge when the Curie temperature decreases. Furthermore, we have detected surprising linear magnetic dichroism in photoemission spectra of the split-off band. By a quantitative theoretical analysis we demonstrate that it arises from the Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit term in zinc-blende crystals. The spectroscopic access to the magnitude of such asymmetric part of spin-orbit coupling is worthwhile, as they account for spin-orbit torque in spintronic devices of ferromagnets without inversion symmetry.
