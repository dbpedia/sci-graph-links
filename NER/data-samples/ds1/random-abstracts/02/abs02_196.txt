Abstract A new descriptor tool enabling to qualitatively identify excited-state potential energy regions with high decay probability is here disclosed and applied to analyze a photoinduced ring-opening reaction already well characterized from the experimental and theoretical point of view. The analysis based on such descriptor allows one to highlight a high probability of excited-state deactivation within the Franckâ€“Condon region, in agreement with experiments, and to qualitatively indentify the main mechanisms providing efficient pathways of photoreactivity.
