Abstract We present the results of T-even TMDs in a light front quark-diquark model of nucleons with the wave functions constructed from the soft-wall AdS/QCD prediction. The relations amongst TMDs are discussed. The p ‚ä•2 dependence of the TMDs are compared with the t-dependence of the GPDs and the relation between the respective dependencies are found.
