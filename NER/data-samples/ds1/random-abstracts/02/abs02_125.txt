Abstract Fields of the Planck cosmic-microwave background maps in the regions of radio sources of the RCR catalog have been studied. Using measurements from the Planck catalog, calibration curves have been plotted in order to determine the objects’ luminosities. The flux densities at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths of 83 objects with normal radio spectra have been estimated for the first time; their spectra have also been constructed, they have been optically identified, and information available in various databases has been collected. A statistical comparison with a sample of sources with steep radio spectra has been carried out. Faint, difficult to characterize microwave sources make an additional contribution to the secondary anisotropy on angular scales < 7′. An algorithm for selecting candidate objects with the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect has been proposed, based on the use of data on the radio spectral indices and the signal in cosmic-microwave background maps.
