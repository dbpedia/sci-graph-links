Abstract. The production of K+, K- and $ \phi$ (1020) mesons is studied in Al+Al collisions at a beam energy of 1.9A GeV which is close to or below the production threshold in NN reactions. Inverse slopes, anisotropy parameters, and total emission yields of K± mesons are obtained. A comparison of the ratio of kinetic energy distributions of K- and K+ mesons to the HSD transport model calculations suggests that the inclusion of the in-medium modifications of kaon properties is necessary to reproduce the ratio. The inverse slope and total yield of $ \phi$ mesons are deduced. The contribution to K- production from $ \phi$ meson decays is found to be $ [17 \pm 3(stat)^{+2}_{-7}(syst)]$%. The results are in line with the previous K± and $ \phi$ data obtained for different colliding systems at similar incident beam energies.
