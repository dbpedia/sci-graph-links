Abstract Advanced long persistent near-infrared phosphors Zn3Ga2Ge2−xSixO10:2.5 %Cr3+ (x = 0, 0.6, 1, 1.4, 2) were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The duration of afterglow can last more than 30 h after stoppage of the 365 nm ultraviolet light irradiation. Specifically, Si4+ substituting Ge4+ can increase the afterglow time but attenuate light emission intensity by introducing deep level of traps. We discussed the mechanism to balance the persistent luminescence intensity and afterglow time, which has significant potential for applications and future research of super long bright persistent luminescence phosphors.
