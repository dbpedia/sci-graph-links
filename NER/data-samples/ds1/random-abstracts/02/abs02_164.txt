Abstract In the framework of the quark-diquark model of baryons, Λ c can be considered as constituent c quark and ud diquark. In hadronizasion process baryon Λ c can be produced from ud scalar diquark and c quark fragmentation. So in this work, in the lowest order of perturbative QCD, fragmentation functions c → Λ c and ud → Λ c are calculated and finally in the electron-positron annihilation in LEP, the inclusive cross section production of Λ c is calculated about pole of z 0.
