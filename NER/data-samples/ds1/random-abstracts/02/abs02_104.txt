Abstract We study how to manipulate by the $$\updelta $$ δ -doping a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) device, which can be realized experimentally by depositing two parallel ferromagnetic stripes on top and bottom of the semiconductor $$\hbox {GaAs/Al}_{x}\hbox {Ga}_{1-x}\mathrm{As}$$ GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs heterostructure. We demonstrate an obvious GMR effect in the device with a $$\updelta $$ δ -doping. We also reveal that the magnetoresistance ratio depends not only on the weight but also on the position of the $$\updelta $$ δ -doping. These interesting results will be helpful for designing controllable GMR devices.
