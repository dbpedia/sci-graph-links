Abstract High-precision spectroscopy on the $$2 \ ^3 S \rightarrow 2 \ ^1 S$$ 23S→21S transition is possible in ultracold optically trapped helium, but the accuracy is limited by the ac-Stark shift induced by the optical dipole trap. To overcome this problem, we have built a trapping laser system at the predicted magic wavelength of 319.8 nm. Our system is based on frequency conversion using commercially available components and produces over 2 W of power at this wavelength. With this system, we show trapping of ultracold atoms, both thermal (~0.2 μk) and in a Bose–Einstein condensate, with a trap lifetime of several seconds, mainly limited by off-resonant scattering .
