Abstract Because it has been shown that the silicon trimer has a strong multi-reference character, accurate multi-reference configuration interaction calculations are performed to elucidate its electronic manifold. Emphasis is given to the long-range part of the potential, aiming to understand the atom–diatom collision’s dynamical aspects and to describe the conical intersections and important saddle points along the reaction path. An analysis of the main features of the potential energy surface is performed for benchmarking, and highly accurate values for structures, vibrational constants and energy gaps are reported, as well as a previously unpublished spin–orbit coupling magnitude. The results predict that intersystem crossings will play an important role in dynamical simulations, especially in triplet-state quenching, making the problem of constructing a precise potential energy surface more complicated and multi-sheet dependent. The ground state is predicted to be the singlet, but because the singlet–triplet gap is rather small (2.448 kJ/mol), both of these states are expected to be populated at room temperature.
