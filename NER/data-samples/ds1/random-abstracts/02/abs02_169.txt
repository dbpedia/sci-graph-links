Abstract We apply the Riccati–Padé method and the Rayleigh–Ritz method with complex rotation to the study of the resonances of a one-dimensional well with two barriers. The model exhibits two different kinds of resonances and we calculate them by means of both approaches. While the Rayleigh–Ritz method reveals each set at a particular interval of rotation angles the Riccati–Padé method yields both of them as roots of the same Hankel determinants.
