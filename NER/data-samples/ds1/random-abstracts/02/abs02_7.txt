Abstract Electrical properties of defects formed in n-Si(FZ) following 8 and 15 MeV proton irradiation are investigated by Hall effect measurements over the wide temperature range of T ≈ 25 to 300 K. Close attention is paid to the damaging factor of proton irradiation, leaving aside passivation effects by hydrogen. The concept of defect production and annealing processes being accepted in the literature so far needs to be reconsidered. Contrary to expectations the dominant impurity-related defects produced by MeV protons turn out to be electrically neutral in n-type material. Surprisingly, radiation acceptors appear to play a minor role. Annealing studies of irradiated samples of such complex defects as a divacancy tied to a phosphorus atom and a vacancy tied to two phosphorus atoms. The latter defect features high thermal stability. Identification of the dominant neutral donors, however, remains unclear and will require further, more detailed, studies. The electric properties of the material after proton irradiation can be completely restored at T = 800°C.
