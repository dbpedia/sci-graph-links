Abstract The problem of control for the quantum statistics of dissipative vortex optical solitons when using the Raman scheme of spin-flip transitions in an optical fiber doped with narrow-bandgap semiconductor quantum dots is considered. The possibility of forming individual bounded nonclassical quadrature squeezed light regions appearing within the spatial profile of a formed vortex soliton is demonstrated.
