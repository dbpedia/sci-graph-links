Abstract The energy (E) versus number of electrons (N) and external potential (v) functional E = E[N, v], which has proved to be of fundamental importance in conceptual density functional theory through the response functions it generates, has been examined concentrating on the concavity of the E = E[v] functional as opposed to the convexity of the E = E(N) function. The concavity of the E = E[v] functional is reflected in negative values of the diagonal elements of the linear response function $$\chi ({\mathbf{r}},{\mathbf{r}}')$$ χ(r,r′) comprising the second functional derivative of E with respect to $$v({\mathbf{r}})$$ v(r) , whereas no sign can be retrieved for the off-diagonal elements. These findings are in agreement with recent computational studies in extracting the chemical content of the linear response function. The results for the diagonal elements can easily be interpreted in terms of electron depletion from regions where the potential is increased and are easily retrieved via the independent particle model expression and in agreement with the diagonal elements of the most general expression for the linear response function. These concavity-related issues are put in contrast with the positive $$(\partial ^2E/\partial N^2)_v$$ (∂2E/∂N2)v derivative, resulting from the convexity of the E(N) function, in line with the positivity of the chemical hardness as resulting from the I versus A (ionization vs. electron affinity) ratio. The first-order derivative $$(\delta E/\delta v({\mathbf{r}}))_N$$ (δE/δv(r))N is discussed within an iso-electronic atom series for which it is shown in detail that the potentials can be ordered univocally, through their Z-dependence. The sign of the slope of the E = E[v] curve is in agreement with the positivity of $$\rho ({\mathbf{r}})$$ ρ(r) . The result for the E = E[v] functional is put in contrast with the negative $$(\partial E/\partial N)_v$$ (∂E/∂N)v derivative (identified as minus the electronegativity) for the E = E(N) function retrieved on the basis of experimental and theoretical data on ionization energies and electron affinities.
