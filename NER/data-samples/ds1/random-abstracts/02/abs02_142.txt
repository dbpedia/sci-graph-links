Abstract The computation of digital combinational and sequential logic functionality in the optical domain is one of the most important aspects, which opens the door of fast, secure and efficient switching and communication activity in the modern technological scenario. The proposed paper describes the working optical micro-ring resonator and its application as power optical switching device. Micro-ring resonator constructed by the non-linear material (GaAsâ€“AlGaAs) behaves as powerful optical switching devices. Now, the proper configurations and appropriate arrangement of optical micro-ring resonator gives the concepts related to the realization of the optical NAND and Half adder functionality. Hence paper describes the theoretical aspects for the implementation of all-optical NAND logic gate and one of the most important combinational digital circuits as half adder. The paper includes the relevant MATLAB simulation result, which describes the working of proposed optical logic device.
