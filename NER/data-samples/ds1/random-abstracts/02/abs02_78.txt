Abstract We describe the relativistic interacting quarkâ€“diquark model formalism and its application to the calculation of strange and nonstrange baryon spectra. The results are compared to the existing experimental data. We also discuss the application of the model to the calculation of other baryon observables, like baryon magnetic moments, open-flavor strong decays and baryon masses with self-energy corrections.
