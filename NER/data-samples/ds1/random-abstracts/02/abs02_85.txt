Abstract We discuss a technique for designing diffractive optical elements (DOE) that generate vortex beam superposition with a desired number and configuration of optical traps. Several modifications of the approach are proposed. Some configurations of the DOE-aided optical trap arrays with a predetermined pattern of intensity minima and maxima for trapping transparent and opaque microobjects are calculated. Results of a real experiment on optically trapping, rotating, and displacing in a controlled manner multiple microparticles in the optical beam generated by the designed DOE have been reported.
