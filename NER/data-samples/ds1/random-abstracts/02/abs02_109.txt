The study of the lightâ€“matter interaction at the quantum scale has been enabled by the cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) architecture1, in which a quantum two-level system strongly couples to a single cavity mode. Originally implemented with atoms in optical cavities2,3, CQED effects are now also observed with artificial atoms in solid-state environments4,5,6. Such realizations of these systems exhibit fast dynamics, making them attractive candidates for devices including modulators and sources in high-throughput communications. However, these systems possess large photon out-coupling rates that obscure any quantum behaviour at large excitation powers. Here, we have used a self-homodyning7 interferometric technique that fully employs the complex mode structure of our nanofabricated cavity8,9,10 to observe a quantum phenomenon known as the dynamic Mollow triplet11. We expect this interference to facilitate the development of arbitrary on-chip quantum state generators, thereby strongly influencing quantum lithography, metrology and imaging.
