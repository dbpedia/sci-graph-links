Abstract The effect anisotropy has on the propagation of concentration elastic waves in crystals subjected to the action of laser pulses generating carriers of disorders in the crystalline structure is studied. The existence of four dispersion wave modes—one quasi-longitudinal, two quasi-transverse, and one quasi-concentration—is established. For transversely isotropic and cubic crystals, phase velocities and attenuation (or amplification) increments of waves are determined for different directions of their propagation.
