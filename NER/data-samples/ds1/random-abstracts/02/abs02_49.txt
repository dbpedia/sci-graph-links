Abstract Any Beltrami coefficient $$\mu $$ μ on R represents a point $$[\mu ]_T$$ [μ]T in Teichmüller space T(R) of a hyperbolic Riemann surface R and a point $$[\mu ]_B$$ [μ]B in the tangent space of T(R) at the base point. The problem is whether $$\mu $$ μ represents a Strebel point is equivalent to $$\mu $$ μ represents an infinitesimal Strebel point. We prove that for any $$\mu $$ μ , there exists an element $$\nu $$ ν , such that $$[\nu ]_T=[\mu ]_T$$ [ν]T=[μ]T and $$[\nu ]_B$$ [ν]B is an infinitesimal Strebel point, when R is the unit disk.
