Abstract BackgroundThe introduction and spread of non-indigenous species is one of the main threats to biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems and it is becoming an increasing problem for the international scientific community. Aquaculture and related activities are recognized as one of the most important drivers of non-indigenous species in the Mediterranean. Grandidierella japonica Stephensen, 1938 is an aorid amphipod species native of Japan. This species had previously only been reported a few times outside the Pacific region, in particular from coastal waters of England and French Atlantic coasts. ResultsA population of the non-indigenous amphipod G. japonica, has been detected in the Sacca di Goro, a Po delta lagoon of the northern Adriatic Sea (Italy), representing the first record of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Adults of both sexes and juveniles were collected in muddy sediments reaching high densities. We examined 24 specimens: 8 adult males, 12 females, and 4 undifferentiated juveniles. Our specimens displayed a variability in the position of teeth of male gnathopod 1. Likely vectors for this introduction are the commercial shellfish transplants, mainly oyster farming. ConclusionsThe finding of a reproducing population of G. japonica suggests that the species has become well established in the Sacca di Goro. This finding also seems to be particularly relevant for the improvement on the knowledge of Mediterranean biodiversity and threats.
