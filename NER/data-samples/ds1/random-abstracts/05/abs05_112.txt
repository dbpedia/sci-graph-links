Abstract Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are synthetic phosphoric acid derivatives used in a wide variety of applications including as flame retardants and plasticizers. Their production and usage has increased in recent years, due to the phase-out of other flame retardant formulations (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers). As such, there has been a recent push to understand the global distribution of OPEs and their behaviour in biota. Multiple studies have been published over the last few years pertaining to OPE concentrations in biotic and abiotic environmental compartments, as well as the metabolism of OPEs in biota. This paper aims to provide a brief review of the occurrence and levels of OPEs in the environment, as well as recent developments concerning the elucidation of OPE metabolism in biota.
