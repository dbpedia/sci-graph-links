Abstract Clams often have their siphons cropped by predators, but a number of species quickly regenerate the tentacular crown and sensors on the siphon tips (morphological regeneration) and more slowly regenerate the lost siphon tissue (quantitative regeneration). In contrast to several studies on long-siphoned species, quantitative regeneration has not been measured in clams with short siphons. The short-siphoned Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, was used in a field experiment that took place in June–September 2009 at two intertidal sites in Matsukawaura lagoon (Japan). Clams that had their siphons amputated every 2 weeks for 10 weeks were caged in the field with non-amputated clams, and their siphon tissue mass and shell growth were compared. Quantitative regeneration was confirmed in siphon-amputated clams, based on the greater total siphon weight (including the weight of amputated parts) than remaining siphon weight of control clams. However, the growth of siphon-amputated clams was lower than that of control clams. Regeneration rate was much lower in short-siphoned species than in long-siphoned species estimated from literature values, suggesting that quantitative regeneration might be less important for short-siphoned species than for long-siphoned species.
