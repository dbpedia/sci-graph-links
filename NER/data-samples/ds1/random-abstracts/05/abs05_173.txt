Abstract Depletion of natural resources and habitat destruction has led to changes in ecosystems from the global to the local scale. For this reason, numerous theories and methods from landscape ecology have emerged and applied in sustainable landscape planning and design, including meso-and micro-scale biotope design. Although many research on biotope effectively promoting biodiversity conservation, the concept of biotope and the biotope approaches in sustainable environmental design have not been well depicted. In the present study, we propose a basic process of biotope design and several key points of design in response to increasing ecological pressure from urban areas or rural areas. We believe this conceptual method will contribute an essential tool to address the spatial dimension for achieving socio-economic and ecological sustainability.
