Abstract Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) are two widely used phthalates, while Cu(II) is a common valence state of copper. They have been ubiquitously detected in the aquatic environment, but information on their joint toxicity to aquatic organisms is scarce. In this study, we evaluated the combined effects of copper and these two phthalates to Daphnia magna and Photobacterium phosphoreum by quantifying the acute toxicity expressed by the EC50 (the concentration causing 50 % of maximal effect) value. The toxicity order was DEHP + Cu(II) > DBP + Cu(II) > Cu(II) > DEHP > DBP for both test species. Antagonism effects were found in the joint toxicity of Cu(II) combined with DBP or DEHP using the toxic unit method. These findings have important implications in environmental risk assessment for phthalates in the aquatic environment in the presence of heavy metals.
