Abstract PurposeThe objectives of the study were (1) to quantify the long-term effects of nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizer (NP) and a combination of nitrogen-phosphorus with organic manure (NPM) on total soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil inorganic carbon (SIC), (2) to identify the changes of SOC and SIC in soil particle-size fractions, and (3) to investigate the relationship between SOC and SIC. Materials and methodsTwo long-term field experiments (sites A and B) were performed in 1984 (site A) and 1979 (site B) in the North China Plain. The soil samples were collected in 2006 and separated for clay, silt and sand size particle fractions and then determined for SOC and SIC. Results and discussionThe long-term fertilization significantly increased SOC in 0–20 cm soil layer by 9–68% but significantly decreased or had no effect on SIC. In total, soil carbon storage was little affected by NP, but significantly increased by NPM application (p < 0.05). Fertilization affected both SOC and SIC in sand- and silt-sized particles but not in clay-size fraction. Both NP and NPM increased SOC in sand- and silt-sized particles by 8.7–123.9% in the 0–20 cm layer but decreased SIC up to 80.4% in the 40–60 cm layer. The SOC concentration in the particle-size fractions was negatively correlated with SIC concentration, which may imply an antagonistic interaction between organic and inorganic carbon levels. ConclusionsThese results illustrate the importance of soil inorganic carbon pool in evaluating soil total carbon pool in semi-arid farmlands. Previous assessments of the effects of fertilizers on the soil carbon pool, using only SOC determinations, require re-evaluation with the inclusion of SIC determinations.
