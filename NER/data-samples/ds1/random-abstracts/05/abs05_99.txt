Abstract The objectives of these studies were to characterize patterns of movement of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide, and aldicarb sulfone from a typical canalized South Florida watershed and to evaluate aldicarb dissipation in surface water in situ within a citrus grove. Surface water samples were collected daily or every other day from the discharge point for the watershed beginning May 15, 2001, through August 15, 2002. Of 457 samples collected, aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide, and aldicarb sulfone were detected in 6, 1, and 13, respectively. Aldicarb was detected from February through May 2002, corresponding to the legal application season of January 1 through April 30 in Florida. Aldicarb concentrations ranged from <0.16 to 4.97 ng ml−1. A single detection (0.99 ng ml−1) of aldicarb sulfoxide occurred in March 2001. The majority of aldicarb sulfone detections occurred during June and July, 2001, after the application season, and ranged from <0.22 to 0.89 ng ml−1. The half-life for aldicarb in fortified, native surface water ranged from 1.86 to 3.64 days depending on the source of water and the presence of sediments. These results demonstrated the utility of sampling on a frequent basis (compared with monthly or quarterly) for better characterizing pesticide discharges, especially in flashy systems such as canal-drained watersheds within South Florida.
