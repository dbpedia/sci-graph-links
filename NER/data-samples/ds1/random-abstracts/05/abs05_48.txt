Abstract Recent studies showed that behavioural individual features are related to species invasion and occupation abilities. In particular, the recent literature on animal personality has pointed to a correlation between behavioural profiles and the success in different phases of the invasion. In the present study, we investigated personality traits in the Neotropical species Necromys lasiurus. This wild rodent is expanding its original distribution to disturbed areas in the Atlantic Forest biome in response to anthropogenic impacts, acting as an invasive species (broad sense). In order to evaluate personality, we performed three behavioural assays as follows: open field, aversive open field and holeboard field. We extracted three personality domains—activity, exploration, and neophilia—using principal component analysis. There was significant positive correlation between these personality domains characterising a behavioural syndrome. We discussed the implications of this behavioural profile to dispersal and potential invasion abilities in this species.
