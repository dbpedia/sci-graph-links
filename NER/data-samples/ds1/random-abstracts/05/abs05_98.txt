Abstract Patterns of genetic structure for some bee species suggest that gene flow may be limited across natural and human-created barriers and that local dispersal or natal site fidelity may be common. Interestingly, this past work has primarily focused on female bees, despite the fact that males may differ substantially in their dispersal processes. By examining genetic structure and diploidy in males, it is possible to gain insight into potential barriers to gene flow and drivers of inbreeding. In this study, we examine diploidy as well as regional and local spatial genetic structure using males of Bombus vosnesenskii, a stable bumble bee species found across western North America. Specifically, we investigate patterns of genetic structure in both island and mainland populations, across spatial scales, and over a range of natural and human-altered habitats. We document high levels of male diploidy, with significantly higher levels in mainland populations compared to island populations and increasing diploidy in areas with poor nesting habitat. Interestingly, we also find evidence of significant spatial genetic structure from 0 to 10 km and 0 to 5 km on island and mainland populations, respectively. Finally, we document low but significant genetic differentiation across the region (ΦST = 0.049). Overall, this work reveals the unique potential for biogeographic context and local habitat composition to drive male diploidy patterns in bumble bees.
