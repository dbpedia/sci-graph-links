Cartilage has a tissue-specific architecture, complicating recreation by synthetic biomaterials. A novel approach for reconstruction is the use of devitalised cartilage. Treatment with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) achieves devitalisation while biomechanical properties are remained. Therefore, in the present study, cartilage was devitalised using HHP treatment and the potential for revitalisation with chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was investigated. The devitalisation of cartilage was performed by application of 480 MPa over 10 minutes. Effective cellular inactivation was demonstrated by the trypan blue exclusion test and DNA quantification. Histology and electron microscopy examinations showed undamaged cartilage structure after HHP treatment. For revitalisation chondrocytes and MSCs were cultured on devitalised cartilage without supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors. Both chondrocytes and MSCs significantly increased expression of cartilage-specific genes. ECM stainings showed neocartilage-like structure with positive AZAN staining as well as collagen type II and aggrecan deposition after three weeks of cultivation. Our results showed that HHP treatment caused devitalisation of cartilage tissue. ECM proteins were not influenced, thus, providing a scaffold for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and chondrocytes. Therefore, using HHP-treated tissue might be a promising approach for cartilage repair." .

The present study focuses on the irradiation temperature- and incident angle-dependent growth dynamics and shape evolution of these voids due to 100 MeV Ag ions irradiation. The d-Ge layers were prepared by multiple low-energy Ar ion implantations in single crystalline Ge with damage formation of ~7 displacements per atom. Further, these d-Ge layers were irradiated using 100 MeV Ag ions at two different temperatures (77 and 300 K) and three different angles (7°, 30° and 45°). After SHI irradiation, substantial volume expansion of d-Ge layer is detected which is due to formation of nanoscale voids. The volume expansion is observed to be more in the samples irradiated at 77 K as compared to 300 K at a given irradiation fluence. It is observed that the voids are of spherical shape at low ion irradiation fluence. The voids grow in size and change their shape from spherical to prolate spheroid with increasing ion fluence. The major axis of spheroid is observed to be aligned approximately along the ion beam direction which has been confirmed by irradiation at three different angles. The change in shape is a consequence of combination of compressive strain and plastic flow developed due to thermal spike generated along ion track. Post-SHI irradiation annealing shows increase in size of voids and reversal of shape from prolate spheroid towards spherical through strain relaxation. The stability of voids was studied with the effect of post-growth annealing." .

It is found that the intraseasonal temperature disturbances exhibit maximum variability near the surface in the region of 50°–75°N, 80°‒120°E and they propagate southeastwards at average zonal and meridional phase speeds of 3.2 and 2.5 m s−1, respectively. The low-level temperature signal is tightly coupled with upper-tropospheric height anomalies, and both propagate southeastward in a similar phase speed. A diagnosis of the temperature budget reveals that the southeastward propagation is primarily attributed to the advection of the temperature anomaly by the mean wind. A wave activity flux analysis indicates that the southeastward propagating wave train is likely a result of Rossby wave energy propagation. The source of the Rossby wave train appears at the high latitude Europe/Atlantic sector, where maximum wave activity flux convergence resides. During its southeastward journey, the ISO perturbation gains energy from the mean flow through both kinetic and potential energy conversions. A physics-based empirical model was constructed to predict the intraseasonal temperature anomaly over southeast China. The major predictability source is the southeastward-propagating ISO signal. The data for 1979‒2003 were used as a training period to construct the empirical model. A 10-yr (2004‒2013) independent forecast shows that the model attains a useful skill of up to 25 days." .

Control of precise surface metrology (e.g., form error, surface roughness) during machining of such surfaces is highly challenging, especially when processing super alloys like hardened steels. This work aims to experimentally investigate surface metrology of a 12.70-mm-thick curved plate platform (with S-shaped sidewall) of AISI SS304 material during milling on a vertical three-axis milling machine with three different tool path strategies: ramp, contour, and peripheral. Experiments are performed to study surface location error (SLE) and roughness during upward and downward feeding of tool on both concave and convex sidewall surfaces at different spindle speed and feed combinations. SLE values that are estimated as undercut or overcut with respect to the desired surface are found to be minimum with ramp (15.05 μm), followed by contour (18.63 μm), and maximum with peripheral (24.12 μm) milling paths. However, peripheral milling may be preferable in terms of surface roughness (improved about 40 %) and overall machining time (six times faster than ramp milling). The findings are analyzed based on the associated cutting mechanics and cutting forces." .

We developed a highly biomimetic multilayered palate substitute with bone and oral mucosa tissues using rabbit cells and biomaterials subjected to nanotechnological techniques based on plastic compression. This novel palate substitute was autologously grafted in vivo, and histological and histochemical analyses were used to evaluate biointegration, cell function, and cell differentiation in the multilayered palate substitute. The three-dimensional structure of the multilayered palate substitute was histologically similar to control tissues, but the ex vivo level of cell and tissue differentiation were low as determined by the absence of epithelial differentiation although cytokeratins 4 and 13 were expressed. In vivo grafting was associated with greater cell differentiation, epithelial stratification, and maturation, but the expression of cytokeratins 4, 13, 5, and 19 at did not reach control tissue levels. Histochemical analysis of the oral mucosa stroma and bone detected weak signals for proteoglycans, elastic and collagen fibers, mineralization deposits and osteocalcin in the multilayered palate substitute cultured ex vivo. However, in vivo grafting was able to induce cell and tissue differentiation, although the expression levels of these components were always significantly lower than those found in controls, except for collagen in the bone layer. These results suggest that generation of a full-thickness multilayered palate substitute is achievable and that tissues become partially differentiated upon in vivo grafting." .

This paper presents a finite element analysis model with multiple constraint conditions to analyze the coupled transverse and longitudinal vibrations of a marine propulsion shaft. Based on this model, in addition to the coupled natural frequencies of each direction, the maximum acceleration are also determined. Furthermore, the simulation of an idling and loading vibration analysis is discussed and validated against experimental results, over a range of rotational speeds. The output of numerical simulation is found to agree with the corresponding results from experimental tests. Finally, an accurate and applicative FEA model for coupled transverse-longitudinal vibration of shaft has been obtained." .

However, the existing clinical methods are invasive, expensive, which are also painful for patients. MethodsBased on light-absorption, this study describes a new noninvasive SvO2 measurement method by using external stimulation signal to generate cyclical fluctuation signal in the vein, which overcomes the low signal-to-noise ratio problem in the measurement process. In this way, the value of SvO2 can be obtained continuously in real time. ResultsThe experimental results demonstrate that the method can successfully measure venous oxygen saturation by artificial addition of stimulation. Under hypoxic conditions, the system can reflect the overall decline of venous oxygen saturation better. When the results measured by the new method are compared with those measured by the invasive method, the root mean square error of the difference is 5.31 and the correlation coefficient of the difference is 0.72. The new method can be used to measure SvO2 and evaluate body oxygen consumption, and its accuracy needs improvement. ConclusionsReal-time and continuous monitoring can be achieved by replacing invasive method with noninvasive method, which provides more comprehensive clinical information in a timely manner and better meet the needs of clinical treatment. However, the accuracy of the new noninvasive SvO2 measurement based on light-absorption has to be further improved." .

Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry analysis (EDX) of 72Ag-Cu filler and filler/WC-Co interface showed evidence of atomic diffusion and possible formation of titanium oxide layers between the joint and the bonding materials. An analytical model supported by the finite element method (FEM) based on strain determination due to the difference in variation of thermal expansion was used to assess the stress distribution at the coupling interface and in bulk materials. The model took into account the evolution of the Young’s modulus and of the thermal expansion with temperature. The model could be used to follow strain and stress evolutions of the bonded materials during the cooling cycle. The maximum stress rose above −300 MPa at the center of the 100 × 100 × 3 mm ceramic plates. The residual stresses on the external surface of ceramic were investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and indentation fracture method (IFM). After brazing and grinding the plate, the principal stresses were 128.1 and 94.9 MPa, and the shear stress was −20.1 MPa. Microscopic examination revealed grain pull-out promoted by the global residual stresses induced by the brazing and grinding processes. The surface stresses evaluated by the different methods were reasonably correlated." .

Regarding damping it is better to use a three-layer beam constructed from two rectangular hollow sections and a rubber layer glued between them. These three-layer beams have good damping capacity, but the dynamic deflection is large due to shear deformation of the rubber layer. To decrease this deflection two fiber-reinforced plastic layers are used. The minimum material cost design is worked out for such five-layer sandwich beams using the Rosenbrock Hillclimb mathematical programming method. Constraints on stress and local buckling are considered. A comparison is made between the optimized versions of a simple welded aluminium beam, three-layer and five-layer beams. It is shown that the deflection of the five-layer beams is smaller than that of the three-layer ones, but the cost of the five-layer beams is greater." .

According to Taguchi quality design concept, an L9 orthogonal array was selected for experiments. The best combination of process parameters was found by both Taguchi method and Grey relational analysis. The influence of the process parameters on overall quality characteristics of the friction welding process was evaluated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. The confirmation test results with optimal parameters confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in this study.

The Geopolymer Mortars (GM) were made from high calcium Fly Ash (FA) and ordinary Portland Cement (PC) with FA:PC weight ratios of 100:0, 95:5, 90:10, 85:15, and 80:20. The GMs were activated with three combinations of sodium Hydroxide Solution (SH) and sodium Silicate Solution (SS) viz., SH, SH+SS (SH:SS=2) and SS. For all mixes, 10 molar SH, alkali activator liquid/solid binder ratio of 0.60 and curing at ambient temperature of 25oC were used. The result indicated that the compressive and shear bond strengths of GM depended on the alkali activators used and the amount of PC. The use of SH and SHSS resulted in the formation of additional Calcium Silicate Hydrate (CSH) which coexisted with sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (NASH) gel. Whereas, the use of SS resulted in NASH gel with only a small amount of CSH. The increasing of PC content enhanced the compressive and shear bond strengths of GMs due to the formation of additional CSH. The 15% PC mixed with SHSS gave the optimum compressive and shear bond strengths." .

However, most of the existing methods for evaluation of the wind stress, including various bulk formulas in terms of the wind speed at a given height and formulas relating the roughness height of the sea surface with wind conditions, predict an ever-increasing tendency of the wind stress coefficient as the wind speed increases, which is inconsistent with the field observations under storm conditions. The wave boundary layer model, which is based on the momentum and energy conservation, has the advantage to take into account the physical details of the air–sea interaction process, but is still invalid under storm conditions without a modification. By including the energy dissipation due to the presence of sea spray, which is speculated to be an important aspect of the air–sea interaction under storm conditions, the wave boundary layer model is improved in this study. The improved model is employed to estimate the wind stress caused by an idealized tropical cyclone motion. The computational results show that the wind stress coefficient reaches its maximal value at a wind speed of about 40 m/s and decreases as the wind speed further increases. This is in fairly good agreement with the field data." .

Six large-scale shear connection models, which involved a portion of reinforced concrete wall and a shear tab welded onto a steel endplate with three steel angles, were constructed and tested under combined actions of cyclic axial load and eccentric shear. The effects of embedment lengths of steel angles, wall boundary elements, types of anchor plates, and thicknesses of endplates were investigated. The test results indicate that properly detailed connections exhibit desirable seismic behavior and fail due to the ductile fracture of steel angles. Wall boundary elements provide beneficial confinement to the concrete surrounding steel angles and thus increase the strength and stiffness of connections. Connections using whole anchor plates are prone to suffer concrete pry-out failure while connections with thin endplates have a relatively low strength and fail due to large inelastic deformations of the endplates. The current design equations proposed by Chinese Standard 04G362 and Code GB50011 significantly underestimate the capacities of the connection models. A revised design method to account for the influence of previously mentioned test parameters was developed." .

The decline is strongest (approximately 50 ppb per year) in the 1997–2003 period but continues post 2003. A ‘local CO increment’ can be identified as the residual after subtraction of contemporary background Atlantic CO mixing ratios from measured values at Egham.

On many days of the year CO measured at Egham is now not far above Atlantic background levels measured at Mace Head (Ireland). The results are consistent with MOPITT satellite observations and ‘bottom-up’ inventory results.

Engineering responses to higher water levels can be prohibitively costly. Several recent studies emphasize the potential role of ecosystems in flood protection as adaptive risk reduction measures while also contributing to carbon fixation. Here, we use a conceptual model study to illustrate the built-in adaptive capability of ecosystems to reduce a wide range of wave heights, occurring at different water levels, to a narrower range. Our model shows that wave height of waves running through a forested section is independent of initial height or of water level. Although the underlying phenomenon of non-linear wave attenuation within coastal vegetation is well studied, implications of reducing variability in wave heights for design of ecosystem and levee combinations have not yet been properly outlined. Narrowing the range of wave heights by a vegetation field generates an adaptive levee that is robust to a whole range of external conditions rather than only to a maximum wave height. This feature can substantially reduce costs for retrofitting of levees under changing future wave climates. Thereby, in wave prone areas, inclusion of ecosystems into flood defense schemes constitutes an adaptive and safe alternative to only hard engineered flood risk measures." .

MethodsWe reviewed 194 pedicle screw of 28 consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive lumbar or thoracic spinal stabilization. The accuracy of screw placement was evaluated according to two criteria published by Neo et al. and Upendra et al. Facet joint violation was evaluated according to the classification described by Babu et al. ResultsUpon Neo grading, CFT group had 19.4 % (14/72) pedicle breach rate and CT-IGN group had a 5.7 % (7/122) pedicle breach rate (p < 0.005). The same sets of screws were also assessed using the outcome-based classification established by Upendra. There were no screw caused neurovascular injuries (type 3 = 0) in both groups. The results showed that 87.5 % (63/72) screws had acceptable placements (type I) and 12.5 % (9/72) had unacceptable placements (type II) in CFT group.

This paper introduces a new method of identifying bridge damage using an instrumented truck; specifically using the truck acceleration histories to calculate changes in the “bridge displacement profile” which is shown to be sensitive to structural damage. The study includes three different bridges modeled as 1D FE beam elements and 2D FE plate elements. The simulation of the vehicle–bridge interaction is implemented in MATLAB. The truck is represented as a simple quarter car model crossing over a rough profile. The approach is also numerically tested for local damage in the bridge plate model. Finally, there is a study of sensitivity to signal noise, corrupted truck properties, initial conditions and transverse vehicle position." .

After landfall near the south coast of Chennai, cyclone Nilam moved north-northwestwards. Coordinated experiments were conducted from the Indian stations of Gadanki (13.5°N, 79.2°E) and Hyderabad (17.4°N, 78.5°E) to study the modification of gravity-wave activity and turbulence by cyclone Nilam, using GPS radiosonde and mesosphere–stratosphere–troposphere radar data. The horizontal velocities underwent large changes during the closest approach of the storm to the experimental sites. Hodograph analysis revealed that inertia gravity waves (IGWs) associated with the cyclone changed their directions from northeast (control time) to northwest following the path of the cyclone. The momentum flux of IGWs and short-period gravity waves (1–8 h) enhanced prior to, and during, the passage of the storm (±0.05 m2 s−2 and ±0.3 m2 s−2, respectively), compared to the flux after its passage. The corresponding body forces underwent similar changes, with values ranging between ±2–4 m s−1 d−1 and ±12–15 m s−1 d−1. The turbulence refractivity structure constant (C n 2) showed large values below 10 km before the passage of the cyclone when humidity in the region was very high. Turbulence and humidity reduced during the passage of the storm when a turbulent layer at ~17 km became more intense. Turbulence in the lower troposphere and near the tropopause became weak after the passage of the cyclone." .

The effect of operating parameters such as Fe2+ loading, contact time, initial pH, and hydrogen peroxide loading on the extent of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction and change in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/COD ratio has been investigated. The optimum operating conditions established for the pretreatment were initial pH of 3.0, Fe2+ loading of 2.0, and 2.5 g L−1 for the US/Fenton/stirring and Fenton approach, respectively, and temperature of 25 °C with initial H2O2 loading of 1.5 g L−1. The use of pretreatment resulted in a significant increase in the BOD5/COD ratio confirming the production of easily digestible intermediates. The effect of the type of sludge in the aerobic biodegradation was also investigated based on the use of primary activated sludge (PAS), modified activated sludge (MAS), and activated sludge (AS). Enhanced removal of the pollutants as well as higher biomass yield was observed for MAS as compared to PAS and AS. The use of US/Fenton/stirring pretreatment under the optimized conditions followed by biological oxidation using MAS resulted in maximum COD removal at 97.9 %. The required hydraulic retention time for the combined oxidation system was also significantly lower as compared to only biological oxidation operation. Kinetic studies revealed that the reduction in the COD followed a first-order kinetic model for advanced oxidation and pseudo first-order model for biodegradation. The study clearly established the utility of the combined technology for the effective treatment of real industrial wastewater." .

The tensional and bending elements are taken into account for deducing the element stiffness matrices which are assembled to establish the spectral equations of motion of the whole rigid frame structure. The validity and accuracy of the natural frequencies and frequency responses obtained by the SEM are verified by comparing the present numerical results with the results of the experiments and the finite element method (FEM). The results indicate that the SEM is very suitable for analyzing the dynamic response and vibration band-gap properties of the periodic frame structures, and the SEM is more effective and accurate than the FEM, especially for the high frequency responses. The influences of the structural and material parameters on the vibration band-gaps are analyzed, and some new configurations of the periodic rigid frame structures are designed to obtain more and wider frequency band-gaps and consequently to improve the structural vibration isolation capability." .

These infrastructures are typically constructed at a relatively fast rate such that the pore-water phase is not allowed to drain, or under constant water content (CW) condition. The mechanical behaviour of compacted fine-grained soils under CW condition should be well understood in addition to various other loading conditions for rational design of geotechnical infrastructures. In this study, compacted soil specimens of a residual gneiss from Brazil were tested using a conventional triaxial testing equipment under CW condition. A high capacity tensiometer was used to measure the matric suction in the compacted soil specimens. Three groups of soil specimens compacted at different initial water contents representing dry of optimum, optimum and wet of optimum conditions were tested to study the influence of soil structure on the matric suction development in the soil specimens during testing. The test results suggest that the matric suction changes in the soil under CW condition depend mainly on the volume change behavior, which is influenced by the level of confining pressure, the degree of saturation and the soil structure. The simple conventional triaxial testing equipment has been found to be useful for determining the mechanical behavior of compacted fine-grained soils under CW condition with the aid of a high capacity tensiometer." .

To avoid the need of an adjoint model, an ensemble-like method to explicitly represent the linear tangent equation is adopted. Results of twin experiments have shown that the method is able to recover the contaminated low dimension model parameters to their true values. The data assimilation scheme was applied to a severe storm surge event which occurred in the North Sea in December 5, 2013. By adjusting wind drag coefficient, the predictive ability of the model increased significantly.

To solve the problem, we have focused on developing proper wide-tip shape of the polymeric dry adhesive structures.

It was found out that both chemical and thermo-mechanical pulping, and mechanical milling can be used for pulping contaminated wood waste chips received from construction waste treatment plant. The resulting pulps were then utilized successfully to prepare product demonstrations (wood fibre filaments and thick foam formed panel structures). There are no technical restraints for pulping contaminated construction wood waste, and the resulting pulp quality depends on the shape and size of the woodchips, dry content, wood species and type of contaminants.

It requires tests that traverse a path in which the definition of a variable and its subsequent use, i.e., a definition‐use association (dua), is exercised. However, DF testing has rarely been adopted in industry because it is considered too costly by practitioners. A factor precluding broad adoption of DF testing is the cost of tracking duas exercised by tests. Previous approaches rely on complex computations and expensive data structures to collect dua coverage. We present an algorithm which utilizes efficient bitwise operations and inexpensive data structures to track intra‐procedural duas. RAM memory requirements are restricted to three bit vectors the size of the number of duas. Conservative simulations indicate that the new algorithm imposes less execution slowdown." .

In this paper, we use a variable-coefficient Korteweg–de Vries equation to examine this issue, for an initial wave which is either elevation, or depression, or a combination of each. We show that the leading waves can be described by a reduction of the Whitham modulation theory to a solitary wave train. We find that for an initial elevation, the leading waves are elevation solitary waves with an amplitude which varies inversely with the depth, with a pre-factor which is twice the maximum amplitude in the initial wave. By contrast, for an initial depression, the leading wave is a depression rarefaction wave, followed by a solitary wave train whose maximum amplitude of the leading wave is determined by the square root of the mass in the initial wave." .

This allows us to examine the source distribution of the second-order nonlinear response originating from the fundamental waves in a consistent manner that takes the nonlocal characteristics of the system into account. We validate this framework by comparing with the results of the fully nonlinear model and apply it to the study of three-wave-mixing enhancements from nanoplasmonic antennas." .

In this work, we figured out the role of SOC in ABi3 (A = Sr and Ba) by theoretical investigation of the band structures, phonon properties, and electron-phonon coupling. Without SOC, strong Fermi surface nesting leads to phonon instabilities in ABi3. SOC suppresses the nesting and stabilizes the structure. Moreover, without SOC the calculation largely underestimates the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc), while with SOC the calculated Tc are very close to those determined by measurements on single crystal samples. The SOC enhanced superconductivity in ABi3 is due to not only the SOC induced phonon softening, but also the SOC related increase of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. ABi3 can be potential platforms to construct heterostructure of superconductor/topological insulator to realize topological superconductivity." .

The adsorption investigations were performed with water solutions of ethyl acetate, and the obtained results fit well the Langmuir model, as well as the Freundlich model. All activated carbons demonstrated considerably high adsorption capacity in the range 160–450 mg/g.

In the investigation reported herein, cyclic pullout tests were conducted on geogrid embedded in sand. A load controlled pullout test apparatus complying with the dimensions suggested by ASTM D-6706-01 was designed and fabricated in-house. Modular units for applying both cyclic and monotonic load were also designed and fabricated. Cyclic load was applied through a pneumatic double acting air cylinder. In addition, the setup consisted of a signal generator and a filter lubricator regulator volume booster. The effect of normal stress and cyclic load on the pullout behaviour was studied. It was found that cyclic loads of a lower magnitude than the monotonic capacity could cause failure. In the case of cyclic loads of small magnitude, the displacements showed tendency to stabilize. In the case of higher magnitudes of cyclic loads, the displacements progressively increased to failure. An initial stiffness was noticed in the system due to the initial densification achieved near the interface due to the dynamic nature of the cyclic pullout forces. Normal load as well as cyclic load played important roles in the number of cycles to cause failure. Post-cyclic monotonic tests showed the effect of degradation of the soil-geosynthetic interface after subjecting the same to certain number of load cycles." .

Experience gained from historical failures has led to the clear realisation that visual inspection at intervals of many months or years is insufficient to identify potential failure caused by overloading and biological degradation. A bridge overloaded today can fail tomorrow and there is a need to implement structural health monitoring (SHM) so that the incidence of overloading can be identified soon after it occurs. This need is becoming more vital with the increased expectation to cater for the increased loads during periods of transporting seasonal produce. The measurement mid-span displacement of girders can be used to determine safety indices for the evaluation of structural safety. The detection of real-time damage in timber girder bridges by the use of high-speed camera and laser-based methods offer unique advantages and can lead to low cost measurement techniques. This work reports on the use of continuous monitoring methods for determining the structural reliability of timber-beam bridge girders. Some applications of the use of laser-based displacement sensing systems are discussed in relation to the monitoring of the structural reliability of two older timber beam bridges in regional New South Wales, Australia. Experimental and analytical approaches are presented and used to demonstrate that the probability of failure can be readily determined on a continuous basis using an SHM system." .

The importance of regional consuming habits and income for dietary AC was also approached. MethodsThe annual per capita consumption database from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) was used for identification of the most consumed plant foods in Brazil. Out of 124 key plant foods, 42 top AC contributing candidates were selected for AC determination based on both the frequency of consumption, and AC results reported in the literature, and in our preliminary assays. The selected food products were prepared according to the Brazilian Food Guide, and their AC was measured by TEAC and FRAP assays. Dietary AC was determined by combining these AC results with IBGE consumption data, and the relative contribution of each plant food was calculated. Results Among all evaluated food products, coffee and green maté tea presented the highest AC, followed by toasted maté tea, red wine, açaí—a native Amazonian fruit—and beans. Associating AC with the annual consumption database from IBGE, coffee alone contributed, on average, to 66 % of dietary AC; other beverages, including maté and wine, contributed altogether to 13 % of dietary AC; beans contributed to 9 %, cereals and derivatives contributed to 4 %; and in natura fruits and vegetables contributed to only 3 and 2 %, respectively. In the North region, fruits were important contributors to AC—mostly because of high açaí consumption, while in the South maté and wine also gained importance, with wine contribution being specially associated with high household income. ConclusionsCoffee is the main contributor to the total dietary AC in Brazil, regardless of household income. Maté tea, açaí and beans are other major dietary AC contributors." .

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the heat resistance of spores isolated from dehydrated ingredients, intermediate and final products. Furthermore, the influence of the heating medium (milk or phosphate buffer) on the heat resistance was determined in order to assess which medium is best to use in the context of dairy processing. Sixteen spore-forming strains from seven different species (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus flexus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Bacillus smithii, Geobacillus pallidus, Geobacillus stearothermophilus) producing thermoresistant spores were selected after their isolation from diverse food products obtained from local dairies such as cocoa powder, milk powder, spices, and dessert products. Spores produced from the chosen strains were tested regarding their heat resistance at 110, 120, and 125 °C for 30 min. Highly thermoresistant spores surviving a heat treatment for 30 min at 125 °C in milk were produced by B. amyloliquefaciens and G. stearothermophilus. The inactivation of the spores was higher in milk than in phosphate buffer. This study highlights that not only raw milk but also dehydrated ingredients are important sources of thermoresistant spores in dairy processing. Since the inactivation of spores in milk and phosphate buffer turned out to be significantly different, milk rather than laboratory media or buffers should be employed as the model heating system when designing thermal processes for new milk-based products." .

It is shown that, in both cases, a compression wave in glassy carbon contains a leading precursor with amplitude of 0.135(5) GPa. It is established that, in the range of pressures up to 2 GPa, a shock discontinuity in glassy carbon is transformed into a broadened compression wave, and shock waves are formed in the release wave, which generally means the anomalous compressibility of the material in both the compression and release waves. It is shown that, at pressure higher than 3 GPa, anomalous behavior turns into normal behavior, accompanied by the formation of a shock compression wave. In the investigated area of pressure, possible structural changes in glassy carbon under shock compression have a reversible character. A physico-mechanical model of glassy carbon is proposed that involves the equation of state and a constitutive relation for Poisson’s ratio and allows the numerical simulation of physico-mechanical and thermophysical properties of glassy carbon of different densities in the region of its anomalous compressibility." .

Traditionally, the deposition of transparent conducting layers and the sealing of the device are separate steps. Here we report on a highly transparent, conductive, and flexible “tape”, which can be obtained by transferring silver nanowire networks to conventional transparent tape. We utilized the viscidity of the tape to reduce the junction resistance between silver nanowires and further protect the nanowires from corrosion, oxidation and mechanical damage. By this simple method, we obtained a flexible tape with high transparency (~90% at 550 nm wavelength) and low sheet resistance (approaching 22 Ω·sq–1). The transparent tape can be attached and stuck firmly on complex surfaces, making the surface highly conductive. We demonstrated the use of the tape as both a conducting layer and a sealing layer for flexible electronics applications including in-situ temperature monitoring and electrochromic devices. " .

While higher material removal rates can be achieved with a milling strategy, the use of a defined cutting edge leads to surfaces with asperities. These sharp peaks quickly wear down during sliding contact, resulting in unacceptable changes in the load bearing surface of the guide. Therefore, a post process to milling must be implemented to mitigate these features. This paper investigates the use of a spindle mounted abrasive disk filament tool for producing a functional surface similar to the ground surfaces. The optimal process parameters were investigated using 2D profile measurements, followed by comparison using areal analysis of ground, milled, and polished surfaces. It was found that polishing reduces both the height and volume of asperities on the milled surface, leading to contact characteristics which were more similar to those of the conventional ground surfaces currently used for sliding guideways." .

The results indicate that pristine MoS2 is nonmagnetic. The materials with the existence of S vacancy or Mo vacancy alone are non-magnetic either. Further calculation demonstrates that Co substitution at Mo site leads to spin polarized state. Two substitutional CoMo defects tend to cluster and result in the non-magnetic behaviour. However, the existence of Mo vacancies leads to uniform distribution of Co dopants and it is energy favourable with ferromagnetic coupling, resulting in an intrinsic diluted magnetic semiconductor." .

The crystal structure analysis of AAC with PA was also carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the compressive strength and flexural strength of AAC were increased by 43.9% and 42.8%, respectively, when 1.5wt% of PA was mixed.

The results showed that there were meaningful differences between South Korea and China, as expected. Significant differences were shown in the number of employees, monthly wages, effecting factors on the lowest cost price period for a year; garment manufacturing time, and manufacturing costs of basic designs and detailed designs of blouse, pants, and jacket. The results of garments cost were significantly different consistent with the quality, from low cost to high cost, and quantities, from 500 pieces or less to above 10,000 pieces. The overall cost difference between two counties was about 2.6–3.5 times greater (Korea to China). Examining the same item, the difference was larger in low quality and small or large quantity rather than high quality and medium quantity. Interestingly, pants and jackets showed the largest cost difference at quantities above 10,000 pieces. Also, for 2018 there were differences in the estimated costs between both countries. The estimated cost differences were increasing from 2013 giving the implication that future manufacturing cost could increase between Korea and China." .

Steel plate shear walls have long been used as a lateral load-resisting system. It is composed of beam and column frame elements, to which infill plates are connected. There is a growing tendency among engineers to design tall buildings using steel plate shear walls. This paper investigates the progressive collapse-resisting capacity of the strip model of steel plate shear wall system compared with X-braced and moment frame system. The 3D models are used to assess the collapse behavior of typical 50-story building models, under sudden loss of elements from the middle and corner of the exterior frame in the story above the ground. The progressive collapse potential of model structures is evaluated by different nonlinear static and dynamic analyses using conventional analysis software. In this study, the vulnerability of candidate structures subjected to progressive collapse is also assessed by a sensitivity index regarding the sensitivity of structures to the dynamic effect induced by progressive collapse. To identify vulnerable members, the resulting actions of two nonlinear and linear static analyses are compared by the factor of redundancy related to the overall strength of the structure. Comparison of the analysis results indicated that in the steel plate shear wall system, the progressive collapse-resisting potential is more than X-braced and moment frame structure. Sensitive index of highly sensitive elements to the dynamic effect stated that in the structural models, beams are significantly more vulnerable in the moment frame than X-braced and SPSW structure. The index depicted that the vulnerability of columns in X-braced and SPSW structure is more than the moment frame structure." .

A threedimensional finite element model was developed in Abaqus and its accuracy was validated against the experimental measurements collected as part of this study. The model was then used to perform a parametric study to gain insight into the structural response at different temperatures. The experimental and numerical results were then used to evaluate the accuracy of available European guidelines for predicting the capacity of shear connectors at elevated temperatures (when embedded in composite slabs with the profiled sheeting parallel to the steel beam). Finally, a new design equation was proposed to calculate the degradation factor defining the resistance of shear connectors for different levels of temperature." .

Noteworthy, the scarcity of the freshwater resources and close proximity to the active seismic zones of the Gulf of Aqaba implicate geophysical investigations for the fresh groundwater aquifers and construct a design response spectrum, respectively. Accordingly, 14 VESs, hydro/engineering geophysical analysis, pumping tests, downhole seismic test, a design response spectrum for buildings, and borehole data were carried out in the study area. The unconfined freshwater aquifer was effectively depicted with true resistivities, thickness, and EC ranged from 56 to 135 Ω m, 11 to 112 m, and 1.4 to 7.1 mS/m, respectively. The Northeastern part was characterized by higher aquifer potentiality, where coarser grains size, highest thickness (112 m), high true resistivity (135 Ω m), groundwater flow (0.074 m3/day), tortuosity (1.293–1.312), formation resistivity factor (4.1–4.6), and storativity (0.281–0.276). An increase in pumping rate was accompanied by an increase in well loss, increase in aquifer losses, decrease in well specific capacity, and decrease in well efficiency. Design response spectrum prognosticated the short buildings (<7 floors) in RMNP to be suffering from a high peak horizontal acceleration and shear forces for acceleration between 0.25 and 0.35 g. Therefore, appropriate detailing of shear reinforcement is indispensable to reduce the risk of structural damages at RMNP." .

Full-scale vortex visualization is essential for the understanding of these effects and the validation of sub-scale experiments and numerical simulations. In the present work, the reference-free background-oriented schlieren (BOS) method was used to visualize blade tip vortices of a full-scale BO 105 helicopter in hover and under free flight conditions. A ground-based dual-camera BOS system with an artificial background was applied for the visualization of the helicopter’s main and tail rotor tip vortices during take-off. In a second flight test, a similar dual-camera BOS system was used to visualize the main rotor blade tip vortices of the BO 105 during high speed forward, curve, and accelerating forward flight. The camera system was deployed aboard a microlight airplane flying above the helicopter, with vegetation on the ground serving as natural backgrounds. Different natural and artificial backgrounds were analyzed and compared to assess their suitability for the BOS evaluation. The airborne setup enabled the visualization of vortices up to a maximum vortex age of $$\\psi _v=630^\\circ$$ ψv=630∘ at distances of up to one rotor diameter behind the rotor plane. Blade-vortex interaction effects and deformations of the vortex system were observed. The visualization results obtained during the inflight measurements show that the reference-free BOS method is highly suitable for the detection of helicopter blade tip vortices during full speed forward and maneuvering flight, therefore removing the restrictions imposed by ground-based measurements.

The magnitude of ICP in the FO membrane was investigated experimentally by measuring water flux in both spiral wound (SW) and flat-sheet (FS) modules with different draw solutions (sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and disodium phosphate). The FO SW module always shows inferior water flux performance to the FO FS module. The water flux in the FO SW module can be easily estimated by just changing structure parameter. The estimated structure parameter in the FO SW module is 9.1325×10−4 m, which is quite higher than 4.2×10−4 m in the FO FS module. The increase of the structure parameter is attributed to the bending of the FO membrane in the SW module. It can be concluded that a module design such like SW type is not suitable for the FO process." .

The relative importance of geometric effects and diaphragm opening time on shock formation are assessed. The diaphragm opening time was controlled through the use of slit-type (fast opening time) and petal-type (slow opening time) diaphragms. A novel method of fabricating the petal-type diaphragms, which results in a consistent burst pressure and symmetric opening without fragmentation, is presented. High-speed schlieren photography was used to visualize the unsteady propagation of the lead shock wave and trailing gas dynamic structures. Surface-mounted pressure sensors were used to capture the spatial and temporal development of the pressure field. Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes simulation predictions using the shear-stress-transport turbulence model are compared to the experimental data. Simulation results are used to explain the presence of high-frequency pressure oscillations observed experimentally in the driver section as well as the cause of the initial acceleration and subsequent rapid decay of shock velocity measured along the top and bottom channel surfaces. A one-dimensional theoretical model predicting the effect of the finite opening time of the diaphragm on the rate of driver depressurization and shock acceleration is proposed. The model removes the large amount of empiricism that accompanies existing models published in the literature. Model accuracy is assessed through comparisons with experiments and simulations. Limitations of and potential improvements in the model are discussed." .

In the present research work, leaching kinetics of EAFD with sulfuric acid has been investigated and various experimental parameters such as concentration of lixiviant, stirring rate, sample particle size, liquid/solid proportion, and temperature of the reaction have been optimized. It has been found that the dissolution rate of EAFD increases with rise in temperature, acidic strength, rate of stirring, liquid to solid proportion and with reduction in EAFD particle size. From the analysis of leaching kinetic data by means of graphical and statistical methods, it has been evaluated that the leaching kinetics of EAFD is dictated by surface diffusion reaction. Apparent energy of activation for the leaching reaction of EAFD with sulfuric acid is found to be 13.1 kJ mol–1 within the temperature range of 308 to 358 K." .

Aboard this spacecraft is a compact landing package, MASCOT (Mobile Asteroid surface SCOuT), which was developed by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) in collaboration with the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES). Similar to the famous predecessor mission Hayabusa, Hayabusa2, will also study an asteroid and return samples to Earth. This time, however, the target is a C-type asteroid which is considered to be more primitive than (25143) Itokawa and provide insight into an even earlier stage of our Solar System. Upon arrival at asteroid Ryugu in 2018, MASCOT will be released from the HY2 spacecraft and gently descend by free fall from an altitude of about 100 m to the surface of the asteroid. After a few bounces, the lander will come to rest at the surface and perform its scientific investigations of the surface structure and mineralogical composition, the thermal behaviour and the magnetic properties by operating its four scientific instruments. Those include an IR imaging spectrometer (MicrOmega, IAS Paris), a camera (MASCAM, DLR Berlin), a radiometer (MARA, DLR Berlin) and a magnetometer (MASMAG, TU Braunschweig). In order to allow optimized payload operations the thermal design of MASCOT is required to cope with the contrasting requirements of the 4-year cruise in cold environment versus the hot conditions on the surface of the asteroid. Operations up to 2 asteroid days (∼16 hours) based on a primary battery are currently envisaged. A mobility mechanism allows locomotion on the surface. The mechanism is supported by an attitude and motion sensing system and an intelligent autonomy manager, which is implemented in the onboard software that enables MASCOT to operate fully independently when ground intervention is not available." .

Together with the concept of Daniels sequence, the RDF is used for estimating the residual (after some preliminary fatigue loading) static strength of a unidirectional fibrous composite (UFC) and its S–N curve on the bases of test data. Usually, the residual strength is analyzed on the basis of a known S–N curve. In our work, an inverse approach is used: the S–N curve is derived from an analysis of the residual strength. This approach gives a good qualitive description of the process of decreasing residual strength and explanes the existence of the fatigue limit. The estimates of parameters of the corresponding regression model can be interpreted as estimates of parameters of the local strength of components of the UFC. In order to approach the quantitative experimental estimates of the fatigue life, some ideas based on the mathematics of the semiMarkovian process are employed. Satisfactory results in processing experimental data on the fatigue life and residual strength of glass/epoxy laminates are obtained." .

Though the efficiency of step-down stress accelerated life tests has improved in general, researchers and engineers may have to deal with the failure mechanism changing due to the high starting stress. In this paper, we develop a new accelerated life test scheme, called self-adaptive stress accelerated life tests (SAS-ALT), with considerations of the relative stress loading criterion. We also develop algorithm steps for implementation of SAS-ALT. We formulate and discuss an optimization function of the proposed SAS-ALT that minimizes the variance of the system life time using the maximum-likelihood method, Fisher matrix, and accelerated model. Some factors of the SAS-ALT, such as stress and failure number, were chosen depending upon the optimum function. We also discuss an application of the computer numerical control system based on real failure data to illustrate step-by-step reliability accelerated life test design policy based on our proposed SAS-ALT scheme." .

Such trajectories permit the installation of cycler vehicles which provide safe and comfortable living conditions for human space travel between Earth and Mars during every synodic opportunity. The question the present paper answers is a logical, obvious one: Does a single-vehicle, one-synodic-period cycler exist? The answer is yes: such a trajectory can be flown-but only with a high-power electric propulsion system. In our example, it is found that‘stopover’ trajectories that spend 30 days in orbit about Earth and 30 days about Mars, and return astronauts to Earth in one synodic period require a 90-t power generator with a power level of 11 MW\"e. Fortuitously, and in lieu of using chemical propulsion, the high power level of the electric propulsion system would also be effective in hauling the cargo payload via a spiral trajectory about the Earth. But because one synodic period is not enough for the cycler vehicle to fly both the interplanetary trajectories and the Earth-spiral trajectories, we suggest developing two nuclear power generators, which could alternate flying the interplanetary trajectories and the Earth-spiral trajectories. Once these power generators are launched and begin operating in space, the mass requirement in seven subsequent missions (over a period of 15 years beginning in 2022) would be modest at 250-300 metric tons to low-Earth orbit per mission. Thus two cargo launches of NASA's Space Launch System and one crew launch of the Falcon Heavy, for example, would be adequate to maintain support for each consecutive mission. Although we propose developing two sets of electric propulsion systems to account for the Earth-spiral phases, only one vehicle is flown on a heliocentric trajectory at any given time. Thus, our low-thrust stopover cycler with zero encounter velocities falls into a category of a‘one-vehicle cycler,’ which completes the gap in the literature, where we have already seen multiple-vehicle cycler concepts." .

The knowledge of the weaving architecture is essential to properly optimise the design of the structural components subjected to specific load conditions. Owing to the hierarchy and periodicity of the textile composite materials, a multi-scale parameterisation modelling strategy combining the adoption of a representative volume element and periodic boundary conditions is employed to estimate the behaviour of stiffened panels. In order to minimise the expensive computational cost, response surface method techniques are used to generate the approximated structural responses in an efficient and applicable way. The approach here proposed consists of a multi-scale parameterization analysis strategy and an optimisation framework based on the response surface technique and genetic algorithms. The optimal design results are verified by finite element analysis proving that the response surface method integrated with genetic algorithms allows to easily investigate the influence of the fabrics constitutive parameters on the structural behaviour." .

A multi-domain state at remanence can be obtained, which is an attractive feature for biomedical applications, where a low remanence is desirable. The nanowires can also be encoded with different remanence values. Notably, the oxidation process of single-crystal iron nanowires halts at a shell thickness of 10 nm. The oxide shell of these nanowires acts as a passivation layer, retaining the magnetic properties of the iron core even during high-temperature operations.

However, there are some problems in current corner plunge milling approach, such as sidewall over-cut, invalid tool location points, and uncontrollable residual height. Therefore, a universal layering algorithm for plunge milling tool path generation is projected and established. First, define and represent two-dimensional corner model. Next, the terminologies about machining layer circle, cutter circle, and cuspidal point circle are introduced and layering model is built. Then, construct cutter circle arrangement program on the basis of the intersection between layer circle and corner model. Meanwhile, the relationship between residual height and layering model is determined. Finally, the layering tool path is recursively generated in line with radial cutting width. Two groups of contrast experiments prove effectively that the proposed method excels the conventional methods in guaranteeing residual height and avoiding invalid tool location points. In addition, the layering method can maintain an efficient processing tool path ratio of more than 80%. Furthermore, the application of a CAD solid model of an aircraft panel demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the layering approach." .

The studies conducted allowed us to ascertain that the transformations of Aand B-defects in diamonds of octahedral and cubic habits follow general regularities. This fact shows that most of the diamonds of cubic habit with low degree of aggregation of nitrogen centers were not really annealed over a long-term interval. Unlike octahedral diamonds, those of cubic habit are characterized by a pronounced increase in the peak of H-containing defects (3107 cm–1) after annealing." .

It is mostly produced in hardened block form, which is less convenient than in granulated form for food applications. In terms of the traditional processing of NCS, preparation of granulated products is difficult due to the impurities found in the cane juice extracted from the whole stalk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize and determine the physico-chemical properties, wax composition (policosanols and long-chain aldehydes), volatile aroma profiles, and antioxidant activity of traditional NCS in granular form made from four different cane cultivars of Thailand. The total soluble solid, pH, color, and mineral content varied among the sugarcane cultivars, whereas there was no significant difference in the total sugar, phenolic and flavonoid content. The total policosanol, a cholesterol-lowering nutraceutical wax component, and long-chain aldehyde contents were similar in the NCS products amongst three cultivars, and ranged from 2.63 to 3.69 mg/100 g. The granulated NCS products, in which acetaldehyde and dimethyl sulfide were the main volatile compounds, gave less aroma components than traditional NCS. The use of different sugarcane cultivars thus influenced the quality attributes of granulated non-centrifugal sugar products." .

High pressure processing as a pre-treatment before aqueous enzymatic extraction also enhanced tocopherols and total polyphenolic content in oils. The percentage free fatty acid and peroxide values indicated that under the initial extraction parameters, the oils were stable and they all met the standards for virgin olive oil set by the International Olive Oil Council. Residual meals from both extraction processes contained low protein contents ranging from 2.4 to 4.6 %.

However, most of the resulted optimum lightweight components usually have complex structures which cannot be produced successfully by traditional manufacturing processes. Selective laser melting is one of the additive manufacturing processes. It shows powerful capacity in the manufacturing of metal components with complex structures. Therefore, the combination of topology optimisation and selective laser melting shows a promising prospect for metal components. However, support structures were usually introduced during the selective laser melting manufacturing process, which resulted to some disadvantages, for example, the support structures are generally difficult to remove from the original components because it is difficult to clamping and machining. Therefore, a design method was proposed in this study, named lightweight and support-free design method, the detailed design process and advantages were presented. In the design process, topology optimisation was applied to realise lightweight design, and support-free design process was developed to meet the support-free requirement. Finally, as a case, a cross-beam component was designed using the proposed method, and the final model was produced successfully using selective laser melting process. The case study result verified that the proposed design method is effective to design lightweight and support-free industrial metal components for SLM process." .

Two MLP algorithms are used: the MLP-S based only on spectral parameters and the MLP-ST that use both spectral and textural features. The MLP model is created with three layers (input, hidden, and output) that consist of 6 output neurons in the output layer that represent the 6 rain intensities classes: very high, moderate to high, moderate, light to moderate, light and no rain and 10 spectral input neurons for the MLP-S and 15 input neurons for MLP-ST, which as ten spectral features that were calculated from MSG thermal infrared brilliance temperature and brilliance temperature difference and as five textural features, and The rainfall intensity areas classified by the proposed technique are validated against ground-based radar data. The rainfall rates used in the training set are derived from Setif radar measurements (Algeria). The results obtained after applying this method show that the introduction of textural parameters as additional information works in improving the classification of different rainfall intensities pixels in the MSG/SEVIRI imagery compared to the techniques based only on spectral information. These results are compared with results obtained with the probability of rainfall intensity (PRI). This comparison revealed a clear outperformance of the MLP algorithms over the PRI algorithms.

Marine X-band radars (MRs) have the advantage over buoys that they can measure “model-free” two-dimensional (2D) wave spectra. This study presents the first comprehensive validation of MR-derived multi-directional wave characteristics. It is based on wave data from the 2010 Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific (ITOP) experiment in the Philippine Sea, namely MR measurements from R/V Roger Revelle, Extreme Air–Sea Interaction (EASI) buoy measurements, as well as WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) modeling results. Buoy measurements of mean direction and spreading as function of frequency, which do not require data adaptive methods, are used to validate the WW3 wave spectra. An advanced MR wave retrieval technique is introduced that addresses various shortcomings of existing methods. Spectral partitioning techniques, applied to MR and WW3 results, reveal that multimodal seas are frequently present. Both data sets are in excellent agreement, tracking the evolution of up to 4 simultaneous wave systems over extended time periods. This study demonstrates MR’s and WW3’s strength at measuring and predicting 2D wave spectra in swell-dominated seas." .

First a complete analytical model is developed by coupling electrostatic force with the bending moment of cantilever to produce vertical actuation at a resonance frequency. Then displacement of the cantilever is correlated with piezoresistive mechanism for mass sensing. We assumed mass of blood cells as the external load on cantilever tip which results in shift in resonance frequency.

The buried concrete structure stores sulfur in high temperature so sulfur pits are generally designed by performing structural analysis, which includes temperature gradient between inner and outer sulfur pit wall as load. The temperature gradient is strongly affected by the sphere of thermal influence in the ground surrounding the sulfur pit. However, there is no guideline to determine the value of the said sphere of thermal influence. This results in the designer using an arbitrary and empirical value for the sphere of thermal influence. For this reason, heat transfer analysis of the sulfur pit surrounded by ground is conducted. Considering the sulfur pit’s wall thickness and thermal properties of insulator as parameters, the temperature variations with time in the sulfur pit wall and ambient ground are investigated numerically. A design formula for determining the thermal sphere is also proposed from the numerical results and would be utilized to calculate the temperature gradient of sulfur pit." .

In this paper, a probability-based model of hurricane damage assessment for coastal constructions is proposed taking into account the non-stationarity in hurricane intensity and frequency. The non-homogeneous Poisson process is employed to model the non-stationarity in hurricane occurrence while the non-stationarity in hurricane intensity is reflected by the time-variant statistical parameters (e.g., mean value and/or standard deviation), with which the mean value and variation of the cumulative hurricane damage are evaluated explicitly. The Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA, is chosen to illustrate the hurricane damage assessment method proposed in this paper. The role of non-stationarity in hurricane intensity and occurrence rate due to climate change in hurricane damage is investigated using some representative changing patterns of hurricane parameters." .

In determining these peak values dynamic analysis is done which requires either response history analysis (RHA), also called time history analysis, or response spectrum analysis (RSA), both of which depend upon ground motion severity. In the past, PGA has been used to describe ground motion severity, because seismic force on a rigid body is proportional to the ground acceleration. However, it has been pointed out that single highest peak on accelerograms is a very unreliable description of the accelerograms as a whole. In this study, we are considering 0.2- and 1-s spectral acceleration.

We conducted a simulation to compare the three strategies to determine the best one regarding lead time reduction. Our results indicate that for simple tasks when variability is low, the mean strategy is best. When the variability is moderate, we suggest the worst case strategy, which usually has a lower cost and exhibits a similar effect on lead time as the mean and variability strategies. When variability is high, as expected, the variability strategy is best. In addition, for complex tasks, the mean strategy is always the best option. However, for situations in which it is not possible to improve the mean, the worst case strategy is an excellent alternative in a manufacturing environment with low variability.

One way to forge a flashless crankshaft within three steps is to use cross wedge rolling, multi-directional forging and final forging. This paper presents the investigation results regarding the influence of the forming angle α in cross wedge rolling on different parameters at multi-directional forging. First, the state of the art is presented. As a basis for the investigations the process development and tool design of cross wedge rolling and multi-directional forging are described. Afterwards the paper’s results regarding the influence of the forming angle α on flash generation, billet temperatures, forming degree, forming forces and effective strain will be presented as a parameter study. Generally, flash is generated because a rotation-symmetric billet is forced into an asymmetric movement. The influence of an increasing forming angle leads to a higher amount of flash at the bottom of the crankwebs." .

Imaging trabecular bone has been a key research focus, but advances in resolution have also enabled the detection of cortical bone micro-architecture, particularly the network of vascular canals, commonly referred to as ‘cortical porosity.’ This review aims to provide an overview of what this level of porosity is, why it is important, and how it can be characterized by imaging. Moving beyond a ‘trabeculocentric’ view of bone loss holds the potential to improve diagnosis and monitoring of interventions. Furthermore, cortical porosity is intimately linked to the remodeling process, which underpins bone loss, and thus a larger potential exists to improve our fundamental understanding of bone health through imaging of both humans and animal models." .

A circular-loop antenna is equivalent to uniform parallel double wires with losses and a short circuit load. The characteristic impedance, the propagation coefficient and the inductance, capacitance and resistance per unit length of the uniform parallel double wires with losses can first be expressed as closed solutions, and the mathematical model of the input impedance of the circular-loop antenna can then be derived naturally from the wave equations. Comparison of the data curve from this model with curves from simulations and experiments show that they are similar; however, some discrepancies are observed, and are attributed to the estimation error of the radiation resistance of the circular-loop antenna. As long as the circular-loop antenna is made from an isotropic material and its size remains uniform, the equivalent method is valid electrically for both small- and large-sized circular-loop antennas." .

The line-art emission is achieved through subtractive patterning of the electrolyte layer with a stylus, and the single-step patterning can be either manual for personalization and uniqueness or automated for high throughput and repeatability. We demonstrate that the light emission is effectuated by cation-assisted electron injection in the patterned regions and that the resulting emissive lines can be as narrow as a few micrometers. The versatility of the method is demonstrated through the attainment of a wide range of light-emission patterns and colors using a variety of different materials.

The results show the highest resistivity of C30 at the early stage until a point when C50 accelerated and overtook the others. It has been experimentally confirmed that the crossing point of C30 and C50 corresponds to the final setting time of C50. From resistivity derivative curve, four different stages were observed upon which the hydration process is classified; these are dissolution, induction, acceleration and deceleration periods. Consequently, restrained shrinkage crack and setting time results demonstrated that C50 set and cracked the earliest. The cracking time of all the samples occurred within a reasonable experimental period thus the novel plastic ring is a convenient method for predicting concrete’s crack potential. The highest inflection time (t i) obtained from resistivity curve and the final setting time (t f) were used with crack time (t c) in coming up with mathematical models for the prediction of concrete’s cracking age for the range of concrete grade considered. Finally, an ANSYS numerical simulation supports the experimental findings in terms of the earliest crack age of C50 and the crack location." .

The thickness of the ultrathin films is revealed to be several tens of nanometers. Weak antilocalization effects and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations have been observed in the magneto-transport measurements on individual films with different thickness, and the two-dimensional surface conduction plays a dominant role. The Fermi level is found to be 81 meV above the Dirac point, and the carrier mobility can reach ~6030 cm2/(Vs) for the 10-nm film. When the film thickness decreases from 30 to 10 nm, the Fermi level will move 8 meV far from the bulk valence band. The coefficient α in the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation is shown to be ~0.5, manifesting that only the bottom surface of the Bi2Te3 ultrathin films takes part in transport conductions. These will pave the way for understanding thoroughly the surface transport properties of topological insulators." .

However, a large number of toxicological studies clearly show that diesel engine emissions profoundly affect human health. Thus the interest in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these effects is large, especially concerning the nature of the components of diesel exhaust responsible for the effects and how they could be eliminated from the exhaust. This review describes the fundamental properties of diesel exhaust as well as the human respiratory tract and concludes that adverse health effects of diesel exhaust not only emerge from its chemical composition, but also from the interplay between its physical properties, the physiological and cellular properties, and function of the human respiratory tract. Furthermore, the primary molecular and cellular mechanisms triggered by diesel exhaust exposure, as well as the fundamentals of the methods for toxicological testing of diesel exhaust toxicity, are described. The key aspects of adverse effects induced by diesel exhaust exposure described herein will be important for regulators to support or ban certain technologies or to legitimate incentives for the development of promising new technologies such as catalytic diesel particle filters." .

First, the FEA method is used to study the influence of temperature cycling profile parameters on the thermal fatigue life of 63Sn–37Pb solder joints. Then, a modified Norris–Landzberg model is proposed by introducing ramp time and dwell time with an added weight value. Finally, the temperature cycling ALT is regarded as a special multi-stress ALT to study its optimum design method. The uniform design theory is used to determine the combined mode. The optimum model is established with the objective of minimizing the asymptotic variance of the estimation of median lifetime under normal use conditions, and the simulation example shows the workability of the proposed method." .

The aim of this paper is to investigate the applicability of WaveWatch-III wave model to fatigue assessment of offshore floating structures. The applicability was investigated for Bluewaters’ FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) which had been turret moored at Sable field for half a decade. The waves were predicted as sea-state time series consisting of one wind sea and one swell. The predicted waves were compared with wave data obtained from ERA-interim and buoy measurements. Furthermore, the fatigue calculations were also carried out for main deck and side shell locations. It has been concluded that predicted fatigue damages of main deck using WaveWatch-III are in a very good agreement regardless of differences in predicted wind waves and swells caused by differences in wave system partitioning. When compared to buoy measurements, the model underestimates fatigue damages of side shell by approximately 30 %. The reason for that has been found in wider directional spreading of actual waves. The WaveWatch-III wave model has been found suitable for the fatigue assessment. However, more attention should be paid on relative wave directionality, wave system partitioning and uncertainty analysis in further development." .

In Europe, EU legislation (the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive), international conventions (OSPAR, HELCOM) and national environmental objectives emphasize the need to reduce the input of nutrients to freshwater and marine environments. A widely used method to achieve this is to allow water to pass through a created or restored wetland. However, the large variation in measured nutrient removal rates in such wetlands calls for a systematic review. MethodsSearches for primary studies were performed in electronic databases and on the internet. One author performed the screening of all retrieved articles at the title and abstract level. To check that the screening was consistent and complied with the agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria, subsets of 100 articles were screened by the other authors. When screening at full-text level the articles were evenly distributed among the authors. Kappa tests were used to evaluate screening consistency. Relevant articles remaining after screening were critically appraised and assigned to three quality categories, from two of which data were extracted. Quantitative synthesis consists of meta-analyses and response surface analyses. Regressions were performed using generalized additive models that can handle nonlinear relationships and interaction effects. ResultsSearches generated 5853 unique records. After screening on relevance and critical appraisal, 93 articles including 203 wetlands were used for data extraction. Most of the wetlands were situated in Europe and North America. The removal rate of both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is highly dependent on the loading rate. Significant relationships were also found for annual average air temperature (T) and wetland area (A). Median removal rates of TN and TP were 93 and 1.2 g m−2 year−1, respectively. Removal efficiency for TN was significantly correlated with hydrologic loading rate (HLR) and T, and the median was 37 %, with a 95 % confidence interval of 29–44 %. Removal efficiency for TP was significantly correlated with inlet TP concentration, HLR, T, and A. Median TP removal efficiency was 46 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 37–55 %. Although there are small differences in average values between the two quality categories, the variation is considerably smaller among high quality studies compared to studies with lower quality. This suggests that part of the large variation between studies may be explained by less rigorous study designs. ConclusionsOn average, created and restored wetlands significantly reduce the transport of TN and TP in treated wastewater and urban and agricultural runoff, and may thus be effective in efforts to counteract eutrophication. However, restored wetlands on former farmland were significantly less efficient than other wetlands at TP removal. In addition, wetlands with precipitation-driven HLRs and/or hydrologic pulsing show significantly lower TP removal efficiencies compared to wetlands with controlled HLRs. Loading rate (inlet concentrations × hydraulic loading rates) needs to be carefully estimated as part of the wetland design. More research is needed on the effects of hydrologic pulsing on wetlands. There is also a lack of evidence for long-term (>20 years) performance of wetlands." .

Compared with internal combustion engines, electric motors can have a more accurate torque feedback which brings a lot of advantages to vehicle dynamics and stability control. However, motors used in electric vehicles are facing more difficult conditions than those in conventional applications, such as extreme high/low temperature changing, vibration, aging, etc. The variation of motor parameters due to harsh working conditions can lead to serious problems for motor torque estimation and thus dynamic control of electric vehicles. In this paper, a new method using kriging to estimate the back EMF and thus accurately calculate motor torque in an on-line fashion is presented. With motor speed and rotor position as inputs, kriging predicts back EMF as the output that is used to calculate the motor torque with three phase currents. Using this novel method, motor torque can be accurately calculated even facing high/low temperatures or aging conditions. Experimental tests under the high temperature have been conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed method." .

Membrane fouling was characterized by pure water flux decline, change in membrane hydrophilicity and infrared spectroscopy. Natural organic matter present in field water causes severe membrane fouling. The presence of divalent cations further aggravated fouling. Use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polyacrylic acids (PAA) in feed resulted in the decrease in membrane fouling. Pretreatment of field water is a must if it is contaminated with micro-organism having membrane fouling potential. Feed water pretreatment and use of PAA restricted membrane fouling to 16 % after 60 h of filtration. Membrane permeate flux decline was maximum at the first 12 h and thereafter remained steady at around 45–46 lm−2h−1 till the end of 60 h.

Raman spectroscopy showed the characteristic peaks of MoS2 film with decreasing separation between the A1g and E2g1 peaks for a shorter time of deposition or smaller thickness of the film. MoS2 films on sapphire substrate showed additional peaks due to MoO3 and Mo4O11 phases. Films on Si substrate and graphene on Cu contained only the characteristic peaks. MoS2 films on graphene suppressed the graphene peak as a result of large fluorescence background in the Raman spectrum. Interfacial effects and the presence of an oxygen impurity are considered responsible for the large fluorescence background in the Raman spectrum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated substrate interaction with the films on sapphire and Si. Coverage of the film on the substrates is uniform with uniform distribution of the Mo and S as evidenced from the x-ray maps. Atomic force microscopy image revealed the surface of the film on sapphire to be very smooth.

The mass and gravity field are derived from measured spacecraft velocity perturbations at fly-by distances between 10 and 100 kilometres.

The elemental composition and microstructure of the soil was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The specific gravity, Atterberg limits, compaction, strength and permeability characteristics of the soil was determined for various dosages of the bio-enzyme. The mountain soil is classified as clayey sand and A-2–4, according to unified soil classification and AASHTO classification systems, respectively. With increasing dosage of the bio-enzyme, the plasticity index, maximum dry unit weight and permeability of the soil decreased, while its 28-day California bearing ratio value, unconfined compressive strength and shear strength increased. Consequently, the application of bio-enzyme to the soil improved its plasticity and strength, and reduced its permeability. It, therefore, became more workable and its subgrade quality was improved for use as a road pavement layer material.

The developed bond model has the advantage over the explicit DEM that large time step or displacement increment can be used. The tensile and shear strength criteria of the bond model are formulated based on the modified Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion. The torque transmission of bonds is introduced based on rolling resistance model. The loss of shear or tensile strength, or torque transmission will lead to the breakage of bonds, and turn the bond into purely frictional contact. Three simple examples are first used to validate the bond model. Numerical examples of uniaxial and biaxial compression tests are used to show its potential in modeling cemented geomaterials. Numerical results show that elastic bonds are indeed necessary for the modeling of cemented granular material under static conditions." .

Different atmospheric physical parameterizations in WRF model were investigated through ten groups of numerical experiments. Results of atmosphere, ocean wave and current features were compared with storm observations, ERA-Interim data, NOAA sea surface temperature data, AVISO current data and HYCOM data, respectively. It was found that the storm track and intensity are sensitive to the cumulus and radiation schemes in WRF, especially around the storm center area. As a result, using Kain–Fritsch cumulus scheme, Goddard shortwave radiation scheme and RRTM longwave radiation scheme in WRF may lead to much larger wind intensity, significant wave height, current intensity, as well as lower SST and sea surface pressure. Thus, they are not recommended for this study. Ocean parameters such as significant wave height, SST and current speed are more sensitive to Single-Moment 6-class microphysics scheme than to Eta microphysics scheme at the storm center. By analyzing modeled data with JASON-2 altimeter data, ERA-Interim data and HYCOM data in terms of fitting coefficient, root-mean-square error, correlation coefficient and model performance, the recommended atmospheric physical parameterization in this coupled system, have been obtained." .

We also numerically touch upon settings, where the conditions do not hold, illustrating, in line also with recent experimental work, that non-monotonic waves bearing non-vanishing tails may exist in the latter case." .

A series of 2d FE analyses have been carried out in parametric form in order to investigate the effects of tunnel excavation velocity relative to the soil consolidation rate and the hydraulic boundary conditions at the tunnel boundary. The shield advancement process has been simulated with a simplified procedure incorporating both volume loss and ovalization of the tunnel section. In order to investigate the relative importance of soil consolidation during the excavation process, different characteristic times for the tunnel face advancement and for the consolidation process around the tunnel have been considered, for the two limiting conditions of fully permeable liner and impervious liner. The potential damage induced by the tunnel excavation on existing structures, based on computed ground surface distortions and horizontal deformations, has been found to vary significantly with time during the consolidation process. The results of the simulations allowed to obtain useful information on the minimum tunnel face advancement speed for which the assumption of fully undrained conditions for the soil during the excavations is acceptable, as well as on the speed range for which solving the fully coupled hydromechanical problem is necessary." .

The tracheoesophageal prosthesis is idealized as a first-order approximation using a straight, constant diameter tube. The flow is scaled according to Reynolds, Strouhal, and Euler numbers to ensure dynamic similarity. Flow pulsatility is produced by a driven orifice that approximates the kinematics of the pharyngoesophageal segment during tracheoesophageal speech. Particle image velocimetry data are acquired in three orthogonal planes as the flow exits the model prosthesis and enters the esophageal tract. Contrary to prior investigations performed in steady flow with the prosthesis oriented in-line with the flow direction, the fluid dynamics are shown to be highly unsteady, suggesting that the esophageal pressure field will be similarly complex. A large vortex ring is formed at the inception of each phonatory cycle, followed by the formation of a persistent jet. This vortex ring appears to remain throughout the entire cycle due to the continued production of vorticity resulting from entrainment between the prosthesis jet and the curved esophageal walls. Mean flow in the axial direction of the esophagus produces significant stretching of the vortex throughout the phonatory cycle. The stagnation point created by the jet impinging on the esophageal wall varies throughout the cycle due to fluctuations in the jet trajectory, which most likely arises due to flow separation within the model prosthesis. Applications to tracheoesophageal speech, including shortcomings of the model and proposed future plans, are discussed." .

The reliability problem of compressor impeller of turbocharger for vehicle application when diesel engines operate in plateau area is studied. Firstly, the rule that the rotational speed of turbocharger changes with the altitude height is presented, and the potential failure modes of compressor impeller are analyzed. Then, the failure behavior models of compressor impeller are built, and the reliability models of compressor impeller operating in plateau area are developed. Finally, the rule that the reliability of compressor impeller changes with the altitude height is studied, the measurements for improving the reliability of the compressor impellers of turbocharger operating in plateau area are given. The results indicate that when the operating speed of diesel engine is certain, the rotational speed of turbocharger increases with the increase of altitude height, and the failure risk of compressor impeller with the failure modes of hub fatigue and blade resonance increases. The reliability of compressor impeller decreases with the increase of altitude height, and it also decreases as the increase of number of the mission profile cycle of engine. The method proposed can not only be used to evaluating the reliability of compressor impeller when diesel engines operate in plateau area but also be applied to direct the structural optimization of compressor impeller." .

The parameters associated with the water vapor diffusion are usually measured by using the instantaneous profile method. This method is very time-consuming because the drying process lasts a long time. In this study, a bottom heating method is proposed to accelerate the drying process in a loess soil column. A constant temperature of 70 °C is applied at the bottom of the soil column. The thermo-hydraulic response of the loess is monitored along the soil column. A numerical model is developed to simulate the coupled thermo-hydraulic process. The numerical model is used to back analyze the tortuosity τ of the loess for vapor diffusion and the parameter a of an empirical evaporation function. We found that the bottom heating accelerated the drying process of the soil column by almost 22 d compared with the conditions without heating under the same evaporation boundary. Before Day 15, the proportions of the enhanced vapor flux in the total water loss were higher than 50%, dominating the evaporation process. The experimental and numerical study demonstrated that the proposed heating method is able to obtain the parameters of vapor diffusion more efficiently than the conventional method." .

The polymer matrix creates steric hindrances for this reaction and impedes the shrinkage process accompanying the opening of С=С bonds. As a result, internal stresses develop in the polymer, the heat of polymerization of methacrylate groups decreases compared with the polymerization of methyl methacrylate, and the full conversion of double bonds is prevented. The relaxation of internal stresses and of excess free volume leads to the spontaneous cracking of network polymers and causes formation of regular adhesive-shrinkage patterns. The process of superslow relaxation of internal stresses in polymer films has been ascertained, and the mechanochemical model of this process has been advanced.

The potential consequences in case of single or multiple shocks are investigated through a large set of simulations, applying a simplified non-linear structural model on a stock of masonry buildings taken from real cases. The results allow an estimation of the changes in vulnerability, with reference to the European Macroseismic Scale classification, for the buildings that suffered a specific damage in a prior shock. Simulations reckon a significant difference in the macroseismic intensity assignments, especially when the same damage is associated to single or multiple seismic shocks. We highlight the potential bias due to the cumulative damage on the correlation between macroseismic intensity and ground motion parameters, and we formulate a proposal for testing on the field, in the case of future earthquakes, what has been here investigated through a simplified simulation." .

If the feed rate is too small, the roughness of the surface could be improved but the reflectiveness would be decreased because of damaging the profile. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a lapping method to reduce the roughness by removing the machining mark, while the reflectiveness can be kept at the original level simultaneously. In this study, the novel lapping method, using strands of wool fibers to deliver the abrasive slurry to rub against the lens, was proposed for removing the machining marks on the mold of a lenticular lens by lapping without damaging the profile of the mold. Even though the normal pressure applied by the wool strands onto the mold surface is very low, the coefficient of friction would be increased significantly with the application of the abrasive slurry. The combined effect was to provide a relatively large shear force to lap the surface with a minimal normal force. Therefore, the proposed method could theoretically avoid damaging the lens while effectively removing the irregularities that appeared on the surfaces. In order to evaluate the proposed lapping method, we firstly lapped the machining marks with different lapping parameters (speed, grit size, time, and pressure) to find out the relationship between these parameters and roughness with the same profile of the mold. Secondly, the optimal lapping parameters were designed based on the above lapping results to deduce the best lapping solution for processing the machining marks. Thirdly, the lapped surface profile of the mold was test by optical profiling system, and the features of the surface can be categorized into various spectral distribution groups. Finally, by comparing the variation of the spectral distribution groups, it is verified that based on our proposed methodology, selective removal of surface spectral groups of features becomes possible." .

The long distance away from the shore also brings many difficulties to energy supply for the platform operation. How to reduce the response of the platform and convert the wave energy into electrical power is a meaningful topic. In this paper, a tuned heave plate system (THP) is presented and designed to be employed on a semi-submersible platform for heave motion suppression and energy harvesting. This THP system is composed of spring supports, a power take-off system (PTO), and a heave plate. The PTO system is a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG), which could directly convert the kinetic energy of the heave plate into electronic power. The stiffness of the spring supports is designed based on the principle of the tuned mass damper (TMD). The numerical model of the platform and the THP system is established according to the hydrodynamic analysis results of the platform. The model is tested and modified by scale model tests on the platform in the wave tank. A parameter study, including the size, tuned period, and damping ratio of the THP system, is conducted systematically based on the numerical model. The optimal parameters of the THP are selected due to the maximum heave motion reduction under severe wave conditions in South China Sea. The performance of the semi-submersible with and without the THP system under different wave conditions is analyzed. It is demonstrated that this novel tuned heave plate system could reduce the heave motion of the semi-submersible platform significantly and generate considerable power, which makes the THP system have a broad prospect for development." .

The fundamental principle is that track fees should be set as close as possible to optimal congestion tolls on a track segment. Since this procedure gives an incentive to keep capacity inefficiently low in order to increase congestion tolls, the second principle is that track fees be devoted to paying for track maintenance, the opportunity cost of land, and the amortization of plant and equipment installed on the track. The third principle is that track fees should be set by traffic and cost conditions on a line and should not vary with the identity of the user whose freight is hauled on the line; this third principle is designed to encourage efficient location and mode choice. The combination of these three principles has the promise of increased willingness to use rail logistics systems, the installation of an appropriate level of capacity on each line, and optimal routing and traffic levels throughout the rail system." .

First, the GlobeLand30 data were merged with other satellite remote sensing and climate datasets to regenerate plant functional type (PFT) data fitted for the BCC_CSM. Second, the up-scaling based on an area-weighted approach was used to aggregate the fine-resolution GlobeLand30 land cover type and area percentage with the coarser model grid resolutions globally. The GlobeLand30-based and the BCC_CSM-based land cover data had generally consistent spatial distribution features, but there were some differences between them. The simulation results of the different land cover type dataset change experiments showed that effects of the new PFT data were larger than those of the new glaciers and water bodies (lakes and wetlands). The maximum value was attained when dataset of all land cover types were changed. The positive bias of precipitation in the mid-high latitude of the northern hemisphere and the negative bias in the Amazon, as well as the negative bias of air temperature in part of the southern hemisphere, were reduced when the GlobeLand30-based data were used in the BCC_CSM atmosphere model. The results suggest that the GlobeLand30 data are suitable for use in the BCC_CSM component models and can improve the performance of the land and atmosphere simulations." .

The proposed coupled model requires a thorough pre-processing stage in order to ensure that the interaction between the various blocks which represent both the rock mass foundation and the dam is always edge to edge. The mechanical part of the model, though limited to small displacements, has the advantage of allowing an accurate representation of the stress distribution along the interfaces, such as rock mass joints. The hydraulic part and the mechanical part of the model are fully compatible. The coupled model is validated using a real case of a dam in operation, by comparison of the results with those obtained with a large displacement discrete model. It is shown that it is possible to assess the sliding stability of concrete gravity dams using small displacement models under both static and dynamic conditions." .

Crush deck acts as a platform to transfer the hot sinter cake from sinter machine to crushing unit. Hot sinter cake with a temperature around 800 °C falls on the crush deck from the discharging end of rotating sinter machine. This investigation consists of visual observation, chemical analysis, characterization of microstructures, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and measurement of hardness. Analysis revealed that this is an iron-based material with Cr–Ni alloying with higher hardness and lower toughness, which was due to improper microstructure. Microstructure revealed a large number of primary carbides along with needle-shaped carbides, which drastically reduce the toughness of the material. Application point of view the wear block should have optimum combination of toughness and wear resistance at elevated temperature; however, analyses showed the actual wear block had with higher wear resistance and lower toughness. This was reflected in the undesirable microstructure observed during metallographic study. It was thus concluded that the component failed before a proper life cycle was achieved due to poor material properties. Based on the failure analysis suitable heat treatment process was recommended. Metallurgical study carried out on the suggested material, showed significant improvements in material property. Trial of recommended wear block was taken at the plant level and life of the recommended material improved twice than that of previous one." .

Within the magnetohydrodynamic approximation we show that an efficient suppression of plasma heat conduction by amagnetic field perturbation inside the CL serves as an instability condition. The instability in the linear phase grows in the characteristic radiative plasma cooling time. A periodic structure of cold and hot filaments located across the direction of the electric current can be formed as a result of the instability in the CL. The proposed mechanism of the thermal instability of a reconnecting CL can be useful for explaining the sequential brightening (“ignition”) of flare loops in solar flares." .

The objective of this study was the physical–chemical characterization of six vegetable fibers in order to apply them in chicken burger formulations as animal fat substitutes. The studied fibers showed moisture content below 14 %, low content of fat, protein and ash, and high levels of carbohydrates. The oat, wheat and bamboo fibers showed the highest content of total dietary fiber. All fibers presented good results of technological characterization, but bamboo, pea and wheat fibers showed the best hygroscopic property results, good emulsifying stability, and color compatible for application in meat products. The use of vegetable fibers in chicken burgers resulted in lower or equal hardness values when the experiments were compared to the control sample. Most samples showed elasticity, adhesiveness, cohesiveness and chewiness values significantly equal to the control sample. The sensory analysis results indicated that all samples had good acceptability. The use of vegetable fibers in chicken burgers proved to be a promising alternative for food manufacturers to combine products deemed unhealthy with functional ingredients that are more appealing for consumers.

The generated hydrochar solids are a hygienic, homogenized, carbon rich and energy dense product with economic value that can be used as an alternative to wood-based charcoal or fossil fuel. Obtaining a satisfactory energy efficiency of the process is, however, one of the prerequisites for the possible breakthrough of this technology. In an experimental HTC reactor, a model kitchen/market waste feedstock (17.8 MJ/kgdb) was hydrothermally carbonized with varying loading rates (TS 20 and 25 %) under mild operational conditions with peak temperatures of 160–190 °C and process times of 2–10 h above 160 °C. The aim was to evaluate the energy ratio of the process under these conditions while examining the impact on the hydrochar quality. Results show that the chemical properties of the produced hydrochar and its heating value were of moderate quality (21.1–24.4 MJ/kgdb), showing similar characteristics like torrefied products. HTC of a 25 % TS-load during 2 h at 180 °C and maximum pressure of 18.3 bar resulted in a char chemical output energy that is twice as high as the electrical energy consumed in the process. If considering the theoretical methane potential of the process water, the energy ratio could be increased to 2.6; while reactor insulation could further enhance this ratio to 3. This article reveals the merits of mild HTC and provides relevant knowledge for attaining an optimized, energy efficient HTC system." .

The ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) methods have been applied for extraction of diosgenin. In case of UAE, the maximum diosgenin was obtained from fenugreek seed powder with 80 % ethanol solution for 50 min, whereas the maximum diosgenin in MAE was obtained at 80 % ethanol solution for 4 min.

Recently, polymer-based composite materials’ surface performances—in particular, surface in relative motion—have been improved markedly by thermal spray coating. Despite this recent progress, the deposition of high-strength materials—producing a coating thickness of the order of more than 500 μm—remains highly challenging. In the present work, a highly dense and thick titanium coating was successfully deposited onto the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) substrate using a newly developed high-pressure warm spray (WS) system. The coating properties, such as hardness (300 ± 20 HV) and adhesion strength (8.1 ± 0.5 MPa), were evaluated and correlated with the microstructures of the coating. In addition, a wipe-test and in situ particle velocity and temperature measurement were performed to validate the particle deposition behavior as a function of the nitrogen flow rate in the WS system. It was found that the microstructures, deposition efficiency, and mechanical properties of the coatings were highly sensitive to nitrogen flow rates. The coating porosity increased with increasing nitrogen flow rates; however, the highest density was observed for nitrogen flow rate of 1000 standard liters per minute (SLM) samples due to the high fraction of semi-molten particles in the spray stream." .

Vulnerability is a function to be minimized for the target (GCV) to survive enemy’s attack. Vulnerability of GCV can be assessed by calculating the vulnerable area out of the projected area of GCV on the projection plane which is vertical to a shotline. To calculate the vulnerable area, the CAD model of GCV including components and subassemblies should be carefully designed considering how the damage of a part of GCV will affect three other major functions of GCV. This relationship can be obtained by target functional modeling (TFM) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). TFM is a diagram that shows the relationship between one of the components and one of the major performance functions of GCV. Using TFM, the components can be classified into critical and noncritical components. The other tool, FTA, is the deductive method to analyze the cause of failure of the target. This paper suggests the unified process of assessing vulnerability of GCV using TFM and FTA using SLAP (Shot Line Analysis Program,) which was developed using C/C++." .

For welding T-joint structural steel S355JR by metal active gas welding, the published experiment results of temperature and displacement fields are applied to illustrate the credibility of the proposed integration model. By comparing numerical results of four different cases with the experiment results, it is verified that prediction precision of welding deformations and residual stresses is apparently improved considering the power-law hardening model, and computational time is also obviously shortened about 30.14% using multi-constraint equations. On the whole, the proposed hybrid method can be further used to precisely and efficiently predict welding deformations and residual stresses of large-scale structures." .

In addition, the formation and growth behavior of AlN inclusions during solidification under different cooling conditions were analyzed with the help of thermodynamics and dynamics. The inclusions formed in the high manganese TWIP steels are classified into nine types: (1) AlN; (2) MgO; (3) CaS; (4) MgAl2O4; (5) AlN + MgO; (6) MgO + MgS; (7) MgO + MgS + CaS; (8) MgO + CaS; (9) MgAl2O4 + MgS. With the increase in the cooling rate, the volume fraction and area ratio of inclusions are almost constant; the size of inclusions decreases and the number density of inclusions increases in the steels. The thermodynamic results of inclusion types calculated with FactSage are consistent with the observed results. With increasing cooling rate, the diameter of AlN decreases. When the cooling rate increases from 0.75 to 4.83 K s−1, the measured average diameter of AlN decreases from 4.49 to 2.42 μm. Under the high cooling rate of 4.83 K s−1, the calculated diameter of AlN reaches 3.59 μm at the end of solidification. However, the calculated diameter of AlN increases to approximately 5.93 μm at the end of solidification under the low cooling rate of 0.75 K s−1. The calculated diameter of AlN decreases with increasing cooling rate. The theoretical calculation results of the change in diameter of AlN under the different cooling rates have the same trend with the observed results. The existences of inclusions in the steels, especially AlN which average sizes are 2.42 and 4.49 μm, respectively, are not considered to have obvious influences on the hot ductility." .

The particles are then coated with nickel using an electro-less method. The degree of nickel deposition is confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively through surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy. To characterize the nickel coatings, elemental analysis is also conducted by using X-ray diffraction. Thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) enable comparisons between the uncoated and coated aluminum, and the reaction process are investigated through fine structural analysis of the particle surfaces and cross sections. There are little difference in reactivity as a function of oxidant type. However, a strong exothermic reaction in the smaller nickel-coated aluminum particles near the melting point of aluminum accelerates the reaction of the smaller particles. Explanation of the reactivity of the nickel-coated aluminum depending on the particle sizes is attempted." .

The Al–Na system is reassessed using the modified quasichemical model for the liquid phase. All the terminal solid solutions were remodeled using the compound energy formalism. The thermodynamic properties of the ternary systems are estimated from the models of the binary systems and the ternary compound using the CALPHAD method. The reaction pathways for the systems MgH2/AlH3, MgH2/NaAlH4, and MgH2/Na3AlH6 are calculated and compared to the experimental data from the literature. Details about the reaction mechanisms and temperatures, the amount of the products, and their composition are revealed and discussed in this work. The calculations show that in the composites MgH2/NaAlH4 and MgH2/Na3AlH6, the components spontaneously destabilize mutually in specific relative amounts by forming NaMgH3, which may play only a catalytic role on the decomposition of (MgH2 + Al) mixture, NaAlH4, or Na3AlH6. Also, Al destabilizes MgH2 and NaMgH3 by forming β phase and reducing the decomposition temperatures of these hydrides by more than 50 °C. The constructed database is successfully used to reproduce the pressure–composition isotherms (PCIs) for Mg-10 at% Al and Mg-4 at% Al alloys at 350 °C. The results provide a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms in the PCIs found in the literature concerning the number of plateau pressures and their sloping. It is shown that the first plateau pressure observed during the PCIs of Al–Mg alloys depends on Al content and is higher than that of pure Mg. This difference is due to Al solubility in hcp-Mg." .

With 6 % population growth rate, demand for fresh water from fossil fuel based desalination plants will grow at an alarming rate. It has been reported that Saudi Arabia’s reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity and generate fresh water through desalination using the same energy source is economically and politically unsustainable. This may lead to destabilisation of the global economy. However, Saudi Arabia has large geothermal resources along the Red Sea coast that can be developed to generate power and support the generation of fresh water through desalination. The cost of fresh water can be further lowered from the current US$ 0.03/m3.

A freezing front penetrates rock crack networks and causes its propagation. To study the evolution of rock mass stability, a suitable model of stress generated by freezing in open rock cracks is needed. This stress evaluated by the simple volume expansion model in a closed crack is too high to be realistic. In this paper, we present an assessment method for this stress and some results. Different experiments on notched limestone specimens submitted to freeze–thaw cycles were performed. Three different tight limestones (Larrys, Chamesson, Pierre de Lens) were tested. Actually, the stress generated by freezing begins to grow at the top of the notch where an ice plug is created and makes it possible for higher stresses to develop in deeper parts of the notch. Consequently, the stress induced by freezing depends on the geometry of the open crack represented by the notch. This value is, however, limited by the permeability of the surrounding rock matrix. A model of the stress evolution generated by freezing along an open crack was established and its envelope curve, named maximum stress, was parameterized. This maximum stress generated by freezing along the crack is completely defined by knowledge of the pore network of the limestone matrix and the geometry of the crack." .

The design parameters adopted in some of the recent case studies based on these classifications indicate that the M rj values for rock masses are higher than those of the corresponding intact rocks. The joint factor, J f, which is defined as a weakness coefficient in rock mass suggests that modulus ratio of rock mass (M rj ) has to be less than the modulus ratio of the corresponding intact rock (M ri ), on the basis of extensive experimental evidence. With joint factor, compressive strength, elastic modulus, cohesion and friction angle were estimated and applied in the analyses of a few cases. The predictions of deformations with this approach agreed well with the field measurements by adapting equivalent continuum approach.

So, how to reuse the embedded manufacturing information plays an important role in the competitive global market for the enterprises increasingly, because it can save enormous time and cost. In this paper, a new method is presented to reuse the existing manufacturing information for the slightly changed 3D design model. First, the hierarchical data structure of process route is introduced to represent the dynamic evolution process of mechanical part model, which takes working procedure model as the carrier of manufacturing information. Second, a multilevel machining feature descriptor which captures different levels of information for each process is designed to search the query machining feature. Moreover, the proposed algorithm of obtaining the main machining feature face for accelerating feature match is given to filter out unmatched feature. Then, the strategies of reusing the manufacturing information are proposed: the matched machining features can automatically obtain the manufacturing information and the unmatched machining features are dealt with by interactive mode. Finally, some slightly changed aircraft structural parts are utilized to verify our proposed method for reusing the manufacturing information. A prototype system has been developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method." .

A parametric finite element analysis with various strength mismatching and bead widths has been conducted on the strain field of side-grooved and normal Charpy specimens. The narrow weld bead promotes the accumulation of plastic strain energy on the base metal side. This feature is more significant in the normal specimen than in the side-grooved specimen. The results show that the method based on the Weibull stress criterion for converting the absorbed energy of the side-grooved specimen to that of the normal specimen can be applied to hybrid laser-arc welds of ultra-high-strength steel. The converted energy is consistent with the absorbed energy measured in the normal specimen.

On the other hand, the influence of strength mismatch ratio on the difference of the absorbed energy is rather weak." .

According to scanning electron microscopy, partial penetration of polymer into the pores of alumina supports takes place giving rise to selective polymeric layers with fiber-like microstructure. Geometric confinement of rigid PIM-1 in the channels of anodic alumina causes reduction of small-scale mobility in polymeric chains. As a result, transport of permanent gases, such as CH4, becomes significantly hindered across composite membranes. Contrary, the transport of condensable gases (CO2, С4H10), did not significantly suffer from the confinement due to high solubility in the polymer matrix. This strategy enables enhancement of selectivity towards CO2 and C4H10 without significant loss of the membrane performance and seems to be prospective for drain and sweetening of natural gas." .

While most such studies have been conducted on constant speed stationary engines and modern engines, this study tried to analyze the effectiveness of an uncoated wall-flow type ceramic diesel particulate filter on a Euro-I, water-cooled, direct injection, variable speed, compression ignition engine in a laboratory set-up in India. Also, this study focused on diesel particulate filter regeneration by two methods: active regeneration by diesel injection in the particulate filter using an electronic control unit and off-board regeneration by taking out and heating the diesel particulate filter in an electrical resistance furnace at 650 °C for 10 h. The results, in the form of smoke emission, NOx emission and engine performance, obtained using both the regeneration methods were analyzed, and conclusions were drawn. It was found that using diesel particulate filter, particulate matter emissions (smoke) were almost entirely eliminated. It was also found that off-board regeneration had numerous advantages compared to active regeneration. Since a furnace would be needed for off-board regeneration, an exchange process for diesel particulate filter is suggested." .

In order to accurately simulate the production performance of shale gas well, it is essential to establish a multi-continuum model for shale gas reservoir. Based on the geometrical scenario of multistage horizontal well fracturing, this paper builds up a triple-continuum model incorporating three systems: matrix with extremely low permeability, less permeable natural fractures and highly permeable hydraulic fractures. This numerical model employs Langmuir adsorption equation to present the influence of desorption gas in matrix and considers the Klinkenberg effect in matrix and natural fractures by adjusting the apparent permeability. The solution of this model is achieved using implicit scheme. Eventually, this model is applied on the single well production situation in a synthetic reservoir, production decline curves and cumulative production curves are obtained, then the sensitivity analysis is made on various kinds of parameters; thus, the influences of these parameters on production rate are obtained: The gas rate will rise with the increase in hydraulic fracture half-length, meshing size, Langmuir volume and Langmuir pressure, but with the decrease in hydraulic fracture spacing." .

In this work we show that mineral particle size controls water loadings achieved by water vapour deposition on 21 contrasting mineral samples exposed to atmospheres of up to ~16 Torr water (70% relative humidity at 25 °C). Submicrometer-sized particles hosted up to ~5 monolayers of water, while micrometer-sized particles up to several thousand monolayers. All films exhibited vibrational spectroscopic signals akin to liquid water, yet with a disrupted network of hydrogen bonds. Water adsorption isotherms were predicted using models (1- or 2- term Freundlich and Do-Do models) describing an adsorption and a condensation regime, respectively pertaining to the binding of water onto mineral surfaces and water film growth by water-water interactions. The Hygroscopic Growth Theory could also account for the particle size dependence on condensable water loadings under the premise that larger particles have a greater propensity of exhibiting of surface regions and interparticle spacings facilitating water condensation reactions. Our work should impact our ability to predict water film formation at mineral surfaces of contrasting particle sizes, and should thus contribute to our understanding of water adsorption and condensation reactions occuring in nature." .

Fluid flow modelling is challenging not only given the uncertainties on subsurface formation intrinsic properties (parameter uncertainty) but also on the modelling choices/assumptions for representing and numerically implementing the processes occurring when CO2 displaces the native brine (model uncertainty). Sensitivity analysis is needed to identify the group of factors which contributes the most to the uncertainties in the predictions. In this paper, we present an approach for assessing the importance of model and parameter uncertainties regarding post-injection trapping of mobile CO2. This approach includes the representation of input parameters, the choice of relevant simulation outputs, the assessment of the mobile plume evolution with a flow simulator and the importance ranking for input parameters. A variance-based sensitivity analysis is proposed, associated with the ACOSSO-like meta-modelling technique to tackle the issues linked with the computational burden posed by the use of long-running simulations and with the different types of uncertainties to be accounted for (model and parameter). The approach is tested on a potential site for CO2 storage in the Paris basin (France) representative of a project in preliminary stage of development. The approach provides physically sound outcomes despite the challenging context of the case study. In addition, these outcomes appear very helpful for prioritizing the future characterisation efforts and monitoring requirements, and for simplifying the modelling exercise." .

Ground vibration is one of the most environmental effects produced by blasting operation. Therefore, the proper prediction of blast-induced ground vibrations is essential to identify safety area of blasting. This paper presents a predictive model based on gene expression programming (GEP) for estimating ground vibration produced by blasting operations conducted in a granite quarry, Malaysia. To achieve this aim, a total number of 102 blasting operations were investigated and relevant blasting parameters were measured. Furthermore, the most influential parameters on ground vibration, i.e., burden-to-spacing ratio, hole depth, stemming, powder factor, maximum charge per delay, and the distance from the blast face were considered and utilized to construct the GEP model. In order to show the capability of GEP model in estimating ground vibration, nonlinear multiple regression (NLMR) technique was also performed using the same datasets. The results demonstrated that the proposed model is able to predict blast-induced ground vibration more accurately than other developed technique. Coefficient of determination values of 0.914 and 0.874 for training and testing datasets of GEP model, respectively show superiority of this model in predicting ground vibration, while these values were obtained as 0.829 and 0.790 for NLMR model." .

The objective of this study was to determine the changes that occur in the lipid composition of the membrane of L. monocytogenes under the conditions of the manufacture and storage of a laboratory-prepared soft cheese (feta type). The results show that L. monocytogenes cells present in the raw milk may survive the cheese manufacturing process as well as the storage period and that the history of the inoculated cells has an effect on their behavior during storage of the cheese. The bacterium seems to follow different pathways and adopt different strategies to preserve the optimal fluidity and functions of the membrane depending on the length of storage time and the history of the inoculated cells. In this context, cells derived from pre-inoculated cells grown in optimal or acidic conditions showed an increase in the number of straight chain fatty acids (SCFA) relative to branched ones (BCFA), without altering the ratio of BCFA C15:0 to BCFA C17:0 and the ratio of iso to anteiso FA. Alternatively, those cells derived from pre-inoculated cells grown in presence of benzalkonium chloride followed a different pathway. These cells achieved a balance between optimal fluidity and solid phase membrane not only by changes in SCFA content, but also by changes in the ratios of BCFA C15:0 to C17:0 and of iso to anteiso fatty acids. This latter approach to maintain membrane fluidity seems to be paired with the different survival trends of the bacterium under the conditions of this study." .

However, ISF has yet to be fully implemented to mainstream high-value manufacturing industries due to a number of technical challenges, all of which are directly related to ISF process parameters. This paper aims to provide a detailed review of the current state-of-the-art of ISF processes in terms of its technological capabilities and specific limitations with discussions on the ISF process parameters and their effects on ISF processes. Particular attention is given to the ISF process parameters on the formability, deformation and failure mechanics, springback and accuracy and surface roughness.

The current motion is computed by solving the phase-averaged 2-D shallow water flow equations reformulated in terms of total-flux velocity, accounting for the effects of wave radiation stresses and general diffusion or mixing induced by current, waves, and wave breaking. The cross-shore boundary conditions are specified by assuming fully developed longshore current and wave setup that are determined using the reduced 1-D momentum equations. A 2-D wave spectral transformation model is used to calculate the wave height, period, direction, and radiation stresses, and a surface wave roller model is adopted to consider the effects of surface roller on the nearshore currents. The nonequilibrium transport of nonuniform total-load sediment is simulated, considering sediment entrainment by current and waves, the lag of sediment transport relative to the flow, and the hiding and exposure effect of nonuniform bed material. The flow and sediment transport equations are solved using an implicit finite volume method on a variety of meshes including nonuniform rectangular, telescoping (quadtree) rectangular, and hybrid triangular/quadrilateral meshes.

An open-ended pipe pile is said to be plugged when the soil inside the pile moves down with the pile, resulting in the pile becoming effectively closed-ended. Plugging is believed to result in an increase in the horizontal stresses between the pile and the surrounding soil, which results in an increase in skin friction. A total number of 60 model pile tests are carried out to investigate the behavior of plugs on the pile load capacity and the effects of plug removal. Different parameters are considered, such as pile diameter–to–length ratio, types of installation in sands of different densities, and removal of the plug in three stages (50, 75, and 100 %) with respect to the length of plug. The changes in the soil plug length and incremental filling ratio (IFR) with the penetration depth during pile driving show that the open-ended piles are partially plugged from the outset of the pile driving. The pile reached a fully plugged state for pressed piles in loose and medium sand and partially plugged (IFR = 10 %) in dense sand. For driven piles, the IFR is about 30 % in loose sand, 20 % in medium sand, and 30 % in dense sand. The pile load capacity increases with increases in the length of the plug length ratio (PLR). The rate of increase in the value of the pile load capacity with PLR is greater in dense sand than in medium and loose sand. Based on test results, new empirical relation for the estimation of the load carrying capacity of open-ended piles based on the IFR is proposed." .

The mechanical properties of these composites largely depend on the mechanical properties of the fibres. In this current study, four phosphate-based glass compositions were produced by replacing Na2O with B2O3 and/or Fe2O3 in the glass system P2O5–CaO–Na2O–MgO, and the P2O5 content was fixed at 45 mol%. The thermal stability of the glasses containing both B2O3 and Fe2O3 and/or FeO (P45B5Fe5 and P45B5Fe3) was significantly higher than that of the only B2O3 (P45B5)- or Fe2O3 (P45Fe3 and P45Fe5)-containing glasses. The viscosity was found to shift to higher temperature with increasing B2O3 and Fe2O3 and/or FeO content. The fragility parameters, m and F 1/2, estimated from the viscosity curve, decrease with B2O3 addition. The improved physical properties of the glasses investigated with B2O3 and Fe2O3 and/or FeO addition were attributed to the replacement of P–O–P bonds with P–O–B and P–O–Fe bonds. The presence of P–O–B and P–O–Fe bonds in the glass structure was confirmed by the FTIR analysis. It was possible to draw continuous fibres up to 3 h from the B2O3- or Fe2O3- and/or FeO-containing glasses, whereas it was difficult to pull fibre from only Fe2O3-containing glasses and the fibre pulling process was not continuous. Therefore, addition of B2O3 to the glass system enabled successful drawing of continuous fibres from glasses with phosphate (P2O5) contents of 45 mol%. It was also observed that addition of only Fe2O3 and/or FeO did not have a significant effect on the fibre mechanical properties, whilst the mechanical properties of the fibres increased with increasing B2O3." .

These coatings strongly attenuate the microwaves used for mobile communications. Here, we present a novel approach to improve radio signal transmission by structuring a low emissivity coating. Laser ablation is used to scribe a line pattern on the coating. The microwave attenuation of the initial coating ranges between −25 and −30 dB between 850 MHz and 3 GHz. The optimized patterning reduces it down to −1.2 ± 0.6 dB. The fraction of the ablated area is relatively low. Our experimental results show that it is possible to reach a level of attenuation close to that of a glass substrate by removing less than 4% of the coating area. The ablated lines are thin enough to not be noticed in most common lighting situations. Therefore, we achieve a dual spectral selectivity: the coated glass is transparent in the visible range, reflective in the infrared and nearly as transparent as its glass substrate to microwaves. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed and show that the attenuation at grazing incidences is dominated by the behaviour of the glass substrate. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that experimental evidence for the combination of such properties is reported and that detailed experimental data are compared to numerical simulations. We anticipate that our findings will be of major importance for the building and transportation sectors." .

Inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) at an early stage of development [12 days posthatch (dph)] were exposed to waters from two estuarine wastewater-treatment outfall locations in a tidal estuary, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta (California, USA) that had varied hydrology and input volumes. The genomic response caused by endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these waters was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a suite of hormonally regulated genes. Relative androgenic and estrogenic activities of the waters were measured using CALUX reporter bioassays. The presence of bifenthrin, a pyrethroid pesticide and known EDC, as well as caffeine and the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen, which were used as markers of wastewater effluent input, were determined using instrumental analysis. Detectable levels of bifenthrin (2.89 ng L−1) were found on one of the sampling dates, and caffeine was found on all sampling dates, in water from the Boynton Slough. Neither compound was detected at the Carquinez Strait site, which has a much smaller effluent discharge input volume relative to the receiving water body size compared with Boynton Slough. Water samples from both sites incubated in the CALUX cell line induced estrogenic and androgenic activity in almost all instances, though the estrogenicity was relatively higher than the androgenicity. Changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts of endocrine-responsive genes and indicators of general chemical stress were observed after a 96-h exposure to waters from both locations. The relative levels of endocrine response, changes in gene transcript abundance, and contaminant concentrations were greater in water from the Boynton Slough site despite those effluents undergoing a more advanced treatment process. The availability of a widely geographically distributed estuarine model species (M. beryllina) now allows for improved assessment of treated effluent impacts across brackish, estuarine, and marine environments." .
