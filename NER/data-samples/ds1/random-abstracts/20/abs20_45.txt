Abstract The origins of modern economic growth and the Industrial Revolution that triggered it can be found in the cultural and institutional developments in early modern Europe. In this era the Republic of Letters emerged as a transnational community that solved many of the incentive problems that plagued the creation and diffusion of science and technology, and paved the way to the Industrial Enlightenment of the eighteenth century.
