Abstract Under study are the polytopes of (0, 1)-normalized convex and 1-convex (dual simplex) n-person TU-games and monotonic big boss games.We solve the characterization problems of the extreme points of the polytopes of 1-convex games, symmetric convex games, and big boss games symmetric with respect to the coalition of powerless agents. For the remaining polytopes, some subsets of extreme points are described.
