Abstract This study examined the interrelationships of two code-related factors (i.e., phoneme detection and silent word reading fluency), one language-related factor (i.e., morphological awareness), and reading comprehension with 45 d/Deaf or hard of hearing (d/Dhh) students in Grades 3â€“8, taking into account any effects of demographic information. A correlational research design was utilized entailing simple Pearson correlations, multiple regressions, and a t-test. Results indicated that morphological awareness was significantly related to English reading comprehension over and beyond the other predictors (i.e., phoneme detection and silent word reading fluency) even with selected demographic (i.e., home language, age, and grade) factors as covariates.
