Abstract This is a review of studies published over the last three years on sexual problems in the Hong Kong Chinese community. It includes the authorâ€™s clinical observations regarding certain sexual problems in Hong Kong. Findings from an earlier period and some overseas studies are cited in the discussion of recent literature. A life-span approach is adopted to reveal the different sexual problems found in different developmental stages, viz., childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. The roots of the sexual problems in Hong Kong are manifold. These include a distorted sexual attitude, inadequate sex education, and a lack of language for sexual expression.
