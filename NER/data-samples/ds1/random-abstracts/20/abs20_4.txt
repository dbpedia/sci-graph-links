Abstract The crisp literature provides characterizations of the preorders that admit a total preorder extension when some pairwise order comparisons are imposed on the extended relation. It is also known that every preorder is the intersection of a collection of total preorders. In this contribution we generalize both approaches to the fuzzy case. We appeal to a construction for deriving the strict preference and the indifference relations from a weak preference relation, that allows to obtain full characterizations in the conditional extension problem. This improves the performance of the construction via generators studied earlier.
