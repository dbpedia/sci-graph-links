Abstract This paper examines the relationships between cultural efficacy, retirement savings, and perceptions of future financial security among New Zealand Māori. Analyses were based on a national probability sample of 563 Māori (355 women, 208 men) who participated in the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. Results showed that Māori with a higher level of cultural efficacy were less likely to be enrolled in KiwiSaver (a State sponsored savings initiative designed to encourage New Zealanders to save for their retirement). At the same time cultural efficacy was linked to an increased positive expectation of future financial security. We propose that this demonstrates resilience of collectivist cultural values among some Māori despite a history of British colonisation. It is proposed that the Māori world view remains holistic, and understandings of economic well-being for Māori need to be expanded to recognise these cultural orientations. The role of Māori identity for economic behaviour is discussed.
