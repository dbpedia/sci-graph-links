Abstract The temperature dependence of the mean polarizability of the H2, N2, and O2 molecules are calculated in the temperature range up to 2000 K. The values of polarizability derivatives of these molecules from the literature are used in the calculation. The temperature dependence of the mean polarizability of molecules is represented in the form of a second degree polynomial.
