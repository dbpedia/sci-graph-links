Abstract PurposeThis study explores the effects of traditional and cultural practices on the spread of Ebola. Problem statementEbola was first identified in Sudan and Zaire in 1976. Since then, there have been sporadic episodes, but the recent outbreak in West Africa, officially declared on March 22, 2014, has been the worst ever. In the three countries most affected (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), Sierra Leone has recorded the most cases. In February 2015, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that nearly 9729 people died from the Ebola virus disease in six countries; Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the USA, and Mali, with more than 23,943 cases identified. Little has been done to examine the role of traditional and cultural practices in the spread of Ebola in these regions. MethodThis research uses the case study approach of a small group of community leaders in Sierra Leone and secondary data to arrive at thematic inferences. ConclusionThe study proposes that traditional and cultural methods of caring for loved ones infected by Ebola enhance the spread of the virus. ImplicationsThe study recommends that changing these practices will significantly reduce the spread of future Ebola outbreaks.
