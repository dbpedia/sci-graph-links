Abstract The present research investigates differences between heterosexuals and gay men in their attitudes toward effeminate and masculine gay men. More specifically, the role of internalized sexual stigma and perceived masculinity were considered to explain emotive reaction toward gay men with gender conforming and non-conforming behaviors. Results showed that effeminate gay men, that is those who enact gender non-conforming behaviors, elicited more negative emotions compared to masculine gay men both in gay and heterosexual respondents with no difference in intensity. Moreover, such negative reactions toward effeminate gay men were more extreme among gay men with high internalized sexual stigma and among heterosexuals with high self-perception of feminine traits. Implications and limitations are discussed.
