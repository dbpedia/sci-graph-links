Abstract This review is a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the International Business literature whose focus is on national culture. The analysis relies on a broad range of bibliometric techniques as productivity rankings, citation analysis (individual and cumulative), study of collaborative research patterns, and analysis of the knowledge base. It provides insights on (1) faculty and institutional research productivity and performance; (2) articles, institutions, and scholarsâ€™ influence in the contents of the field and its research agenda; and (3) national and international collaborative research trends. The study also explores the body of literature that has exerted the greatest impact on the researched set of selected articles.
