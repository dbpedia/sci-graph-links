Abstract Spontaneous gallbladder perforation is rare in children. The etiology of gallbladder perforation varies greatly and is often unknown. Identified causes include infection, congenital, stones or choledochal cysts. Presently there are only five reported cases of spontaneous gallbladder perforation in children in the English literature. As such, the optimal method of diagnosis and management remains controversial. We report the case of a 2-year-old girl who presented with peritonitis secondary to spontaneous gallbladder perforation.
