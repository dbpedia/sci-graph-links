Abstract The goal of the present study is to investigate and to base a new qualitative dimension of the organization’s performance, less addressed in the literature, namely the geocentric behavior dimension. Using a cross-sectional sample covering 215 countries over the period 2012–2015, our research provides empirical evidence on significant impact of the political, cultural and emotional factors (such as happiness), on the organization’s performances from a certain geocentric space. Our study may have significant implications for investors, managers, public entities or business environment, providing measurable evidence on the role of qualitative factors such as those mentioned, which act in a certain geocentric space, on the organization’s performances.
