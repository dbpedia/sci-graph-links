Abstract In “Cartas americanas,” the Spanish writer and literary critic Juan Valera complained about what he considered the “desaforado entusiasmo por la última moda de París” in Spanish-American writers. In particular, he disapproved Carlos Reyles’s central character in his work El extraño, which he considered a copy of French heroes. In “¿Modas o modelos?, el dandi en El extraño y La raza de Caín de Carlos Reyles,” I study Reyles’ fiction and establish that, contrary to Valera’s perception, the dandy in Reyle’s works is not a copy, but rather a genuine representation of a Spanish-American type whose formulation allows Reyles to portray an accurate representation of fin de siècle Uruguayan society.
