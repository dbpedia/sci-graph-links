Abstract Mucinous appendiceal neoplasm occurs in less than 1 % of appendicectomies. Majority of what is known in the literature is about pseudomyxoma peritonei, which exists as its disseminated form. Pictorial imagery of its pre-disseminated form is rarely observed. We present in a case report form a case of low-grade mucinous neoplasm of the appendix resulting in focal intussusception including images captured from this unique case that will become a learning case for readers of the journal.
