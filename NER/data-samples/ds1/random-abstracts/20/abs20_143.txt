Abstract This paper looks at the particular relationship between madness and sanity in a dictatorship, specifically in Soviet Russia, as analyzed in Mikhail Bulgakov’s Master and Margarita and in Alexander Zinoviev’s The Madhouse. In both cases, albeit in different ways, madness is regarded as a form resistance to communism (Stalin’s and Brezhnev’s), as a particular kind of sanity, and finally as a creative vocation. The relationship between madness and sanity is seen as reversible and can change depending on different perspectives—which are mostly political in the two novels. As illustrated by the two authors, the modern literary discourse on madness can be metaphorically shaped by the writer, as a generic category which can refer to various forms of resistance and deviation from the established social, political and cultural norms.
