Abstract Known primarily as an accomplished novelist, Rosa Montero has nevertheless written short stories throughout her career—as artistic primers or blueprints for novels—but they have received scant critical attention. This article considers a selection of tales about sexual relationships from her 1998 anthology of short stories, Amantes y enemigos, drawing some comparisons with her accounts of historical love affairs in Pasiones (1999). It concludes that, in these exceptionally well-crafted stories, the writer exploits the resources of the genre—its open-endings and epiphanies—both to expose romantic delusions as well as to fashion fleeting moments of transcendence. Her treatment of the theme of love in these stories is significantly more miscellaneous (and sometimes more optimistic), than in her novels and essays.
