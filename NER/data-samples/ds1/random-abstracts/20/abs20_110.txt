Abstract BackgroundAn anaphylactoid purpura affects small capillaries in the skin and other organs. Although two cases of anaphylactoid purpura exacerbated by cellulitis have been reported in Japanese literatures, its prognosis remains still unclear. Because cellulitis exacerbates various cutaneous inflammations, it has been speculated that cellulitis might also exacerbate cutaneous inflammation, such as vasculitis. FindingsIn this article, we report that 78-year-old woman exhibited anaphylactoid purpura, following cellulitis. We also reviewed the literature concerning about this subject. ConclusionsThis type of anaphylactoid purpura is thought to have a favorable prognosis dependent on the treatment for cellulitis.
