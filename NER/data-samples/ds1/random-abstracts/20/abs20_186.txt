Abstract This paper explores the various ways in which nineteenth century monetary theory and the novel addressed the questions of reality and fiction with regard to the ontological status and social function of money. Departing from Walter Bagehot’s insistence on the reality and realism of finance, and surveying examples of how novels by Dickens, Balzac, Trollope, or Zola represented, or avoided representing, financial realities, I deal with the various notions of money seen either as a neutral or abstract medium facilitating wealth-creating commodity exchange or as an active but mystical agent blurring the division of fiction and fact (Mill, Marx, Simmel). After that the paper gives an overview of economic oriented literary criticism with regard to its investment in relating and/or distinguishing monetary and literary notions of fiction. The essay ends by returning to Bagehot’s argument and raises the question of the appropriation of reality by an increasingly fictitious finance, problematizing the distinction between expedient fictions and deceitful lies.
