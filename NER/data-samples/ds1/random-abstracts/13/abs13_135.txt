Abstract This study investigated the factors that affect the intention to use social media for learning among students from the higher learning institutions. A Social Media Acceptance Model was developed by adapting factors from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the E-Learning Acceptance Model (ELAM). A total of 300 students (M age = 25.9, SDage = 4.28) participated in an online survey. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed six factors that affect the intention to use social media for learning: self, information and communication technology (ICT) facility, collectivism, communication functionality, effort/influence and performance. However, the effects of ICT facility and collectivism were found to be insignificant. Self had the strongest effect on intention to use social media for learning. The overall model estimation was found to be approximately 71 %. However, results also revealed that although their intention to use social media learning is high, they do not actually use the media for learning. The students are generally receptive to use social media for learning; hence, academics and tertiary institutions should capitalize on the students’ enthusiasm and encourage or implement policies that incorporate social media as part of teaching and learning activities.
