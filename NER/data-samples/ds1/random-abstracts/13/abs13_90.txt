Abstract Investigating how learners appropriate technological tools while engaging in mathematical tasks provides an insight into how learners’ tool-mediated activities shape their mathematical knowledge. The theory of instrumental genesis (Lonchamp in International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 7(2), 211–237, 2012; Rabardel and Beguin in Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science, 6(5), 429–461, 2005) explains how learners appropriate technological tools and accomplish tasks while interacting with these tools. In this study, we investigate how teachers appropriate a collaborative, dynamic geometry environment, the Virtual Math Teams with GeoGebra (VMTwG), and how their appropriation shapes their geometrical knowledge. The environment contains a chat panel and multiuser version of GeoGebra (a dynamic geometry software) that teachers share. The participants are seven middle and high school mathematics teachers who participated in a 15-week professional development course in which they collaborated synchronously in VMTwG to solve geometrical tasks. We analyzed the work of one team of two high school teachers. Our analysis shows that the teachers appropriated collaboratively technological and mathematical tools, which supported their mathematical problem solving. These tools enabled them to manipulate and explore geometric objects and to notice and discuss relations among them. Our study contributes an analysis of longitudinal data to understand the co-emergence of learners’ collaborative appropriation of digital technologies and their construction of mathematical knowledge. This study suggests further research to understand how to orchestrate learners’ appropriation of collaborative technological tools in which instructors are not contemporaneously present during learners’ problem-solving activity.
