Abstract The increasing number of new higher education institutions (HEIs) has resulted in a fierce competition for attracting and retaining the best students. In line with these purposes, this study is aimed at devising a student satisfaction index (SSI) model for the HEIs. The SSI model is developed to measure the satisfaction of students in terms of different aspects such as image of the university, expectations, perceived quality, perceived value, and loyalty. The SSI model was developed using the Bayesian neural networks-based Universal Structure Modeling method. The results provide strategically valuable information for HEIs decision makers with regard to influential factors of student satisfaction and loyalty.
