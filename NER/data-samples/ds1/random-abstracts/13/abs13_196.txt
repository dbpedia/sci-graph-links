Abstract A number of healthcare organizations have recognized the need for interprofessional education (IPE) across healthcare disciplines as an important factor in improving patient outcomes. Touro University Nevada addressed this by developing an interprofessional team-based learning (TBL) program involving students from multiple healthcare programs: osteopathic medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and physician assistant. The TBL format provides a mechanism for accommodating a large participating student cohort while requiring a modest number of facilitators. Using TBL for IPE proved an excellent mechanism for providing students with a deeper understanding of the role of represented healthcare disciplines.
