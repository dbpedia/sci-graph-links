Abstract This article entails a study focused on the relationship between counseling students’ negative childhood memories of receiving corrective feedback and current negative self-evaluations when receiving similar feedback in counselor education programs. Participants (N = 186) completed the Corrective Feedback Instrument-Revised (CFI-R; Hulse-Killacky and Page in Journal for Specialists in Group Work, 19, 197–210. doi:10.1080/01933929408414365, 1994). Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that counseling students’ negative childhood memories were associated with their current negative self-evaluations when receiving corrective feedback. Findings, implications and future research recommendations are discussed for the purpose of enhancing counselor education learning environments.
