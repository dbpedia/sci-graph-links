Abstract With the adoption of online learning and the development of educational technologies, many universities and teachers are attempting to provide qualified teaching for their students. In order to improve students’ learning, the authors designed and provided flipped learning (FL) and treatment of online academic help-seeking (OAHS) in a computing course to help students develop computing skills for using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. The participants in this study were 126 undergraduates from three classes taking a compulsory course titled “Applied Information Technology: Office Software.” According to the analysis, students who received the treatment of OAHS had significantly better computing skills for using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint than those without. However, the treatment of FL did not result in better development of students’ computing skills. Based on the results obtained, the authors present possible implications for online teachers, educators, and schools, particularly to assist those students who may feel bashful and are not willing to ask questions or seek for help in traditional classrooms. This study designs and provides reference for an integration of FL with OAHS to improve students’ learning outcomes.
