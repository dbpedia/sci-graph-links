Summary This study investigates medical students’ therapeutic attitude before and after communication skills training seminars with simulated patients. The aim was to find out whether the therapeutic attitude of medical students is trainable and whether there is a difference in therapeutic attitude before and after the communication skills training with standardized patients. The participating groups are medical students in their 4th year. The collected parameter is the therapeutic attitude on the basis of the therapeutic attitude questionnaire. The questionnaires are filled out at two different points in time, which are the following: once before and the second time after the communication skills training. The results of this study indicate that therapeutic attitude is trainable. Further studies in the area of communication skills training in medical students are needed to emphasise these results.
