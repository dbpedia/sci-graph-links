Abstract Following Kojima and Ünver (Econ Theory 55(3):515–544, 2014) and Afacan (Math Soc Sci 66(2):176–179, 2013), this paper provides two characterizations of the Boston school choice mechanism determined by the student-proposing immediate acceptance algorithm. A mechanism is the Boston mechanism if and only if it satisfies one of the following two groups of axioms: favoring higher ranks and weak fairness; favoring higher ranks, rank monotonicity, and rank rationality.
