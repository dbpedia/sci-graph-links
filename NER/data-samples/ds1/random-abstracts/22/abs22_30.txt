Abstract This study investigates the relationship between ethical ideologies, Machiavellianism, perceived ethical problem, gender and ethical intention. The results from a survey of students in marketing classes from an Australian university branch campus in Malaysia revealed that relativism and Machiavellianism have negative impact on ethical intention of students. However, idealism and perceived ethical problems have positive impacts on their ethical intention. Moreover, the study found that gender is not a determinant of the ethical intentions of students. This study is attempting to improve our understanding of the ethical issues existing in one of the emergent markets (i.e. Malaysia). Additionally, it offers some implications for marketing educators.
