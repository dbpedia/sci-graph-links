Abstract Let $$\Omega \subset {{\Bbb C}^n}$$ be a bounded, simply connected ℂ-convex domain. Let α ∈ ℤ+ n and let f be a function on Ω which is separately $${C^{2{\alpha _j} - 1}}$$-smooth with respect to z j (by which we mean jointly $${C^{2{\alpha _j} - 1}}$$-smooth with respect to Rez j , Imz j ). If f is α-analytic on Ω\f −1(0), then f is α-analytic on Ω. The result is well-known for the case α i = 1, 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n, even when f a priori is only known to be continuous.
