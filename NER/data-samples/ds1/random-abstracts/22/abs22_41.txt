Abstract This paper introduces Allen’s extended interval logic whose sentences are Boolean combinations of sentences of Allen’s interval logic with metric constraints on time points. For this extended logic, a deduction method based on analytic tableaux is defined. This method is used for answering queries on ontologies specified in Allen’s extended interval logic. An example illustrating the applicability of this extended logic to the problem of workflow specification is presented.
