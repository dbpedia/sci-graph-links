Abstract In the intriguing article The puzzle of the changing past, Barlassina and Del Prete (Analysis 75:59â€“67, 2015) argue that, if one grants a platitude about truth and accepts a simple story that they tell, one is forced to conclude that the past has changed. I will suggest that there is a coherent way to resist that conclusion. The platitude about truth is in fact a platitude, but the story is not exactly as they tell it.
