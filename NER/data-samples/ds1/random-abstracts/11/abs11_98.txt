Opinion statement Ankyloglossia, or “tongue tie,” classically involves a short or thickened lingual frenulum that may prohibit tongue protrusion. However, the diagnosis, evaluation, clinical significance, and management of ankyloglossia are widely variable and controversial. Despite attempts to create standardized diagnostic criteria for ankyloglossia, there has yet to be a universally accepted system. Management of ankyloglossia often includes a multidisciplinary approach including lactation consultants, speech language pathologists, pediatricians, and otolaryngologists. Observation or conservative management for asymptomatic infants or infants with minimal or well-compensated symptoms is a reasonable option, whereas surgical intervention may be warranted for infants and children with ankyloglossia that has significant impact on breastfeeding or speech. Frenotomy (also known as frenulotomy) is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed at the bedside or office setting in very young infants, precluding the need for general anesthesia. Frenuloplasty is usually performed on older children and should be performed in the operating room with general anesthesia. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to definitively associate ankyloglossia with breastfeeding or speech deficits. Surgical intervention for ankyloglossia should be recommended with caution and performed only on infants or children with clear findings of ankyloglossia on physical exam and a documented history of breastfeeding or speech difficulties; the timing and method of treatment should be tailored to the individual infant or child. Frenotomy or frenuloplasty should only be performed by providers with adequate training and experience in order to minimize complications.
