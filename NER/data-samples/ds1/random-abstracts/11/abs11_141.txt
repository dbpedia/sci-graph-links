Abstract BackgroundGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been considered to have a poor prognosis. We successfully treated a case of G-CSF-producing ESCC in a 92-year-old woman. Case presentationA 92-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of choking while swallowing and dysphagia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a type 2 esophageal cancer located 26–35 cm from the dental arch, with no distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed with G-CSF-producing ESCC based on remarkable leukocytosis and high G-CSF levels. The patient underwent radical subtotal esophagectomy. Subsequently, the level of neutrophils (from 23,500/μL to 5000/μL) and the level of G-CSF (from 131 to <19.5 pg/mL) decreased significantly. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the resected tissue specimen showed positive staining for G-CSF in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Although the patient developed aspiration pneumonitis, after antibiotic treatment, she promptly recovered and was discharged. ConclusionsHerein, we describe a case of successfully treated G-CSF-producing ESCC in a 92-year-old woman. Precise detection and safely performed immediate radical operation are considered essential to achieve a good clinical course.
