Abstract This study aimed to identify the risk determinants of caries and record oral hygiene status in recent immigrant and refugee children residing in Saskatoon and Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Convenience samples of 133, 3–15 year-old recent immigrant and refugee children, and 86 adult guardians were recruited. Clinical examination of children and survey of their guardians explored the presence of at least one decayed tooth in the child’s mouth; and the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, among other aspects in adult participants. Refugee children had statistically significant higher decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) scores (mean dmft/DMFT score 5.80 ± 4.24) than immigrant children (mean dmft/DMFT score 3.52 ± 3.78 (p < 0.001). Adult immigrants had significantly higher proficiency in English language, knowledge about preventive components like fluoride and dental floss compared to refugee adults. The results of this study confirm the poorer state of oral health among refugee and immigrant children compared to Canadian children.
