The most common classifications of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy consist of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia (PE) and superimposed PE. A common final pathophysiology of PE is endothelial dysfunction. The most successful translational research model for explaining the cause–effect relationship in the genesis of PE is the angiogenic/angiostatic balance theory, involving soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble endoglin (sEng). In a systematic review of articles on the prediction of early-onset PE using angiogenesis-related factors, we revealed that the prediction of early-onset PE in the first trimester is clinically possible, but the prediction of early-onset PE in the early third trimester might be ideal. In addition, an onset threshold or a serial approach appeared to be clinically useful for predicting the imminent onset of PE, with onset at <4 weeks after blood sampling in the second and early third trimesters, because the positive likelihood ratio was >10 and the positive predictive value was >20%. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines state that the Triage PlGF testing and Elecsys immunoassay for the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio could help to exclude PE in women with suspected PE at 20–34 weeks of gestation. Until now, we have not found any effective therapies to prevent PE. However, low-dose aspirin treatment starting at ⩽16 weeks of gestation might be associated with a marked reduction in PE. In addition, early statin treatment might prevent the occurrence of PE. Currently, a clinical trial using pravastatin for the prevention of PE is ongoing.
