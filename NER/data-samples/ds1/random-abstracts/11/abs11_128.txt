Abstract Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose level. Trace element homeostasis causes disturbances in diabetes due to hyperglycemia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant enzyme, contains zinc and copper ions as its cofactors. Defects in SOD level and activity have been observed in diabetes. Resveratrol (RSV) has displayed hypoglycemic effects and is proven to improve oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible effects of RSV on blood glucose level, serum copper and zinc levels, SOD, and a number of other oxidative markers in type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats with administration of streptozotocin and nicotine amide. The studied groups containing six animals per group were as follows: group 1 normal control group; group 2 diabetic control group; groups 3, 4, and 5 diabetic rats that received 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight of RSV, respectively for 30 days. Serum glucose, copper, zinc, SOD activity, total oxidant status (TOS) as well as thiol groups were all measured. Blood glucose in RSV treated groups significantly decreased. Similarly, copper significantly decreased in diabetic groups treated with RSV. Treatment with 10 mg/kg RSV resulted in significantly increased serum zinc. Furthermore, Cu/Zn ratio was observed to decrease in treated groups compared with untreated diabetic control group. RSV treated groups revealed an increased level of SOD activity as well as improved oxidative status. In summary, the results showed that RSV has potential hypoglycemic effect, attenuates trace element homeostasis, and consequently increases SOD activity level.
