Abstract Since its discovery in 1988, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been recognized as a powerful cardiovascular biomarker for a number of disease states, specifically heart failure. Concurrent with such a discovery, much effort has been allocated to the precise monitoring of physiological BNP levels. Thus, it can be used to guide the therapy of heart failure and determine the patientâ€™s stage of disease. Thus, we discuss in this article BNP as a potent biomarker. Subsequently, we will review the progress of biosensing devices as they could be applied to monitor BNP levels as assays, benchtop biosensors and implantable biosensors. The analytical characteristics of commercially available BNP assays are presented. Still emerging as a field, we define four obstacles that present opportunity for the future development of implantable biosensor: foreign body response, sensor renewability, sensitivity and selectivity.
