Abstract BackgroundSerum uric acid concentrations have been associated with mortality in patients receiving hemodialysis. Treatment options are sometimes limited because of the accumulation of a drug and/or its metabolites. The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and plasma levels of topiroxostat, a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and its metabolites in patients receiving hemodialysis. MethodsThis was a 52-week open study. The plasma concentrations of topiroxostat and its metabolites were measured. The endpoints selected were effects on serum uric acid concentrations and the safety and tolerability of topiroxostat. A statistical analysis was performed using a paired t test with Bonferroni corrections. ResultsNineteen participants were followed for 52 weeks without significant adverse effects. Serum uric acid concentrations decreased from 527 ± 49 to 325 ± 62, 297 ± 99, 297 ± 68, and 296 ± 83 μmol/L (weeks 4, 12, 26, and 52; p < 0.001, respectively). The dosage of topiroxostat was 20 mg twice per day in all patients. The clearances of topiroxostat and its metabolites by a dialyzer by use of an arterio-venous method were 55.9 ± 31.1 mL/min (topiroxostat), 143.9 ± 37.0 mL/min (N-oxide), 179.0 ± 41.1 mL/min (N 1-glucuronide), and 192.9 ± 37.0 mL/min (N 2-glucuronide). Plasma concentrations of topiroxostat did not increase during the 52-week study period. The concentrations of the metabolites of topiroxostat (N 1-glucuronide and N 2-glucuronide) slightly increased at the 0-h point on week 4 and remained at similar levels for 52 weeks. ConclusionsTopiroxostat effectively reduced serum uric acid concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Topiroxostat and its metabolites were partly cleared during hemodialysis and were sufficiently low to allow for the continued administration of the drug for 52 weeks.
