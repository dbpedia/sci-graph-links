Abstract Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy has emerged as a predictor of both maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Data suggest that SDB during pregnancy is associated with maternal gestational hypertension and preeclampsia as well as gestational diabetes. Furthermore, there are increasing reports that SDB may play a role in fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, increased cesarean sections, and increased neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions. The public health impact of unrecognized maternal SDB is therefore immense. Treatment of SDB in the general population has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and daytime functioning, and although no large intervention trial has been conducted in pregnant women, small pilot studies demonstrate promising results.
