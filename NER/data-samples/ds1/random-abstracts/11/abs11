These leaves are rich in cycloartanes, a subclass of triterpenes known to possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed at evaluating the analgesic properties of three cycloartanes isolated from Oxyanthus pallidus leaves as well as their aglycones and acetylated derivatives. MethodsThree cycloartanes OP3, OP5 and OP6 obtained by successive chromatography of the crude methanol extract of the leaves were hydrolysed to yield respective aglycone AOP1, AOP2, AOP3 and acetylated to HOP1, HOP2 and HOP3 respectively. Formalin-induced pain model was used to evaluate the acute anti-nociceptive properties of these cycloartanes (5 mg/kg, p.o) in mice and to determine the structure-activity relationship. Acute (24 h) and chronic (10 days) anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of OP5 were evaluated at the doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day administered orally. OP6 was also evaluated in acute experiments. The antioxidant and hepato-protective activities of OP5 were evaluated at the end of the chronic treatment. ResultsThe mixture and the individual isolated cycloartanes significantly inhibited both phases of formalin-induced pain with percentage inhibition ranging from 13 to 78 %. Acid hydrolysis did not significantly affect their antinociceptive activities while acetylation significantly reduced the effects of these compounds during the second phase of pain. OP5 and OP6 induced acute anti-hyperalgesic activity in formalin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia but not an anti-inflammatory effect. Repeated administration of OP5 for 10 days did not induce any anti-hyperalgesic effect. The evaluation of in vivo antioxidant properties showed that OP5 significantly reduced malondialdehyde and increased superoxide dismutase levels in liver without significantly affecting other oxidative stress and hepatotoxic parameters. Chronic administration of OP5 did not cause gastric ulceration. ConclusionCycloartanes isolated from Oxyanthus pallidus possess analgesic effects but lack anti-inflammatory activities. This analgesic effect especially on inflammatory pain may be due to the presence of hydroxyl group in front of the plane. OP5 is devoid of ulcerogenic effect and possess antioxidant properties that might be of benefit to its analgesic properties." .

In this case, we integrated physiologically based modeling in the development processes to effectively design extended-release (ER) clinical products for an ester prodrug LY545694. By simulating the trial results of immediate-release products, we delineated complex pharmacokinetics due to prodrug conversion and established an absorption model to describe the clinical observations. This model suggested the prodrug has optimal biopharmaceutical properties to warrant developing an ER product. Subsequently, we incorporated release profiles of prototype ER tablets into the absorption model to simulate the in vivo performance of these products observed in an exploratory trial. The models suggested that the absorption of these ER tablets was lower than the IR products because the extended release from the formulations prevented the drug from taking advantage of the optimal absorption window. Using these models, we formed a strategy to optimize the ER product to minimize the impact of the absorption window limitation. Accurate prediction of the performance of these optimized products by modeling was confirmed in a third clinical trial." .

However, the factors shaping the development of the microbiota remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms through which these factors affect gut metabolite profiles have not been extensively investigated. Here we analyse gut microbiota development of 27 infants during the first month of life. We find three distinct clusters that transition towards Bifidobacteriaceae-dominant microbiota. We observe considerable differences in human milk oligosaccharide utilization among infant bifidobacteria. Colonization of fucosyllactose (FL)-utilizing bifidobacteria is associated with altered metabolite profiles and microbiota compositions, which have been previously shown to affect infant health. Genome analysis of infants’ bifidobacteria reveals an ABC transporter as a key genetic factor for FL utilization. Thus, the ability of bifidobacteria to utilize FL and the presence of FL in breast milk may affect the development of the gut microbiota in infants, and might ultimately have therapeutic implications." .

To evaluate the association between serum non-HDL-C and cognitive impairment in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MethodsA total of 725 hospitalized patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled. They received conventional treatment. Cognitive function was assessed on the 3rd day after admission using mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, and Hamilton depression rating scale 21-item (HAMD-21). Lipid profile and biochemical markers were measured, and non-HDL-C was calculated. ResultsCompared with patients with normal non-HDL-C, those with high non-HDL-C showed lower MMSE (23.1 ± 4.9 vs. 26.0 ± 4.6, P < 0.001) and MoCA (20.4 ± 6.4 vs. 22.2 ± 5.3 P = 0.01) scores, higher NPI (6.2 ± 1.2 vs. 3.3 ± 1.5, P < 0.001) and HADM-21 (6.0 ± 2.2 vs. 4.5 ± 1.9, P < 0.001) scores, and higher homocysteine (16.0 ± 3.8 vs. 14.3 ± 2.0 mmol/L, P = 0.044), fasting blood glucose (6.4 ± 2.7 vs. 6.1 ± 2.1 mmol/L, P = 0.041), and HbA1c (6.80 ± 1.32 % vs. 6.52 ± 1.17 %, P = 0.013) levels. MMSE (r = -0.526, P < 0.001), MoCA (r = −0.216, P < 0.001), and NPI (r = 0.403, P < 0.001) scores were correlated with non-HDL-C levels. High non-HDL-C levels were an independent risk factor for cognitive disorders after acute ischemic stroke (P = 0.034, odds ratio = 3.115, 95 % confidence interval: 1.088–8.917). ConclusionsHigh serum non-HDL-C levels, age, education, homocysteine levels, and HAMD score were independent risk factors of cognitive impairment in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The risk of cognitive disorders after acute ischemic stroke increased with increasing non-HDL-C levels. This parameter is easy to assess in the clinical setting." .

The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL1β) stimulates several mediators of cartilage degradation. Toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) can bind to various damage-associated molecular patterns, leading to inflammatory condition. So far, no data exist of PGRN effects in inflammatory conditions induced by IL1β or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of PGRN in IL1β- or LPS-induced inflammatory responses of chondrocytes. Human osteoarthritic chondrocytes and ATDC-5 cells were treated with PGRN in presence or not of IL1β or LPS. First, we showed that recombinant PGRN had no effects on cell viability. We present evidence that PGRN expression was increased during the differentiation of ATDC-5 cell line. Moreover, PGRN mRNA and protein expression is increased in cartilage, synovial and infrapatellar fat pad tissue samples from OA patients. PGRN mRNA levels are upregulated under TNFα and IL1β stimulation. Our data showed that PGRN is able to significantly counteract the IL1β-induced expression of NOS2, COX2, MMP13 and VCAM-1. LPS-induced expression of NOS2 is also decreased by PGRN. These effects are mediated, at least in part, through TNFR1. Taken together, our results suggest that PGRN has a clear anti-inflammatory function." .

US Pharmacopeia (USP) buffers of pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8 were used as dissolution media and tested using USP apparatus 2 at 75 rpm and 900 ml. Nine acyclovir products were tested, and only three dissolved very rapidly in all media; i.e., they showed a release of >85% in 15 min. Eight atenolol products tested were all very rapidly dissolving in all three pH media. Ten ciprofloxacin hydrochloride products were tested, and the results showed that only five products met the WHO biowaiver criteria.

Here we present bio-compatible sensors based on Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) spin electronics. We show on a mouse muscle in vitro, using electrophysiology and computational modeling, that this technology permits simultaneous local recordings of the magnetic fields from action potentials. The sensitivity of this type of sensor is almost size independent, allowing the miniaturization and shaping required for in vivo/vitro magnetophysiology. GMR-based technology can constitute the magnetic counterpart of microelectrodes in electrophysiology, and might represent a new fundamental tool to investigate the local sources of neuronal magnetic activity." .

PAH predominantly affects women; paradoxically, female PAH patients have better outcomes than men. The roles of estrogen in PAH remain controversial, which is referred to as “the estrogen paradox”. Here, we sought to determine the role of estrogen in pulsatile pulmonary arterial hemodynamic changes and its impact on RV functional adaption to PAH. Female mice were ovariectomized and replenished with estrogen or placebo. PAH was induced with SU5416 and chronic hypoxia. In vivo hemodynamic measurements showed that (1) estrogen prevented loss of pulmonary vascular compliance with limited effects on the increase of pulmonary vascular resistance in PAH; (2) estrogen attenuated increases in wave reflections in PAH and limited its adverse effects on PA systolic and pulse pressures; and (3) estrogen maintained the total hydraulic power and preserved transpulmonary vascular efficiency in PAH. This study demonstrates that estrogen preserves pulmonary vascular compliance independent of pulmonary vascular resistance, which provides a mechanical mechanism for ability of estrogen to delay disease progression without preventing onset. The estrogenic protection of pulsatile pulmonary hemodynamics underscores the therapeutic potential of estrogen in PAH." .

Inter-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is generally moderate to high; however, the factors responsible for the high inter-subject variability have not been comprehensively reviewed. In this review, the extent of inter-subject variability for mAb pharmacokinetics is presented and potential factors contributing to this variability are explored and summarised. Disease status, age, sex, ethnicity, body size, genetic polymorphisms, concomitant medication, co-morbidities, immune status and multiple other patient-specific details have been considered. The inter-subject variability for mAb pharmacokinetics most likely depends on the complex interplay of multiple factors. However, studies aimed at investigating the reasons for the inter-subject variability are sparse. Population pharmacokinetic models and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models are useful tools to identify important covariates, aiding in the understanding of factors contributing to inter-subject variability. Further understanding of inter-subject variability in pharmacokinetics should aid in development of dosing regimens that are more appropriate." .

The prediction of intestinal perforation prior to chemotherapy is difficult, and there is no standard strategy to minimize the frequency of severely adverse gastrointestinal events in lymphoma cases. Case presentationThe 61-year-old female patient had a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), diagnosed histologically as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We administered six courses of intensive chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate and sequential whole-brain irradiation (40.5 Gy). After a 3-year remission of the PCNSL, the patient’s lymphoma recurred, involving the small intestine. 18F-FDG-PET/CT upon the recurrence before chemotherapy showed multiple nodular lesions in the patient’s gastrointestinal tract. Central nervous system lesions were not detected. We administered intensive salvage chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, high-dose AraC, methyl-prednisolone, etoposide, and rituximab. The response was a rapid partial response, but on day 10 after the initiation of salvage chemotherapy, she complained of abdominal pain with tenderness. The contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT revealed transmural ischemia of the intestine. On the 7th day after the onset of urgent abdominal symptoms, follow-up CE-CT showed that the ischemic lesion had become thin. We conducted elective surgery after waiting for the complete recovery of the patient’s white blood cell count. The pathological findings of resected intestine confirmed the elimination of the majority of lymphoma cells and concomitant partial necrotic tissue. ConclusionsWe were able to avoid the neutropenic period and safely conducted the surgical treatment for the subclinical perforation by using CE-CT. The combination of 18F-FDG-PET/CT before chemotherapy and CE-CT scanning for the targeted involvement site helped us evaluate the surgical indications and optimal timing of surgery in a lymphoma patient with gastrointestinal involvement." .

Since then, the use of calcifediol or other native forms of vitamin D was largely ignored until the publication of the 2009 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations. The guidelines suggested that measurement of circulating levels of 25(OH)D (calcifediol) and its supplementation were to be performed on the same basis as for the general population. This indication was based on the fact that the precursors of active vitamin D had provided to CKD patients considerable benefits in survival, mainly due to their pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. However, despite the long-term use of various classes of vitamin D in CKD, a clear definition is still lacking concerning the most appropriate time for initiation of therapy, the best compound to prescribe (active metabolites or analogs), the proper dosage, and the most suitable duration of therapy. The aim of this position statement is to provide and critically appraise the current plentiful evidence on vitamin D in different clinical settings related to CKD, particularly focusing on outcomes, monitoring and treatment-associated risks. However, it should be taken in account that position statements are meant to provide guidance; therefore, they are not to be considered prescriptive for all patients and, importantly, they cannot replace the judgment of clinicians." .

Little research has been done on how older people experience the environment of the NH. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 Nursing Home residents between the ages of 67 and 90. The findings indicate that the informants’ expressions of well-being belong to two main categories: “Well-being in public and private spaces” “Lack of Well-being in public and private spaces”. Two comprehensive themes were identified as relevant to a better understanding of the residents’ expressions of well-being: Emotional states, Own/Others’ behaviors and activities. From results emerged that in residents’ room, peacefulness is fundamental to relaxation and sleep; in lounge, being excluded from the group can be a source of negative feelings. Lack of well-being in the bathroom is related to feelings of incapacity and to violations of privacy. Practical implications of findings are discussed with regard to the role of health care assistants, nurses and activities co-ordinators in the promotion of residents’ well-being." .

This comorbidity is poorly understood. Although most forms of AD are not genetically inherited, we have identified a new human mutation in the carboxypeptidase E (CPE)/neurotrophic factor-α1 (NF-α1) gene from an AD patient that caused memory deficit and depressive-like behavior in transgenic mice. This mutation consists of three adenosine inserts, introducing nine amino acids, including two glutamines into the mutant protein, herein called CPE-QQ. Expression of CPE-QQ in Neuro2a cells demonstrated that it was not secreted, but accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and was subsequently degraded by proteasomes. Expression of CPE-QQ in rat hippocampal neurons resulted in cell death, through increased ER stress and decreased expression of pro-survival protein, BCL-2. Transgenic mice expressing CPE-QQ did not show any difference in the processing enzyme activity of CPE compared with wild-type mice. However, the transgenic mice exhibited poor memory, depressive-like behavior, severely decreased dendrites in the hippocampal CA3 region and medial prefrontal cortex indicative of neurodegeneration, hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396, and diminished neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus at 50 weeks old. All these pathologies are associated with AD and the latter with depression and were observed in 50-week-old mice. Interestingly, the younger CPE-QQ mice (11 weeks old) did not show deficits in dendrite outgrowth and neurogenesis. This study has uncovered a human CPE/NF-α1 gene mutation that could lead to comorbidity of dementia and depression, emphasizing the importance of this gene in cognitive function." .

Here we investigated whether Albumin containing HES solutions are superior to HES alone in maintaining intestinal barrier function. MethodsAn isolated perfused model of the mouse small intestine was used to investigate the effects of: (i) 3 % Albumin (Alb), (ii) 3 % HES or (iii) 1.5 % HES/1.5 % Albumin (HES/Alb). Intestinal morphology, cell damage, metabolic functions, fluid shifts and endothelial/epithelial barrier permeability were evaluated. Potentially involved signaling mechanisms (Erk1/2, Akt and Stat5 phosphorylation) were screened. ResultsHES induced histomorphological damage (p < 0.01 vs. Alb), by trend elevated the amount of luminal intestinal fatty acid binding protein and reduced galactose uptake (p < 0.001 vs. Alb). Luminal and lymphatic flow rates were increased (p < 0.001 vs. Alb), while vascular flow was decreased (p < 0.001 vs. Alb) during HES perfusion. HES also increased the vascular to luminal FITC-dextran transfer (p < 0.001 vs. Alb), pointing towards a fluid shift from the vascular to the luminal and lymphatic compartments during HES perfusion. Addition of Alb (HES/Alb) reversed all adverse effects of HES (p < 0.05 vs. HES), restored barrier integrity (p < 0.05 vs. HES) and improved metabolic function of the intestine (p < 0.001 vs. HES; p < 0.05 vs. Alb). Mechanistically, HES/Alb perfusion resulted in an increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt kinases (p < 0.001 vs. HES), while Stat5 remained unchanged. ConclusionsAlbumin supplementation abrogates the adverse effects of HES in the intestine and underlying mechanism may function via phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt. Albumin containing HES solutions are superior to HES alone and may improve the suitability of HES in the clinic." .

However, not every subpopulation can be distinguished based on brain area or activity of specific promoters, but rather on topology and connectivity. A fascinating tool to detect neuronal circuitry is based on the transsynaptic tracer, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). When expressed in neurons, it is transported throughout the neuron, secreted, and taken up by synaptically connected neurons. Expression of a WGA and Cre recombinase fusion protein using a viral vector technology in Cre-dependent transgenic animals allows to trace neuronal network connections and to induce topological transgene expression. In this study, we applied and evaluated this technology in specific areas throughout the whole rodent brain, including the hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra, and the motor cortex. Adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) encoding the WGA–Cre fusion protein under control of a CMV promoter were stereotactically injected in Rosa26-STOP-EYFP transgenic mice. After 6 weeks, both the number of transneuronally labeled YFP+/mCherry− cells and the transduced YFP+/mCherry+ cells were quantified in the connected regions. We were able to trace several connections using WGA–Cre transneuronal labeling; however, the labeling efficacy was region-dependent. The observed transneuronal labeling mostly occurred in the anterograde direction without the occurrence of multi-synaptic labeling. Furthermore, we were able to visualize a specific subset of newborn neurons derived from the subventricular zone based on their connectivity." .

Interplay among various signalling molecules and transcription factors under the control of ovarian hormones is necessary for successful establishment of pregnancy. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow embryonic implantation in the receptive endometrium are still largely unknown. Here, we show that Sry-related HMG box gene-17 (Sox17) heterozygous mutant female mice exhibit subfertility due to implantation failure. Sox17 was expressed in the oviduct, uterine luminal epithelium, and blood vessels. Sox17 heterozygosity caused no appreciable defects in ovulation, fertilisation, blastocyst formation, and gross morphology of the oviduct and uterus. Another group F Sox transcription factor, Sox7, was also expressed in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium relatively weakly. Despite uterine Sox7 expression, a significant reduction in the number of implantation sites was observed in Sox17 heterozygous mutant females due to haploinsufficiency. Our findings revealed a novel role of Sox17 in uterine receptivity to embryo implantation." .

Material und MethodenFoveale SD-OCT-Scans von 13 RVV-Patienten wurden nach vollständigem Rückgang des initialen MÖ nach IVOM retrospektiv ausgewertet. Die Dicke der inneren Netzhautschichten bis zur Membrana limitans externa (ELM) und der Photorezeptoren [ELM bis retinales Pigmentepithel (RPE)] wurde mittels automatischer Segmentierungssoftware bestimmt. Die foveale Kontinuität der 4 äußeren hyperreflektiven Bänder [ELM, ellipsoide Zone der Innensegmente (ISe), Interdigitationszone (IZ), RPE] sowie die Lage des initialen MÖ wurden beurteilt. Patienten mit gutem ≤ log(MAR) 0,3 (n = 10) und schlechtem Endvisus ≥ log(MAR) 1,0 (n = 3) wurden verglichen. ErgebnisseDie inneren Netzhautschichten bis zur ELM waren in der schlechteren Visusgruppe dünner. Bei gutem Endvisus lag das initiale MÖ signifikant häufiger oberhalb der ISe und die ISe war nach MÖ-Resorption tendenziell häufiger morphologisch intakt. DiskussionBei fehlendem Visusanstieg trotz trockenem Makulabefund zeigten sich die inneren Netzhautschichten bis zur ELM in der SD-OCT dünner, was als Atrophie zu werten ist. Im Bereich der Photorezeptoren zeigten sich qualitative Unterschiede. Mögliche Erklärungen könnten Ischämie und sowie eine Mitbeteiligung der äußeren Netzhautschichten im Rahmen des initialen MÖ darstellen, die zu einer dauerhaften Schädigung der ISe führen." .

MethodsThis study was a retrospective chart review. A total of 138 patients with abnormal liver transaminase levels at the time of admission were included in this study. We evaluated the influence of combined therapy of conventional and herbal medicines on liver transaminase levels over a period of at least 2 weeks at Kyung Hee University Korean Medical Hospital. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 for Windows. Paired T-tests were used to examine the significance of differences in AST, ALT, and GGT levels at the time of admission and discharge. ResultsWe found that combined therapy reduced levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) to a statistically significant level. Specifically, there were 48, 66, 104 subjects who exhibited abnormal AST, ALT and GGT levels at admission, which was reduced to 13, 37, and 64 subjects after combined therapy, respectively. Some subjects exhibited worsening levels of liver transaminases after combined therapy, so we used the χ2 test to analyze the influence of combined therapy with conventional and herbal medicines on liver function according to initial liver transaminase levels. According to this analysis, ALT and GGT levels may be more important than AST levels in estimating the influence of combined therapy on patients with abnormal liver transaminase levels. ConclusionsBased on this retrospective chart review, combined therapy of conventional and herbal medicines would be considered relatively safe. Thus, if patients have abnormal ALT or GGT levels, caution should be taken when suggesting combined therapy with conventional and herbal medicines." .

This study compared the complication rates following mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography evaluation to those with clinical assessment only. MethodsWe performed a single-institution retrospective study of mastectomy patients who underwent immediate tissue expander-based reconstruction between September 2009 and December 2013. ICG angiography was adopted in March 2012. The rates of complications in the ICG and clinical assessment only groups were compared. Factors associated with complications were identified with the Fischer exact test and univariate analysis. ResultsA total of 114 patients were identified; clinical assessment only, 53 patients; ICG angiography, 61 patients. The overall complication rates were not significantly different between the two groups (ICG angiography, 50.8 %; clinical assessment, 43.4 %; p = 0.46). There was no significant difference in the rates of unexpected return to the operating room, cellulitis, hematomas, and seromas. The overall rates of flap necrosis were not significantly different (ICG angiography, 27.9 %; clinical assessment, 18.9 %; p = 0.28). However, the rates of severe flap necrosis were significantly lower with intraoperative ICG angiography (4.9 %) than with clinical assessment only (18.9 %, p = 0.02). On univariate analysis, breast weight (≥500 g) was significantly associated with increased rates of severe flap necrosis (p = 0.04), whereas body mass index, age, smoking status, prior breast surgery, history of radiation therapy, and receipt of nipple-sparing mastectomy were not. ConclusionsWe observed that the implementation of intraoperative ICG angiography was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of severe flap necrosis." .

Here, we report robust neuroprotective effects of a novel compound, 2-((2-oxopropanoyl)oxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid (OPTBA), a 2-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethyl benzoic acid (HTB, a metabolite of triflusal)-pyruvate ester. Intravenous administration of OPTBA (5 mg/kg) 3 or 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats reduced infarct volumes to 38.5 ± 11.4% and 46.5 ± 15.3%, respectively, of that of MCAO controls, and ameliorated motor impairment and neurological deficits. Importantly, neuroprotective effects of OPTBA were far greater than those afforded by combined treatment of HTB and pyruvate. Furthermore, OPTBA suppressed microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine inductions more effectively than HTB/pyruvate co-treatment in the postischemic brain and LPS-treated cortical slice cultures and also attenuated NMDA-induced neuronal death in hippocampal slice cultures. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that OPTBA was hydrolyzed to HTB and pyruvate with a t1/2 of 38.6 min in blood and 7.2 and 2.4 h in cortex and striatum, respectively, and HTB was maintained for more than 24 h both in blood and brain tissue. Together these results indicate OPTBA acts directly and via its hydrolysis products, thus acting as a multimodal neuroprotectant in the postischemic brain." .

Asthenozoospermia is a common cause of infertility. Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones have been shown to influence human infertility, but no research has explored whether N6-methyladenosine (m6A) level in RNA is associated with asthenozoospermia. Here, we collected a total of 52 semen samples, including 20 asthenozoospermia patients and 32 healthy controls. An LC-ESI-MS/MS method was used to detect m6A contents in sperm RNA, and real-time PCR was performed to determine the mRNA expression of demethylase (FTO, ALKBH5), methyltransferase (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP) and an m6A-selective-binding protein (YTHDF2). We found that m6A content (p = 0.033) and the mRNA expression of METTL3 (p = 0.016) and METTL14 (p = 0.025) in asthenozoospermia patients were significantly higher than those of controls. Increased m6A content was a risk factor for asthenozoospermia (odds ratio (OR) 3.229, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.178 – 8.853, p = 0.023). Moreover, m6A content was correlated with the expression of METTL3 (r = 0.303, p = 0.032) and with sperm motility (progressive motility: r = −0.288, p = 0.038; non-progressive motility: r = −0.293, p = 0.037; immotility: r = 0.387, p = 0.005).

However, whether MMP-9 has a causal link to ventricular arrhythmia, as well as the underlying mechanism, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanistic involvement of myocardial MMP-9 in the pathophysiology of ventricular arrhythmia. Increased levels of myocardial MMP-9 are linked to ventricular arrhythmia attacks after angiotensin II (Ang II) treatment. MMP-9-deficient mice were protected from ventricular arrhythmia. Increased expressions of protein kinase A (PKA) and ryanodine receptor phosphorylation at serine 2808 (pS2808) were correlated with inducible ventricular arrhythmia. MMP-9 deficiency consistently prevented PKA and pS2808 increases after Ang II treatment and reduced ventricular arrhythmia. Calcium dynamics were examined via confocal imaging in isolated murine cardiomyocytes. MMP-9 inhibition prevents calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and reduces arrhythmia-like irregular calcium transients via protein kinase A and ryanodine receptor phosphorylation. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes similarly show that MMP-9 inhibition prevents abnormal calcium leakage. Myocardial MMP-9 inhibition prevents ventricular arrhythmia through pleiotropic effects, including the modulation of calcium homeostasis and reduced calcium leakage." .

They express ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and can release gliotransmitters. Astrocytes also express transporters that regulate the extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters. Here we report a previously unrecognized role for the astrocytic GABA transporter, GAT-3. GAT-3 activity results in a rise in astrocytic Na+ concentrations and a consequent increase in astrocytic Ca2+ through Na+/Ca2+ exchange. This leads to the release of ATP/adenosine by astrocytes, which then diffusely inhibits neuronal glutamate release via activation of presynaptic adenosine receptors. Through this mechanism, increases in astrocytic GAT-3 activity due to GABA released from interneurons contribute to 'diffuse' heterosynaptic depression. This provides a mechanism for homeostatic regulation of excitatory transmission in the hippocampus." .

Indeed, the number of antiviral mAbs developed in recent years has grown exponentially. Although their direct effects on viral blunting have been studied in detail, their potential immunomodulatory actions have been overlooked until recently. The ability of antiviral mAbs to modulate antiviral immune responses in infected organisms has recently been revealed. More specifically, upon recognition of their cognate antigens, mAbs form immune complexes (ICs) that can be recognized by the Fc receptors expressed on different immune cells of infected individuals. This binding may be followed by the modulation of the host immune responses. Harnessing this immunomodulatory property may facilitate improvements in the therapeutic potential of antiviral mAbs. This review focuses on the role of ICs formed with different viral determinants and mAbs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in the context of both passive immunotherapies and vaccination strategies. Potential deleterious effects of ICs on the host immune response are also discussed." .

Those born with malformed genitalia are often diagnosed at birth. However, in resource-poor countries like India, where not all births are supervised by healthcare workers, some of these children remain undiagnosed until puberty or even later. The aim of this study was to assess the gender issues and psychosocial problems of children with DSD. Participants included 205 children with DSD (103 with 46,XX DSD and 102 with 46,XY DSD). Both the children with DSD and their parents underwent semistructured interviews by a clinical psychologist. The birth of a child with DSD was perceived as a major medical and social problem by parents from all socioeconomic strata. Mothers were distressed as many believed the DSD condition was transmitted through the mother. Children who were not diagnosed and treated during infancy or early childhood experienced considerable social discrimination not only from relatives and friends but also from medical and paramedical staff in hospitals. Several patients had been operated during infancy without an etiological diagnosis and without provision of adequate information to the parents. Some children had problems related to complications of surgery. Most teenage patients with 5α-reductase-2 deficiency reared as females presented with gender dysphoria, while children with androgen insensitivity (except for one) or with gonadal dysgenesis developed a gender identity concordant with their gender of rearing. Parents of children with DSD preferred a male gender assignment for their children (if that was possible) because of the social advantages of growing up male in a patriarchal society." .

Accordingly this study is conducted to evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of hydromethanolic root extract of Indigofera spicata Forssk. in castor oil induced diarrhea model, misoprostol induced secretion model and its antimotility activity using charcoal as a marker. MethodsIn all the three models the animals were randomly allocated into five groups of six animals each and then group I mice were received 1 ml/100 g normal saline, group II were treated with standard drug as a positive control whereas group III, IV and V were treated with 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg extract doses, respectively. Statistical significance of differences in the mean of number of defecations, fluid content of faces, intestinal fluid accumulation ratio, intestinal fluid weight and distance travelled by charcoal between groups was analyzed by SPSS version-21 using one way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison. ResultThe hydromethanolic crude extract of Indigofera spicata at 200 and 400 mg/kg mg/kg doses showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of the frequency of defecation and weight difference of the fluid content of the faces compared to the negative controls. For those doses the percentage inhibition of diarrheal feces was 43.62 and 53.51 %, respectively. The antisecretary activity of the extract in terms of fluid accumulation ratio was not found significant but in terms of intestinal fluid weight, all the extract doses revealed significant (p < 0.05) inhibition. Unlike the standard drug, the antimotility activity of the extract was not found statistically significant compared to the negative control.

Because in vivo assays for oral acute toxicity in mammals are time-consuming and costly, there is thus an urgent need to develop in silico prediction models of oral acute toxicity. ResultsIn this study, based on a comprehensive data set containing 7314 diverse chemicals with rat oral LD50 values, relevance vector machine (RVM) technique was employed to build the regression models for the prediction of oral acute toxicity in rate, which were compared with those built using other six machine learning approaches, including k-nearest-neighbor regression, random forest (RF), support vector machine, local approximate Gaussian process, multilayer perceptron ensemble, and eXtreme gradient boosting. A subset of the original molecular descriptors and structural fingerprints (PubChem or SubFP) was chosen by the Chi squared statistics. The prediction capabilities of individual QSAR models, measured by q ext2 for the test set containing 2376 molecules, ranged from 0.572 to 0.659. ConclusionConsidering the overall prediction accuracy for the test set, RVM with Laplacian kernel and RF were recommended to build in silico models with better predictivity for rat oral acute toxicity. By combining the predictions from individual models, four consensus models were developed, yielding better prediction capabilities for the test set (q ext2 = 0.669–0.689). Finally, some essential descriptors and substructures relevant to oral acute toxicity were identified and analyzed, and they may be served as property or substructure alerts to avoid toxicity. We believe that the best consensus model with high prediction accuracy can be used as a reliable virtual screening tool to filter out compounds with high rat oral acute toxicity.

We aimed to establish if this constraint also applied at higher ambient temperature (30 °C). Female Swiss mice lactating at 30 °C had lower asymptotic food intake and weaned lighter litters than those at 21 °C. Resting metabolic rate, daily energy expenditure, milk energy output and suckling time were all lower at 30 °C. In a second experiment we gave mice at 30 °C either 6 or 9 pups to raise. Female performance was independent of litter size, indicating that it is probably not controlled by pup demands. In a third experiment we exposed only the mother, or only the offspring to the elevated temperature. In this case the performance of the mother was only reduced when she was exposed, and not when her pups were exposed, showing that the high temperature directly constrains female performance. These data suggest that at 30 °C SusEI and reproductive performance are likely constrained by the capacity of females to dissipate body heat, and not indirectly via pup demands. Constraints seem to change with ambient temperature in this strain of mouse." .

However, the training of nurses and other healthcare professionals may not adequately equip them to practice in a manner which is both compassionate and culturally competent. In this paper, we report on the development of three learning tools, designed to promote the skills and strengthen the capacity of nurses and healthcare professionals to provide culturally competent and compassionate care. MethodsThe project involved the participation of six European countries in the development of three learning tools, covering culturally competent compassion, culturally competent courage, and intercultural communication. The principles which informed the methodology derive from the previous work on the Papadopoulos, Tilki and Taylor (PTT) model of transcultural nursing and cultural competence, and were also informed by the Intercultural Education of Nurses in Europe (IENE1 & IENE2) projects. Each partner country was required to produce one tool for each topic area, based on guidance provided by the project co-ordinator, leading to the development of eighteen tools in total. The tools were administered mainly to student nurses to test their feasibility. ResultsThe emerging tools contained important theoretical and practical components, whereby innovative learning methods and case studies were included. Student nurses enjoyed using the tools, and enjoyed their flexibility. The learning tools enabled students to become stimulated and to engage together leading to a positive learning experience. DiscussionThe tools allow for a positive learning experience and reflection of good practice to take place. The flexibility and content of the tools allows for them to be of equal value to other healthcare professionals as well as nursing staff. ConclusionThe tools were initially utilised mainly with student nurses and were received with a positive response. Work is now in place to further implement the tools and evaluate the longer term effects among a range of healthcare professionals and service user health outcomes." .

Recently, there has been a re-emerging interest in the role of ketone bodies in exercise metabolism, with considerable media speculation about ketone body supplements being routinely used by professional cyclists. Ketone bodies can serve as an important energy substrate under certain conditions, such as starvation, and can modulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Dietary strategies to increase endogenous ketone body availability (i.e., a ketogenic diet) require a diet high in lipids and low in carbohydrates for ~4 days to induce nutritional ketosis. However, a high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet may impair exercise performance via reducing the capacity to utilize carbohydrate, which forms a key fuel source for skeletal muscle during intense endurance-type exercise. Recently, ketone body supplements (ketone salts and esters) have emerged and may be used to rapidly increase ketone body availability, without the need to first adapt to a ketogenic diet. However, the extent to which ketone bodies regulate skeletal muscle bioenergetics and substrate metabolism during prolonged endurance-type exercise of varying intensity and duration remains unknown. Therefore, at present there are no data available to suggest that ingestion of ketone bodies during exercise improves athletes’ performance under conditions where evidence-based nutritional strategies are applied appropriately." .

Recent studies have indicated that inflammatory processes occurring in the brain are involved in a common and crucial mechanism in epileptogenesis. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) and its only receptor, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5), are highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and participate in inflammatory responses. The present study aimed to assess the expression of CXCL13 and CXCR5 in the brain tissues of both patients with intractable epilepsy (IE) and a rat model (lithium-pilocarpine) of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to identify possible roles of the CXCL13–CXCR5 signaling pathway in epileptogenesis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemical, double-labeled immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses were performed in this study. CXCL13 and CXCR5 mRNA expression and protein levels were found to be significantly up-regulated in the TLE patients and TLE rats. Further, CXCL13 and CXCR5 protein levels were altered during the different epileptic phases after onset of status epilepticus (SE) in the pilocarpine model rats, including the acute phase (6, 24, and 72 h), latent phase (7 and 14 days) and chronic phase (30 and 60 days groups). Moreover, double-labeled immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CXCL13 was mainly expressed in the cytomembranes and cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes, while CXCR5 was mainly expressed in the cytomembranes and cytoplasm of neurons. Thus, the CXCL13–CXCR5 signaling pathway may play a possible pathogenic role in IE. CXCL13 and CXCR5 may represent potential biomarkers of brain inflammation in epileptic patients." .

Although these methods may have potential benefits it presents a problem when patients use non-conventional treatments in the perioperative period without informing their attending physician about it and this may cause adverse events and complications. To prevent this, physicians need to have a profound knowledge about non-conventional treatments. MethodsAn anonymous questionnaire was distributed among surgeons and anaesthesiologists working in Hungarian university clinics and in selected city or county hospitals. Questionnaires were distributed by post, online or in person. Altogether 258 questionnaires were received from 22 clinical and hospital departments. ResultsAnaesthesiologists and surgeons use reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, herbal medicine and manual therapy most frequently in their clinical practice. Traditional Chinese Medicine was considered to be the most scientifically sound method, while homeopathy was perceived as the least well-grounded method. Neural therapy was the least well-known method among our subjects.Among the subjects of our survey only 3.1 % of perioperative care physicians had some qualifications in non-conventional medicine, 12.4 % considered themselves to be well-informed in this topic and 48.4 % would like to study some complementary method. Women were significantly more interested in alternative treatments than men, p = 0.001427; OR: 2.2765. Anaesthesiologists would be significantly more willing to learn non-conventional methods than surgeons. 86.4 % of the participants thought that non-conventional treatments should be evaluated from the point of view of evidence. Both surgeons and anaesthesiologists accept the application of integrative medicine and they also approve of the idea of teaching these methods at universities. ConclusionsAccording to perioperative care physicians, non-conventional methods should be evaluated based on evidence. They also expressed a willingness to learn about those treatments that meet the criteria of evidence and apply these in their clinical practice." .

AOPPs can promote oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation and thus participate in many pathophysiological disease processes. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of blood vessels that is characterized by low-density lipoprotein infiltration into the endothelial intima and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Inflammation and OS are established risk factors for the formation of atherosclerosis. Accumulated studies show that AOPPs can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis through OS and inflammation. Additionally, AOPPs can accelerate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques by inhibiting high-density lipoprotein receptor scavenger receptor class B type I-mediated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol reverse transport, leading to metabolic disturbances. Some studies have suggested that plasma AOPPs levels are independently positively correlated with blood pressure and are also independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. AOPPs can trigger oxidative bursts of neutrophils, monocytes and phagocytic cells, increase the generation of reactive oxygen species and promote the secretion of cytokines to accelerate endothelial cell injury. Detecting the levels and inhibiting the formation of AOPPs may provide a novel approach to monitor the progress and improve the prognosis of atherosclerosis." .

MethodsIn our study there were 126 eyes: 40 with CON, 40 with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and 46 normal eyes (NOR). Digital color fundus photographs were assessed for the redness of disc rim color using ImageJ software. We separately measured the intensity of red, green, and blue pixels from RGB images. Three disc color indices (DCIs), which indicate the redness intensity, were calculated through existing formulas. ResultsAll three DCIs of CON were significantly smaller than those of NOR (P < 0.001). In addition, when compared with NTG, DCIs were also significantly smaller in CON (P < 0.05). A comparison of mild CON and mild NTG (mean deviation (MD) > -6 dB), in which the extent of retinal nerve fiber layer thinning is comparable, the DCIs of mild CON were significantly smaller than those of mild NTG (P < 0.05). In contrast, DCIs did not differ between moderate-to-severe stages of CON and NTG (MD ≤ -6 dB), though the retinal nerve fibers of CON were more severely damaged than those of NTG. To differentiate between mild CON and mild NTG, all AUROCs for the three DCIs were above 0.700. ConclusionsA quantitative and objective assessment of optic disc color was useful in differentiating early-stage CON from GON and NOR." .

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that is expressed in numerous cells, rapidly inactivates endogenous GLP-1. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition is employed as a therapeutic avenue to increase GLP-1 levels in the management of T2D. The effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of AD has been reported in various animal models of AD. With this background, the present study was designed to examine the effectiveness of linagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Nine-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were administered linagliptin orally (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. At the end of the linagliptin treatment, mice were evaluated for cognitive ability on the Morris Water Maze and Y-maze. Following cognitive evaluation, mice were sacrificed to determine the effect of the linagliptin on brain incretin levels, amyloid burden, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. We confirm that linagliptin treatment for 8 weeks mitigates the cognitive deficits present in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, linagliptin also improves brain incretin levels and attenuates amyloid beta, tau phosphorylation as well as neuroinflammation. In conclusion, linagliptin possesses neuroprotective properties that may be attributed to the improvement of incretin levels in the brain." .

Infertility is a common complaint of woman presenting with ROS, and little progress has been made in term of reproduction with the patient’s own gamete. So far only one case report of live birth has been reported after in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes in a patient suffering from ROS in 2013. Case presentationA secondary infertile woman of 33 years-old was manifested with oligomenorrhea and markedly increased gonadotropin levels around postmenopausal range, but had normal antral follicle count, normal serum inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone levels. She had normal karyotype of 46,XX and normal thyroid function. There were no abnormal findings in some autoantibody assays and FSH receptor sequencing. After oral contraceptive pills combined with triptorelin depot were administered, her gonadotropin levels reduced but it showed no response to high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (hp-HMG 300IU/d for 15 days). Then endometrium was prepared with estradiol valerate and IVM from small antral follicles were performed. Five immature oocytes were retrieved. Twenty-four hours after IVM culture, 3 oocytes matured to metaphase II stage and were inseminated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection using her husband’s sperm. Two top-quality embryos were transferred and one embryo was cryopreserved. The patient got pregnant and delivered a healthy boy at term. ConclusionIVM using their own oocytes could be an available treatment for infertile women with ROS." .

For this reason, treatments have been ineffective. It is imperative to find novel therapies ameliorating modifiable risk factors (hypertension, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and traumatic brain injury) and effective against early pathogenic mechanisms including alterations in cerebral blood flow leading to poor oxygenation and decreased access to nutrients, impaired glucose metabolism, chronic inflammation, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) fulfill these requirements. ARBs are directly neuroprotective against early injury factors in neuronal, astrocyte, microglia, and cerebrovascular endothelial cell cultures. ARBs protect cerebral blood flow and reduce injury to the blood brain barrier and neurological and cognitive loss in animal models of brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. These compounds are clinically effective against major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease: hypertension, stroke, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and ameliorate age-dependent cognitive loss. Controlled studies on hypertensive patients, open trials, case reports, and database meta-analysis indicate significant therapeutic effects of ARBs in Alzheimer’s disease. ARBs are safe compounds, widely used to treat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in humans, and although they reduce hypertension, they do not affect blood pressure in normotensive individuals. Overall, there is sufficient evidence to consider long-term controlled clinical studies with ARBs in patients suffering from established risk factors, in patients with early cognitive loss, or in normal individuals when reliable biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease risk are identified." .

Our results demonstrated positive associations between dietary restraint and baseline activation of the frontal and the temporal regions (i.e., food reward encoding) and the limbic regions (i.e., homeostatic control, including the hypothalamus).

The estimated prevalence of major congenital malformations such as cardiac defects, facial clefts, hypospadias, and neural tube defects in epileptic women is 4–10 %, which represents a two- to fourfold increase in pregnant women compared to the general population. However, there are no clear data for newer drugs. Lacosamide (LCM), a novel AED, is the first of the third-generation AEDs to be approved as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. There are no data on the pharmacokinetics of LCM during pregnancy, and only some published data have reported on its effects during pregnancy. MethodsIn this study, three different doses of LCM (0.12, 0.5, and 1.60 mg in 0.18 mL) were applied under the embryonic disks of specific pathogen-free Leghorn chicken embryos after a 30-h incubation. Incubation was continued for 80 h, at which time all embryos were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. ResultsThere was growth retardation in all of the LCM-treated groups. Major malformations increased in a dose-dependent manner and were mostly observed in the supratherapeutic group. ConclusionBased on our data, LCM may cause growth retardation or major congenital malformations. Nevertheless, more extensive investigations of its reliability are needed." .

This study therefore examined if STESS and its components retain their prognostic relevance beyond acute treatment. MethodsOne hundred twenty-five non-anoxic patients with SE were retrospectively identified in two hospitals between 2008 and 2014 (39.2 % refractory SE). Patients’ treatment, demographic data, date of death, aetiology of SE, and the components of the STESS (age, history of seizures, level of consciousness and worst seizure type) were determined based on the patients’ records. ResultsIn 94.4 % of patients, SE was treated successfully; in-hospital mortality rate was 12 %. The overall mortality was 42 % after median follow-up of 28.1 months. The survival plateaued after about 3 years, all patients with progressive brain diseases (n = 4) died within one year. In-hospital mortality correlated highly significantly with STESS, the optimal cut-off was 4. With respect to long-term outcome, STESS correlated significantly with overall mortality though with lower odds ratios. When looking only at patients that survived the acute phase of treatment, only the STESS components “level of consciousness” (at admission), “coma” as worst seizure type, and “age” reached a statistical significant association with mortality. In these patients, STESS with a cut-off of 4 was not significantly associated with survival/mortality. Aetiology of SE was insufficient to explain the weak association and the high mortality after discharge alone. ConclusionSTESS at onset of SE reliably assessed in-hospital mortality, and was indicative for overall survival. However, STESS did not allow correct estimation of mortality after discharge. The high mortality after discharge and high overall mortality of patients diagnosed with SE was not explained by progressive brain disorders alone. Further research is needed to understand the causes for high overall mortality after SE and putative prognostic factors." .

Study DesignWe conducted a retrospective, observational study in a tertiary-care academic hospital. The study included 768 female patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries who received propofol-based induction of general anesthesia. Main Outcome MeasuresWeight-adjusted anesthetic induction dosing, age-associated differences in dosing by ASA-PS (American Society of Anesthesiology—Physical Status), and hemodynamic outcomes between younger (18–64 years, n = 537) and older (≥65 years, n = 231) female patients were analyzed. ResultsOlder patients received lower doses of propofol and midazolam than younger patients (propofol: 2.037 ± 0.783 vs 2.322 ± 0.834 mg/kg, p < 0.001; midazolam: 0.013 ± 0.014 vs 0.023 ± 0.042 mg/kg, p < 0.001). However, practitioners still consistently exceeded the FDA recommended dose (1–1.5 mg/kg) of propofol for elderly patients. There was no significant difference in the doses of fentanyl administered between the two age groups (1.343 ± 0.744 vs 1.363 ± 0.763 μg/kg, p = 0.744), and doses of fentanyl in older patients exceeded the recommended dose (0.5–1.0 μg/kg). Corresponding to observed overdosing of induction agents, older patients experienced larger decreases in post-induction blood pressure and were more likely to receive vasopressor therapy. ConclusionsAnesthetic induction doses of fentanyl and propofol were not sufficiently corrected in older patients in accordance with recommendations. Significantly greater frequency of post-induction hypotension occurred amongst older patients. Quality improvement efforts may lead to improved outcomes in this vulnerable population." .

The purpose of this work is to evaluate whether co-packing using a plastic pouch can enhance the joint adherence to the treatment or not. The study also compares the cost effectiveness (CE) of two co-packaging options: ‘central’ and ‘health center (HC)’ level bundling. MethodsThis cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted in 2015 in eight districts of Ethiopia. Thirty two HCs were randomly assigned to one of the following four intervention arms: (i) ‘Central bundling’ (zinc and ORS bundled using a pouch that had instructional message, distributed to HCs); (ii) ‘HC level bundling’ (zinc, ORS and a similar pouch distributed to the HCs and bundled by health workers); (iii) ‘Bundling without message’ (zinc, ORS and plain pouch distributed and bundled by the health workers); and, (iv) ‘Status quo’ (zinc and ORS co-administered without bundling). In each of the four arms, 176 children 6–59 months of age, presented with acute diarrhea were enrolled. Twelve days after enrollment, level of adherence was assessed. A composite scale of adherence was developed and modeled using mixed effects linear regression analysis. The unit costs associated with the arms were estimated using secondary data sources. Incremental CE analysis was made by taking the cost and level of adherence in fourth arm as a base value. ResultsThe follow-up rate was 95.6 %. As compared with the ‘status quo’ arm, the joint adherences in the ‘central’ and ‘HC level’ bundling arms raised substantially by 14.8 and 15.7 percentage points (PP), respectively (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between ‘bundling without message’ and the ‘status quo’ arms. The unit cost incurred by the ‘central bundling’ is relatively higher (USD 0.658/episode) as compared with the ‘HC level bundling’ approach (USD 0.608/episode). The incremental CE ratio in the ‘central bundling’ modality was two times higher than in the ‘HC based bundling’ approach. ConclusionBundling zinc with ORS using a pouch with instructional messages increases adherence to the treatment. ‘HC level bundling’ is more CE than the ‘central bundling’ approach." .

This research was conducted as part of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, a study comprising a nationally representative sample of Australian women in three age groups. The focus of this research is 14 099 women born in 1946–1951, who have been surveyed six times (1996–2010). Student t-tests were used to compare women who did or did not have hypertension by their health-care utilization. Longitudinal analyses were conducted using a Poisson generalized estimating equation model. The incidence of hypertension among this cohort during 1996 to 2010 ranged from 400 to 597 participants per survey, resulting in an increase in prevalence of hypertension from 20.9% in 1996 to 41.3% in 2010. For all survey periods, women with hypertension had a significantly higher average number of visits to doctors and allied health practitioners compared with women without hypertension (P<0.005). The use of complementary medicine (practitioners and self-prescribed treatments) by women with hypertension was significantly lower compared to women without hypertension (P<0.005). Over time, conventional health-care utilization was higher for women with hypertension compared with women without hypertension (adjusted RR=1.18; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.22; P<0.0001). Our findings show that women with hypertension are using a range of conventional and complementary and alternative medicine: with hypertensive women using more conventional medicine and less complementary and alternative medicine than non-hypertensive women. As such, health-care providers should communicate with their patients regarding their use of complementary and alternative medicine in their efforts to provide safe, effective and coordinate care." .

Clinical examination of children and survey of their guardians explored the presence of at least one decayed tooth in the child’s mouth; and the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, among other aspects in adult participants. Refugee children had statistically significant higher decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) scores (mean dmft/DMFT score 5.80 ± 4.24) than immigrant children (mean dmft/DMFT score 3.52 ± 3.78 (p < 0.001).

Clinical trial studies on the efficacy of acupuncture therapy for substance abuse were classified according to substance (cocaine, opioid, nicotine, and alcohol), and their treatment protocols, assessments, and findings were examined. A total of 119 studies were identified, of which 85 research articles addressed the efficacy of acupuncture for treating addiction. There were substantial variations in study protocols, particularly regarding treatment duration, frequency of electroacupuncture, duration of stimulation, and choice of acupoints. Contradictory results, intergroup differences, variation in sample sizes, and acupuncture placebo effects made it difficult to evaluate acupuncture effectiveness in drug addiction treatment. This review also identified a lack of rigorous study design, such as control of confounding variables by incorporating sham controls, sufficient sample sizes, reliable assessments, and adequately replicated experiments." .

One group received a commercial inactivated BTV serotype 8 (BTV8) vaccine. This group and the non-vaccinated group of calves were challenged twice (4 months apart) with the European BTV8 strain isolated during the 2006–2007 epidemics. Calves were then infected with a BTV1 inoculum which was found to be unexpectedly contaminated by BTV serotype 15 (BTV15). BTV1 and BTV15 single infections were performed on two other groups of three BTV naïve calves. A severe clinical picture was obtained after superinfection with BTV1/BTV15 in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals and after challenge with BTV8 in non-vaccinated animals. BTV1 and BTV15 single infection caused only very slight clinical signs. After superinfection and at the viraemic peak, there were an average of above 1000 times more BTV15 genomic copies than BTV1 ones. BTV1 RNA could be detected only in the spleen of one calf whereas BTV15 RNA was found in 15 organs of seven different animals. BTV8 immunization whether it was acquired through vaccination and challenges or challenges alone did not change BTV1 or BTV15 RNA detection in superinfected animals. However in these animals a partial cross neutralization between BTV8 and BTV1 might be involved in the lower BTV1 replication versus BTV15. Infection with different serotypes can occur also in the field. Interference between virus strains, genetic reassortment and cross-protection were considered as mechanisms to explain the clinical outcomes and the other virological and immunological findings in the course of BTV1/BTV15 superinfection." .

It is involved in DNA repair and redox signaling and, in turn, oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Although previous studies have demonstrated that APE1/Ref-1 functions as a negative regulator of inflammatory response via several mechanisms in neuronal cells, little is known about the roles of APE1/Ref-1 in glial cells. In this study, we found that cytoplasmic APE1/Ref-1 expression was upregulated in reactive astrocytes of the kainic acid- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected hippocampus. Analysis of the inflammatory response induced by extranuclear APE1/Ref-1 (ΔNLS-Ref-1) in cultured primary astrocytes revealed that it markedly suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion induced by LPS to a similar extent as did wild type APE1/Ref-1 (WT-Ref-1), supporting the concept an anti-inflammatory role of extranuclear APE1/Ref-1 in astrocytes. Additionally, overexpression of WT- and ΔNLS-Ref-1 suppressed the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), although it effectively enhanced activator protein 1 (AP-1) activity. The blunting effect of APE1/Ref-1 on LPS-induced NF-κB activation was not mediated by IκB kinase (IKK) activity. Instead, APE1/Ref-1 inhibited p300-mediated acetylation of p65 by suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels following LPS treatment. Taken together, our results showed that altered expression and/or subcellular distribution of APE1/Ref-1 in activated astrocytes regulated the neuroinflammatory response to excitotoxin and endotoxin insults used in model of neurodegenerative brain diseases." .

The embryos were cultivated alone or in coculture with inactivated MSC or MEF for 4 d. After 4 d in culture, the percentage of blastocyst formation in coculture with MSC (91.7 ± 4.3%) or MEF (95.1 ± 3.3%) was higher than in the control group (72.2 ± 9.0%). We did not observe any difference in proliferation or apoptosis. However, the blastocysts cocultured with MSC or MEF presented a significantly higher number of cells within the inner cell mass per embryo when compared to the controls. The MSC and MEF groups presented also a higher cell number and diameter when compared to the control (CTRL). In summary, our data indicate that coculture with MSC or MEF improves early embryonic development and quality in vitro." .

Therapies protecting photoreceptor from degeneration remain to be developed. Anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, and neuroprotective effects of celastrol have been demonstrated in a variety of disease models. The current study aimed to investigate the photoreceptor protective effect of celastrol. MethodsBright light-induced retinal degeneration in BALB/c mice was used, and morphological, functional, and molecular changes of retina were evaluated in the absence and presence of celastrol treatment. ResultsSignificant morphological and functional protection was observed as a result of celastrol treatment in bright light-exposed BALB/c mice. Celastrol treatment resulted in suppression of cell death in photoreceptor cells, alleviation of oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, downregulation of retinal expression of proinflammatory genes, and suppression of microglia activation and gliosis in the retina. Additionally, leukostasis was found to be induced in the retinal vasculature in light-exposed BALB/c mice, which was significantly attenuated by celastrol treatment. In vitro, celastrol attenuated all-trans-retinal-induced oxidative stress in cultured APRE19 cells. Moreover, celastrol treatment significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharides-stimulated expression of proinflammatory genes in both APRE19 and RAW264.7 cells. ConclusionsThe results demonstrated for the first time that celastrol prevents against light-induced retinal degeneration through inhibition of retinal oxidative stress and inflammation." .

Individuals with these mood disorders are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death in part because of increased rates of obesity, inactivity, and diabetes mellitus compared to the general population. Exercise may not only mitigate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but could also potentially improve the long term outcomes of mood disorders. Recent findingsWe conducted a literature review on the impact of exercise on mood disorders and associated comorbid conditions as well as possible biological mechanisms. We found that exercise impacts both the physical health parameters of mood disorders as well as mental health outcomes. Exercise also positively impacts conditions frequently comorbid with mood disorders (i.e. anxiety, pain, and insomnia). There are multiple candidate biomarkers for exercise, with brain-derived neurotrophic factor and oxidative stress as two main promising components of exercise’s anti-depressant effect. SummaryExercise appears to be a promising adjunct treatment for mood disorders. We conclude with recommendations for future research of exercise as an adjunct intervention for mood disorders." .

For hospitals in England (10), additional questions regarding their understanding of incidents to be reported as Never Events were asked.Results Thirteen hospitals replied (8 in England). All use a surgical safety checklist in an operating theatre setting. Ten use a surgical safety checklist in an outpatient setting for the extraction of teeth.

Fucoxanthin (Fx), a marine carotenoid, has demonstrated a variety of beneficial health effects. Despite accumulating evidence supporting the immune-modulating effects of Fx in vitro, the underlying signaling pathways remain unknown. In the present study, Fx dose-dependently inhibited the secretion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, reactive oxygen species (ROS), prostaglandin (PG) E2, and nitric oxide (NO) productions, and also suppressed the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 enzymes. Further, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, and COX-2 mRNA expression were suppressed by treatment with Fx in a dose-dependently manner. The mechanism studies indicated that Fx blocks protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs)/transcription factor (AP)-1 pathways. In addition, we demonstrated that Fx increases nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf)-2 activation and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia. Subsequently, we found that Fx also mediates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) pathway, and promotes the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These results indicate that Fx may be more effective and potential than other candidates via either decreasing the pro-inflammatory factors production or increasing the neuroprotective molecules expression for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases." .

Fluid restriction, dehydration by sweating (sauna or exercise) and the use of diuretics are among the most recurrent means of weight cutting. Although it is difficult to dissuade athletes from this practice due to the possible negative effect of severe dehydration on their health, athletes may be receptive to avoid weight cutting if there is evidence that it could affect their muscle performance. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate if hypohydration, to reach a weight category, affects neuromuscular performance and combat sports competition results. MethodsWe tested 163 (124 men and 39 woman) combat sports athletes during the 2013 senior Spanish National Championships. Body mass and urine osmolality (UOSM) were measured at the official weigh-in (PRE) and 13–18 h later, right before competing (POST). Athletes were divided according to their USOM at PRE in euhydrated (EUH; UOSM 250–700 mOsm · kgH2O−1), hypohydrated (HYP; UOSM 701–1080 mOsm · kgH2O−1) and severely hypohydrated (S-HYP; UOSM 1081–1500 mOsm · kgH2O−1). Athletes’ muscle strength, power output and contraction velocity were measured in upper (bench press and grip) and lower body (countermovement jump - CMJ) muscle actions at PRE and POST time-points. ResultsAt weigh-in 84 % of the participants were hypohydrated. Before competition (POST) UOSM in S-HYP and HYP decreased but did not reach euhydration levels. However, this partial rehydration increased bench press contraction velocity (2.8-7.3 %; p < 0.05) and CMJ power (2.8 %; p < 0.05) in S-HYP. Sixty-three percent of the participants competed with a body mass above their previous day’s weight category and 70 of them (69 % of that sample) obtained a medal. ConclusionsHypohydration is highly prevalent among combat sports athletes at weigh-in and not fully reversed in the 13–18 h from weigh-in to competition. Nonetheless, partial rehydration recovers upper and lower body neuromuscular performance in the severely hypohydrated participants. Our data suggest that the advantage of competing in a lower weight category could compensate the declines in neuromuscular performance at the onset of competition, since 69 % of medal winners underwent marked hypohydration." .

Some researchers have proposed that combining physical exercise with cognitive training may augment the benefits of cognition. However, strong evidence is lacking regarding whether a combined therapy is superior to a single type of training for older adults with MCI. Moreover, which combination approach – combining physical exercise with cognitive training sequentially or simultaneously – is more advantageous for cognitive improvement is not yet clear. This proposed study is designed to clarify these questions. Methods/designThis study is a single-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Eighty individuals with MCI will be recruited and randomly assigned to cognitive training (COG), physical exercise training (PE), sequential training (SEQ), and dual-task training (DUAL) groups. The intervention programs will be 90 min/day, 2–3 days/week, for a total of 36 training sessions. The participants in the SEQ group will first perform 45 min of physical exercise followed by 45 min of cognitive training, whereas those in the DUAL group will perform physical exercise and cognitive training simultaneously. Participants will be assessed at baseline, after the intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. The primary cognitive outcome tests will include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the color-naming Stroop test. Other outcomes will include assessments that evaluate the cognitive, physical, and daily functions of older adults with MCI.

Although a trend exists toward the concept of “damage control orthopedics” (DCO), current literature is inconclusive. Thus, a need exists for a more specific controlled clinical study. The primary objective of this study was to clarify whether a risk-adapted procedure for treating femoral fractures, as opposed to an early definitive treatment strategy, leads to an improved outcome (morbidity and mortality). Methods/DesignThe study was designed as a randomized controlled multicenter study. Multiple-trauma patients with femur shaft fractures and a calculated probability of death of 20 to 60 % were randomized to either temporary fracture fixation with external fixation and defined secondary definitive treatment (DCO) or primary reamed nailing (early total care). The primary objective was to reduce the extent of organ failure as measured by the maximum sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. ResultsThirty-four patients were randomized to two groups of 17 patients each. Both groups were comparable regarding sex, age, injury severity score, Glasgow Coma Scale, prothrombin time, base excess, calculated probability of death, and other physiologic variables. The maximum SOFA score was comparable (nonsignificant) between the groups. Regarding the secondary endpoints, the patients with external fixation required a significantly longer ventilation period (p = 0.049) and stayed on the intensive care significantly longer (p = 0.037), whereas the in-hospital length of stay was balanced for both groups. Unfortunately, the study had to be terminated prior to reaching the anticipated sample size because of unexpected low patient recruitment. ConclusionsThus, the results of this randomized study reflect the ambivalence in the literature. No advantage of the damage control concept could be detected in the treatment of femur fractures in multiple-trauma patients. The necessity for scientific evaluation of this clinically relevant question remains. Trial registrationCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN10321620 Date assigned: 9 February 2007." .

However, the diagnosis, evaluation, clinical significance, and management of ankyloglossia are widely variable and controversial. Despite attempts to create standardized diagnostic criteria for ankyloglossia, there has yet to be a universally accepted system. Management of ankyloglossia often includes a multidisciplinary approach including lactation consultants, speech language pathologists, pediatricians, and otolaryngologists. Observation or conservative management for asymptomatic infants or infants with minimal or well-compensated symptoms is a reasonable option, whereas surgical intervention may be warranted for infants and children with ankyloglossia that has significant impact on breastfeeding or speech. Frenotomy (also known as frenulotomy) is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed at the bedside or office setting in very young infants, precluding the need for general anesthesia. Frenuloplasty is usually performed on older children and should be performed in the operating room with general anesthesia. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to definitively associate ankyloglossia with breastfeeding or speech deficits. Surgical intervention for ankyloglossia should be recommended with caution and performed only on infants or children with clear findings of ankyloglossia on physical exam and a documented history of breastfeeding or speech difficulties; the timing and method of treatment should be tailored to the individual infant or child.

However, MVV and LVV can often involve the renal artery and its branches, causing a wide array of lesions that range from renal artery stenosis to intra-renal vasculitis causing renal ischaemia/infarction, microaneurysms and haemorrhage. This review focuses on renal involvement in MVV and LVV and underlines why renal abnormalities in these syndromes should not be overlooked." .

Case presentationWe report the first Danish family diagnosed with diffuse non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma of Bothnian type in which fourteen individuals are potentially affected. The proband, a 36-year-old male had since childhood been affected by pronounced hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles along with palmoplantar keratoderma. He reported a very distinctive feature of the disorder, aquagenic wrinkling, as he developed pronounced maceration of the skin with translucent white papules and a spongy appearance following exposure to water. The patient presented recurrent fungal infections, a wellknown feature of the condition, but also periodic worsening with pitted keratolysis and malodour due to bacterial infections. ConclusionsPalmoplantar keratoderma of Bothnian type, which may be associated with hyperhidrosis, is frequently complicated by fungal infections and may be complicated by Corynebacterium infections." .

Studies on specific types of lipids that are directly or indirectly altered by FD are very scarce, even though they are crucial in understanding the biological process linked to the pathogenesis of FD. We performed a comprehensive lipid profiling of plasma and urinary lipids from FD patients with nanoflow liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS/MS) and identified 129 plasma and 111 urinary lipids. Among these, lipids that exhibited alternations (>twofold) in patients were selected as targets for selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-based high-speed quantitation using nanoflow ultra-performance LC-ESI-MS/MS (nUPLC-ESI-MS/MS) and 31 plasma and 26 urinary lipids showed significant elevation among FD patients. Higher percentages of sphingolipids (SLs; 48 % for plasma and 42 % for urine) were highly elevated in patients; whereas, a smaller percentage of phospholipids (PLs; 15 % for plasma and 13 % for urine) were significantly affected. Even though α-galactosidase A is reported to affect THC only, the results show that other classes of lipids (especially SLs) are changed as well, indicating that FD not only alters metabolism of THC but various classes of lipids too.

However, conventional drug susceptibility test (DST) methods, which rely on the detection of the colony formation on a solid medium, require 1–2 months to the result. A rapid and accurate DST is necessary to identify patients with drug-resistant TB and treat them with appropriate drugs. Here, we used microscopic imaging of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) immobilized in an agarose matrix for a rapid DST. The agarose matrix, which was molded in a microfluidic chip, was inoculated with MTB, and TB drugs in liquid culture medium diffused throughout the agarose to reach the MTB immobilized in the agarose matrix. After the responses of MTB to drugs were tracked with an automated microscopic system, an image-processing program automatically determined the susceptibility and resistance of MTB to specific doses of TB drugs. The automatic DST system was able to assess the drug susceptibility of various drug-resistant clinical TB strains within 9 days with an accuracy comparable to that of conventional method. Our rapid DST method based on microscopic time-lapse imaging greatly reduces the time required for a DST and can be used to rapidly and accurately treat TB patients." .

A common final pathophysiology of PE is endothelial dysfunction. The most successful translational research model for explaining the cause–effect relationship in the genesis of PE is the angiogenic/angiostatic balance theory, involving soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble endoglin (sEng). In a systematic review of articles on the prediction of early-onset PE using angiogenesis-related factors, we revealed that the prediction of early-onset PE in the first trimester is clinically possible, but the prediction of early-onset PE in the early third trimester might be ideal. In addition, an onset threshold or a serial approach appeared to be clinically useful for predicting the imminent onset of PE, with onset at <4 weeks after blood sampling in the second and early third trimesters, because the positive likelihood ratio was >10 and the positive predictive value was >20%. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines state that the Triage PlGF testing and Elecsys immunoassay for the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio could help to exclude PE in women with suspected PE at 20–34 weeks of gestation. Until now, we have not found any effective therapies to prevent PE. However, low-dose aspirin treatment starting at ⩽16 weeks of gestation might be associated with a marked reduction in PE.

Over the last decade, inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce residual cardiovascular disease risk. Binding of PCSK9 to the LDL receptor targets the receptor for lysosomal degradation. The recognition that inhibition of PCSK9 increases LDL receptor activity has led to the development of a number of approaches to directly target PCSK9. Numerous monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are currently being evaluated in phase 3 trials, involving various patient categories on different background lipid-lowering therapies. Current evidence shows reductions in LDL-C levels of up to 70 % may be achieved with PCSK9 inhibition, independent of background statin therapy.

Treatment options are sometimes limited because of the accumulation of a drug and/or its metabolites. The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and plasma levels of topiroxostat, a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and its metabolites in patients receiving hemodialysis. MethodsThis was a 52-week open study. The plasma concentrations of topiroxostat and its metabolites were measured. The endpoints selected were effects on serum uric acid concentrations and the safety and tolerability of topiroxostat. A statistical analysis was performed using a paired t test with Bonferroni corrections. ResultsNineteen participants were followed for 52 weeks without significant adverse effects. Serum uric acid concentrations decreased from 527 ± 49 to 325 ± 62, 297 ± 99, 297 ± 68, and 296 ± 83 μmol/L (weeks 4, 12, 26, and 52; p < 0.001, respectively). The dosage of topiroxostat was 20 mg twice per day in all patients. The clearances of topiroxostat and its metabolites by a dialyzer by use of an arterio-venous method were 55.9 ± 31.1 mL/min (topiroxostat), 143.9 ± 37.0 mL/min (N-oxide), 179.0 ± 41.1 mL/min (N 1-glucuronide), and 192.9 ± 37.0 mL/min (N 2-glucuronide). Plasma concentrations of topiroxostat did not increase during the 52-week study period. The concentrations of the metabolites of topiroxostat (N 1-glucuronide and N 2-glucuronide) slightly increased at the 0-h point on week 4 and remained at similar levels for 52 weeks. ConclusionsTopiroxostat effectively reduced serum uric acid concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Topiroxostat and its metabolites were partly cleared during hemodialysis and were sufficiently low to allow for the continued administration of the drug for 52 weeks." .

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of proximal dental caries is often stifled due to the poor quality of dental X-ray images. Therefore, we propose an automatic detection system to detect proximal dental caries in periapical images for the first time. The system comprises four modules: horizontal alignment of pictured teeth, probability map generation, crown extraction, and refinement. We first align the pictured teeth horizontally as a pre-process to minimize performance degradation due to rotation. Next, a fully convolutional network are used to produce a caries probability map while crown regions are extracted based on optimization schemes and an edge-based level set method. In the refinement module, the caries probability map is refined by the distance probability modeled by crown regions since caries are located near tooth surfaces. Also we adopt non-maximum suppression to improve the detection performance. Experiments on various periapical images reveal that the proposed system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and crown extraction is superior to the system using a naïve CNN." .

To clarify the functional roles of the AKT-mTOR pathway in the hippocampal neurons, we generated conditional knockout mice harboring the deletion of Pten (Pten-cKO) in Proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. The Pten-cKO mice developed normally until 8 weeks of age, then presented generalized seizures at 8–10 weeks of age. Video-monitored electroencephalograms detected paroxysmal discharges emerging from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These mice showed progressive hypertrophy of the dentate gyrus (DG) with increased expressions of excitatory synaptic markers (Psd95, Shank3 and Homer). In contrast, the expression of inhibitory neurons (Gad67) was decreased at 6–8 weeks of age. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the abnormal sprouting of mossy fibers in the DG of the Pten-cKO mice prior to the onset of seizures. The treatment of these mice with an mTOR inhibitor rapamycin successfully prevented the development of seizures and reversed these molecular phenotypes. These data indicate that the mTOR pathway regulates hippocampal excitability in the postnatal brain." .

However, it remains uncertain whether an upper transconjunctival sclerocorneal incision can cause minor blepharoptosis. In the present prospective study, patients underwent cataract surgery with either an upper or temporal 2.4-mm transconjunctival sclerocorneal incision. We measured the marginal reflex distance 1 (MRD1) preoperatively and postoperatively, and compared these measurements between the two different incision types. Further we explored the risk factors of the postoperative MRD1 reduction. MethodsThe study population included patients who underwent cataract surgery on both eyes at Aichi Medical University between October 2013 and September 2015. In each patient, one eye was operated using an upper 2.4-mm transconjunctival sclerocorneal incision, and the other with a temporal incision. We prespecified that an MRD1 difference of ≥0.5 mm between the pre- and post-surgical measurements indicated postoperative ptosis, which was a strict criterion. MRD1 was measured using digital photography, and we calculated the difference between the preoperative and postoperative MRD1 values. This change in MRD1 was compared between the groups with different incision locations. The change in MRD1 was analyzed by using the multivariate regression model including incision position (temporal or upper), preoperative MRD1, and preoperative distance between medial and lateral canthi. ResultsWe assessed data from a total of 34 patients. The mean change in MRD1 from pre-operation to post-operation measurements was −0.26 ± 0.93 with the temporal incision and −0.24 ± 0.86 with the upper incision. The mean difference in the change in MRD1 between the different two incision types was −0.02, with a 95 % CI of −0.24 to 0.20, establishing equivalence between these incision types. The multivariate regression analysis showed that the preoperative MRD1 was significantly associated with the reduction of MRD1 after surgery (p = 0.034). ConclusionsCataract surgery using upper and temporal 2.4-mm transconjunctival sclerocorneal incisions are clinically equivalent with regards to change in MRD1, and neither incision type caused critical postoperative ptosis. The longer preoperative MRD1 was significantly associated with the reduction of MRD1 after surgery. Trial registrationCurrent Controlled Trials UMIN000022310.

Cortistatin (CST), a novel bio-active peptide, has been shown to exert multiple protective effects on the cardiovascular system. However, the role and possible mechanism of CST in VC remain unclear. Therefore, we used β-glycerophosphoric acid (β-GP) to induce calcification in rat and human VSMCs to determine the effects of CST on osteoblastic differentiation and VSMC mineralization in vitro. Compared with the control, β-GP significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium content in cultured rat and human VSMCs, as well as multicellular node formation and calcium deposition, as confirmed by von Kossa and Alizarin Red S staining assays. After incubating rat and human VSMCs with β-GP in the presence of different doses of CST (10−8 or 10−7 mol/L), CST clearly reversed the β-GP-induced increases in ALP activity and calcium content and formation of pathological calcified nodes of VSMCs in a dose-independent manner. Moreover, 10−8 and 10−7 mol/L CST inhibited the phenotypic transformation of VSMCs into osteoblastic cells by decreasing the osteocalcin protein levels, increasing the SM-α-actin protein levels, and reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress by decreasing the protein expression of glucose-regulated protein 94 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein. In conclusion, CST directly inhibited β-GP-induced calcification of VSMCs in vitro, probably by suppressing ERS and phenotypic transformation of VSMCs into osteoblastic cells. These results indicate that CST represents a potential target for the prevention and treatment of VC." .

However, this prediction should be tested for species with protracted breeding seasons, since it is not clear how reproduction is fuelled over several consecutive months of spawning. The simultaneous hermaphrodite scallop Pecten fumatus was used to test the hypothesis that protracted spawning is supported by both capital and income strategies, depending on the state of energy reserves and food availability at the time of oocyte maturation. The study was carried out in Great Bay, Tasmania, Australia (147.335W, 43.220S) in 2010/2011. The use of glycogen, protein and lipid in the muscle, gonad, and digestive gland was examined, along with the role of atretic eggs as an alternative energy source for oogenesis and maturation. The reproductive stage of an individual was determined using only the ovaries. P. fumatus uses a capital breeding strategy early in the reproductive cycle during winter and spring (August–October) with muscle glycogen and protein and digestive gland lipid providing energy for oogenesis. Given there was no evidence of energy stores being used later in the reproductive cycle in late spring and summer (November–March), when less food was available for direct fuelling of reproduction, it appears that metabolites produced from oocyte lysis may have fuelled oogenesis. Recycling of energy from oocyte resorption must be considered as part of the strategy of energy use to fuel reproduction in marine invertebrates." .

Nearly a third of these admitted patients are re-admitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge. Whilst there is a move within the NHS to ensure that people with long-term conditions receive more co-ordinated care, there is little research evidence to support an optimum approach to this in COPD. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing standardised packages of care i.e. care bundles, for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD as a means of improving hospital care and reducing re-admissions. Methods / DesignThis mixed-methods evaluation will use a controlled before-and-after design to examine the effect of, and costs associated with, implementing care bundles for patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD, compared with usual care. It will quantitatively measure a range of patient and organisational outcomes for two groups of hospitals - those who deliver care using COPD care bundles, and those who deliver care without the use of COPD care bundles. These care bundles may be provided for patients with COPD following admission, prior to discharge or at both points in the care pathway. The primary outcome will be re-admission to hospital within 28 days of discharge, although the study will additionally investigate a number of secondary outcomes including length of stay, total bed days, in-hospital mortality, costs of care and patient / carer experience. A series of nested qualitative case studies will explore in detail the context and process of care as well as the impact of COPD bundles on staff, patients and carers. DiscussionThe results of the study will provide information about the effectiveness of care bundles as a way of managing in-hospital care for patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Given the number of unplanned hospital admissions for this patient group and their rate of subsequent re-admission, it is hoped that this evaluation will make a timely contribution to the evidence on care provision, to the benefit of patients, clinicians, managers and policy-makers.

However, functional changes are not easily explained by differences in crystal structures. We employ Markov state models to identify hidden conformations and explore their role in determining TEM’s specificity. We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique, called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts TEM specificity by accounting for conformational heterogeneity. Using our MSMs, we identify hidden states whose populations correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models’ prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced Ω-loop flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in drug and protein design." .

Growing evidence indicates that oxidative and nitrative modifications of proteins, including fibrinogen, may lead to changes in hemostasis. The study compares samples from patients with MM at diagnosis and healthy volunteers with regard to the oxidative/nitrative modifications of proteins, ROTEM and thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization. The content of carbonyl groups in plasma proteins of patients with MM was significantly higher than in controls (2.981 vs. 1.807 nmol/mg of protein, p = 0.005), while no differences were seen in the concentrations of nitrated proteins. Maximum clot firmness readings were significantly higher in the samples of patients than in controls according to FIBTEM test (23.5 vs. 15 mm, p = 0.006). The lag time of the fibrin polymerization process and the velocity of clot lysis (V Lys) were found to be significantly higher in the group of MM patients than controls. In contrast, no marked differences were identified between studied groups in reference to maximal velocity of fibrin polymerization process (V max), maximal absorbance (A max) and plasmin amidolytic activity values. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that at the time of diagnosis, patients with MM demonstrated greater oxidative stress than healthy volunteers, which is reflected in a higher amount of carbonylated proteins. Some prothrombotic features found in ROTEM tests in MM patients were not confirmed by turbidimetry." .

Here, we measured oxidative damage (protein carbonyls, 8-OHdG) and antioxidant protection (enzymatic antioxidant activity and serum antioxidant capacity) in multiple tissues of reproductive (R) and non-reproductive (N) mice from two mouse strains selectively bred for high (H) or low (L) food intake, which differ in their reproductive performance, i.e., H mice have increased milk energy output (MEO) and wean larger pups. Levels of oxidative damage were unchanged (liver) or reduced (brain and serum) in R versus N mice, and no differences in multiple measures of oxidative protection were found between H and L mice in liver (except for Glutathione Peroxidase), brain or mammary glands. Also, there were no associations between an individual’s energetic investment (e.g., MEO) and most of the oxidative stress measures detected in various tissues. These data are inconsistent with the oxidative stress theory, but were more supportive of, but not completely consistent, with the ‘oxidative shielding’ hypothesis." .

Potential significant differences between the methods could be misleading. This study aimed to confirm the agreement between the BGA and CL results and to analyze the effects of inter-methods bias on medical decisions. Methods.Blood samples from arterial lines were collected in the Cardio Surgical Intensive Care Unit simultaneously for gas analyses (RapidPoint 500, Siemens, Erlangen, Germania) and CL ( D×C $D{\\times}C$ 880i and D×H $D{\\times} H$ 800 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) determinations. Methods were compared using Passing-Bablok (PB) regression and Bland Altman analysis. Positive and negative false results of the BGA tests were calculated considering the reference CL tests at critical values for glucose (70, 150 and 180 mg/dL), hemoglobin (7 and 10 g/dL), potassium (3.5–5 mEq/L), sodium (135–145 mEq/L) and lactate (6.5–19.3 mg/dL). Results.PB regression did not show a significant deviation from linearity for all of the parameters; proportional and constant differences were observed for hemoglobin, potassium, and lactate. Intercept and slope of sodium and glucose regression line were significantly different from zero and one respectively. Only the potassium, lactate, and glucose bias estimations were acceptable. However, for hemoglobin it was possible to significantly lower negative false results using PB transformed data. Conclusions.Only the glucose, potassium and lactate results, using both methods, were interchangeable; however the hemoglobin adjustment of BGA values based on PB regression might represent a safer solution." .

Data of the effect of anaemia on functional status during hospitalization and mortality after discharge are limited. Aim of the study is to examine whether there is an association between anaemia, hand grip strength, gait speed and basic activities of daily living (ADL) during hospitalization and mortality 1 year after discharge in geriatric patients. MethodsIn a prospective study, data on age, sex, body mass index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), main clinical diagnosis, number of comorbidities, hand grip strength, gait speed, ADL, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and estimated Glomerular filtration ratio (eGFR) were recorded in 220 older patients, admitted to the acute geriatric ward of a university hospital. Anaemia was defined as a haemoglobin level <13 g/dL for men and <12 g/dL for women and was further specified into severe (haemoglobin level <10 g/dL for both men and women) and moderate anaemia (haemoglobin between 10 and 12 g/dL for women and 10 and 13 g/dL for men). Gait speed (in meters per second) was calculated after a 4.5 m walk and hand grip strength (in kilogram) was assessed with a hydraulic hand dynamometer. Functionality was assessed in the six basic activities of daily living. Information about the vital status was obtained 1 year after discharge with a telephone call. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the effect of the anaemia status on the walking speed, hand grip strength and premorbid ADL index and logistic regression analysis was used to examine whether anaemia could be identified as risk factors for mortality 12 months after discharge. ResultsOverall, 106 (48 %) patients had anaemia. Hand-grip strength, gait speed and ADL score were not significantly different between anaemic and non-anaemic hospitalized geriatric patients. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, eGFR, MMSE, number of comorbidities and main clinical diagnosis, the means for hand-grip strength were 17.3, 19.9 and 19.1 kg (p = 0.38); for gait speed 0.57, 0.52 and 0.47 m/s (p = 0.28); and for the ADL score 3.50, 3.05 and 3.30 (p = 0.75) in patients with severe, moderate and without anaemia, respectively. In the unadjusted model, the odds ratio for mortality 1 year after discharge was 2.72 (95 % CI 1.20–6.14) and 4.70 (95 % CI 1.91–11.77) for moderate and severe anaemia, respectively, with no anaemia as the reference group. After adjustment for several confounders, a haemoglobin level less than 10 g/dl (OR 3.87; 95 % CI 1.25–11.99) remained significantly associated with an increased mortality over that 1 year period. ConclusionOur results do not support that anaemia on admission is associated with a decline in physical performance (hand grip strength and gait speed) and functionality (ADL) during hospitalization in older patients. However, severe anaemia is a significant risk factor for an increased mortality over a 1 year period after discharge." .

In this research, we proposed a novel physico-mechanical parameter (PMP) for estimating the mechanical strength of travertines after a freeze–thaw test, which is based on initial mechanical strength, effective porosity, and mean pore size of the stones. For this purpose, 12 samples of travertines were selected and their initial mechanical strengths (uniaxial compressive, Brazilian tensile and point load strengths), effective porosity, and mean pore size were determined. Then a freeze–thaw test was conducted up to 60 cycles on samples, and their mechanical strengths were measured. The results showed that PMP is in good accuracy for estimating the mechanical strengths of stones after a freeze–thaw test, and thus making a rapid durability assessment. As a result, the PMP avoids performing a freeze–thaw test, which is laborious and time-consuming." .

The wide use of TIVADs is associated with important complications. A meta-analysis was undertaken to compare the internal jugular vein (IJV) with the subclavian vein (SCV) as the percutaneous access site for TIVAD to determine whether IJV has any advantages. MethodsAll randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies assessing the two access sites, IJV and SCV, were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and OVID EMB Reviews from their inception to December 2015. Random-effects models were used in all analyses. The endpoints evaluated included TIVAD-related infections, catheter-related thrombotic complications, and major mechanical complications. ResultsTwelve studies including 3905 patients published between 2008 and 2015, were included. Our meta-analysis showed that incidences of TIVAD-related infections (odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.48–1.04, P = 0.081) and catheter-related thrombotic complications (OR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.38–1.51, P = 0.433) were not significantly different between the two groups. However, compared with SCV, IJV was associated with reduced risks of total major mechanical complications (OR 0.38, 95 % CI 0.24–0.61, P < 0.001). More specifically, catheter dislocation (OR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.22–0.84, P = 0.013) and malfunction (OR 0.42, 95 % CI 0.28–0.62, P < 0.001) were more prevalent in the SCV than in the IJV group; however, the risk of catheter fracture (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.21–1.05, P = 0.065) were not significantly different between the two groups. Sensitivity analyses using fixed-effects models showed a decreased risk of catheter fracture in the IJV group. ConclusionThe IJV seems to be a safer alternative to the SCV with lower risks of total major mechanical complications, catheter dislocation, and malfunction. However, a large-scale and well-designed RCT comparing the complications of each access site is warranted before the IJV site can be unequivocally recommended as a first choice for percutaneous implantation of a TIVAD." .

MethodsCross-sectional data were collected from 954 Puerto Ricans, aged 46–79 years, in Boston, Massachusetts. In-person interviews were conducted to collect information on sociodemographics and lifestyle, mental status, medication use, comorbidities, sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and falls and fractures. Blood and urine samples, and bone density measures were collected to assess C-reactive protein, serum interleukin-6, urinary cortisol, and bone mineral density. ResultsMultivariate robust Poisson regressions suggested that adults with insomnia had a 32 % increased likelihood of having falls (PR 1.32, p < 0.05), after adjustment for multiple covariates. Age and gender modified the effect of insomnia on risk of falls. Insomnia was significantly associated with higher risk of falls in adults of 60 years or older (PR 1.49, p < 0.05) and in women (PR 1.36, p < 0.05), but not in adults younger than 60 years or in men. Insomnia was not associated with recurrent falls or fractures. ConclusionsAge and gender need to be taken into account when considering treatment of insomnia in preventing geriatric falls. Well-designed evidence-based interventions to treat insomnia and improve sleep quality may reduce the risk of falls in this population." .

The Australian Government provided supports (e.g., training for mental health professionals), resources (e.g., funding for positions devoted to fostering inter-agency linkages or partnerships) and various flexibilities in service delivery. This study aimed to explore the processes used in the implementation of the CMHS in order to achieve its objectives of delivering a high quality standard of service, and forging linkages and support networks with other relevant health and non-health agencies. Structured interviews were conducted with 20 program administrators, six referring professionals and eight mental health professionals. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed for themes using NVivo. The CMHS appears to have made good progress towards achieving its objectives by implementing processes that facilitated the delivery of a high quality service (e.g., engaging appropriately qualified, and encouraging additional training and clinical support for, mental health professionals; employing quality assurance mechanisms and clinical governance arrangements) and establishment of inter-agency linkages (e.g., devoting a professional role—Coordination and Liaison—to this purpose). Provider perspectives suggest that the CMHS has had a positive impact on children and their families. Comparable countries implementing primary mental health programs for children may benefit from considering similar additional supports (e.g., training for mental health professionals), resources (e.g., funding positions devoted to fostering service inter-agency linkages) and service delivery flexibilities as those available in the CMHS." .

The detection of such alterations requires a matched non-neoplastic sample for adequate filtering of non-somatic events such as germline polymorphisms. Non-neoplastic tissue adjacent to the excised neoplasm is often used for this purpose as it is simultaneously collected and generally contains the same tissue type as the neoplasm. Following NGS analysis, we and others have frequently observed low-level somatic mutations in these non-neoplastic tissues, which may impose additional challenges to somatic mutation detection as it complicates germline variant filtering. MethodsWe hypothesized that the low-level somatic mutation observed in non-neoplastic tissues may be entirely or partially caused by inadvertent contamination by neoplastic cells during the surgical pathology gross assessment or tissue procurement process. To test this hypothesis, we applied a systematic protocol designed to collect multiple grossly non-neoplastic tissues using different methods surrounding each single neoplasm. The procedure was applied in two breast cancer lumpectomy specimens. In each case, all samples were first sequenced by whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in the neoplasm and determine their presence in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. We then generated ultra-deep coverage using targeted sequencing to assess the levels of contamination in non-neoplastic tissue samples collected under different conditions. ResultsContamination levels in non-neoplastic tissues ranged up to 3.5 and 20.9 % respectively in the two cases tested, with consistent pattern correlated with the manner of grossing and procurement. By carefully controlling the conditions of various steps during this process, we were able to eliminate any detectable contamination in both patients. ConclusionThe results demonstrated that the process of tissue procurement contributes to the level of contamination in non-neoplastic tissue, and contamination can be reduced to below detectable levels by using a carefully designed collection method. A standard protocol dedicated for acquiring adjacent non-neoplastic tissue that minimizes neoplasm contamination should be implemented for all somatic mutation detection studies." .

Thus, a double blind placebo controlled multi-centered trial was planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of B. coagulans MTCC 5856 in diarrhea predominant IBS patients. MethodsThirty six newly diagnosed diarrhea predominant IBS patients were enrolled in three clinical centres. Along with standard care of treatment, 18 patients in group one received placebo while in group two 18 patients received B. coagulans MTCC 5856 tablet containing 2 × 109 cfu/day as active for 90 days. Clinical symptoms of IBS were considered as primary end point measures and were evaluated through questionnaires. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for abdominal pain. Physician’s global assessment and IBS quality of life were considered as secondary efficacy measures and were monitored through questionnaires. ResultsLaboratory parameters, anthropometric and vital signs were within the normal clinical range during the 90 days of supplementation in placebo and B. coagulans MTCC 5856 group. There was a significant decrease in the clinical symptoms like bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and stool frequency in a patient group receiving B. coagulans MTCC 5856 when compared to placebo group (p < 0.01).

However, inconsistencies exist between studies using these animal models, specifically in terms of the effects on synaptic plasticity, a major cellular model of learning and memory. Whereas some studies find impairments in plasticity in these models, others do not. We show that long-term potentiation (LTP), in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from this mouse, is impared at Tg2576 adult 6–7 months old. However, LTP is inducible again in slices taken from Tg2576 aged 14–19 months old. In the aged Tg2576, we found that the percentage of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in hippocampal CA1-3 region is significantly decreased, and LTP inhibition or reversal mediated by NRG1/ErbB signaling, which requires ErbB4 receptors in PV interneurons, is impaired. Inhibition of ErbB receptor kinase in adult Tg2576 restores LTP but impairs depotentiation as shown in aged Tg2576. Our study suggests that hippocampal LTP reemerges in aged Tg2576. However, this reemerged LTP is an insuppressible form due to impaired NRG1/ErbB signaling, possibly through the loss of PV interneurons." .

In order to understand this relationship, we have studied an AD-prediabetes mouse model (APP/PS1) with severe hyperinsulinemia induced by long-term high fat diet (HFD), and an AD-T2D model, generated by crossing APP/PS1 and db/db mice (APP/PS1xdb/db). In both, prediabetic and diabetic AD mice, we have analyzed underlying neuronal pathology and synaptic loss. At 26 weeks of age, when both pathologies were clearly established, we observed severe brain atrophy in APP/PS1xdb/db animals as well as cortical thinning, accompanied by increased caspase activity. Reduced senile plaque burden and elevated soluble Aβ40 and 42 levels were observed in AD-T2D mice. Further assessment revealed a significant increase of neurite curvature in prediabetic-AD mice, and this effect was worsened in AD-T2D animals. Synaptic density loss, analyzed by array tomography, revealed a synergistic effect between T2D and AD, whereas an intermediate state was observed, once more, in prediabetic-AD mice. Altogether, our data suggest that early prediabetic hyperinsulinemia may exacerbate AD pathology, and that fully established T2D clearly worsens these effects. Therefore, it is feasible that early detection of prediabetic state and strict metabolic control could slow or delay progression of AD-associated neuropathological features." .

Chickens in three control groups were fed a basal diet without PSE supplementation. Chickens in the three PSE addition groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with PSE at 100 (T100), 200 (T200), and 300 (T300) mg/kg of feed, respectively.

At 6 and 9 days post-inoculation, PSE supplementation at 200 mg/kg in the diet increased concentration of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (P < 0.05). PSE supplementation at 200 mg/kg in the diet significantly (P < 0.05) increased mRNA expressions of IFN-γ and IL-2 in the cecum of chickens at 9 days post-inoculation relative to the BC and NC group. The current results showed the anticoccidial properties, and beneficial effect on intestinal mucosa damage of PSE in broiler chickens that had been challenged by coccidiosis." .

To overcome this, other protocols have required the inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor to reprogram postmitotic neurons, which can result in tumorigenesis of the cells. We describe a method that does not require p53 inactivation but induces reprogramming in retinal cells from reprogrammable mice grown in aggregates with wild-type mouse retinal cells. After the first 10 d of reprogramming, the aggregates are then dispersed and plated on irradiated feeder cells to propagate and isolate individual iPSC clones. The reprogramming efficiency of different neuronal populations at any stage of development can be quantified using this protocol. Reprogramming retinal neurons using this protocol will take 56 d, and these retina-derived iPSCs can undergo retinal differentiation to produce retinae in 34 d. In addition, we describe a quantitative assessment of retinal differentiation from these neuron-derived iPSCs called STEM-RET. The procedure quantifies eye field specification, optic cup formation and retinal differentiation in 3D cultures using molecular, cellular and morphological criteria. An advanced level of cell culture experience is required to carry out this protocol." .

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence exerted by the cancer microenvironment on secretion of molecules during cancer progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we report that secretion of spingsine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its regulator, SphK1 expression is dependent of the substrate rigidity, which is critical for the balance between cancer cell invasion and adhesion. Conditioned media (CM) of MDA-MB-231, an aggressive breast cancer cell obtained from soft substrate (~0.5 kPa) induced chemo-attractive invasion, while CM obtained from stiff substrate (~2.5 kPa) increased cell adhesion instead. We found that the expression of SphK1 is upregulated in the stiff substrate, resulting in an increase in S1P levels in the CM. We also found that upregulation of SphK1 expression in the stiff substrate is dominant in metastatic cancer cells but not in primary cancer cells. These results suggest that alterations in the mechanical environment of the ECM surrounding the tumor cells actively regulate cellular properties such as secretion, which in turn, may contribute to cancer progression." .

MethodsNightmare frequency and subjectively experienced stress was elicited via questionnaires. The mothers-to-be were approached during their application visit about 4–8 weeks prior to delivery in three obstetric hospitals. The present analysis included 406 women aged 16–40 years in the last trimester of their pregnancy. Women with severe somatic illnesses and/or psychiatric disorders were excluded. The representative sample included 496 women (age range: 14–93 years.). ResultsThe findings clearly indicate that pregnant women report nightmares more often compared to a representative sample and that nightmare frequency is closely related to subjectively experienced stress during daytime. Moreover, baby-related dreams were correlated with nightmare frequency but not with day-time stress. ConclusionsFuture studies should investigate the prevalence of nightmare disorders in pregnancy and study whether brief interventions like Imagery Rehearsal Therapy are beneficial for pregnant women suffering from nightmares." .

The repertoire of IgA bound to gut bacteria reflects both T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways4,5, plus glycans present on the antibody’s secretory component6. Human gut bacterial taxa targeted by IgA in the setting of barrier dysfunction are capable of producing intestinal pathology when isolated and transferred to gnotobiotic mice7,8. A complex reorientation of gut immunity occurs as infants transition from passively acquired IgA present in breast milk to host-derived IgA9,10,11. How IgA responses co-develop with assembly of the microbiota during this period remains poorly understood. Here, we (1) identify a set of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose representations define a program of microbiota assembly and maturation during the first 2 postnatal years that is shared across 40 healthy twin pairs in the USA; (2) describe a pattern of progression of gut mucosal IgA responses to bacterial members of the microbiota that is highly distinctive for family members (twin pairs) during the first several postnatal months then generalizes across pairs in the second year; and (3) assess the effects of zygosity, birth mode, and breast feeding. Age-associated differences in these IgA responses can be recapitulated in young germ-free mice, colonized with faecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets that simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Most of these responses were robust to diet, suggesting that ‘intrinsic’ properties of community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses. The approach described can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states and to help discover ways of repairing or preventing perturbations in this facet of host immunity." .

Materials and methodsThe Shiga Diabetes Clinical Survey records medical performance in diabetic patients in primary care clinics and hospitals in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. In this study, laboratory data, modality of treatment for diabetes, and status of examination for diabetic complications were examined using results of surveys in 2000, 2006, and 2012. The study included 17,870, 18,398, and 24,219 patients for those years, respectively. ResultsMean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level significantly improved over 12 years and was significantly lower in the primary care clinics group than the hospitals group (7.3 ± 1.5 vs. 7.4 ± 1.4 % in 2000, 7.2 ± 1.2 vs. 7.4 ± 1.3 % in 2006, and 6.9 ± 1.0 vs. 7.1 ± 1.1 % in 2012). With regard to diabetic treatment modality, patients treated in hospitals used insulin more frequently than those in primary care clinics. The proportion of patients examined for diabetic complications increased but did not reach 50 % in 2012. Mean blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lowered, but blood pressure control was worse than that of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. ConclusionsThis study shows that glycemic control in both primary care clinics and hospitals has improved and was almost acceptable. However, examinations for diabetic complications and the control of blood pressure were still insufficient." .

BAL fluid samples from all patients with a positive PCR on the mitochondrial large subunit mRNA of P. jirovecii and possible cross exposure were typed with multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Five patients with a positive PcP PCR could have contact with another PcP patient. Another five patients with a weak positive PcP PCR on BAL fluid during the same period were also included.

Aging is associated with numerous changes to systemic physiology that affect physical function and performance. We present a narrative review of the literature aimed at discussing the age-related changes in various metrics of physical performance (exercise economy, anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake, muscle strength, and power). It also explores aging exercise physiology as it relates to global physical performance. Finally, this review examines the vascular contributions to aging exercise physiology. Numerous studies have shown that older adults exhibit substantial reductions in physical performance. The process of decline in endurance capacity is particularly insidious over the age of 60 years and varies considerably as a function of sex, task specificity, and individual training status. Starting at the age of 50 years, aging also implicates an impressive deterioration of neuromuscular function, affecting muscle strength and power. Muscle atrophy, together with minor deficits in the structure and function of the nervous system and/or impairments in intrinsic muscle quality, plays an important role in the development of neuromotor senescence. Large artery stiffness increases as a function of age, thus triggering subsequent changes in pulsatile hemodynamics and systemic endothelial dysfunction. For this reason, we propose that vascular senescence has a negative impact on cerebral, cardiac, and neuromuscular structure and function, detrimentally affecting physical performance." .

To learn from our experience, we described the critical care response to the outbreak. Methods This observational study was conducted at the Intensive Care Department which covered 5 ICUs with 60 single-bedded rooms. We described qualitatively and, as applicable, quantitatively the response of intensive care services to the outbreak. The clinical course and outcomes of healthcare workers (HCWs) who had MERS were noted. Results Sixty-three MERS patients were admitted to 3 MERS-designated ICUs during the outbreak (peak census = 27 patients on August 25, 2015, and the last new case on September 13, 2015). Most patients had multiorgan failure. Eight HCWs had MERS requiring ICU admission (median stay = 28 days): Seven developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, four were treated with prone positioning, four needed continuous renal replacement therapy and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The hospital mortality of ICU MERS patients was 63.4 % (0 % for the HCWs). In response to the outbreak, the number of negative-pressure rooms was increased from 14 to 38 rooms in 3 MERS-designated ICUs. Patients were managed with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:0.8. Infection prevention practices were intensified. As a surrogate, surface disinfectant and hand hygiene gel consumption increased by ~30 % and 17 N95 masks were used per patient/day on average. Family visits were restricted to 2 h/day. Although most ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS, all reported to work normally. During the outbreak, 27.0 % of nurses and 18.4 % of physicians working in the MERS-designated ICUs reported upper respiratory symptoms, and were tested for MERS-CoV. Only 2/196 (1.0 %) ICU nurses and 1/80 (1.3 %) physician tested positive, had mild disease and recovered fully. The total sick leave duration was 138 days for nurses and 30 days for physicians. Conclusions Our hospital outbreak of MERS resulted in 63 patients requiring organ support and prolonged ICU stay with a high mortality rate. The ICU response required careful facility and staff management and proper infection control and prevention practices." .

MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted to enrolled subjects with documented dyslipidemia. A total of 202 patients with dyslipidemia were recruited and 138 were undergone aspirin treatment before this indexed admission and 64 had never been treated with aspirin. All subjects were undergone coronary angiography to diagnoses CHD. Clinical characteristics were collected and comparisons were performed between subjects with aspirin and subjects without aspirin therapy. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the relation between aspirin and incident CHD and bleeding events. ResultsCompared to those with aspirin therapy, CHD incidence was significantly higher in subjects without aspirin therapy (23.4 % versus 18.1 %, P < 0.05). Five patients in the aspirin group had gastrointestinal bleeding and no bleeding event was occurred in subjects without aspirin therapy. Subjects with aspirin therapy had higher rate of previous helicobacter pylori (HP) infection (8.7 % versus 4.7 %, P < 0.05). Compared to subjects without CHD, subjects with CHD were older, had higher frequencies of males and smokers, had higher heart rate, serum LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) and Hs-CRP levels. Percentages of subjects with hypertension, diabetes, gastrointestinal bleeding, and HP infection were also considerably higher in CHD group (P < 0.05 for all comparison). Logistic regression analysis revealed that aspirin was associated with reduced incidence of CHD, with odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.94, P < 0.05). Regarding safety endpoint, gastrointestinal bleeding risk associated with aspirin was attenuated to nonsignificant after adjusting for HP infection, with OR of 1.16 (95 % CI: 0.99-1.52, P = 0.178). ConclusionAspirin is beneficial for reducing incident CHD, while modestly increases gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Screening subjects with previous HP infection may avoid aspirin-related gastrointestinal bleeding." .

It has been demonstrated closely associated with bimodal disruption of blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) in our previous work. Aquaporin (AQP)1 plays important but contradictory roles in water homeostasis. Recently, microRNAs (miRs) effectively regulate numerous target mRNAs during ischemia. However, whether miRs are able to protect against dimodal disruption of BSCB by regulating perivascular AQP1 remains to be elucidated. ResultsSpinal water content and EB extravasation were suggested as a bimodal distribution in directly proportion to AQP1, since all maximal changes were detected at 12 and 48 h after reperfusion. Further TEM and double immunofluorescence showed that former disruption of BSCB at 12 h was attributed to cytotoxic edema by up-regulated AQP1 expressions in astrocytes, whereas the latter at 48 h was mixed with vasogenic edema with both endothelial cells and astrocytes involvement. Microarray analysis revealed that at 12 h post-injury, ten miRs were upregulated (>2.0 fold) and seven miRs were downregulated (<0.5 fold) and at 48 h, ten miRs were upregulated and eleven were downregulated compared to Sham-operated controls. Genomic screening and luciferase assays identified that miR-320a was a potential modulator of AQP1 in spinal cord after IR in vitro. In vivo, compared to rats in IR and negative control group, intrathecal infusion of miR-320a mimic attenuated IR-induced lower limb motor function deficits and BSCB dysfunction as decreased EB extravasation and spinal water content through down-regulating AQP1 expressions, whereas pretreated with miR-320a AMO reversed above effects. ConclusionThese findings indicate miR-320a directly and functionally affects spinal cord edema through negatively regulating AQP1 of BSCB after IR." .

Members of this class of organoselenium compounds have promising pharmacological activities, among them are antioxidant and acute antidepressant-like activities with the involvement of monoaminergic system, as previously presented by our research group. ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to investigate the possible involvement of cellular signalling pathways in the antidepressant-like effect caused by OSX (0.01 mg/kg, oral route (p.o.) by gavage) in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice. MethodsMice were treated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection either with vehicle or with H-89 (1 μg/site i.c.v., an inhibitor of protein kinase A-PKA), KN-62 (1 μg/site i.c.v., an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-CAMKII), chelerythrine (1 μg/site i.c.v., an inhibitor of protein kinase C-PKC) or PD098059 (5 μg/site i.c.v., an inhibitor of extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2-ERK1/2). Fifteen minutes after, vehicle or OSX was injected, and 30 min later, the TST and open field tests (OFT) were carried out. ResultsThe antidepressant-like effect of orally administered OSX was blocked by treatment of the mice with H-89, KN-62, chelerythrine and PD098059; all inhibitors of signalling proteins involved with neurotrophic signalling pathways. The number of crossings in the OFT was not altered by treatment with OSX and/or signalling antagonists. ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that OSX showed an antidepressant-like effect in the TST in mice through the activation of protein kinases PKA, PKC, CAMKII and ERK1/2 that are involved in intracellular signalling pathways." .

Eukaryotic inositol-hexakisphosphate (InsP6) binds an autoprocessing domain to activate a proteolysis event that releases the N-terminal glucosyltransferase domain into the cytosol. Here, we report the crystal structure of a 1,832-amino-acid fragment of TcdA (TcdA1832), which reveals a requirement for zinc in the mechanism of toxin autoprocessing and an extended delivery domain that serves as a scaffold for the hydrophobic α-helices involved in pH-dependent pore formation. A surface loop of the delivery domain whose sequence is strictly conserved among all large clostridial toxins is shown to be functionally important, and is highlighted for future efforts in the development of vaccines and novel therapeutics.\n" .

Forty-five participants were recruited and randomly divided into 3 groups using a randomization schedule. The control group (CG, n = 15) and the acupuncture group (AG, n = 15) were treated by manipulation acupuncture, and the moxibustion group (MG, n = 15) was treated by indirect moxibustion. Primary outcomes were the scores of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI). Secondary outcomes were the HRV parameters which can reflect activity of the autonomic nervous system. This trial considered both instantaneous changes and long-term effectiveness. FAI scores decreased after the 4th and 10th treatments in the 3 groups. The decrease in FAI in the MG was greater than that in the AG. Acupuncture was more effective in instantaneous changes of HRV and moxibustion in long-term aspects. Both acupuncture and moxibustion improved fatigue in CFS patients, but moxibustion was more effective. The possible mechanism of the intervention may be through activation of the vagus nerve. Moxibustion was more effective than acupuncture in long-term treatment of CFS." .

MethodsAntibiotic carriers (CD-MAN and CD-GLU) are prepared from β-cyclodextrin grafted with sugar molecules (D-mannose and D-glucose, respectively) via azide-alkyne click reaction. The sugar molecules serve as a chemoattractant enticing the bacteria to take in higher amounts of the antibiotic, resulting in rapid killing of the bacteria. ResultsThree types of hydrophobic antibiotics, erythromycin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin, are used as model drugs and loaded into the carriers. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotics in the CD-MAN-antibiotic and CD-GLU-antibiotic complexes for Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains, and a number of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus strains, including the methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), are reduced by a factor ranging from 3 to >100. The CD-MAN-antibiotic complex is also able to prolong the stability of the loaded antibiotic and inhibit development of intrinsic antibiotic resistance in the bacteria. ConclusionsThese non-cytotoxic sugar-modfied nanocarriers can potentiate the activity of existing antibiotics, especially against multidrug-resistant bacteria, which is highly advantageous in view of the paucity of new antibiotics in the pipeline." .

Thus, the aims of the current study were to develop and evaluate a new wearable exoskeleton for gait rehabilitation assistance integrated with a mobility system (RehabWheel) for patients with gait impairment. A wearable exoskeleton was controlled by artificial pneumatic muscles to mimic joint movement; appropriate gait training was then undertaken. In total, 13 healthy males participated in evaluating RehabWheel by comparing joint angle kinematics and muscle activation patterns during walking over ground with RehabWheel and normal gaits. The joint angle kinematics of the hip and knee joints with RehabWheel were similar to those of normal gait despite differences in their magnitude. Additionally, muscle activations in the hip and knee joints were less during RehabWheel gait than normal gait and were associated with joint kinematics. These findings indicate that RehabWheel may have potential for incorporation into gait rehabilitative training assistance combined with a wheelchair platform for movement. This study is valuable for the initial identification of the practical feasibility of this new mobility system with both mobility and gait rehabilitation functions." .

Humans are among the very few species that menstruate and that, consequently, are equipped with unique cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling these cyclic processes. Many reproductive pathologies are specific to menstruating species, and studies in animal models rarely translate to humans. Abnormal remodelling and regeneration of the human endometrium leads to a range of reproductive complications. Furthermore, the processes regulating endometrial remodelling and implantation, including those controlling hormonal impact, breakdown and repair, stem/progenitor cell activation, inflammation and cell invasion have broad applications to other fields. This Review presents current knowledge regarding the normal and abnormal function of the human endometrium. The development of biomarkers for prediction of uterine diseases and pregnancy disorders and future avenues of investigation to improve fertility and enhance endometrial function are also discussed." .

In order to improve their quality of life, the need was felt to review the present status of ovarian steroid hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in them. The purpose was to examine the published literature on menopause management in them and highlight the risks and benefits. MethodsThe literature search on menopause management in cancer survivors was performed. The research and review articles in English language on the subject that were available and accessible were reviewed. And the recommendations and opinions were presented as working guidelines. ConclusionTreatment of some of gynecological cancers and the breast cancer results in abrupt loss of ovarian function and severe menopausal symptoms. Use of HRT in women with a genetic predisposition for or development of a gynecological malignancy suggests no proven adverse oncologic effects as a result of short-term use. The main concerns are the potential stimulation of residual cancer and the induction of new hormone-dependent disease. The majority of the most common gynecological malignancies like squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix, serous papillary epithelial ovarian carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva are not estrogen dependent. HRT is not shown to adversely affect the outcome in patients after treatment for hormone-sensitive cancers like early-stage endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium. In cases with low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, it is an absolute contraindication. The option needs to be discussed individually with the survivor providing unbiased information." .

Rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification, 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) and safety were evaluated in patients who were receiving concomitant ARAs.RESULTS:Among 2,053 patients enrolled and dosed with study drug, 410 (20%) were receiving concomitant ARAs; of these, 308 (15%) were taking concomitant PPIs. Rates of SVR12 were 95.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93.5–97.4%) among patients receiving an ARA, and 96.3% (95% CI 95.3–97.2%) in patients not receiving a concomitant ARA. Similarly, among patients receiving a PPI or not, SVR12 was achieved in 95.1% (95% CI 92.1–97.0%) and 96.4% (95% CI 95.5–97.2%), respectively. Response rates were high regardless of treatment regimen (with or without RBV), and among patients receiving a standard or high dose of PPIs. Regarding safety, adverse events and serious adverse events were more frequently reported in patients taking concomitant ARAs, though baseline population differences may have played a role.CONCLUSIONS:In phase 3 trials of OBV/PTV/r plus DSV and RBV in HCV genotype 1-infected patients, SVR12 rates were high regardless of ARA/PPI use or PPI dose.

Therefore, the strategies in the surgical intervention for PCP meningiomas have not been well established. Moreover, the presence of deep and critical neuroanatomical structures and relatively high morbidity, which can be difficult to predict preoperatively, make their surgical excision more challenging. We report two surgical cases of PCP meningioma and discuss the appropriate assessment of preoperative features and surgical strategies with review of the literature. Our study suggests that PCP meningioma may be characterized by the anterior displacement of internal carotid artery, and infero-laterally shifted posterior communicating arteries, and homonymous hemianopsia, a distinctive clinical feature. One of the key issues in PCP meningioma surgery is preservation of the optic nerve. Unlocking the optic nerve by anterior clinoidectomy and dissection, the falciform ligament is the important step to preserve vision for larger tumors. Complication with the perforators is also hazardous of these challenging surgeries than anterior clinoid meningiomas for their specific neuroanatomical structures and might not be feasible to avoid even with additional techniques and critical monitoring. A combination and multi-staged-surgical approach can be options of tailor-made surgical strategy in cases with tumor adhesion to the perforators." .

While supportive contacts are essential for many tasks, little is known about their impact on motor learning. To study the effect of contacts an innovative full-body experimental paradigm was established. The task of the subjects was to reach for a distant target while postural stability could only be maintained by establishing an additional supportive hand contact. To examine adaptation, non-trivial postural perturbations of the subjects’ support base were systematically introduced. A novel probabilistic trajectory model approach was employed to analyze the correlation between the motions of both arms and the trunk. We found that subjects adapted to the perturbations by establishing target dependent hand contacts. Moreover, we found that the trunk motion adapted significantly faster than the motion of the arms. However, the most striking finding was that observations of the initial phase of the left arm or trunk motion (100–400 ms) were sufficient to faithfully predict the complete movement of the right arm. Overall, our results suggest that the goal-directed arm movements determine the supportive arm motions and that the motion of heavy body parts adapts faster than the light arms." .

MethodsHealthy resistance-trained males (n = 30) performed preliminary testing (T1) whereby they: 1) donated a baseline blood draw, 2) performed knee extensor dynamometry to obtain peak quadriceps isometric and isokinetic torque as well as electromyography (EMG) activity at 60°/s and 120°/s, and 3) performed a one repetition maximum (1RM) barbell back squat. The following week participants performed 10 sets x 5 repetitions at 80 % of their 1RM barbell back squat for 3 consecutive days and 48 h following the third lifting bout participants returned for (T2) testing whereby they repeated the T1 battery.

Evaluating the balance between regulatory T cells and effector T cells could be useful for monitoring the proinflammatory profile of LP. Therefore, this study aimed to assess populations of dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory and effector T cells in peripheral blood samples collected from patients with LP to evaluate the polyfunctionality of T cells upon toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 18 patients with LP and 22 healthy control subjects were stimulated with agonists of TLR4, TLR7, TLR7/TLR8 or TLR9. Frequencies of circulating IFN-α+ plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs); TNF-α+ myeloid DCs (mDCs); regulatory T cells (Tregs); and IL-17-, IL-10-, IL-22-, TNF-, and IFN-γ-secreting T cells were assessed via flow cytometry. ResultsThe frequencies of regulatory CD4+ and CD8+CD25+Foxp3+CD127low/− T cells and TNF-α+ mDCs were induced following activation with TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 agonists in the LP group. Moreover, increased baseline frequencies of CD4+IL-10+ T cells and CD8+IL-22+ or IFN-γ+T cells were found. In the LP group, TLR4 activation induced an increased frequency of CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells, while TLR7/8 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activation induced an increased frequency of CD8+ IL-22+ T cells. An increased frequency of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells that simultaneously secreted 3 of the evaluated cytokines (not including IL-10) was verified upon TLR7/8/9 activation, while polyfunctional CD8+ T cells were already detectable at baseline. ConclusionsTLR-mediated activation of the innate immune response induced the production of proinflammatory mDCs, Tregs and polyfunctional T cells in patients with LP. Therefore, TLR activation has an adjuvant role in inducing both innate and adaptive immune responses." .

A total of 38 orally administered drugs were included in this classification. Dose numbers were calculated using age-appropriate initial gastric volume for neonates, 6-month-old infants, and children aging 1 year through adulthood. Using age-appropriate initial gastric volume and British National Formulary age-specific dosing recommendations in the calculation of dose numbers, the solubility classes shifted from low to high in pediatric subpopulations of 12 years and older for amoxicillin, 5 years, 12 years and older for cephalexin, 9 years and older for chloramphenicol, 3–4 years, 9–11 and 15 years and older for diazepam, 18 years and older (adult) for doxycycline and erythromycin, 8 years and older for phenobarbital, 10 years and older for prednisolone, and 15 years and older for trimethoprim.

In the present study, we have attempted to construct an assay system for UA production in vitro employing cultured AML12 hepatocytes. UA levels in balanced salt solution (BSS) in the presence of UA precursor nucleosides, adenosine, inosine, guanosine and xanthine, at 12.5, 25, and 100 µM were significantly higher than BSS alone and their effects were dose-dependent, while all the UA precursors did not significantly increase intracellular UA levels. Hence, UA levels in BSS were thereafter adopted as an index of UA production. UA production from nucleosides was significantly higher than that from nucleotides (GMP, IMP and AMP). UA production from guanosine and inosine in combination (GI mixture) as well as nucleosides increased time-dependently and almost linearly up to 2 h. Selecting GI mixture, effects of allopurinol, a widely used anti-hyperuricemic agent, and quercetin, a well-known polyphenol in onion and strawberry, on UA production were examined. Both allopurinol and quercetin dose-dependently (0.1, 0.3 and 1 μM for allopurinol and 10, 30, and 100 μM for quercetin) and significantly reduced UA production in the hepatocytes. They also significantly reduced hyperuricemia induced by intraperitoneal injection of UA precursor purine bodies to mice at a single oral dose of 10 (allopurinol) or 200 (quercetin) mg/kg body weight. This assay system for UA production in cultured hepatocytes is considered to be useful to search for novel anti-hyperuricemic compounds in foods and natural resources with possibility to have human health benefits." .

Along with strong vitreoretinal attachment at the fovea, the precortical pocket plays a role in perifoveal posterior vitreous detachments, which may lead to macular holes, premacular membranes, and ring-shaped proliferation in diabetic retinopathy. I and my colleagues published pioneer studies of the vitreous in postmortem eyes. Here, the role of the precortical pocket in various vitreoretinal interface diseases is discussed. Swept-source optical coherence tomography showed development of the precortical pocket, the connecting channel, and Cloquet’s canal during early childhood. These findings raised the possibility that aqueous humor may drain into the precortical pocket. The physiologic role of the drainage route is also discussed.

In this study, we provide mechanistic insight into how CRP contributes to the development of AMD. In particular, we show that monomeric CRP (mCRP) but not the pentameric form (pCRP) upregulates IL-8 and CCL2 levels in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Further, we show that complement factor H (FH) binds mCRP to dampen its proinflammatory activity.

Concurrent with such a discovery, much effort has been allocated to the precise monitoring of physiological BNP levels. Thus, it can be used to guide the therapy of heart failure and determine the patient’s stage of disease. Thus, we discuss in this article BNP as a potent biomarker. Subsequently, we will review the progress of biosensing devices as they could be applied to monitor BNP levels as assays, benchtop biosensors and implantable biosensors. The analytical characteristics of commercially available BNP assays are presented. Still emerging as a field, we define four obstacles that present opportunity for the future development of implantable biosensor: foreign body response, sensor renewability, sensitivity and selectivity." .

We successfully treated a case of G-CSF-producing ESCC in a 92-year-old woman. Case presentationA 92-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of choking while swallowing and dysphagia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a type 2 esophageal cancer located 26–35 cm from the dental arch, with no distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed with G-CSF-producing ESCC based on remarkable leukocytosis and high G-CSF levels. The patient underwent radical subtotal esophagectomy. Subsequently, the level of neutrophils (from 23,500/μL to 5000/μL) and the level of G-CSF (from 131 to <19.5 pg/mL) decreased significantly. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the resected tissue specimen showed positive staining for G-CSF in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Although the patient developed aspiration pneumonitis, after antibiotic treatment, she promptly recovered and was discharged. ConclusionsHerein, we describe a case of successfully treated G-CSF-producing ESCC in a 92-year-old woman. Precise detection and safely performed immediate radical operation are considered essential to achieve a good clinical course." .

The purpose of this study was to report the pattern of acupuncture use and associated factors in patients with stroke. MethodsWe used claims data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database and identified 285001 new-onset stroke patients in 2000–2008 from 23 million people allover Taiwan. The use of acupuncture treatment after stroke within one year was identified. We compared sociodemographics, coexisting medical conditions, and stroke characteristics between stroke patients who did and did not receive acupuncture treatment. ResultsThe use of acupuncture in stroke patients increased from 2000 to 2008. Female gender, younger age, white-collar employee status, higher income, and residence in areas with more traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians were factors associated with acupuncture use in stroke patients. Ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.28), having no renal dialysis (OR 2.76, 95 % CI 2.45–3.13), receiving rehabilitation (OR 3.20, 95 % CI 3.13–3.27) and longer hospitalization (OR 1.23, 95 % CI 1.19–1.27) were also associated with acupuncture use. Stroke patients using rehabilitation services were more likely to have more acupuncture visits and a higher expenditure on acupuncture compared with stroke patients who did not receive rehabilitation services. ConclusionsThe application of acupuncture in stroke patients is well accepted and increasing in Taiwan. The use of acupuncture in stroke patients is associated with sociodemographic factors and clinical characteristics." .

These magnetic fields are most commonly detected using cryogenically-cooled superconducting magnetometers. Here we present the first detection of action potentials from an animal nerve using an optical atomic magnetometer. Using an optimal design we are able to achieve the sensitivity dominated by the quantum shot noise of light and quantum projection noise of atomic spins. Such sensitivity allows us to measure the nerve impulse with a miniature room-temperature sensor which is a critical advantage for biomedical applications. Positioning the sensor at a distance of a few millimeters from the nerve, corresponding to the distance between the skin and nerves in biological studies, we detect the magnetic field generated by an action potential of a frog sciatic nerve. From the magnetic field measurements we determine the activity of the nerve and the temporal shape of the nerve impulse. This work opens new ways towards implementing optical magnetometers as practical devices for medical diagnostics." .

Furthermore, perinatal outcome of seven deliveries (nine children) from Denmark is reported. MethodsPubMed was searched for papers of deliveries resulting from ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC). Seven women underwent OTC prior to chemotherapy. Four of these women still had low ovarian function and had tried to conceive. They therefore had tissue autotransplanted to augment their fertility. The other three women had developed premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) after the end of treatment. ResultsWorldwide, approximately 95 children have been born or will be born in the near future from OTC, including these 9 new children. Information on the perinatal outcome was found on 40 children. The mean gestational age was 39 weeks and the mean birth weight was 3168 g of the singleton pregnancies, which is within internationally recognized normal standards. Furthermore, half the singletons resulted from natural conception and all twins resulted from in vitro fertilization treatment. All seven Danish women became pregnant within 1–3 years after transplantation. They gave birth to nine healthy children. ConclusionThe data is reassuring and further suggests that cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is becoming an established fertility preservation method. The seven Danish women reported in this study were all in their early thirties when OTC was performed. Most other reported cases were in the women’s twenties. This suggests that the follicular pool in the thirties is large enough and sufficient to sustain fertility." .

It is essential to unravel its etiology and pathogenesis. This should enable us to study the presymptomatic stages of the disease and to analyze and reverse the antemortem behavioral, memory, and cognitive dysfunction. Prima facie, an ongoing chronic vulnerability involving neural insult may lead normal elderly to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and then to AD. Development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to thwart the disease pathology obviously requires a thorough delineation of underlying disruptive neuropathological processes. Our sensory capacity for touch, smell, taste, hearing, and vision declines with advancing age. Declines in different sensory attributes are considered here to be the primary “first-tier pathologies.” Olfactory loss is among the first clinical signs of neurodegenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sensory dysfunction in the aged promotes pathological disturbances in the locus coeruleus, basal forebrain, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and several key areas of neocortex and brainstem. Hence, sensory dysfunction is the pivotal factor that may upregulate cognitive and memory dysfunction. The age-related constellation of comorbid pathological factors may include apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, head trauma, and obstructive sleep apnea. The concepts and trajectories delineated here are the dynamic pillars of the current hypothesis presented—it postulates that the sensory decline, in conjunction with the above pathologies, is crucial in triggering neurodegeneration and promoting cognitive/memory dysfunction in aging and AD. The application of this thesis can be important in formulating new multifactorial preventive and treatment strategies (suggested here) in order to attenuate cognitive and memory decline and ameliorate pathological dysfunction in aging, MCI, and AD." .

Inadequate vitamin D action increases the risk for various musculoskeletal/mineral events including fracture, fall, secondary hyperparathyroidism, diminished response to antiresorptives, rickets/osteomalacia, and hypocalcemia. Its most common cause in recent years is vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, clinically defined by a low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level. Guidelines for vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency defined by serum 25(OH)D concentrations have been published all over the world. In Japan, however, the information on the associations between serum 25(OH)D and bone and mineral disorders has not been widely shared among healthcare providers, partly because its measurement had not been reimbursed with national medical insurance policy until August 2016. We have set out to collect and analyze Japanese data on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and bone and mineral events. Integrating these domestic data and published guidelines worldwide, here, we present the following assessment criteria for vitamin D sufficiency/insufficiency/deficiency using serum 25(OH)D level in Japan. (1) Serum 25(OH)D level equal to or above 30 ng/ml is considered to be vitamin D sufficient. (2) Serum 25(OH)D level less than 30 ng/ml but not less than 20 ng/ml is considered to be vitamin D insufficient. (3) Serum 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/ml is considered to be vitamin D deficient. We believe that these criteria will be clinically helpful in the assessment of serum 25(OH)D concentrations and further expect that they will form a basis for the future development of guidelines for the management of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency." .

We investigated retinal hemodynamic changes in BRVO patients after IVB by performing laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). MethodsIn 35 BRVO patients with macular edema, the relative flow volume (RFV) of the retinal artery and vein passing through the optic disc was measured in both the occluded and non-occluded regions of the retina before IVB and 1 month after IVB by LSFG. The ischemic region of retina was measured with the Scion Image program and the severity of retinal ischemia was assessed by dividing the non-perfused area by the disc area. ResultsMacular edema improved significantly by 1 month after IVB. The venous RFV ratio showed a significant increase in the non-occluded region at 1 month after IVB. There was a significant negative correlation between the venous RFV ratio and the severity of retinal ischemia in the occluded region. On the other hand, arterial RFV ratio showed no significant change after IVB in either the occluded or non-occluded region. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the arterial RFV ratio and the severity of retinal ischemia in either the occluded or non-occluded region. ConclusionsThese results suggest that an increase of retinal venous outflow after IVB may possibly influence the resolution of macular edema and that the response of venous outflow after IVB depends on the severity of retinal ischemia in the occluded region." .

In this study we examined the efficacy of ethoxyquin in preventing neurotoxicity of cisplatin in rodent models of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and explored its mechanism of action. Ethoxyquin prevented neurotoxicity of cisplatin in vitro in a sensory neuronal cell line and primary rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In vivo, chronic co-administration of ethoxyquin partially abrogated cisplatin-induced behavioral, electrophysiological and morphological abnormalities. Furthermore, ethoxyquin did not interfere with cisplatin’s ability to induce tumor cell death in ovarian cancer cell line in vitro and in vivo. Finally, ethoxyquin reduced the levels of two client proteins (SF3B2 and ataxin-2) of a chaperone protein, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) when co-administered with cisplatin in vitro. These results implied that the neuroprotective effect of ethoxyquin is mediated through these two client proteins of Hsp90. In fact, reducing levels of SF3B2 in tissue-cultured neurons was effective against neurotoxicity of cisplatin. These findings suggest that ethoxyquin or other compounds that inhibit chaperone activity of Hsp90 and reduce levels of its client protein, SF3B2 may be developed as an adjuvant therapy to prevent neurotoxicity in cisplatin-based chemotherapy protocols." .

Therefore, the aim of this in vitro pilot study was to assess if the progression of erosive demineralization is faster on teeth already presenting signs of ETW when compared to originally sound teeth. MethodsWe selected 23 central incisors: 14 were clinically sound (Sound) and 9 presented clinical signs of early erosive tooth wear (ETW-teeth). The teeth were embedded in resin, leaving an uncovered window of native enamel (6.69 ± 2.30 mm2) on the incisal half of the labial surface. We measured enamel surface reflection intensity (SRI) initially and after each consecutive erosive challenge (1 % citric acid, total of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 min). Calcium released to the citric acid was measured with an atomic absorption spectrometer. ResultsWe observed higher initial SRI values in ETW-teeth than in Sound teeth (p = 0.007). During in vitro erosive demineralization, we observed that erosion on originally Sound teeth progressed significantly slower (p = 0.033) than on ETW-teeth: SRI decreased by 75 % (from 100 to 25 %) on Sound teeth, and by 89 % (from 100 to 11 %) on ETW-teeth. Calcium release increased during erosion, but presented no significant differences (p = 0.643) between originally Sound (0.031 μmol/mm2) and ETW-teeth (0.032 μmol/mm2). There was satisfactory correlation between calcium release and rSRI values (r s  = −0.66). ConclusionThe optical reflectometer distinguished originally sound teeth from those with signs of ETW, and the results suggest that acid demineralization progresses differently on teeth already presenting clinical signs of ETW than on sound teeth." .

Pursuing this hypothesis, we investigated the pattern of muscular activity in the shoulder and arm during a repetitive dynamic task performed until participants’ rating of perceived exertion reached 8 on Borg’s CR-10 scale. We collected high-density surface electromyogram (HD-EMG) over the upper trapezius, as well as bipolar EMG from biceps brachii, triceps brachii, deltoideus anterior, serratus anterior, upper and lower trapezius from 21 healthy women. Root-mean-square (RMS) and mean power frequency (MNF) were calculated for all EMG signals. The barycenter of RMS values over the HD-EMG grid was also determined, as well as normalized mutual information (NMI) for each pair of muscles. Cycle-to-cycle variability of these metrics was also assessed. With time, EMG RMS increased for most of the muscles, and MNF decreased. Trapezius activity became higher on the lateral side than on the medial side of the HD-EMG grid and the barycenter moved in a lateral direction. NMI between muscle pairs increased with time while its variability decreased. The variability of the metrics during the initial 10 % of task performance was not associated with the time to task termination. Our results suggest that the considerable variability in force and posture contained in the dynamic task per se masks any possible effects of differences between subjects in initial motor variability on the rate of fatigue development." .

These graduates were immediately deployed in public hospital settings, with the ultimate aim of providing clinical pharmacy services. As such an initiative is new to the Ethiopian pharmacy sector, there is a need to do assessment of the health care providers’ perception and satisfaction towards the service. MethodsA cross-sectional survey using self-administered questionnaire was conducted in six regions and one-city administration of the country. Physicians, Health officers and Nurses working along with the new pharmacy graduates formed the study population. A total of 650 healthcare professionals participated in the study. Data were entered, cleaned and analyzed using appropriate statistical tools. ResultsMajority of the health care providers agreed that clinical pharmacy service could have a significant contribution to the patient care. A large proportion of them (70–90 %) had a positive attitude, although there appeared to be some differences across professions. About 50 % of the professionals were of the opinion that patient care should be left to the health care providers and pharmacists should concentrate on drug products. In addition, the same proportion of respondents said that the setup in their respective hospital was appropriate for provision of clinical pharmacy service. Multivariable analysis indicated that attitude of the health care providers was significantly associated with year of experience.

ConclusionIn this study, less than one third of the study participants reported medication administration errors. Educational status, disagreement over time - error definition, administrative reason and fear were factors statistically significant for the refusal of errors reporting at p-value <0.05. Therefore, the results of this study suggest strategies that enhance the cultures of error reporting such as providing a clear definition of reportable errors and strengthen the educational status of nurses by the health care organization." .

Persons with schizophrenia (PWS) have excess mortality (their life expectancy is reduced by 20 %) and excess morbidity. In addition, such persons may have a large number of missing or decayed teeth. Dental caries and periodontal measurement indexes are often twice as high as the level found in the general population. Poor oral health can also affect quality of life and oral health is inseparable from general health. The management of oral health problems needs a multidisciplinary approach. According to the World Health Organization, the aim of therapeutic education (TE) is to help patients take care of themselves and to improve empowerment and recovery. In this educational approach, it is important to take into account the patient’s personal experience. Though rarely investigated, the personal experience of PWS in oral health quality of life (OHRQoL) must be used to build a therapeutic educational programme in oral health (TEPOH) in a multidisciplinary approach, and the effectiveness of this program must be evaluated. Methods/designWe report the protocol of a randomized controlled cluster study. This study will be conducted in twelve hospitals in France. We hypothesized that a decrease of 20 % in the proportion of patients with CPI ≥ 3 would establish the effectiveness of TEPOH. Therefore, 12 hospitals will be randomly allocated to either TEPOH or no TEPOH. Altogether, they will have to recruit 230 PWS, who will be randomly allocated with a ratio of 1:1 to one of two conditions: control without intervention versus the group benefitting from TEPOH. DiscussionIf successful, the study will generate methodologically sound results that provide knowledge on the effectiveness of a TEP in oral health for PWS. The results can be used to promote OHRQoL in a global health approach and develop appropriate strategies to encourage and facilitate financial support for healthcare, the multidisciplinary treatment of dental disorders, and the development of training in oral and mental health for caregivers.

Institutions have different surgical approaches for the treatment of BOTs. Here, we performed a retrospective review of clinical characteristics, surgical management and surgical outcomes, and sought to identify variables affecting disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with BOTs. MethodsA retrospective review of ten gynecological oncology department databases in Turkey was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with BOTs. The effects of type of surgery, age, stage, surgical staging, complete versus incomplete staging, and adjuvant chemotherapy were examined on DFS and OS. ResultsIn total, 733 patients with BOTs were included in the analysis. Most of the staged cases were in stage IA (70.4 %). In total, 345 patients underwent conservative surgeries. Recurrence rates were similar between the conservative and radical surgery groups (10.5 % vs. 8.7 %). Furthermore we did not find any difference between DFS (HR = 0.96; 95 % confidence interval, CI = 0.7–1.2; p = 0.576) or OS (HR = 0.9; 95 % CI = 0.8–1.1; p = 0.328) between patients who underwent conservative versus radical surgeries. There was also no difference in DFS (HR = 0.74; 95 % CI = 0.8–1.1; p = 0.080) or OS (HR = 0.8; 95 % CI = 0.7–1.0; p = 0.091) between complete, incomplete, and unstaged patients. Furthermore, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) for tumor stage ≥ IC was not an independent prognostic factor for DFS or OS. ConclusionsPatients undergoing conservative surgery did not show higher recurrence rates; furthermore, survival time was not shortened. Detailed surgical staging, including lymph node sampling or dissection, appendectomy, and hysterectomy, were not beneficial in the surgical management oF BOTs." .

Here we show that deregulation of the homeobox transcription factor gene DUX4 and the ETS transcription factor gene ERG is a hallmark of a subtype of B-progenitor ALL that comprises up to 7% of B-ALL. DUX4 rearrangement and overexpression was present in all cases and was accompanied by transcriptional deregulation of ERG, expression of a novel ERG isoform, ERGalt, and frequent ERG deletion. ERGalt uses a non-canonical first exon whose transcription was initiated by DUX4 binding. ERGalt retains the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of ERG, but it inhibits wild-type ERG transcriptional activity and is transforming. These results illustrate a unique paradigm of transcription factor deregulation in leukemia in which DUX4 deregulation results in loss of function of ERG, either by deletion or induced expression of an isoform that is a dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type ERG function." .

However, protease inhibitor-based combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with increased rates of preterm, low birth weight, and small for gestational age births. Our previous experimental findings demonstrate that protease inhibitor use during pregnancy is associated with decreased progesterone levels that correlate with fetal growth, and that progesterone supplementation can improve protease inhibitor-induced fetal growth restriction. We hypothesize that HIV-positive pregnant women who receive protease inhibitor-based combination therapy may also benefit from progesterone supplementation during pregnancy. Methods/designIn order to test this hypothesis, we have designed an open-label, multi-centre, randomized controlled (parallel group) pilot trial. The initial goal of this trial is to test feasibility and acceptability of our intervention. Forty HIV-positive pregnant women who are either on, or intending to start or switch to a boosted protease inhibitor-based combination antiretroviral regimen will be enrolled from six sites across Ontario, Canada. Twenty-five women will be randomized to self-administer natural progesterone (Prometrium, 200 mg) vaginally every night starting between gestational week 16 and 24 until week 36, and 15 women will be randomized to no intervention. While the participants and treating physicians will not be blinded, the laboratory personnel performing the biochemical and morphological evaluations will be blinded to ensure unbiased evaluation. The primary outcome of the pilot study is the feasibility of enrolment as measured by the recruitment rate and patient-reported reasons to decline participation. Secondary outcomes in participants include safety, acceptability, and adherence to progesterone supplementation. DiscussionGiven the safety of intravaginal progesterone and its current use in the general obstetrical population to prevent recurrent preterm delivery, this pilot study will provide data to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of this intervention on improving neonatal health in the context of HIV-positive pregnancies.

The marine gastropod Rapana venosa is ideal for investigating how population density influences the frequency of polyandry and elucidating patterns of sperm usage. Two different population density (12 ind/m3 and 36 ind/m3) treatments with two replications were set to observe reproductive behaviors. Five microsatellite markers were used to identify the frequency of multiple paternity and determine paternal contributions to progeny arrays in 120 egg masses. All of the mean mating frequency, mean number of sires and mean egg-laying frequency were higher at high population density treatment relative to low population density treatment, indicating population density is an important factor affecting polyandry. The last sperm donors achieved high proportions of paternity in 74.77% of egg masses, which supported the “last male sperm precedence” hypothesis. In addition, high variance in reproductive success among R. venosa males were detected, which might have an important influence on effective population size." .

Despite its frequent use, we know little about the safety of this herbal medicine during pregnancy. The primary aim of this study was to study the consequences of the use of echinacea on malformations and common adverse pregnancy outcomes. Secondly, we aimed to characterize women using this herb in pregnancy. MethodThis study is based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and included 68,522 women and their children. Information was retrieved from three self-administered questionnaires completed by the women in pregnancy weeks 17 and 30 and 6 months after birth. Information on pregnancy outcomes was retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Generalized estimating equations analyses were performed to assess the association between exposure to echinacea and pregnancy outcomes. Pearson’s chi-square test was used to assess factors related to use of echinacea in pregnancy. ResultsAmong 68,522 women, 363 (0.5 %) reported the use of echinacea during pregnancy. These women were characterized by high age and delivery before 2002 and were to a less extent smoking in pregnancy. The use of echinacea was not associated with an increased risk of malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes. ConclusionThis study revealed no increased risk of malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes after the use of echinacea in pregnancy. Studies on the safety of commonly used herbal medications are important to identify herbals that should be avoided in pregnancy." .

However, the mechanistic contribution of the APOL1 allelic state to kidney injury in HIV-1 infection remains to be elucidated. ResultsNon-risk WT APOL1 is associated with lower intracellular levels of HIV-1 in conditionally immortalized human podocytes, while the over expression of G1 or G2 risk Vs significantly increases viral accumulation. The priming of podocytes with exogenous IL-1β facilitates HIV-1 entry, via the up-regulation of DC-SIGN. The over expression of APOL1 G1 and G2 risk Vs in combination with an increase in IL-1β levels causes a greater increase in viral concentration than either condition alone. In turn, HIV-1 and exogenous IL-1β together induce a de novo secretion of endogenous IL-1β and an increase of APOL1 gene expression. ConclusionsOur findings indicate that the presence of risk Vs of APOL1 is permissive of HIV-1 persistence in human podocytes in synergy with IL-1β, a cytokine that characterizes the inflammatory milieu of acute and chronic phases of HIV-1 infection. The elucidation of these molecular mechanisms explains, at least in part, the higher frequency of HIVAN in populations carrying the risk polymorphic genetic variant of APOL1 gene." .

Work in the mouse demonstrated transmission of commensal bacteria from mother to fetus during gestation, though it is unclear what modulates this process. We have previously shown in the nonhuman primate that, independent of obesity, a maternal high-fat diet during gestation and lactation persistently shapes the juvenile gut microbiome. We therefore sought to interrogate in a population-based human longitudinal cohort whether a maternal high-fat diet similarly alters the neonatal and infant gut microbiome in early life. MethodsA representative cohort was prospectively enrolled either in the early third trimester or intrapartum (n = 163), with a subset consented to longitudinal sampling through the postpartum interval (n = 81). Multiple body site samples, including stool and meconium, were collected from neonates at delivery and by 6 weeks of age. A rapid dietary questionnaire was administered to estimate intake of fat, added sugars, and fiber over the past month (National Health and Examination Survey). DNA was extracted from each infant meconium/stool sample (MoBio) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis. ResultsOn average, the maternal dietary intake of fat ranged from 14.0 to 55.2 %, with an average intake of 33.1 % (σ = 6.1 %). Mothers whose diets significantly differed from the mean (±1 standard deviation) were separated into two distinct groups, a control group (n = 13, μ = 24.4 %) and a high-fat group (n = 13, μ = 43.1 %). Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the microbiome of the neonatal stool at birth (meconium) clustered differently by virtue of maternal gestational diet (PERMANOVA p = 0.001). LEfSe feature selection identified several taxa that discriminated the groups, with a notable relative depletion of Bacteroides in the neonates exposed to a maternal high-fat gestational diet (Student’s t-test, p < 0.05) that persisted to 6 weeks of age. ConclusionsSimilar to the primate, independent of maternal body mass index, a maternal high-fat diet is associated with distinct changes in the neonatal gut microbiome at birth which persist through 4–6 weeks of age. Our findings underscore the importance of counseling pregnant mothers on macronutrient consumption during pregnancy and lactation." .

Presently, treatment options are mainly limited to surgical tumor resection due to the lack of effective pharmacological drugs. Although the mechanistic understanding of Nf2 gene function has advanced, it has so far been primarily restricted to Schwann cell-intrinsic events. Extracellular cues determining Schwann cell behavior with regard to schwannoma development remain unknown. Here we show pro-tumourigenic microenvironmental effects on Schwann cells where an altered axonal microenvironment in cooperation with injury signals contribute to a persistent regenerative Schwann cell response promoting schwannoma development. Specifically in genetically engineered mice following crush injuries on sciatic nerves, we found macroscopic nerve swellings in mice with homozygous nf2 gene deletion in Schwann cells and in animals with heterozygous nf2 knockout in both Schwann cells and axons. However, patient-mimicking schwannomas could only be provoked in animals with combined heterozygous nf2 knockout in Schwann cells and axons. We identified a severe re-myelination defect and sustained macrophage presence in the tumor tissue as major abnormalities. Strikingly, treatment of tumor-developing mice after nerve crush injury with medium-dose aspirin significantly decreased schwannoma progression in this disease model. Our results suggest a multifactorial concept for schwannoma formation—emphasizing axonal factors and mechanical nerve irritation as predilection site for schwannoma development. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the potential efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of schwannomas." .

The aim of the present study was to examine the possible effects of RSV on blood glucose level, serum copper and zinc levels, SOD, and a number of other oxidative markers in type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats with administration of streptozotocin and nicotine amide. The studied groups containing six animals per group were as follows: group 1 normal control group; group 2 diabetic control group; groups 3, 4, and 5 diabetic rats that received 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg body weight of RSV, respectively for 30 days. Serum glucose, copper, zinc, SOD activity, total oxidant status (TOS) as well as thiol groups were all measured. Blood glucose in RSV treated groups significantly decreased. Similarly, copper significantly decreased in diabetic groups treated with RSV. Treatment with 10 mg/kg RSV resulted in significantly increased serum zinc. Furthermore, Cu/Zn ratio was observed to decrease in treated groups compared with untreated diabetic control group. RSV treated groups revealed an increased level of SOD activity as well as improved oxidative status. In summary, the results showed that RSV has potential hypoglycemic effect, attenuates trace element homeostasis, and consequently increases SOD activity level." .

Since the first ESA crewmember completed an LDM in 2006, the ESA countermeasure program has strived to provide efficient protection against decreases in body mass, muscle strength, bone mass, and aerobic capacity within the operational constraints of the ISS environment and the changing availability of on-board exercise devices. The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of ESA’s individualised approach to in-flight exercise countermeasures and an up-to-date picture of how exercise is used to counteract physiological changes resulting from µG-induced adaptation. Changes in the absolute workload for resistive exercise, treadmill running and cycle ergometry throughout ESA’s eight LDMs are also presented, and aspects of pre-flight physical preparation and post-flight reconditioning outlined. ResultsWith the introduction of the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) in 2009, the relative contribution of resistance exercise to total in-flight exercise increased (33–46 %), whilst treadmill running (42–33 %) and cycle ergometry (26–20 %) decreased. All eight ESA crewmembers increased their in-flight absolute workload during their LDMs for resistance exercise and treadmill running (running speed and vertical loading through the harness), while cycle ergometer workload was unchanged across missions. ConclusionIncreased or unchanged absolute exercise workloads in-flight would appear contradictory to typical post-flight reductions in muscle mass and strength, and cardiovascular capacity following LDMs. However, increased absolute in-flight workloads are not directly linked to changes in exercise capacity as they likely also reflect the planned, conservative loading early in the mission to allow adaption to µG exercise, including personal comfort issues with novel exercise hardware (e.g. the treadmill harness). Inconsistency in hardware and individualised support concepts across time limit the comparability of results from different crewmembers, and questions regarding the difference between cycling and running in µG versus identical exercise here on Earth, and other factors that might influence in-flight exercise performance, still require further investigation." .
