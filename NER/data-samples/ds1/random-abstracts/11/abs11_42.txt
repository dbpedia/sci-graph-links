Abstract BackgroundA plaster dental model is a patientâ€™s traditional three-dimensional (3D) record. If the dental crowns from a plaster model are separated and positioned in wax, this setup of the crowns can be used to simulate orthodontic treatment. The traditional way to make this dental setup requires significant time by the orthodontist and in the orthodontic lab. New developments in dentistry and orthodontics include the possibility of virtual setups. AimIn this article, the differences between conventional setups with plaster models and virtual setups are discussed. MethodsA clinical patient is described for whom two different setups were made and compared by model superimposition with Geomagic Qualify software. ResultsAccording to the literature and the results from this study, virtual setups and conventional setups with plaster models are equally accurate. ConclusionVirtual setups present several advantages, e.g., digital storage, digital models cannot be damaged, the same model can undergo several treatment simulations, and communication between dental and surgical professionals and between dental professionals and patients is facilitated. Despite these advantages, considerable time and training are needed for dental professionals to master and adopt the general use of digital models and virtual setups in dentistry.
