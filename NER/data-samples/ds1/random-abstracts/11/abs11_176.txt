Abstract Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) are novel biomarkers of oxidative damage to proteins and a novel class of inflammatory mediators. AOPPs can promote oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation and thus participate in many pathophysiological disease processes. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of blood vessels that is characterized by low-density lipoprotein infiltration into the endothelial intima and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Inflammation and OS are established risk factors for the formation of atherosclerosis. Accumulated studies show that AOPPs can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis through OS and inflammation. Additionally, AOPPs can accelerate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques by inhibiting high-density lipoprotein receptor scavenger receptor class B type I-mediated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol reverse transport, leading to metabolic disturbances. Some studies have suggested that plasma AOPPs levels are independently positively correlated with blood pressure and are also independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. AOPPs can trigger oxidative bursts of neutrophils, monocytes and phagocytic cells, increase the generation of reactive oxygen species and promote the secretion of cytokines to accelerate endothelial cell injury. Detecting the levels and inhibiting the formation of AOPPs may provide a novel approach to monitor the progress and improve the prognosis of atherosclerosis.
