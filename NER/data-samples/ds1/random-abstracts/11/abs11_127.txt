Abstract Classical bioisosteric substitution is the replacement of a carbon atom by a silicon atom (sila-substitution, carbon/silicon switch). The review is focused on the effects of bioisosteric carbon/silicon switch on the activity of the known pharmaceuticals. In the majority of cases, silicon derivatives show enhanced biological activities and improved pharmacological profiles as compared with the parent carbon drug scaffolds.
