Abstract Different reports of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PcP) outbreaks on oncology and transplant units suggest the possibility of a person-to-person transmission. Based on these reports, we searched retrospectively for possible PcP clusters in UZ Leuven in 2013. A movement and transmission map was established for all patients (n = 21) with a positive PcP PCR on BAL fluid. BAL fluid samples from all patients with a positive PCR on the mitochondrial large subunit mRNA of P. jirovecii and possible cross exposure were typed with multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Five patients with a positive PcP PCR could have contact with another PcP patient. Another five patients with a weak positive PcP PCR on BAL fluid during the same period were also included. Based on the MLST typing of the BAL samples of these ten patients, there was no evidence of a PcP outbreak in UZ Leuven in 2013. MLST has proven to be a useful tool in genotyping and outbreak detection. From this case series, it could be concluded that current infection control precautions for P. jirovecii are appropriate in UZ Leuven. However, there is need for an international Pneumocystis database and more clarity in the geographic distribution of different P. jirovecii genotypes.
