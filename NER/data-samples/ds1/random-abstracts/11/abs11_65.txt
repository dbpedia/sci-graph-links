Abstract This paper describes the design of a low cost wearable hand exercise device that can assist repetitive wrist and finger exercise for stroke patients. The design of this device was guided by neurobiological principles of motor learning, such as sensory-motor integration, movement repetition, and cognitive interaction. This pilot study tested the efficacy of a wireless sensing system in the device to serve as a facilitator of repetitive hand exercise, which is an essential part of rehabilitation after stroke. The results from healthy young adults showed that the device with a wireless sensing system yielded quantitatively better motor function with the repetitive wrist and finger joint movements.This proof-of-concept study shows potential therapeutic evidence for stroke rehabilitation as well as the potential utility of sensing system for stroke rehabilitation.
