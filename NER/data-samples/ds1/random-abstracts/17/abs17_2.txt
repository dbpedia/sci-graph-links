Abstract Let {x m } be a vector sequence that satisfies xm∼s+∑i=1∞αigi(m)asm→∞, $$\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\sim \boldsymbol{s}+\sum\limits^{\infty}_{i=1}\alpha_{i} \boldsymbol{g}_{i}(m)\quad\text{as \(m\to\infty\)}, $$ s being the limit or antilimit of {x m } and {gi(m)}i=1∞ $\{\boldsymbol {g}_{i}(m)\}^{\infty }_{i=1}$ being an asymptotic scale as m → ∞, in the sense that limm→∞∥gi+1(m)∥∥gi(m)∥=0,i=1,2,…. $$\lim\limits_{m\to\infty}\frac{\|\boldsymbol{g}_{i+1}(m)\|}{\|\boldsymbol{g}_{i}(m)\|}=0,\quad i=1,2,\ldots. $$ The vector sequences {gi(m)}m=0∞ $\{\boldsymbol {g}_{i}(m)\}^{\infty }_{m=0}$, i = 1, 2,…, are known, as well as {x m }. In this work, we analyze the convergence and convergence acceleration properties of a vectorized version of the generalized Richardson extrapolation process that is defined via the equations ∑i=1k〈y,Δgi(m)〉α~i=〈y,Δxm〉,n≤m≤n+k−1;sn,k=xn+∑i=1kα~igi(n), $$\sum\limits^{k}_{i=1}\langle\boldsymbol{y},{\Delta}\boldsymbol{g}_{i}(m)\rangle\widetilde{\alpha}_{i}=\langle\boldsymbol{y},{\Delta}\boldsymbol{x}_{m}\rangle,\quad n\leq m\leq n+k-1;\quad \boldsymbol{s}_{n,k}=\boldsymbol{x}_{n}+\sum\limits^{k}_{i=1}\widetilde{\alpha}_{i}\boldsymbol{g}_{i}(n), $$ s n, k being the approximation to s. Here, y is some nonzero vector, 〈⋅ ,⋅〉 is an inner product, such that 〈αa,βb〉=α¯β〈a,b〉 $\langle \alpha \boldsymbol {a},\beta \boldsymbol {b}\rangle =\overline {\alpha }\beta \langle \boldsymbol {a},\boldsymbol {b}\rangle $, and Δx m = x m + 1− x m and Δg i (m) = g i (m + 1)−g i (m). By imposing a minimal number of reasonable additional conditions on the g i (m), we show that the error s n, k − s has a full asymptotic expansion as n→∞. We also show that actual convergence acceleration takes place, and we provide a complete classification of it.
