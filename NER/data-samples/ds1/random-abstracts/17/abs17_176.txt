Abstract Let Ω be a bounded domain in ℝ n with smooth boundary. Here we consider the following Jacobian-determinant equation $$\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\det \nabla u\left( x \right) = f\left( x \right),}&{x \in \Omega ;} \\ {u\left( x \right) = x,}&{x \in \partial \Omega ,} \end{array}} \right.$$ {det∇u(x)=f(x),x∈Ω;u(x)=x,x∈∂Ω, where f is a function on Ω with minΩ f = δ > 0 and ∫Ω f(x)dx = |Ω|. We prove that if $$f \in B_{p1}^{\frac{n}{p}}\left( \Omega \right)$$ f∈Bp1np(Ω) for some p ∈ (n,∞), then there exists a solution $$u \in B_{p1}^{\frac{n}{p} + 1}\left( \Omega \right) \subset {C^1}\left( \Omega \right)$$ u∈Bp1np+1(Ω)⊂C1(Ω) to this equation. On the other hand, we give a simple example such that u ∈ C 0 1(ℝ2,ℝ2) while det∇u does not lie in $$B_{p1}^{\frac{2}{p}}\left( {{\mathbb{R}^{}}} \right)$$ Bp12p(ℝ) for any p < ∞.
