Abstract A finite family $$\mathcal {B}$$ B of balls with respect to an arbitrary norm in $$\mathbb R^d$$ Rd ($$d\ge 2$$ d≥2 ) is called a non-separable family if there is no hyperplane disjoint from $$\bigcup \mathcal {B}$$ ⋃B that strictly separates some elements of $$\mathcal {B}$$ B from all the other elements of $$\mathcal {B}$$ B in $$\mathbb R^d$$ Rd . In this paper we prove that if $$\mathcal {B}$$ B is a non-separable family of balls of radii $$r_1, r_2,\ldots , r_n$$ r1,r2,…,rn ($$n\ge 2$$ n≥2 ) with respect to an arbitrary norm in $$\mathbb R^d$$ Rd ($$d\ge 2$$ d≥2 ), then $$\bigcup \mathcal {B}$$ ⋃B can be covered by a ball of radius $$\sum _{i=1}^n r_i$$ ∑i=1nri . This was conjectured by Erdős for the Euclidean norm and was proved for that case by Goodman and Goodman (Am Math Mon 52:494–498, 1945). On the other hand, in the same paper Goodman and Goodman conjectured that their theorem extends to arbitrary non-separable finite families of positive homothetic convex bodies in $$\mathbb R^d$$ Rd , $$d\ge 2$$ d≥2 . Besides giving a counterexample to their conjecture, we prove that conjecture under various additional conditions.
