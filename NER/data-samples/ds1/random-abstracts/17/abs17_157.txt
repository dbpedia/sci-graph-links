Abstract We present the first case report describing a craniotomy for a glioblastoma in a patient with hemihydranencephaly (HHE). Ten years ago our patient had average cognitive and language functions, indicating very good adaption of his single right hemisphere. Due to the tumour he developed a deceleration, deficits in language functions and mild impairments of basic cognitive functions. Further neuroplastic reorganisations of his right hemisphere in response to the tumour growth are discussed. The favourable postoperative outcome supported the decision for careful tumour resection in this patient with HHE.
