Abstract Humanâ€“robot interaction in natural (or human) language is simulated as intelligent management of English conversation between a humanoid robot and several kinds of people on imagination. The robot is destined to help a disabled old man by comprehending his intention through dialogue and its final response to his intention is animated graphically. When the robot finds any problem in a situation in helping him, it tries to solve such a problem by employing its knowledge and the information acquired by inquiry to the people. This is an application of integrative multimedia understanding based on intermediate knowledge representation in mental-image description language (L md), the formal language proposed in mental image directed semantic theory.
