This paper aims to explore the influence of informal governance mechanisms (IGMs) on knowledge integration (KI) within cross‐functional project teams (CFPTs). In order to achieve this objective, we provide a novel and distinct perspective – social capital (SC). From this perspective, we analyse three dimensions of IGMs, that is, social interaction, social trust and social cognition. Propositions on underlying influencing mechanisms of the three dimensions on KI are then empirically tested using qualitative data from semi‐structured interviews and quantitative data from questionnaire surveys. Results indicate that strong social ties, mutual trust and formation of shared vision facilitate KI within CFPTs. In addition, communication platforms are encouraged to provide more opportunities for team members to exchange knowledge. This paper provides suggestions for both knowledge governance theory and project management practice.
