Abstract A words phonetic decoding method in automatic speech recognition is considered. The properties of Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence are used to synthesize the estimation of the distribution of divergence between minimum speech units (e.g., single phonemes) inside a single class. It is demonstrated that the minimum variance of the intraphonemic divergence is reached when the phonetic database is tuned to the voice of a single speaker. The estimations are proven by experimental results on the recognition of vowel sounds and isolated words of Russian language.
