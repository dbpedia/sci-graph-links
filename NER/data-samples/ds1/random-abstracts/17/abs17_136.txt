Abstract Cognitive concept learning is to learn concepts from a given clue by simulating human thought processes including perception, attention and thinking. In recent years, it has attracted much attention from the communities of formal concept analysis, cognitive computing and granular computing. However, the classical cognitive concept learning approaches are not suitable for incomplete information. Motivated by this problem, this study mainly focuses on cognitive concept learning from incomplete information. Specifically, we put forward a pair of approximate cognitive operators to derive concepts from incomplete information. Then, we propose an approximate cognitive computing system to perform the transformation between granular concepts as incomplete information is updated periodically. Moreover, cognitive processes are simulated based on three types of similarities. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed cognitive concept learning methods.
