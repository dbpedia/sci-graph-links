Abstract The current study applies the hIa metric of Harzing et al. (Scientometrics 99(3):811–821 2014) to examine average faculty research performance across 5 Colleges in a single university. Average faculty performance for a range of common metrics of research publication such as papers, citations and h-index are presented to allow for a comparison of the degree to which the hIa can account for differences in publication patterns and career lengths in the current sample of faculty (N = 474). Scopus publication data for all faculty members across 5 Colleges was collected and analyzed to evaluate the assertion that the hIa provides a more reliable metric for comparison between academics of different career lengths, and academics researching in different disciplines. Comparison of current results with the results from the original work of Harzing et al. (Scientometrics 99(3):811–821 2014) offer strong support for the usefulness of the hIa in qualitatively and quantitatively different academic environments. Results are discussed in relation to the potential value and appropriate use of the hIa metric.
