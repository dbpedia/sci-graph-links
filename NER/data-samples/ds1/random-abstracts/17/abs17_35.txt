Summary The spectral representations for tensor fields are derived along the lines developed in the preceding paper for irreducible fields. The consequences of the supplementary conditions as well as the restrictions imposed byCP- andP-invariance are investigated. The propagators are given again in the form of (unconditional) projection operators multiplied by some (analytic) functions.
