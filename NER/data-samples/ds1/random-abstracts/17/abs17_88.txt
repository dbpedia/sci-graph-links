Background:Less is known about the effect of screen time and sleep at a younger age on current sleep outcome in infants. Therefore, we examined whether sleep parameter at a younger age and daily exposure of electronic media could predict sleep outcomes in 12-mo-old Thai infants.Methods:There were 208 typically developing infants enrolled since 6 mo old. Each main caregiver completed a sleep questionnaire and was interviewed for the infantâ€™s screen exposure at 6 and 12 mo of age. Nighttime sleep latency and sleep duration were calculated. Electronic media and sleep outcomes were analyzed using multiple linear regressions and path analysis.Results:Longer sleep latency at age 12 mo was predicted by longer daily duration of media exposure and longer 6-mo-old sleep latency. Infants who were exposed to electronic media above the median at both ages had longer 12-mo-old nighttime sleep latency compared with those who were exposed to the screen below the median at both ages.Conclusion:Six-month-old nighttime sleep latency and 12-mo-old electronic media exposure could predict 12-mo-old nighttime sleep latency. Relative changes in media exposure over time can provide a better prediction of nighttime sleep latency in Thai infants than screen exposure at either time point.
