Abstract Let $${\Delta }$$ Δ be an affine building of type $$\widetilde{A}_2$$ A~2 and $${\Omega }$$ Ω its maximal boundary. We prove that, for every function $$f \in L^1({\Omega }),$$ f∈L1(Ω), restricted convergence of the normalized generalized Poisson transform $${\mathcal {P}}_{{\chi }} f / {\mathcal {P}}_{{\chi }} 1$$ Pχf/Pχ1 to f holds almost everywhere.
