Abstract The architecture of the pre-modern Islamic world broadly identifies itself with geometric design. In erecting buildings, architects-engineers of the Islamic world utilized distinct modes of geometric projections vital to the spatial conception of the building. These representations identify three modes of design drawings: plans, revetments/vertical surfaces, and reflected ceiling plans. This paper will discuss these modes of drawings and their unique role in relation to the architectural “design thinking” traditions. Much has been examined regarding two-dimensional Islamic geometric patterns (girih), but little exists in terms of a comprehensive framework investigating various modes of geometric drawings in relation to formal, spatial, and tectonic conceptions of the architectural space. This paper fills a critical gap in the literature about Islamic architecture and examines this topic through primary resources and original pamphlets.
