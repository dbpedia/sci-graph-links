Abstract While moving entire buildings was a common occurrence in the historic past, little detailed information about this activity exists in the documentary records before the 20th century. Archaeological evidence of moved buildings is also virtually nonexistent in the literature. This study describes methods that were used to move buildings in the 18th through the early-20th centuries and the features and artifact patterns that should result from this activity. Excavation of three Historical period sites of buildings moved in the 19th century in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area has revealed features and produced artifact frequencies corresponding to these expected patterns. This suggests that historical archaeological evidence of moved buildings is more common than we realize and must be considered in any architectural studies.
