Abstract This paper considers a Schelling model in an arbitrary fixed network where there are no vacant houses. Agents have preferences either for segregation or for mixed neighborhoods. Utility is non-transferable. Two agents exchange houses when the trade is mutually beneficial. We find that an allocation is stable when for two agents of opposite-color each black (white) agent has a higher proportion of neighbors who are black (white). This result holds irrespective of agentsâ€™ preferences. When all members of both groups prefer mixed neighborhoods, an allocation is also stable provided that if an agent belongs to the minority (majority), then any neighbor of opposite-color is in a smaller minority (larger majority).
