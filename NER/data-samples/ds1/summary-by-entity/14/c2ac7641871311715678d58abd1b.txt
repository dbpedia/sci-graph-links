Abstract Does informative advertising increase price or does it decrease price? The answer to this empirical question is mixed and not conclusive, despite its significance for public policy and marketing. Using the tools of experimental economics, we seek answer to this empirical question in this paper. Our experiments constitute the first laboratory test of the effect of informative advertising in a horizontally differentiated market. Study 1 shows that informative advertising can lead to higher prices if consumer valuations are low. Study 2, on the other hand, points to the possibility that informative advertising can lead to lower prices if consumer valuations are high. Thus, these studies provide evidence on the causal relationship between price and advertising and more importantly clarify the conditions under which we may observe divergent results. Furthermore, our experimental analysis is the first to study competition involving multiple firms (n = 7) in a horizontally differentiated market using the spokes framework.
