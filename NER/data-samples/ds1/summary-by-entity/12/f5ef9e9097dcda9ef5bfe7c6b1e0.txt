Abstract The aim of this paper is to present a recursive construction of simple t-designs for arbitrary t. The construction is of purely combinatorial nature and it requires finding solutions for the indices of the ingredient designs that satisfy a certain set of equalities. We give a small number of examples to illustrate the construction, whereby we have found a large number of new t-designs, which were previously unknown. This indicates that the method is useful and powerful.
