Abstract Archaeologists involved in heritage studies and civic engagement movements are working to make a difference in the public lives of communities. They are helping to promote improved quality of life through both political and nonpolitical processes. Meaningful historical awareness coupled with varying kinds and degrees of empowerment can provide a new sense of community building. The articles in this volume provide a variety of approaches that address community, representation, and social-justice issues. They provide strategies for how archaeology can be more engaged in community-heritage building, in some cases providing a sense of place for those who have been forgotten in the dominant narratives.
