Abstract We investigate the relationship between verbal and hand proprioception of slant. In Experiment 1 we demonstrate that verbally estimating free hand orientation produces overestimates by a factor of 1.67. These values are similar to those seen for verbal overestimates of slanted surfaces. In Experiment 2, participants positioned their hand to a ramp at 1 of 4 different orientations, and then verbally estimated the orientation of either their hand or the ramp. We show that verbal estimates of the ramp are a product of the orientation of their hand and the perception of the orientation of their hand. We discuss how this work is consistent with the proprioception calibration hypothesis that proposes that similar biases exist in both verbal estimates of visually perceived slant and proprioceptively perceived hand orientation and how this may explain free hand estimates to outdoor hills that are greater than actual hill orientation by a factor of ~2, but are still less than verbal (over)estimates.
