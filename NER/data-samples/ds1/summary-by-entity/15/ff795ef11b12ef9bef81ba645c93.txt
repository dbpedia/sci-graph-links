Abstract Integrating the theoretical perspectives of resource orchestration and relational capital, this research examines how the managerial capability involved in resource bundling approaches (i.e., stabilizing, enriching, and pioneering) affect the speed of strategic change, and how managerial ties (i.e., government ties, customer ties and supplier ties) as external resources influence the effects of resource bundling capabilities on strategic change speed. Using data from 508 Chinese firms, we demonstrate that the stabilizing bundling process is negatively related to the speed of strategic change, and enriching and pioneering bundling processes are positively related to the speed of strategic change. Importantly, we find that specific effects of resource bundling on strategic change speed are influenced by different types of external social relationships. These results suggest that managerial capabilities and external ties affect the speed with which strategic change can be implemented.
