Abstract In the present context of the globalized market, sustainable manufacturing has become a major concern for all organizations. The sustainable manufacturing system includes economic, environmental, and social sustainabilities. Green manufacturing enhances the environmental sustainability but, it also affects the economic and social sustainabilities. The compulsion to follow the environmental rules and regulation in any business activity has increased the awareness for the use of green products, recyclable materials for packaging, reduction of carbon emission, etc. Due to the involvement of extra costs in green manufacturing, some ignorance in the implementation of green practices may be observed. To ensure sustainable systems, selection of suppliers based on green performance measures is very important. This study evaluates the suppliers’ performances based on Green Practices as follows: environmental management and pollution control, cost, quality, and flexibility using the fuzzy-extended Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality approach. This approach helps the managers to incorporate the linguistic decision of the decision makers and convert it into quantitative scale. This method is used to eliminate and outrank the poor performers. As poor performers are outranked, this approach helps to select the most suitable green suppliers as per organization’s requirement.
