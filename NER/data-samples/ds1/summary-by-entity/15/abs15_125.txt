Abstract A modification of the discrete multistage exchange trading model with risky securities is considered. At each stage of trading, the players place their integer bids. One of the players knows the real price, while the other knows only its probability distribution. The transaction price is defined as a convex combination of the proposed bids with some given coefficient. The solution to an infinitely long game is obtained.
