Strategic objectives distinguish weakness and strength keys for each strategic plan in order to define specific expectations to gain the most succeed and findings for their organization in the future. Due to the ambiguity in the judgment of managersâ€™ prioritizing strategic objectives, this study is conducted to assist managers and prioritize the objectives. To this end, an integrated method is presented by combination of focus-group interviews as qualitative methods and grey system theory as quantitative methods. In order to examine the proposed method, a case study took into account to prioritize strategic objectives of a strategic procurement system in an Iranian company and the proposed method applied on it.
