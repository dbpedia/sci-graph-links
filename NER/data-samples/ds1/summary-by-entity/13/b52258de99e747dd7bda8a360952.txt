Abstract To date, guidelines for designing inclusive dyslexia-friendly online learning environments, which take into consideration both learners with and without dyslexia, are still scarce. As web text is one of the extensively used elements in online learning, this study aims to derive practical guidelines on this aspect by exploring the experience of learners with dyslexia and learners without dyslexia when using different online reading affordances. The study employed a within-subjects qualitative study and key patterns that emerged from the data collected via observations and interviews were interpreted based on two important aspects of learning experience, which were perceived learning and engagement. The study reveals that (1) the direct application of Printed Text on the web should be carefully considered, (2) existing web accessibility guidelines (limit to guidelines examined in this study) are appropriate and (3) the use of a Screen Reader for online reading should not be made compulsory and be available as an option instead. The comparison between the experience of learners with and without dyslexia in this study has yielded insights into affordances that are perceived positively by both groups of learners. As learners with dyslexia form a significant minority of the online learning population, the inclusive dyslexia-friendly guidelines derived from this study would better inform the future implementation of online reading affordances that acknowledge differences and similarities between online learners.
