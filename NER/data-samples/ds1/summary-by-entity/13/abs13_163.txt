Abstract In this paper, a mobile instructional pervasive game (M-IPG) learning method is proposed for improving students’ learning achievements with respect to vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an EFL course at a university school. A total of 137 university students participated in the experiment, 67 of whom were assigned to the experimental group and followed with the M-IPG approach, whilst 70 students were in the control group and was taught with the mobile inquiry-based instruction. From the empirical obtained, it was found that the proposed approach could effectively promote students’ learning achievement, as well as decrease their cognitive load of learning and perceptions of the use of M-IPG learning. It was found from the interviews that most of the participants perceived the M-IPG learning method to be a stimulating though challenging learning task that facilitated them in improving their location-based learning in the aspects of language learning and practice, learning contents recall, and confidence in using the language.
