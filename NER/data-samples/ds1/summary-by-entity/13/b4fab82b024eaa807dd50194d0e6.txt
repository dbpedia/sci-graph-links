Abstract This paper seeks to develop and validate a measurement scale of perceived quality in the online media (e-SQ-Media), and to explore the influence of perceived quality on satisfaction and loyalty in the online media. Firstly, an explanation of the main attributes of the concepts examined is provided, with special attention being paid to the multidimensional nature of the variables and the relationships between them. This is followed by an examination of the validation processes of the measuring instruments. The validation process of scales suggested that the quality of service in online media is defined by a construct composed of four dimensions: efficiency; system availability; reliability and privacy; and interaction. The model, validated by means of structural equations, provides empirical evidence of the positive link between the quality dimensions proposed in the model and the constructs of satisfaction and loyalty. Most relevant studies regarding quality in online media have focused in the identification of a set of indicators without taking into account aspects relating to perceived quality. The fusion of the two areas of knowledge (online media and e-service quality) may lead to the creation of a scale that takes advantage of the most beneficial features that provide us with the different areas of study with the aim of obtaining as balanced and convergent a model as possible.
