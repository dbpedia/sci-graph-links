Abstract California Association of School Psychologists (CASP) adopted a Position Paper in March, 2014 intended to support school psychologists in California in electing to use a process known as Patterns of Strengths and Weaknesses (PSW) as one of three methods specified in IDEA 2014 and California Code of Regulations, Title 5, to identify students being assessed for Specific Learning Disability (SLD). The CASP Position Paper recommends use of a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) for assisting students who are experiencing learning difficulties. Suggested methods include a comprehensive evaluation using data from multiple sources such as response to instruction and intervention, direct observations across time and settings, record reviews, interviews, and direct assessment to identify the studentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses in cognitive and academic skill areas. Critical elements of the PSW model are described.
