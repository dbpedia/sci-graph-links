Abstract This study evaluated how calculus studentsâ€™ attitudes towards usage of technology changes according to their learning environment and thinking types at the undergraduate level. Thus, the study attempted to determine the place and importance of technological support in the process of attaining the aimed and obtained acquisitions by students. Participants of the study consist of forty-three calculus students who are studying in traditional or CAS-supported teaching environments, and have different thinking types. Pre-and post-assessment tools were used in the data gathering process, and the data were evaluated with descriptive statistics. The results of the study showed that students in the traditional group place more importance on procedural skills, while students in the CAS group attach more importance to conceptual skills in terms of instructional objects. It also determined that acquisitions, which students think developed differ according to learning environment and thinking types. The main implications of the study were discussed in terms of the related literature and teaching practice.
