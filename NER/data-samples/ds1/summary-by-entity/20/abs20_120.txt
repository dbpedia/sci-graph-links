Abstract Silicon compounds are mentioned four times in the poem Venus and Adonis. This poem was published in London, England by William Shakespeare in the year 1593 It is worth noting that William Shakespeare (1564-1616) has also been cited twice before in the journal SILICON since its introduction in 2009. One such citation to Shakespeare was under the sub-header of the journal that is entitled POETS’ CORNER. The idea behind this series of articles that are given under POETS’ CORNER is to have a place where the artistic aspects of the element silicon (Si) and its chemical compounds can be described. Hopefully, this collection of articles will build, and it will serve to show just how broad the field of silicon-based materials and silicon-based technologies is. Indeed one already sees this broadness reflected in the growing content of the journal SILICON. This is article is the third in the ongoing series of articles that are entitled POETS’ CORNER. It was written during 2016 when the world was celebrating the 400 th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare (d. 23 rd April 1616).
