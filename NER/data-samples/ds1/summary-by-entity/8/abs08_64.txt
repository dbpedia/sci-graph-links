Abstract People-flow counting is one of the key techniques of intelligence video surveillance systems and the information of people-flow obtained from this technique is an very important evidence for many applications, such as business analysis, staff planning, security, etc. Traditionally, the color image information based methods encounter kinds of challenges, such as shadows, illumination changing, cloth color, etc., while the depth information based methods suffer from lack of texture. In this paper, we propose an effective approach of people-flow counting by combining color and depth information. First, we adopt a background subtraction technique to fast obtain the moving regions on depth images. Second, the water filling algorithm is used to effectively detect head candidates on the moving regions. Then we use the SVM to recognize the real heads from the candidates. Finally, we adopt a weighted K Nearest Neighbor based multi-target tracking method to track each confirmed head and count the people through the surveillance region. Four datasets constructed from two surveillance scenes are used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that our method outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Our method can work stably on condition of kinds of interruptions and can not only obtain high precisions, but also high recalls on four datasets.
