Abstract With the rapid expansion of the human-centric ubiquitous environment, wireless sensor networks (WSN) will continue to be part of our everyday life and increase the amount and the type of data generated and transmitted by the WSN. As sensors become more essential in our daily life, the data from the sensors will become more private and need to be handled more sensitively. Therefore, the security of not only the data transmission between sensor nodes, but also the software system handling the data from sensor nodes will become more important. In this study, I concentrated on the security characteristics of the overall application systems in WSNs and derived the security attributes from the security requirements and standards of the existing network-based software systems. In the software development process, security must be considered throughout the whole process and, according to the applications the priority of each security attribute can be changed. I demonstrated the relative priority change in a web-based system and a WSN application system with an Analytic Hierarchy Process. The evaluation results showed that the difference of the relative priority of the security attributes in each sample system results not from the difference between the existing network-based system and the WSN but the type of the application. Therefore, the Multimedia security requirements and standards of the existing network-based software development process can be applied to the WSN application system through proper selection and modification.
