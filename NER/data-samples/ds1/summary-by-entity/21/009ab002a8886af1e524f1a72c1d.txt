Abstract The historical side of archæology has been neglected by members of the discipline. This paper attempts to define some theory and methods of history more clearly. Its relationship to archæology will be established. In so doing, the place of history and archæology in the experimental sciences is clarified. The close allegiance of archæology to the sciences established by processual archæologists may in fact be spurious.
