Abstract Problems are considered in which the role of Casimirs in forming dynamics of the two-dimensional ideal incompressible fluid is basically studied; in particular, the conditions are formulated which arise in the stability problem of two-dimensional flows in the presence of Casimirs. Some general approaches to the construction of difference schemes for solving equations of two-dimensional fluid which possess the given Casimirs are considered.
