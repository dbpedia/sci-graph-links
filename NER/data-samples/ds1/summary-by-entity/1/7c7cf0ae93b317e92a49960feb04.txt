Abstract In this paper, with the aid of functional analysis, for almost sectorial operators and some fixed point theorems, we study the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to fractional neutral evolution equations with almost sectorial operators. We also show that mild solutions can become strong and classical solutions under appropriate assumptions. Finally, we present an example to illustrate the applicability of our results.
