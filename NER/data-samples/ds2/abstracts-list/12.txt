The article presents, on the basis of an in-depth study of architectural work, an analysis of these practices and artifacts and shows that they are multilaterally interrelated and form complexes of interrelated practices and artifacts which we have dubbed ‘ordering systems’. In doing so, the article outlines an approach to investigating and conceiving of such practices." .

The first is a tangible computational interface for the design of artifacts such as chairs. Framed within user-driven customization precedents and literature, it suggests ways in which computation can enable new ways of interacting with design knowledge. The second is an architectural installation that uses biometric data from human bodies to dynamically transform an occupant’s experience of an enclosed space. Documenting the development of a series of prototypes, this experiment outlines an area of design inquiry we term “biometrically-responsive architecture”, linking architectural spaces and the human body in new ways. Combining methods from architecture and computation, and emphasizing open-ended bodily interactions over symbolic transactions and goal-driven optimization, these two experiments outline ways in which architectural artifacts and spaces can interact with human designers and occupants in playful ways." .

As these systems comprise various elements, which can be tailored to any given setting, e.g. pre-board fare-collection, holding strategies and other advanced public transport systems (APTS), the attractiveness of such systems depends heavily on their implementation. In the early planning stage it is advantageous to deploy simple and transparent models to evaluate possible ways of implementation. For this purpose, the present study develops a mesoscopic model which makes it possible to evaluate public transport operations in details, including dwell times, intelligent traffic signal timings and holding strategies while modelling impacts from other traffic using statistical distributional data thereby ensuring simplicity in use and fast computational times. This makes it appropriate for analysing the impacts of improvements to public transport operations, individually or in combination, in early planning stages. The paper presents a joint measure of reliability for such evaluations based on passengers’ perceived travel time by considering headway time regularity and running time variability, i.e. taking into account waiting time and in-vehicle time. The approach was applied on a case study by assessing the effects of implementing segregated infrastructure and APTS elements, individually and in combination. The results showed that the reliability of on-street public transport operations mainly depends on APTS elements, and especially holding strategies, whereas pure infrastructure improvements induced travel time reductions. The results further suggested that synergy effects can be obtained by planning on-street public transport coherently in terms of reduced travel times and increased reliability." .

Transport is one of the fascinating technology branches developed during the last 200 years. Effortless movement over long distances has become possible for car users as long as cheap fossil energy is available. However, the effect of fast transport on urban structures and society was not taken into account when developing these technical means. Technologists and economists have used indicators for expected benefits of these fast transport modes without taking into account the real system effects on society and urban structures. Plausible assumptions and hopes instead of scientific understanding of the complex system are used in practice. In contradiction to widely held beliefs of transportation planners, there is actually no growth of mobility if counted in number of trips per person per day, no time saving by increasing speed in the system, and no real freedom of modal choice. Modal choice is dependent on physical and other structures, the artificial environment built by urban planners, transport experts and political decisions. The core hypothesis of traditional urban and transport planning ‘growth of mobility’, ‘travel time saving by increasing speed’ and ‘freedom of modal choice’ are myths and do not exist in the real urban and transport system. This is the reason why urban planning and transport planning based on traditional non-scientific assumptions is creating continuously not only more transport problems, but also environmental and social as well as economic problems all over the world, where these principals are applied. Urban transport planning in Europe, understanding the transport system and the solutions are presented in this paper." .

It is evidence of millennia of adaptation of humans to the environment. Cultural heritage can be intangible (e.g., traditional knowledge, customs, ritual practises or beliefs) and tangible, the latter including various categories of places, from cultural landscapes and sacred sites to archaeological complexes, individual architectural or artistic monuments and historic urban centres. The most world wide representative Cultural and Natural Heritages are included within “UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage”. They are the flagship of a large number of monuments and sites diffused at both national and local level. The sites and remains are not always in equilibrium with the environment. They are continuously impacted and weathered by several internal and external factors, both natural and human-induced, with rapid and/or slow onset. These include major sudden natural hazards, such as earthquakes or extreme meteorological events, but also slow, cumulative processes such as the erosion of rocks, compounded by the effect of climate change, without disregarding the role of humans, especially in conflict situations. Cultural Heritages required proper infrastructures to be used by local populations. Such infrastructures are part of the heritage itself and nowadays need adequate attention for a sustainable conservation and maintenance. Typical example is the Siq of Petra (Jordan). In the present paper the role of engineering geology and earth science in general is described for the conservation and management of a masterpiece of cultural properties such as the Siq of Petra. The relevance and potential of these areas of study was not fully appreciated in the past. At present, however, their contribution is increasingly acknowledged as the need for an inter-disciplinary approach, which would bring together art history, science, management and socio-economic concerns, has become more and more apparent. This paper will focus on the relevance of modern technologies for investigation and monitoring, as a fundamental step for a safeguarding project that have to enhance, as much as possible, traditional knowledge and local sustainable practises, in conservation techniques." .

However when public transport faces competition from other modes of transport, and activities can be undertaken in a variety of locations, then the management and planning of public transport services is considerably more difficult. This paper examines a methodology for representing consumer behaviour when faced with alternative travel decisions, in order to identify the demand for public transport and to help operators adjust services and prices to maximise demand, when considering people's disposable income, the alternative modes and activity locations available. From this it is possible to devise criteria for maximising consumer surplus in a city, taking into account social benefits." .

The notion of sustainable urban form has its roots in the Garden City movement at the turn of the century. The ‘garden’ cities of the 1900s and the ‘ecological’ cities of the 1970s were proposed as alternatives to the pathology of modern urban form. Just as cities provide a place for humans to live, so they destroy ecosystems and become unfit habitats for the human spirit. The city must be made more vital, humane, efficient, beautiful, self-sufficient, and natural through a return to a more compact form, its impact on the environment must be decreased. These themes have re-emerged in the sustainable cities of the 1990s, advanced on behalf of future generations and planetary ecology. The sustainable city is a compact city. Calthorpe's ‘Transit-Oriented Developments’ (1989) are hailed as sustainable because their walkable streets free residents from reliance on automobiles and their high density preserves surrounding wildlife habitat. The European Commission (EC) rests a sustainable future for Europe (1990) on the twin pillars of urban compactness and urban regeneration. Nash (1991) believes that sustainable global urbanization would consist of 1.5 billion humans living in 500 compact cities. He calls his vision ‘Island Civilisation’. The sustainable city is also a city of regenerative processes. Girardet (1990; 1992) thinks it has a ‘circular metabolism’, as distinguished from the ‘linear metabolism’ of contemporary cities. McDonough (adviser to President Clinton on ‘sustainable development’) theorizes inThe Hannover Principles (1992) that in order to make civilization sustainable, urban form will have to be based on the principles of nature, which makes no waste, maximizes biodiversity and is sustained by the sun. The urban form designed by McDonald (1993), conceptualized with ideas from chaos theory, contemplates a sustainable city within a sustainable watershed and a form ‘holistic’, ‘diverse’, ‘fractal’ and ‘evolutionary’. Lyle (1994) believes that the sustainable cities of the next century will be based on the ‘green infrastructure’ of ‘regenerative systems’. The commonality linking these landmarks of sustainable urbanization is the ideal of bringing the city into a vital symbiosis with nature. The sustainable city is a ‘green’ or ‘living’ city. The search for the sustainable city in the 20th century has not been Utopian buttopian, a quest to create a form of city suited to optimal development of the Earth island." .

The ENVI-met V4.0 (BASIC) model was validated by field observations and used to simulate the micrometeorological conditions and the standard effective temperature (SET) at pedestrian level of the street canyons for a typical summer day of Guangzhou. The results show that the micrometeorological parameters of mean radiant temperature (MRT) and wind speed play key roles in pedestrian thermal comfort. Street orientation has the largest contribution on SET at pedestrian level, followed by aspect ratio and greenery, while surface albedo and interactions between factors have small contributions. The street canyons oriented southeast-northwest or with a higher aspect ratio provide more shade, higher wind speed, and better thermal comfort conditions for pedestrians. Compared with the east-west-oriented street canyons, the north-south-oriented street canyons have higher MRTs and worse pedestrian thermal comfort due to their wider building spacing along the street. The effects of greenery change with the road width and the time of the day. Street canyon design is recommended to improve pedestrian thermal comfort. This study provides a better understanding of the effects of street canyon design on pedestrian thermal comfort and is a useful guide on urban design for the hot-humid area of China." .

At the time of the study, Site A had 1-year-old A. nilotica saplings only, whereas Site B had full grown trees. The larva of bagworm moth used either thorns or cut-twigs or both as the materials for building its case. It renovated its case three times, and during each instance it increased the volume of its case by replacing older thorns or cut-twigs by newer and longer ones. However, it exhibited a spectacular predilection for thorns, irrespective of the sites, during the first-instar stage of its development. Thereafter, at Site A it used exclusively cut-twigs, whereas at Site B it preferably used thorns provided they were available in the range of the required length and within the threshold distance. It appears that the bagworm has an ability to process thorn length and distance signals hierarchically to fulfill its priority, that is, case building. Thus it optimizes time and energy expenditures during the period of its larval growth leading to pupation by toggling its preference between thorns and cut-twigs." .

It has been found that about 2.17 GWh of energy is used in the condominium annually by different types of household appliances and lightings in public areas. As there is significant potential to reduce the energy used, different energy savings measures have been applied and energy savings, bill savings, life cycle cost analysis have been estimated and presented in this paper. It has been found that a cumulative amount of 2.4 GWh of energy can be saved for about 10 years with the implementation of different energy savings strategies proposed for appliances and lighting in public areas. However, good maintenance practices and good energy management practices should be employed continuously to maintain high energy efficiency and high performance of the equipment used and the entire building. It has been found that some of the measures like reducing air conditioning load and reducing heat gain through window tinting are economically very viable as payback period is very short. More advantageously, some of the measures can be implemented without investing significant cost. Ultimately, a key driver in the success of energy efficiency is the education and attitude of the stakeholders in the building industry, and end users who are committed to practice energy saving measures." .

Although the literature on creativity is rich in ways to stimulate the decision-making process, these tools are rarely formally present in the building design process. To further the discussion on creativity and design education this paper presents a study on methods that may enhance the creative process and their application in architecture courses around the world. The results of this inquiry indicate that design instructors apply methods that may stimulate creativity mostly informally, with some positive results. To explore more fully the richness of the literature on the enhancement of creativity, structured applications of methods are recommended in controlled experiments to analyze results." .

Urban transport congestion poses a challenge to the cities of China. Policies have been made trying to control the car use and the land use in Chinese cities without sound modelling researches. The existing literature on monocentric city modelling has shown that the parameters are critical for the outcome of the modelling. Following the Alonso-type monocentric model, this paper introduces a bi-modal model to simulate the city size, the distribution of land rent and the modal substitution in Chinese cities. We set the key parameters according to the recent available data of China′s cities, and re-explain the hypothesis of the model. Then we make a sensitivity analysis to reveal the impacts of key parameters on the Chinese cities. According to the results, we find that the wage, the price of car use and the agriculture rent have significant impacts on city size. The land supply for the private transport or the public transport has the strongest impacts on car use and the level of transport congestion. The total population of the city and the wage level have strong impacts on land rent. Some results are counter-intuitive, but explainable. We also discuss implication of these results for policy making." .

The resulting historical narratives and commemorations constitute a heritage landscape known as Acadiana, where monuments, memorials, historic sites, and parks reaffirm and reproduce this identity. An historical archaeology of Acadiana, including a recent investigation of the Amand Broussard homesite, offers a unique opportunity for cultural analysis and historical critique." .

Especially if the individual grain is custom-designed, the range of behaviours can be calibrated to match a wide range of architectural and structural performance criteria. The aggregate becomes programmable matter. The relevance of loose granular systems for architecture is on the one hand their rapid re-configurability, allowing for a system not to be destroyed but rather to be recycled. On the other hand aggregates per se can be functionally graded either within one and the same particle type or through mixing different particle geometries. This enables the variation of architectural properties throughout one and the same material system, which is one of the core postulates of current architectural design research. However, very few examples of designed granular matter in architecture exist. The results presented here are thus one of the first coherent bodies of comprehensive research in this field compiled over a period of five years. Methodologically aggregate systems challenge conventional architectural design principles: whereas an architect generally precisely defines local and global geometry of a structure, in a designed granular system he can only calibrate the particle geometry in order to tune the overall behaviour of the aggregate formation. Thus new design methods have been developed throughout the research projects, which are informed by the related fields of granular physics and behaviour-based robotics. In this context the article provides an introduction to both designed particle systems and suitable fabrication approaches in an architectural context. Case study projects serve to verify the applicability of the concepts introduced. The research findings are discussed with regards to their practical, methodological and design theoretical contributions. To conclude, further directions of research are highlighted." .

His design philosophy, environmental awareness and in-depth understanding of the Australian context and vernacular architecture, have made him one of the leaders of critical regionalism worldwide. His buildings not only provide shelter, but also offer comfort with lower environmental impacts through simple, yet creative design solutions. Although Murcutt’s architecture is well documented, limited evidence-based research has been undertaken to study his approach to design and how this has a direct influence on visual and thermal comfort in his buildings; this paper aims to fill this gap. In this work, the authors have conducted a critical review of three of his most celebrated projects from the environmental design perspective, Marie-Short, Ball-Eastaway, and Marika-Alderton Houses. Even though these houses share a similar building typology, their time of design, location, climate, orientation, tectonics and environmental requirements greatly differ, offering an opportunity for comparative analysis. Through theoretical qualitative and quantitative studies, the close connection between the spatial qualities, environmental design strategies and performance of these houses were investigated in detail. The impact and implications of the reinterpreted elements of Australia’s vernacular architecture including verandahs, overhangs, roofing shape, building form and layout, had on the performance and spatial delight of the houses was explored through computer aided modelling. Daylighting and thermal performances were assessed and analysed in correlation with Murcutt’s environmental design strategies. Through this investigation it is clear that while cross-ventilation and shading devices were adopted in buildings to prevent excessive solar ingress during summertime, Murcutt seems to consciously favour scenic views, and a constant connection with nature over visual and thermal comfort. Although the three houses experience occasional visual and thermal discomfort, the research findings suggest that they perform well as free-running buildings for most of the time. They are found to be sensibly designed to be climatically adaptable, skilfully built and spatially delightful, whilst keeping a continuous dialogue with nature; it is achieving this unique balance that lies the significance of Murcutt’s work." .

Results for the air conditioned sample indicated that office buildings were overcooled, causing up to one-third of their occupants to experience cool thermal comfort sensations. These observations in air conditioned buildings were broadly consistent with the ISO, ASHRAE and Singapore indoor climatic standards. Indoor climates of the naturally ventilated apartments during the day and early evening were on average three degrees warmer than the ISO comfort standard prescriptions, but caused much less thermal discomfort than expected.

Indeed, Dennett's remarks on design serve to highlight tensions buried deep within his theory. For inasmuch as Dennett succeeds in objectifying attributions of design, attributions of intentionality readily follow suit, leading to a form of intentional realism. But inasmuch as Dennett is successful in relativizing attributions of design, scientific realism at large is subject to renewed anti-realistic criticism. Dennettian-inspired considerations of adaptationism substantiate the former move towards intentional realism, while considerations of the relativity of artifactual design encourage the latter move towards physical relativism. The ambivalence intrinsic to Dennett's ``mild realism'' can be viewed as a function of these two conflicting positions on design, for Dennett can no more avoid objectifying intentionality when he is realistic about design than he can avoid relativizing physical causality when relativistic about design." .

Such regeneration processes are an arena where different interests meet and often confront each other, with concepts and values of built heritage being used to different ends by the actors involved. However, the origins of conservation concepts and approaches are seldom considered. This paper examines the historical development of built heritage awareness and conservation policies from an institutionalist perspective at the international, European and Latin. American levels. It then considers conservation policies in Scotland and Brazil, particularly in the central areas in Edinburgh and Salvador from the 19th century to the 1970s, and the growing awareness of built heritage among certain sections of society and local institutions in these localities. Finally, the paper analyses the reasons behind, and types of, interventions in Edinburgh’s Old Town and Salvador’s Pelourinho and Maciel neighbourhoods, and the level of awareness of built heritage among the general population in the two cities. The paper draws conclusions on the influence of various factors on the development of approaches to built heritage and on the different ways in which these contributed to a particular awareness of built heritage in Edinburgh and Salvador." .

Because of the limitations of manual checking by even the best supervisors, the goal of this research is to achieve an approach of BIM-based code compliance checking for deep foundation construction presented in BIM models, as well as a system based on the proposed approach. This research abides by the principles of four stages in rule-based system, and emphasizes the development of the library of checking knowledge and the standard of required information which are the key problems in achieving the BIM-based code compliance checking. Decision tables, production representation and a developing process similar to IDM development are used to solve the problems. Furthermore, a case study is provided to investigate the effect of the BIM-based code compliance checking process. It is proved that the BIM-based checking improves the efficiency and precision in code compliance checking and facilitates the risk identification at the next stage. It ensures the safety of deep foundation and reduces personal injury and property loss." .

Systematic looting, destruction and illicit excavation of sites continue without the international community (including academics, government organisations, heritage workers and humanitarian aid organisations) acknowledging this problem, let alone addressing it. The pre-war approaches to Somali cultural heritage lacked awareness-raising initiatives and basic dialogue with local communities, and hence remained uninformed about local views and methodologies regarding heritage. This has resulted in a lack of interest in building a local foundation and infrastructure for heritage management and archaeological research in the country. Today, it is clear that no measures were taken to protect cultural heritage during two decades of armed conflict in Somalia. Recently, archaeological material has become the target of ideologically motivated destruction. However, in post-conflict Somaliland, a self-declared, de facto country where there is peace and stability, possibilities for protection and management of cultural heritage exist. In order to carry out such work, an understanding of local practices is necessary. Hence, this paper presents unique research into local heritage management strategies and unveils indigenous heritage management methods, which the author refers to as the knowledge-centred approach. This approach emphasises knowledge and skill rather than objects, helping cultures such as the Somali, with strong oral transmission of knowledge, preserve their cultural heritage even in times of armed conflict. Also, this paper presents a critical assessment of the Somali cultural emergency as a whole and suggests ways of assisting different stakeholders in the protection of Somali heritage in the conflict and post-conflict eras." .

Beside the construction phase, it is the daily life in neighbourhoods that impacts their carbon footprint. Energy monitoring is a powerful tool for energy analytics, benchmarking, improvements and even real-time energy management on neighbourhood scale. Unfortunately, the standard planning processes on neighbourhood scale do not facilitate seamless monitoring. This paper describes the fundamentals of centralized monitoring on neighbourhood scale, shows the limits of available real-world examples and introduces a current project aiming at tackling some of the lessons learned from previous projects, focusing on the specifications and their integration into the planning process of new urban development areas." .

Archaeologists attribute aspects of the Mesoamerican urban tradition to the limiting effects of inefficient transport. The relationship between transport and population growth is evaluated here. A large sample of preindustrial European cities with known populations is categorized according to the navigability of their waterways, and their growth is monitored over three centuries. Median population sizes were consistently lower among landlocked cities than among seaports and cities on rivers. Effects of population stasis was more pronounced among landlocked cities. Capital cities appeared able to stretch population limits in each category, but not to elude them. The applicability of the model to prehistoric urban development is discussed, as are potential problems that would be encountered." .

Based on the feedback from over 319,000 visitors at 791 locations, we create an index that shows the extent to which World Heritage sites are actually branding themselves as such. We find great heterogeneity throughout the list and explain this econometrically with site-specific incentives. Notably, the sites that benefit more from the World Heritage brand are significantly more willing to contribute to the collective brand than sites that benefit less. Specifically, rural sites are much better branded than urban sites, as rural sites benefit more from the brand than urban sites. We also find a positive relationship between World Heritage branding and its conservation status and a U-shaped relationship between a site’s visitor numbers and its branding. Furthermore, Asian sites are much better branded than sites in the Middle East, and richer countries and those with already more international tourists are branded less. The difficulty of effective branding, e.g., for large, open-access sites, has no significant effect. Our findings suggest that mandatory World Heritage branding obligations would have a positive effect on the World Heritage brand equity, bringing conservation and economic benefits to a much wider range of World Heritage sites." .

Brief reference is made to indoor environmental conditions in both conditioned and unconditioned buildings. The lack of useful information with respect to the effects of directional radiation in warm climates is emphasized. A method is outlined for a more rational assessment of outdoor meteorological conditions in terms of the probability of joint occurrence of various combinations of meteorological elements. The influence of structural design on the thermal performance of buildings is discussed in terms of the diurnal variation of outdoor air temperature and solar radiation fluxes. The need of ceiling insulation is specifically stressed." .

It has received much recent interest because of its potential in factor screening experiments. A packing design is an important object in combinatorial design theory. In this paper, a strong link between the two apparently unrelated kinds of designs is shown. Several criteria for comparing supersaturated designs are proposed, their properties and connections with other existing criteria are discussed. A combinatorial approach, called the packing method, for constructing optimal supersaturated designs is presented, and properties of the resulting designs are also investigated. Comparisons between the new designs and other existing designs are given, which show that our construction method and the newly constructed designs have good properties." .

Previous studies have shown that signaling or marketability plays an important role in the pursuit for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and equivalent green-building certification. By analyzing all new construction projects receiving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification from 2000 to 2012 in the US, this study estimates the relative importance of ‘green’ signaling. This broad perspective using project-level data enables an analysis of some drivers of signaling and the pursuit of marketing benefits. The roles of local competition and market conditions, as well as municipal regulations are examined, especially as they differ between types of building owners (e.g., for-profit firms, governments, nonprofits). The results indicate that the non-building performance value—value captured by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design signals above and beyond the specific building attributes that Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certifies—dominates the attainment of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design scores around certification tier thresholds. Further, strong evidence of spatial clustering of this non-building performance value for some owner types indicates that for-profit owners may be more responsive to local competition than non-profit owners. Local legislative mandates predict greater signaling intensity by government-owned buildings, as expected, but for-profit-owned projects tend to signal less, even after controls for local conditions. The results highlight the importance of local conditions, including peer effects and regulations, in driving non-building performance values across a wide range of green buildings." .

The current paper provides a background on residential sprinkler technology from its inception until the present, and analyzes the contribution of risk factors, such as fire, on the total lifecycle carbon emissions of one- and two-family dwellings and the reduction to that contribution achieved via the use of automatic fire sprinklers. The analysis shows that the risk of fire increases the carbon emissions of a building over its’ lifecycle. The results illustrate that sound risk management is necessary to achieving sustainability and avoiding unintended consequences. These findings are especially important as society seeks to design and build more energy- and resource-efficient, environmentally sustainable buildings." .

The ambitious project of developing a new international city centre has been carefully planned as the Netherlands has a strong and meticulous tradition for urban planning. The planning has however not only encompassed traditional urban planning aspects such as infrastructure, environmental factors and aesthetics, but has also dealt with the design of urban experiences. Through an introduction of the framework of the structure of experiences, this article examines how urban experiences can be understood and analysed, and deals with how urban experiences can be designed through careful consideration of how experiences are constituted. Taking the psychological structure of experiences into account when designing urbanity is not only interesting, but also highly relevant as Zuidas is competing with other international venues such as La Défense, the Docklands and Potsdamer Platz." .

For large fill areas, the compression of saturated clayey soils with time under pressures not exceeding those computed in accordance with SNiP II-15-74 can be determined by methods of the theory of one-dimensional soil consolidation." .

One constructs a new 3-manifold DW by doubling W along a subsurface in its boundary. If DW is hyperbolic, and if W has compressible boundary, then DW must have a longitude of 'length' less than 4. This can be applied to show that an arc α that is a candidate for an unknotting tunnel in a 3-manifold cannot be an unknotting tunnel. It can also be used to show that a 'tubed surface' is incompressible. For knot and link complements in S 3, and α an unknotting tunnel, DW is almost always hyperbolic. Empirically, this construction appears to provide a surprisingly effective procedure for demonstrating that specific arcs are not unknotting tunnels." .

However, those factors are not usually considered when the city is planned, and it is difficult to ensure that urban planning will create more sustainable cities. Therefore, knowledge of the relationship between planning variables and future operating cost of urban public services can help to improve the decision-making process in the early stages of urban planning. In a set of Spanish cities on two different territorial levels, the degree of correlation between three of the urban planning variables that define the urban morphology and the operating cost of street lighting infrastructure has been analysed. The study shows that at whole city level, the operating cost is closely related to housing density and relative length of roads, while for new residential developments, the most crucial urban variable is the relative area occupied by the streets. It has also become clear that per area and per capita operating cost of illuminating newly developed areas is significantly higher than the average cost for the whole city." .

One major evaluation criterion in the method is total travel time, subdivided into walking time, waiting time, time on vehicle, transfer time, and concealed waiting time. The other major criterion is costs incurred by a given supply of transport. In contrast with conventional methods, this method operates with real measures, i.e. real location (instead of traffic zones), real time (instead of average travel time), and real costs (instead of proxy-costs). The purpose is to produce relevant and easily understandable results suitable to open planning, for instance planning with citizen participation. Five examples of application of the method are given: (1) evaluation of changes in suburban bus services; (2) evaluation of geographical localities as regards public transport; (3) evaluation of circular bus routes; (4) evaluation of flexible work hours versus fixed work hours and, finally; (5) production of user information on transport service. The research on evaluation of public transport was carried out in collaboration between Aalborg Municipality and the University of Aalborg 1980–1981. It was funded by the Department of Education, the University of Aarhus, Aalborg Municipality, the University of Aalborg's Data Centre and the University of Aalborg.

Less attention appears to direct to the thermal comfort or thermal sensation of occupants, even to the relationship between thermal conditions and thermal sensation. In this paper, a series of experiments were designed and conducted for understanding the non-uniform conditions and the occupant’s thermal responses in vehicle cabin during the heating period. To accurately assess the transient temperature distribution in cabin in common daily condition, the air temperature at a number of positions is measured in a full size vehicle cabin under natural winter environment in South China by using a discrete thermocouples network. The occupant body is divided into nine segments, the skin temperature at each segment and the occupant’s local thermal sensation at the head, body, upper limb and lower limb are monitored continuously. The skin temperature is observed by using a discrete thermocouples network, and the local thermal sensation is evaluated by using a seven-point thermal comfort survey questionnaire proposed by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc(ASHRAE) Standard. The relationship between the skin temperature and the thermal sensation is discussed and regressed by statistics method. The results show that the interior air temperature is highly non-uniform over the vehicle cabin. The locations where the occupants sit have a significant effect on the occupant’s thermal responses, including the skin temperature and the thermal sensation. The skin temperature and thermal sensation are quite different between body segments due to the effect of non-uniform conditions, clothing resistance, and the human thermal regulating system. A quantitative relationship between the thermal sensation and the skin temperature at each body segment of occupant in real life traffic is presented. The investigation result indicates that the skin temperature is a robust index to evaluate the thermal sensation. Applying the skin temperature to designing and controlling parameters of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning(HVAC) system may benefit the thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption." .

As I will try to demonstrate below, their two different responses not only supplement my article very nicely, but also augment each other’s. In the beginning of Read’s comment, as he sets the stage for his observations, he unknowingly also points in the direction of Benjamin’s remarks: “I propose not to de-construct therefore, or add a point of view from an orthogonal position, but to try in the spirit of multidisciplinarity to talk in languages not well practiced—to begin to build what Bowker and Star call ‘boundary objects’ between different starting positions; points we can gather around to think further together” (Read 2011).

TPIs are standardized measures suitable for analysis in order to appraise the feasibility of a transport policy or an infrastructural project. Data collection of TPIs is a crucial phase, but data detection and monitoring are not standardized at the city level. Thus, there is no a standard for data collection and storing, this aspect makes much difficult to compare different city contexts. This issue is critical and bounds the analysis of built scenarios. A standardized set of transport performance indicators becomes, hence, essential for monitoring the implemented policies. Methodology and resultsThe paper answers to some of these questions, providing a specific set of sustainable and transport performance indicators to evaluate effects of policy measures. Furthermore, it shows a comparative analysis of different European cities in terms of development, sustainability and infrastructures, by using transport performance indicators. A Normalized Transport Sustainability Index has been built using identified TPIs, in order to measure and hence to compare the whole sustainability of adopted policies in different urban areas. The same NTSI allows to appraise the expected results and thus to tune the policy measures. ConclusionWe can affirm that an high value of sustainability is associated, in general, to small-medium cities in term both population and urban area; nevertheless, for large cities, the adoption of policy measures, from a side, to control the urban sprawl, from the other side, to manage the urban transport demand with an adequate public transport development allows to achieve a more sustainable mobility." .
<http://www.springernature.com/scigraph/things/articles/f43f15aba63bffcfef4edcc5f4db9ca5> <http://www.springernature.com/scigraph/ontologies/core/abstract> "Abstract Although the fields of urban planning and public health share a common origin in the efforts of reformers to tame the ravages of early industrialization in the 19th century, the 2 disciplines parted ways in the early 20th century as planners increasingly focused on the built environment while public health professionals narrowed in on biomedical causes of disease and disability. Among the unfortunate results of this divergence was a tendency to discount the public health implications of planning decisions. Given increasingly complex urban environments and grave health disparities in cities worldwide, urban planners and public health professionals have once again become convinced of the need for inclusive approaches to improve population health and achieve health equity. To make substantive progress, intersectoral collaboration utilizing ecological and systems science perspectives will be crucial as the solutions lie well beyond the control of any single authority. Grounded in the social determinants of health, and with a renewed sense of interconnectedness, dedicated and talented people in government agencies and communities who recognize that our future depends on cultivating local change and evaluating the results can come to grips with the enormous challenge that lies ahead to create more equitable, sustainable, and healthier cities worldwide." .

Seemingly, to his Dutch colleagues, Nio's work is on the track of liberating architecture from the burden of cultural responsibilities (Ibelings Supermodernism: Architecture in the age of globalization: Nai Uitgevers Pub, 1998), yet it evinces significant differences from other work in that vein. MethodsNio’s projects are compared with Jencks' phenomenology of iconic architecture (Jencks The iconic building: Rizzoli New York, 2005), in order to demonstrate the importance and peculiarity of Nio’s work within the context of Iconic Architecture and the Superdutch period, and the extent to which his work can be considered different. ResultsThis article argues that Nio’s architecture is not based on the production of outstanding shapes (Lootsma SuperDutch Afterthoughts Post. Rotterdam. Rotterdam: 010 Publisher, 2001), or the clever interpretation of a given program (Betsky Reading MVRDV: NAi 2003), but on the creation of disquieting presences in the built environment. Most of his work consists of pieces of architecture each of which has its own name, character and identity and seems to rely on disrupting the expected and disturbing the quiet. ConclusionsThis paper examines Nio’s work, with particular attention to three case studies, in order to generate a series of qualitative characteristics that define his idiosyncratic architecture." .

An examination of the latest Pantheon studies illustrates the newest theories of relationships between architecture and mathematics in Rome’s most celebrated building. This paper was presented at the Nexus 2000 conference on architecture and mathematics, 4–7 June 2000, Ferrara, Italy. Many studies on the Pantheon are carried out far from Rome and so ideas on the monument cannot be checked easily or frequently. For this reason, a group of architects and archaeologists are working in Rome, trying to resolve some seemingly banal but still unanswered questions.

There is considerable evidence, however, that occupants do not understand the principles of how buildings function and that they use the systems non-optimally. The purpose of the paper is to quantify the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption and show how it is affected by design strategies. Numerical simulations of an office were performed with the dynamic thermal simulation software TRNSYS. Three types of behaviour (‘careless’, ‘normal’, and ‘conscious’) and two types of design (‘ordinary’ and ‘robust’) were considered. The results show that the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption is greatly diminished with robust design solutions, solutions that make buildings less sensitive to occupant behaviour. The careless user consumes 75–79 % less energy if the robust design solutions are applied rather than the ordinary design solutions. It is argued that a realistic view of occupant behaviour is advantageous in the creation of energy-efficient buildings (that is, leaving less need to learn how buildings work, to be motivated to save energy, or to perform specific energy-saving actions). However, the possibility of personal control should not be eliminated." .

The error of this insistence was persuasively argued by Jane Jacobs in the 1960s. Subsequently, planning theory and practice came to recognise the importance of density, but this return to favour requires remaining constantly alert to the possible dangers and pitfalls. MethodsCritically considering the traditional and contemporary urban planning literature and the empirical evidence in the recent economic and geographical research, this article investigates the whys and wherefores of density in urban planning. It addresses two main questions: Is urban density really desirable (and why)? Is it effectively manageable (and how)? ResultsDensity per se is meaningless unless it is a tool or condition for achieving something further. And even if the instrumental function of density were to be acknowledged, it is crucial to take into account that density is not solely (or merely) a tool which—in certain conditions—can be useful in reducing commute times and minimising the encroachment on undeveloped land. Its primary advantage concerns favouring the concentrated diverse admix of human preferences, tastes, abilities, know-how, uses, activities, and so forth. ConclusionsAfter having expressly laboured to avoid it for so long, the aim is not to create density directly, but to open the door and allow density to happen in our cities, thanks to more abstract and general planning rules." .

In this design, dampers’ position inside air terminal units (ATUs) are modulated to adjust the amount of air supply volume based on thermal zones’ cooling or heating demand. A minimum air flow fraction (MAFF) is set for damper settings of ATUs to avoid under-ventilation problem in thermal zones. This study investigated the impact of MAFF value on various performance aspects of multiple-zone VAVR design in different building applications and climate types. A five-storey commercial building for three applications of school, office and retail in four climate types of tropical monsoon, hot desert, Mediterranean and humid continental have been simulated in EnergyPlus building simulation software. The results of simulations have shown that lowering MAFF value in ATUs would reduce the required reheat coil energy to maintain precise air supply temperature at part load cooling scenarios. Nonetheless, this reduction could have some implications on thermal comfort and indoor air quality level of thermal zones in a multiple-zone arrangement. It was concluded that in general it is an energy efficient control strategy to keep MAFF value to as low as 0.1 for high ventilation rate spaces like classrooms in school buildings (except for hot desert climate). On the other hand, it is advisable to not reduce MAFF value below 0.3 for low ventilation rate spaces like office areas to avoid any air quality issues in thermal zones." .

The amounts of LPS as shown by GC-MS were 30–50 times larger than the amounts detected by the Limulus test. GC-MS revealed that 21% of the LPS collected on cellulose acetate filters and 26% on polycarbonate filters remained on the filters after buffer extraction. Better correlation with the Limulus test and the 3-OH-FA measurements was achieved when considering the sum of 3-OH C12:0 and 3-OH C14:0 rather than the sum of all of the detected 3-OH-FAs (i.e. those with 12–18-carbon chains), indicating that the bioactivity of the LPS was dependent upon the relative distribution of the 3-OH-FAs. Linear regression analysis between air concentrations of dust and endotoxin/LPS gaveR 2values that varied from 0.407 to 0.739. The air concentrations of LPS were lower in the uninsulated swine house (a green house with an alternative housing system) than in the two insulated buildings (conventional housing systems; one designed as a climate chamber, i.e. climatic parameters could be controlled), whereas the opposite was found for the concentrations of LPS in airborne dust from the three buildings. The numbers of viable bacteria and fungi were highest in the uninsulated swine house. Moreover the relative distribution of 3-OH-FAs in that building differed from the distribution in the insulated buildings, which reflects differences in the microflora, probably mainly due to differences between the housing systems and the design of the buildings." .

The success of such applications lies on several factors like user-friendliness and data presentation as well as the amount and accuracy of cultural data they can offer to users, static or mobile, on-demand. This paper presents the design and implementation of a multipurpose, multidiscipline digital platform that manages, preserves and disseminates tangible and intangible cultural heritage information, in a trustworthy manner, appropriate for the everyday use in smart city digital environments. Platform’s trustworthiness is mainly ensured by applying specific authorization mechanisms based on an extended role-based access control scheme. The platform integrates a mobile services module that can host and support smartphone applications for the direct collection, digitization and dissemination of cultural heritage content. Moreover, we make an attempt to address various stakeholders who benefit from such a platform. In this direction we have designed and implemented a series of real life usage scenarios. The proposed platform is evaluated against other online digital platforms that host cultural heritage content. Evaluation results suggest that the presented platform could become a participatory system that targets not only experts and artists, but also amateurs and enthusiasts of cultural heritage.

Moreover, the inventory of “green” office space in the United States has increased dramatically since the introduction of rating schemes that attest to the energy efficiency or sustainability of commercial buildings. In some metropolitan areas, the supply of certified office buildings has more than doubled in the last decade, and there are a few metropolitan areas where “green” office space now accounts for more than a quarter of the total office stock. In this paper, we analyze the diffusion of buildings certified for energy efficiency across US property markets. Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas observed over the last fifteen years, we trace the diffusion of green building practices across the country. We then model the geographic patterns and dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse over space and time is important for designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built environment." .

The city took the opportunity to build back “stronger, better, and greener,” enforcing upgraded codes, requiring city-owned buildings to meet LEED Platinum level standards, and recommending energy-efficiency housing in a new Sustainable Comprehensive Plan. Using information collected from surveys of Greensburg tornado survivors, interviews, and publications, we examined the housing-related recovery, including the emergency provision of temporary shelter and rebuilding permanently. Although temporary shelter kept residents nearby for rebuilding, given the gap between insurance policy limits on the aging housing stock and rebuilding costs, housing affordability is a critical issue in Greensburg’s recovery. Local, state, and federal support have made construction of municipal buildings at LEED Platinum level and some affordable and green housing projects possible. However, far greater public and private sector funding for affordable workforce housing, in conjunction with broader economic and job development, is needed." .

Thermal comfort conditions are among the most significant factors of climatic variables in the northwestern regions of Iran due to the considerable spatial and temporal variations and are vital for environmental, energy and economic management. It is therefore necessary to advance our knowledge of the climatic conditions in order to provide an appropriate tool for managing climatic extremes. This requires charting of the range of clusters of the thermal comfort conditions in this region. In this study, the general atmosphere circulation model HADCM3 and the A1 scenario, downscaled by the LARS-WG model, were employed to simulate the climatic conditions in Iran during the period 2011–2040. The data obtained were compared with sampled data from six Iranian climatic stations for the 30-year period (1961–1990). In order to tabulate this comparison, six clusters per climatic station were defined based on intrinsic similarity of data. Results show an increase in the annual average temperature of these six stations by 1.69 °C for the predicted years, projected from the base years 1961–1990. This factor has resulted in an increment of the annual average thermal comfort temperature inside buildings by a magnitude of 0.52 °C in future decades. When the thermal requirements of the studied region were evaluated based on the real temperature difference and the degree of thermal comfort, it becomes clear that apart from cluster 1, the energy required to reach thermal comfort inside buildings will increase in the future. As a result of this temperature increase, an increase of the energy required to reach the thermal comfort is expected. This new methodology is an interesting tool and needs to be seriously considered by engineers and architects in designing buildings of the future." .

Travel is viewed as essential for therestoration of face-to-face contact lost through decentralized (sociofugal) architecture. Telecommunication is seen as a substitute for travel. While telecommunication cannot restore face-to-face interaction in its entirety, it can through compensation along available modalities (i.e., proxemic, kinesic, paralinguistic, and/or linguistic) allow functionally equivalent interaction distances. Finally, we define crowding across multiple modalities and multiple dyad terms. Contrary to convention, we argue that one can be crowded by Picturephone®, telephone, or letter as well as by face-to-face interaction, and is by one other person as well as by many." .

Surface survey, favored by archaeologists of complex societies as a settlement detection method, seldom is appropriate for discovering architectural remains buried through bioturbation. Where the focus of analysis includes settlement represented by architectural remains, surface survey is appropriate only where all or a representative sample of all types of architectural remains are protrusive. “Protrusion” describes a relationship (affected by climate, environment, topography, and cultural variables) between the height of a ruined building and the depth of the biomantle, which is the zone of bioturbation. To enable archaeologists to assess the appropriateness of settlement detection procedures, including surface survey, I propose a scheme that classifies architectural remains in terms of their protrusion, building height, and visibility characteristics. The scheme can be employed to determine if and why architectural remains are protrusive in particular study areas. To demonstrate its analytical utility, I apply the scheme and the model of building burial through bioturbation that underlies it to the problem of Maya “invisible” settlement. I conclude that in the Maya lowlands of Mesoamerica, building remains buried through bioturbation are a more abundant settlement category than many archaeologists have supposed." .

The energetic impact of buildings in the current energetic context is first depicted. Then the studied optimization problem is defined as the optimal management of production and consumption activities in houses. A scheduling problem is identified to adjust the energy consumption to both the energy cost and the inhabitant’s comfort. The available flexibilities of the services provided by domestic appliances are used to compute optimal energy plans. These flexibilities are associated to time windows or heating storage abilities. A constraints formulation of the energy allocation problem is given. A derived mixed linear program is used to solve this problem. The energy consumption in houses is very dependent to uncertain data such as weather forecasts and inhabitants’ activities. Parametric uncertainties are introduced in the home energy management problem in order to provide robust energy allocation. Robust linear programming is implemented. Event related uncertainties are also addressed through stochastic programming in order to take into account the inhabitant’s activities. A scenario based approach is implemented to face this robust optimization problem." .

One of the most important decisions made by architects are those about the design approach such as the use of patterns or styles in the architecture. The structural nature of this type of decisions give them the potential to be controlled systematically. In the literature, there are some works on the automation of architectural decision violation checking. In this paper we show that these works do not allow to detect all possible architectural decision violations. To solve this problem we propose an approach which: (i) describes architectural patterns that hold the architectural decision definition, (ii) integrates architectural decisions into an architectural model and, (iii) automates the architectural decision conformance checking. The approach is implemented using Eclipse modeling framework and its accompanying technologies. Starting from well-known architectural patterns, we show that we can formalize all those related to the structural aspect. Through two evaluations, we show that our approach can be adapted to different architecture paradigms and allows to detect more violations comparing to the existing approaches." .

The aim is the implementation of a low-impact monitoring system together with long-term mitigation/conservation policies. A field analysis was conducted to reconstruct geometry of the rocky cliff, characteristics of discontinuities, main failure modes, and volume of potential unstable blocks and geomechanical parameters. Instability processes are the combination of causative factors such as the following: lithology, frequency and orientation of discontinuities, slope orientation, physical and mechanical characteristics of slope-forming materials, and morphological and hydrological boundary conditions. The combined adoption of different survey techniques (e.g., 3D laser scanner, ground-based radar interferometry) could be the best solution in the interdisciplinary field of cultural heritage preservation policies.

At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the development stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollution. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems." .

In this study, the ASHRAE 55 adaptive model of thermal comfort was investigated for its applicability to a hot and humid climate through a long-term field survey performed in central Taiwan among local students attending 14 elementary and high schools during September to January. Adaptive behaviors, thermal neutrality, and thermal comfort zones are explored. A probit analysis of thermal acceptability responses from students was performed in place of the conventional linear regression of thermal sensation votes against operative temperature to investigate the limits of comfort zones for 90% and 80% acceptability; the corresponding comfort zones were found to occur at 20.1–28.4°C and 17.6–30.0°C, respectively. In comparison with the yearly comfort zones recommended by the adaptive model for naturally ventilated spaces in the ASHRAE Standard 55, those observed in this study differ in the lower limit for 80% acceptability, with the observed level being 1.7°C lower than the ASHRAE-recommended value. These findings can be generalized to the population of school children, thus providing information that can supplement ASHRAE Standard 55 in evaluating the thermal performance of naturally ventilated school buildings, particularly in hot-humid areas such as Taiwan." .

The present paper presents an analysis of the Cordovan proportion in the curved ribbing of Gothic vaults. Specifically, it consists of a geometric study of the octagonal vault of the Chapel of the Presentation in Burgos Cathedral. The results show that when the side of the octagon is taken as a modulus, the Cordovan triangles drawn by the layout of the vault form a geometric succession whose ratio is the Cordovan number." .

Urban systems have been developed to achieve energy and resource savings in an attempt to eliminate their environmentally negative impacts. The end goal would seem to be to make buildings and cities virtually invisible within the context of the natural environment and to extract humanity from that which is natural. This approach could be termed as a hyper-efficiency sustainability model. In this approach, the impacts of human beings and their functional systems are seen as contaminants that need reduction or removal. Although driven by a desire to preserve the Earth’s natural systems, such an approach ultimately creates greater division between humanity and nature and may not bring sustainability. As an alternative to a hyper-efficiency model of sustainability, a model should be pursued that focuses more on developing an integrative relationship between civilization and environment akin to mutualism in biology. Such an approach, which could be termed as a mutualistic sustainability model, incorporates natural systems and elements into the structures and functions of buildings and cities, with the goal of achieving cooperative and positive interaction between humanity and nature. Such integration can create opportunities to support living organisms and biological systems in an ecologically contributive manner, while fulfilling human infrastructural needs. It offers a more positive alternative to efficiency based strategies and has the potential to establish a healthier and more productive relationship between humanity and the Earth’s natural systems. This paper elaborates on these two distinct approaches to sustainability and presents an examination of recent green building projects and green infrastructure projects. It analyses specific strategies and methods to contrast and compare manifestations of both approaches, providing valuable lessons and insights for designing sustainable buildings and cities." .

Increasing group size was found to have an adverse effect on the amount and nature of the comb construction. The building abilities of various workers varied considerably. When isolated singly, only few workers built correctly, some built incorrectly and many failed to build altogether. Workers isolated immediately after emergence showed a greater tendency to build than workers isolated 3 or 4 days after emergence." .

Based on these findings policies steering the shape of cities have been proposed to reduce urban transport emissions and limit congestion. Such policies can also be relevant for the rapidly growing and motorising Chinese cities. Yet, empirical evidence on the relationships between urban form and car usage is scarce for the specific Chinese context that is characterised by high densities, fast development and strong government steering. Using novel crowd-sourced datasets we study the impact of several urban form variables (city size, urban density, land-use mix, polycentricity and spatial clustering) on the cost of commuting expressed in time and distance. The results show that city size and spatial clustering are important determinants of commuting: large cities without clear clusters of businesses and other facilities have longer average commuting times and distances. Increased prosperity also adds to longer and lengthier commutes. Spatial planning measures that maintain or reinforce high-density clusters can help limiting commuting distance and time. Current sprawled urban development may have long-term, negative consequences for the accessibility and liveability of Chinese cities and could hamper their economic potential." .

The new algorithm is more “on-line” than earlier similar methods, takes expected timeO(nℝgn) and spaceO(n), and is eminently practical to implement. The analysis of the algorithm is also interesting in its own right and can serve as a model for many similar questions in both two and three dimensions. Finally we demonstrate how this approach for constructing Voronoi diagrams obviates the need for building a separate point-location structure for nearest-neighbor queries." .

CFCs are used for refrigeration, air-conditioning, foam blowing, solvent cleaning and propelling aerosols and, in each case, equipment has been designed to make the most efficient use of the properties of individual compounds. There is little scope for substitution, even between CFCs. The potential for replacement of these historic uses by substitute technologies - ammonia, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and HCFCs, HFCs and FCs -is examined. It is shown that the quantities required are influenced as much by improvements to containment as they are by the primary demands from society. Based on analysis of the historic data; the declared manufacturing capacities, and the anticipated effects of international controls, the potential production and emissions of the principal HCFCs and HFCs are calculated for the next twenty five years. While consumption of HCFCs will fall nearly to zero, it would appear that demand for HFC-134a could double, from approximately 150,000 to 300,000 tonnes/year between 1995 and 2020. Over the same timescale demand for HFC-32 could rise to 90,000 tonnes/year. The potential future emissions of other HCFCs, HFCs and FCs which are expected to be used less widely, or for which there is no current consumption base from which to make meaningful extrapolations, are also discussed." .

In particular, we characterize the p-adic-like affine rank 3 buildings by a certain p-adic Moufang condition, and show that such a condition has zero probability to survive in hyperbolic rank 3 buildings.

Is chiasmus a tool of literati who appropriate spatial forms to pull their plots to closure, or is there an independent architectural tradition of chiasmus? If one pulls together the clues about metonymy, the logic of arrangement, one can discover an intriguing link to Jacques Lacan’s similar design of the human psyche and his topological investigations. The Vitruvian sequence of venustas, utilitas and firmatas may suggest to some nothing more than an arbitrary division of architectural interests. Ritually, however, the relation of firmitas not just to material stability but to the traditional rituals required to secure buildings from both collapse and curse, even if figurative, offers connections to the chiastic design of foundation rites, where sacrifice secures the life and security of structure." .

They are called Advanced Public Transport Systems and consist of small automated collective vehicles running on demand. A pre-design method for a first dimensioning of such systems was developed by simulating nearly 3 000 scenarios with Dial-A-Ride software and performing statistical regressions on the results. The method needs as input: network length, expected demand, vehicle top speed, maximum waiting time, and vehicle capacity. In six steps the method gives: number of vehicles, average waiting time, vehicle⋅kilometers, commercial speed, occupancy rate, and costs. The regressions are given for 20-place vehicles, 15 km/h top speed, and 1 000 s waiting time CTS. All the R 2 coefficients are higher than 0.75 and in most cases than 0.85. Empirical validations, made by comparing pre-design regressions with other system data, showed that the method gives accurate results." .

A new analysis technique is described that produces electricity load profile indicators to help identify potential electricity savings from 81 municipal buildings of six different types: commercial and public offices, libraries and museums, sport centres, schools, community centres and care homes/hostels. This approach is different from conventional energy management analysis techniques since it uses total electricity consumption data in half-hourly periods rather than annual or monthly data. The analysis enabled the detection of buildings with consumption profiles that differ significantly from the typical profile for that building type. This provided a systematic and rapid procedure to identify potential energy saving opportunities in multiple buildings. The new approach introduces a standard statistical technique, independent of energy manager judgement, to help identify energy saving opportunities in buildings." .

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is considered one of the most promising techniques in this field. This study presents the experience of GPR data acquisition, processing, and interpretation in three cities located along the coast of the Red Sea. These cities are Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Sharm El-Sheikh and Qusier in Egypt. Data acquisition parameters varied in the three cities based on site conditions, target characteristics, and equipment availability. The processing flows were kept simple to avoid introducing artifacts to the collected data. The results show that despite the difference in site conditions and survey parameters among the three cities, with the exception of fiber optic cable, GPR technique is capable of detecting different kinds of underground utilities and precisely determine the extension, diameter, and depth of burial of these utilities." .

This changing concept has prompted a subsequent re-evaluation of what constitutes the outstanding universal values of World Heritage sites and the operational methods for implementing the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. The scope has broadened from studying a single monument in isolation to one that values a multidimensional, multiregional, and inter-disciplinary approach and encapsulates vast spans of human history. Within this broader view, landslides and more generally slope instabilities are an important factor endangering cultural heritage sites, especially prehistoric sites, earth/rock monuments, and archaeological sites affected by environmental processes and degradation. Natural and cultural heritage sites, as well as cultural landscapes, are then tied into a common framework that the Geological Society of America has defined “Men’s legacy to Earth and Earth’s legacy to Man”. On the other hand, not too much effort has been expended in the past to develop conservation policies systematically integrating geological, geomorphological, and engineering geological aspects into daily practices. The purpose of the “LAndslides and CUltural & Natural HEritage” thematic Network (LACUNHEN) is to create a platform for scientists and practitioners who are ready to jointly contribute to safeguarding relevant endangered Natural and Cultural Heritage sites (e.g., Machu Picchu). They will share and disseminate their respective experience, demonstrating how these special “objects” require approaches, techniques, and solutions that go far beyond traditional civil engineering perspectives." .

The whole-building energy simulation program EnergyPlus v6.0 is coupled with GenOpt v3.0 generic optimization tool to automatically compute the optimal values of thermal insulation thicknesses for external walls and roofs in addition to glazing unit types for vertical fenestration. A life cycle cost (LCC) model is implemented within the GenOpt program for the objective function evaluation using simulation outputs pertaining to energy consumption and associated utility costs. A stochastic population-based and multi-dimensional optimization technique of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized for searching the parameter space. This algorithm can result in a 36.2% reduction in the computational effort to converge to the global minimum point with a very high degree of accuracy compared to the full enumeration technique. The results indicate that the annual total site energy consumption of the optimized building model is reduced by 33.3% with respect to the initial baseline case. The optimized envelope parameters can yield 28.7% life cycle cost reduction over a 25 years life span with a simple pay-back period of 4.2 years." .

This is because in dense areas, public transport is organised more efficiently and travellers tend to travel shorter distances. However, this assertion is frequently based on locations with efficient integration of transport within the land use planning framework. In Ghana and many African countries, it remains unknown whether the effect of land use on urban travel is strong as reported in developed countries and elsewhere. This research examines the effect of land use on urban travel in Ghana using Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana, as a case study. Simple questionnaire survey with urban residents, semi-structured interviews with agencies and secondary data analysis were used for this research. Results indicate negative effect of land use on urban travel as there has been increased congestion in all the major road arterials in the city resulting in difficulty in commuting using motorised transport. Findings further show a weak effect of land use on urban travel, as areas experiencing change of land use have poor locational accessibility. The paper recommends innovative ways of meeting the growing travel demand of residents in the city such as the development of a light rail and bus rapid transit systems to help ease congestion and improve public transportation." .

Function is a widely accepted foundational concept for design activities, and while affordances have the potential to be a more broadly applicable, little work has been done to show how this new approach can be reconciled with more familiar design modeling practices. In this paper, affordances are shown to provide an alternative means for linking intentional and physical design descriptions across the product life cycle. This approach involves a renewed engagement with the affordance ontology of ecological psychology, which is compared, contrasted, and integrated with function theory. This integrated perspective is used to shine light on the possibilities and limitations of affordance-based design reasoning and to construct a representational hierarchy for use in the design process. This work demonstrates the robustness of the ecological perspective in design scenarios and highlights ways in which function- and affordance-based design processes can be integrated while retaining the strengths of both. The outcome of this integration is a stronger representational and reasoning framework for early-stage design that supports instead of supplants traditional methods of engineering design." .

If free to do so, people adjust their clothing or available building controls (windows, blinds, doors, fans, and thermostats) with the aim of achieving or restoring comfort and reducing discomfort. Initially responses to thermal conditions are considered. Trigger temperatures are established where responses to warm or cold thermal discomfort may occur. These trigger-temperatures depend on (among other things) clothing (which may depend on season and social conditions) and air movement (e.g., fan setting). Trigger-temperatures differ from person to person and from time to time. If several controls are available people will use those that are most user-friendly, effective and free from undesirable consequences, and this is represented in the model by a constraint assigned to each control option. The concept of constraints is then expanded to capture non-thermal stimuli for control use (e.g., fresh-air). Using datasets from surveys in Europe and Pakistan, estimates are made of the parameters used in the model: the comfort temperature in relation to the prevailing outdoor temperature, the extent of inter-personal variation of trigger temperature, the effect of a fan on the comfort temperature, and the values of constraints that affect the use of windows and fans in the surveyed buildings. The incorporation of the new model, including constraints, into building simulation code is illustrated. Some limitations or unknowns in the current model are identified and possible approaches for future research to fill these gaps suggested. The application of the model in building performance analysis and building design is discussed." .

The old world with its modernist assumptions was based on increasing consumption of fossil fuels and other resources, reducing the natural and the diverse to simple, American-style mass production, with a strong state-based, large-scale approach to providing infrastructure. That old way no longer works but no way forward is obviously apparent. This paper looks at how the uncertainties produced by post-modernism can be put to advantage in providing a more sustainable postmodern city. It is suggested that the key principles are recognizing values, maximizing diversity and crossing boundaries. These are developed into some guidelines for urban planning and transport practice." .

Cartographic generalization aims to represent geographical information on a map whose specifications are different from those of the original database. Generalization often implies scale reduction, which generates legibility problems. To be readable at smaller scale, geographical objects often need to be enlarged, which generates problems of overlapping features or map congestion. To manage this problem with respect to buildings, we present a method of selection based on the typification principle that creates a result with fewer objects, but preserves the initial pattern of distribution. For this we use a graph of proximity on the building set, which is analysed and segmented with respect to various criteria, taken from gestalt theory. This analysis provides geographical information that is attached to each group of buildings such as the mean size of buildings, shape of the group, and density. This information is independent of scale. The information from the analysis stage is used to define methods to represent them at the target scale. The aim is to preserve the pattern as far as possible, preserve similarities and differences between the groups with regard to density, size and orientation of buildings. We present some results that have been obtained using the platform Stratège, developed in the COGIT laboratory at the Institut Géographique National, Paris." .

Housing consisted of outside lots with access to overhead shelter, outside lots with no overhead shelter and a cold confinement building. Ad libitum corn, 2.27 kg of 35% dry matter whole plant sorghum silage and 0.68 kg of a 61% protein-vitamin-mineral supplement was offered. Feed that was not consumed was measured to determine feed intake. The temperature data were recorded by hygro-thermographs. Hourly temperatures and humidity were used to develop weather variables. Regression analysis was used and weather variables were regressed on dry matter intake (DMI). When addition of a new variable did not improve R 2 more than one unit, then the number of variables in the model was truncated. Cattle in confinement had lower DMI than those in open lots and those in open lots with access to an overhead shelter (P < 0.05). Cattle in outside lots with access to overhead shelter had similar DMI compared to those in open lots (P = 0.065). Effect of heat was predominantly displayed in August in the three housing systems. In terms of explaining variation in DMI, in outside lots with access to overhead shelter, average and daytime temperatures were important factors, whereas in open lots, nocturnal, peak and average temperatures were important factors. In confinement buildings, the previous day’s temperature and humidity index were the most important factors explaining variation in DMI. Results show the effect of housing and weather variables on DMI in summer and when considering these results, cattle producers wishing to improve cattle feedlot performance should consider housing conditions providing less stress or more comfort." .

In particular, the energy demand for cooling in the residential sector is increasing due to the large occupancy floor area and high usage of air conditioning. Minimizing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions is one of the highest priority goals set for national energy management strategies in developed countries including Canada. In this study, a framework based on the life cycle assessment approach is developed to assess the environmental impacts of different building cooling systems, namely conventional snow storage system, watertight snow storage system, high-density snow storage system, and the conventional chiller cooling system. Moreover, all these systems have varying energy requirements and associated environmental impacts during different phases (extraction and construction, utilization, and end of life) of the life cycle of a building. A low-rise residential building in Kelowna (BC, Canada) has been selected for the pragmatic application of the proposed framework. The annual cooling energy demand for the building is estimated for different phases. Subsequently, the life cycle impact assessment has been carried out using SimaPro 8.1 software and TRACI 2.1 method. For sustainability evaluation of different cooling systems over their life cycle, multi-criteria decision analysis has been employed using the ‘Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE II).’ The results showed that the snow storage systems tend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and associated environmental impacts more than the conventional system." .

However, the handling of communication with users in building projects has been insufficiently specified and studied. Drawing on a study of user involvement in building project design, production, and management, this paper examines user involvement in Swedish residential projects. To map current perceptions and approaches, building industry actors met in four focus groups. Group participants were asked to reflect on the definition of users, communication handling, how information from users is used, and challenges and opportunities in user involvement. Our initial emphasis was front-end activities, but focus group results revealed that user involvement was a continuous process extending from project initiation to evaluating the finished project as a basis for future projects. Discussions indicated confusion about who constituted users in various situations but, regardless of level of experience, focus group participants agreed on the importance and potential of user involvement and on the need for specific methods to acquire useful input." .

The fire in the first villa developed significantly faster than the fire fighters could handle and the fire quickly spread to other structures. In addition to 36 modern buildings, 4 historic buildings in Gamle Lærdalsøyri cultural heritage area were lost. Heroic effort of local and neighbor community fire brigades, police, military forces and volunteers prevented the fire from destroying the whole village, including the remaining 157 historic buildings. Adiabatically heated (low humidity) air from surrounding high mountains gave outdoor wood fuel moisture content (FMC) of about 7.6%. Inside inhabited buildings, it is shown that the wooden products reached about 4.5% FMC prior to the blaze. When ignited, this resulted in rapid fire development. Two story villas burned down in less than 1 h while producing much embers and firebrands. Strong shifting winds subsequently spread the fire to neighbor houses by flame contact (periodically 20 m long horizontal flames) and over long distances (200 m) by embers and firebrands. Based on the present work, an increased fire risk associated with low FMC in inhabited wooden houses during winter time can be predicted. This is of value when considering measures to reduce the probability of a fire outbreak as well as measures mitigating the escalation of a potential fire." .

The damage to buildings includes many uncertainty factors, such as the occurrence of rockfall, runout trajectory, and impact energy. A uncertainty method was used to assess the probability of rockfall impacting buildings. The process includes four steps: (A) Calculating the probability of rockfall occurrence. (B) Probability analysis of the rockfall reaching the building and its energy. (C) Calculation of the building’s vulnerability to rockfall impact. (D) Probability assessment of the building collapse. (E) Design options for protecting the building from rockfall damage. The method is applied in an abandoned limestone quarry in Fengshan, southwestern China. The results indicate that rockfalls have two kinds of failure modes: slide and topple, whose failure probability is 0–0.488 in the different quarry zones. The probabilities of three buildings located at the bottom of the quarry of collapsing from rockfall impact are 0.188, 0.006, and 0.002. A rockfall platform and vegetation planting at the bottom of the quarry could prevent rockfall from reaching the buildings." .

Secondly, we show that, if a duality θ never maps a chamber to an opposite chamber, then it is a symplectic polarity. The latter completes the programme for dualities of buildings of type E 6 of determining all domestic automorphisms of spherical buildings, and it also shows that symplectic polarities are the only polarities in buildings of type E 6 for which the Phan geometry is empty." .

These buildings not only display the richness of the Australian culture, but also capture the architectural and historical values of its past. Although many of these buildings still appear to be strong and sound, many signs of deterioration have been detected in recent years. Conservators from various disciplines such as science, architecture and engineering are working closely together to develop suitable solutions to stop or at least slow down the degradation process of these precious buildings. This study demonstrates the usefulness of thermal analysis in determining the weathering mechanisms of marble and sandstone taken from two of Sydney’s landmarks, the Captain Arthur Phillips Monument at Sydney’s Botanic Gardens and Sydney’s St Mary’s Cathedral. This paper reports the findings of the weathering behaviours of both marble and sandstone samples determined using thermal analysis techniques." .

Next we recall the construction of the affine building associated to a discrete valuation on the rational function field ℂ(z). Then we describe the same building in terms of complex Laurent polynomials, and introduce the Veronese representation, which is an equivariant embedding of the building into an affine Kac–Moody algebra. Next, we introduce topological twin buildings. These buildings can be used for a proof which is a variant of the proof by Quillen and Mitchell, of Bott periodicity which uses only topological geometry. At the end we indicate very briefly that the whole process works also for affine real almost split Kac–Moody groups." .

Policymakers in general and urban economists in particular have paid little attention to public transport system pricing leading to the absence of a financially viable, self-supporting urban transport system. In this paper, we report a partial equilibrium model developed by us, which captures transport tax reforms in the presence of certain transport externalities. Our theoretical model shows that the question of public transport subsidies to reduce congestion and provide quality transport services depends on three factors: (a) the extent to which such subsidies induce people to switch from private transport to public transport; (b) if the price elasticity of current users of public transport is higher, there may be a sharp rise in public transport ridership as a reaction to increased subsidies, which will have an undesirable effect; and (c) there is the danger that subsidies will cause a loss in productive efficiency. The numerical model of our paper for Delhi shows that the cross price elasticity of public transport demand with respect to the price of private transport is significant (0.63) in the off-peak period whereas the same in the peak period is somewhat low (0.16) and the combined effect of these elasticities will result in a considerable modal shift in favour of bus transport demand (19%) if the price of public transport were to be subsidized and private transport were to be priced optimally. Even without subsidy, the modal shift will be significant (18%), if the under-priced private transport modes are optimally priced keeping the current bus prices constant. This paper shows that there will be significant welfare gains in both these scenarios." .

An insulating envelope is a configuration of a set of rectangular panels that respects a set of limitations. Due to the number of façades to be renovated and the number of possible configurations for a single façade, the envelope configuration is both a mass customization problem as well as a combinatorial one. The paper then introduces a decision support system based on the framework of constraint satisfaction, as it fits neatly the constrained nature of the problem. Two configuration tasks have been identified as prerequisite to envelopes configurations: (1) the configuration of a questionnaire for information inputs and (2) the configuration of a constraint satisfaction problem for each one of the façades to be renovated. The system architecture promotes maintenance, modularity and efficiency as different configuration tasks are divided into web-services. Conception and implementation of the massive building thermal renovation are then supported." .

Data from official statistics on building activity in Germany for 2014 and the period from 2010 to 2014 were evaluated in the analysis, and interviews with expert architects and planners were conducted. The goal of the study is to explore the market opportunities of TCC. The experts who were questioned consider TCC as the key to opening the market for types of buildings in which timber construction has had limited application until now (multi-family houses and residential-like/multi-story non-residential buildings). Possible market potentials are calculated with the aid of a scenario which can also be adapted in the context of individual scenarios based on the given data. The study makes it clear that TCC is not only to be evaluated technologically (R + D, standards etc.); market development depends at least as much on soft (social) factors. In part, this concerns the identity of timber construction itself, which must deconstruct the mindsets that have formed over decades in the wood-based sector and are communicated in marketing. At the same time, a co-operation between concrete and timber constructors becomes necessary, which experts call a “clash of cultures.”" .

It also backgrounds traditional transit in metropolitan areas of the United States and outlines its deficiencies in terms of today's urban sprawl and in terms of today's society in metropolitan areas. Urban sprawl has developed city-like areas around big cities, but with lower population densities. Highways and roads were built. Cars were mass-produced. These new populations have never had an alternative to the private car. Today's society includes an ever-increasing number of senior citizens and handicapped persons. Senior citizens find it difficult to get to fixed-route bus stops; handicapped persons have difficulty in boarding regular buses and wheelchair persons cannot even get on board. Particular emphasis is placed upon the examination of the development of demand-responsive transit in metropolitan Rochester, U.S.A. and a Demonstration Project, sponsored by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration of the United States Department of Transportation. The paper also examines and makes reference to the results of integrated transit in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. The Demonstration Project has several key objectives, the principal one of which is the integration of demand-responsive transit with the fixed-route element of traditional transit. Other important objectives of the demonstration are the balancing of peak and off-peak service so as to improve the overall utilization of resources, increase transit coverage, regular (not special) service for the elderly and the handicapped, the utilization of a computer in dispatching, digital communications, and marketing and promotional techniques." .

In the detailed construction documentation design phase of construction projects with teams comprising multiple independent designers, slow and interrupted information flows lead to significant waste. Applying lean principles, such as reducing batch sizes, cycle times and work in progress inventories, to the management of information flows may improve processes and reduce waste in this phase of the design process, but the lack of a method for measuring the volume, rate and effectiveness of information flow is an obstacle to research. This study proposes measuring the flow of information in the process of detailed design where construction documents are prepared. Measures and indices of flow were formulated based on examination of empirical data compiled by monitoring flows of design information in the detailed design stage of each of fourteen construction projects. Data describing the flows was drawn from the database logs created through practitioners’ use of a project extranet service. Indices for identifying information flow bottlenecks, large batch sizes and accumulation of work in process were computed and validated for four of the projects by comparing them with the results of independent observations of design coordination meetings. An index for measuring rework was also computed but could not be validated. The indices and information flow graphs are intended to assist in identifying faults or bottlenecks in the process either as they happen or in retrospective study, indicating disruptions in the information flow. As such, they are important tools for research of engineering design and may be of practical use in design management if incorporated in future online design management tools." .

The individual management of energy, through such devices, make users more responsible and also stimulates them to implement energy retrofit interventions in their flats. The use of individual metering systems in existing apartments, however, could have some critical aspects. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the application of individual energy systems in existing collective-ownership residential buildings, highlighting the critical aspects and providing practical solutions to overcome them. A study has been made of an individual metering application in an existing residential block of flats located in Milan (Italy) with poor thermal insulation between the various dwellings themselves and for the outside walls of the building. Although a net reduction of 50.4 % in the global costs for winter heating, obtained exclusively through plant-modification works, represents an optimum goal for energy savings, the study highlight some critical aspects. The savings for different apartments differ greatly and depend upon the criteria chosen for burden sharing. This study shows that the phenomenon of “heat theft” can prove to be important and provides the possibility of reducing to zero the quota of expenses from consumption whilst still benefiting from comfortable temperatures. Once the problems have been identified, the paper then proposes solutions to overcome them through a revision of the criteria for the allocation of energy costs." .

Respondents intercepted at four cultural monuments provided information on their visitation patterns, experience at the site, perception of the state of conservation of the monuments, and rating of the quality of the services and infrastructure. We combine actual trips with stated trips under hypothetical programs that would enhance the conservation of the monuments and improve one of (i) the cultural experience at the site, (ii) the quality of the infrastructure, or (iii) the quality of the services, and use the combined actual and stated trips to fit a panel data model. Our study is one of the few applications of the TCM to value cultural heritage sites. Our investigation shows that (i) significant use values are associated with the four study monuments, and (ii) conservation programs and initiatives that improve the cultural experience, or simply make it easier for the respondent to reach and spend time at the monument, are valued by domestic visitors and would encourage higher visitation rates. Actual and intended trips reported by the respondents exhibit good construct validity, in the sense that they are well predicted by price, location, hypothetical scenario and other individual characteristics of the respondents." .

Especially in office buildings, where internal heat loads and a relatively high occupant density occur at the same time with solar heat gains, overheating has become a common problem. In Europe the adaptive thermal comfort model according to EN 15251 provides a method to evaluate thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings. However, especially in the context of the climate change and the occurrence of heat waves within the last decade, the question arises, how thermal comfort can be maintained without additional cooling, especially in warm climates. In this paper a parametric study for a typical cellular naturally ventilated office room has been conducted, using the building simulation software EnergyPlus. It is based on the Mediterranean climate of Athens, Greece. Adaptive thermal comfort is evaluated according to EN 15251. Variations refer to different building design priorities, and they consider the variability of occupant behaviour and internal heat loads by using an ideal and worst case scenario. The influence of heat waves is considered by comparing measured temperatures for an average and an exceptionally hot year within the last decade. Since the use of building controls for shading affects thermal as well as visual comfort, daylighting and view are evaluated as well. Conclusions are drawn regarding the influence and interaction of building design, occupants and heat waves on comfort and greenhouse gas emissions in naturally ventilated offices, and related optimisation potential." .

This is mainly due to lack of understanding of the dynamic nature of construction system. However, very little attention has been given to its significant importance and few empirical studies have been undertaken on this issue. This paper, therefore, analyzes the effect of aggressive scheduling, overtime, resource adding, and schedule slippage on construction performance, focusing on workers’ reactions to those scheduling decisions. Survey data from 102 construction practitioners in 38 construction sites are used for the analysis. The results indicate that efforts to increase work rate by working overtime, resource adding, and aggressive scheduling can be offset due to losses in productivity and quality. Based on the research findings, practical guidelines are then discussed to help site managers to effectively deal with the dynamics of scheduling and improve construction performance." .

Since so many of their other features are similar, such as their population, their household structure, their employment structure, their household incomes, their car ownership levels, their public transport systems, their road networks, this separating characteristic allows a good test of some of the current theories about the relation of travel to land use, and about the influence of travel on the expansion of cities and especially about the changing relation between the central city, the inner core and the outer ring. In order to show more clearly the nature of the similarities and differences, the available data for London and Paris are presented in rings by distance from the centre, using the smallest available analysis units for each data set with the appropriate geographical coding and allocating to 2 km wide bands. This avoids all the problems caused by arbitrary political units. Analyses are presented to justify the contention that many of their features are similar, as noted above, with the notable exception of density. Paris may, in fact, be characterised as having a population distribution equivalent to that of London forty years earlier, though, because Paris is now expanding faster than London was then, this time lag is diminishing. The daily travel patterns of the inhabitants are then presented, using the same distance from centre basis, using both distance travelled and time taken, and separating travellers according to the modes or mode combinations used in the course of a day. These patterns are taken from the various travel surveys which, with the 1981 surveys, now span up to 20 years. The contrast between the traditional land use transport model philosophy, as embodied in the models operated by both city administrations, and as represented in the continuous space, monocentric, radially symmetric conception of the city in Angel and Hyman's model, and the philosophy of Zahavi with his emphasis on time and money budgets as the starting point of such modelling is discussed in the context of the results presented. Some comments on the possible ways this might help to illuminate the question of the expansion of cities are given." .

Empirical theory is a type of “middle-range theory” (following Robert Merton): sets of concepts and methods that are less abstract, and have greater empirical content, than high-level social theory. The categories of theory reviewed here include environment-behavior theory, architectural communication theory, space syntax, urban morphology, reception theory, generative planning theory, normative theory, and city size theory. Most of these approaches originated in the fields of architecture, planning, and geography, and they directly link the urban-built environment to the actions of people within cities." .

In fact, it is well known that the indoor environmental quality (IEQ), considering both thermal and indoor air quality aspects, has a primary impact not only on the perceived human comfort, but also on the building energy consumption. This issue is clearly expressed by the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2002/92/EC, together with the most recent 2010/31/EU, which underlines that the expression of a judgment about the energy consumption of a building should be always joint with the corresponding indoor environmental quality level required by occupants. To this aim, the concept of indoor environment categories has been introduced in the EN 15251 standard. These categories range from I to III, where category I refers to the highest level of indoor climate requirement. In the challenge of reducing the environmental impact for air conditioning in buildings, it is essential that IEQ requirements are relaxed in order to widen the variations of the temperature ranges and ventilation air flow rates. In this paper, by means of building energy simulation, the heating and cooling energy demand are calculated for a mechanically controlled office building where different indoor environmental quality levels are required, ranging from category I to category III of EN 15251. The building is located in different European cities (Moscow, Torino and Athens), characterized by significantly different wheatear conditions. The mutual relation between heating and cooling energy demand and the required levels of IEQ is highlighted. The simulations are performed on a typical office room which is adopted as a reference in validation tests of the European Standard EN 15265 to validate calculation procedures of energy use for space heating and cooling." .

Although there are a number of important differences between Japan and the United Kingdom — such as the degree of urbanisation, level of car ownership, the responsibilities of government organisations and the existence of private railways in Japan — there are many similarities in the role that public transport plays and the factors which influence the efficiency of public transport. The success or otherwise of the developments in urban public transport systems in Japan would seem to have important implications for the design of transport systems in the similarly dense and compact conurbations of the United Kingdom and other European countries." .

It’s a familiar claim that we’re “alienated from nature,” but I argue that what we’re really alienated from is the built environment itself. Typically talk of alienation from nature involves the claim that we fail to acknowledge nature’s otherness, but the built environment is just as other from us as the natural one. And just as we are said to fail to recognize the role of nature as the origin of everything with which we have to do in the world, so too we fail to recognize the role of socially organized human labor in the objects that surround us. Overcoming alienation would require acknowledging the builtness and the sociality of the world we inhabit." .

The emergency activities to protect the C.H. have been developed on two parallel levels: (1) survey and assessment of damages, (2) implementation of temporary safety measures. The organization of the emergency actions was managed by a centralized structure, the so called Function 15 “Protection of Cultural Heritage”, that coordinated the surveys of protected buildings and the design and implementation of temporary safety measures. This allowed the cooperation among different involved subjects (Ministry of Cultural Heritage officers, experts on structural engineering, architects and historians from Universities and private offices and fire brigade teams). The first level of the operating process was carried out on site by expert teams filling up dedicated survey forms for churches and palaces, developed by the Civil Protection Group GLABEC (a Working group for Cultural Heritage); the forms were based on the standardization of damage survey allowing for its immediate interpretation. The second level was based on the past experience in the field of temporary safety measures; the idea was to provide a technical and scientific support in order to assist the work of fire brigade, highly experienced professionals in the “emergency” field. After the first emergency phase the damages of the most important buildings were more carefully investigated and the possible damage progression constantly monitored. The paper presents the case of the Spanish Fortress in L’Aquila, severely damaged by the earthquake; the description concerns the definition of the damages and the interpretation of the activated collapse mechanisms. Finally the design of the provisional strengthening interventions and the on site diagnostic investigations are presented." .

Field surveys were conducted in ten kitchens of rural western India, which were then modelled and simulated for dynamic indoor airflow network analysis. The simulated results were statistically clustered using principal component analysis and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, to construct a cumulative built environment parameter called ‘Built Factor’ for each kitchen, and subsequently a derivative matrix was developed. Categorization of better performing kitchens from this derivative matrix enabled in deriving the built parameter thresholds for a ‘better’ kitchen design. This derived kitchen showed 60 % reduction in PM2.5 peak concentration during cooking hours. The evaluation described here is essentially a “proof of concept”, that effective building design can be an alternative way to reduce HAP without the introduction of chimneys, improved cookstoves or shifting to cleaner fuel." .

This solutionaugments the conventional single-chip BIST approach, which is used to produce individual good dies, to an effective multi-chip BIST solution. The multi-chip BIST puts the entire module in a self-test mode. The self-test mode not only provides effective detection of static and dynamic faults, but also identifies the failed elements, i.e., bad dies or substrate. The multi-chip self-test scheme is based on pseudo-random test generation and uses multi-signature evaluation. The hardware design ofmulti-chip and single-chip self-test blocks is combined under one common architecture called the Dual BIST Architecture.

This study reports a field experiment involving simultaneous physical measurements and a questionnaire survey, collecting data from 2,129 respondents, that evaluated thermal comfort in short- and long-haul buses and trains. Experimental results indicate that high air temperature, strong solar radiation, and low air movement explain why passengers feel thermally uncomfortable. The overall insulation of clothing worn by passengers and thermal adaptive behaviour in vehicles differ from those in their living and working spaces. Passengers in short-haul vehicles habitually adjust the air outlets to increase thermal comfort, while passengers in long-haul vehicles prefer to draw the drapes to reduce discomfort from extended exposure to solar radiation. The neutral temperatures for short- and long-haul vehicles are 26.2°C and 27.4°C, while the comfort zones are 22.4–28.9°C and 22.4–30.1°C, respectively. The results of this study provide a valuable reference for practitioners involved in determining the adequate control and management of in-vehicle thermal environments, as well as facilitating design of buses and trains, ultimately contributing to efforts to achieve a balance between the thermal comfort satisfaction of passengers and energy conserving measures for air-conditioning in mass transportation vehicles." .

This human-dominated organism degrades natural habitats, simplifies species composition, disrupts hydrological systems and modifies energy flow and nutrient cycling. Sustainable urban development (SUD) is seen as a panacea to minimise these externalities caused by widespread human activities on the environment. The concept of SUD has been around over a considerably long time as the need to adopt environmentally sustainable behaviours made the international community commit to it. However, to date such development has not been achieved in large scales anywhere around the globe. This review paper aims to look at the SUD concept from the lens of planning and development integration to generate new insights and directions. The paper reports the outcome of the review of the literature on planning and development approaches—i.e. urban planning, ecological planning, urban development, SUD—and proposes a new process to support the efforts for achieving SUD—i.e. integrated urban planning and development process. The findings of this review paper highlight that adopting such holistic planning and development process generate a potential to further support the progress towards achieving sustainability agendas of our cities." .

We investigated area use of semidomesticated reindeer in the Essand reindeer district’s summer range (Norway) in connection with a new 420 kV power line built in 2008/2009 to replace an existing 300 kV line. We used 6 years (2008–2013) of GPS telemetry data from 5 to 22 female reindeer per season. During the construction period compared to the period before and after construction, predicted probability of use decreased on average 10 % within areas 6 km from the central infrastructure for the calving period, about 12 % within 3.5 km in summer and close to 13 % within 3.5 km in autumn. In the calving period prior to construction, as well as the calving period, summer and autumn for the years after construction, use of areas close to the infrastructure did not deviate from random. Resource selection functions showed significant effects of construction work, habitat quality, elevation and aspect on the area use of reindeer. We found no support for the hypothesis that power lines have negative effects on reindeer area use, independent of associated human activity during construction. Mitigation measures should focus on both the construction period of power lines, minimizing construction work when adjacent areas are utilized by reindeer, as well as keeping human activity to a minimum during operative years." .

Theoverall aim was to obtain more empirical andtheoretical knowledge about the connectionbetween physical urban planning and householdconsumption. This knowledge provides a platformfor discussing principles and practices forsustainable urban development. This project was based on two main assumptions.First, it was suggested that the significantand increasing environmental damage due toprivate household consumption presents a majorchallenge in achieving sustainable development.Second, a large part of this consumption appears to be influenced by our physical livingsituation, i.e., the way we design and locateour houses. This also applies to energy use forheating and technical appliances, transport,and even to the considerable amount ofequipment that is needed for householdoperation, redecoration and maintenance. Withrespect to transport, the study team includedboth everyday travel and leisure-time journeysin this research. While everyday trips such astravelling to work, shopping and taking thechildren to school are strongly influenced bythe living situation of the household, thismight also be true for leisure-time travel. Based on two large surveys in the Norwegiantowns of Greater Oslo and Førde, the studyteam collected data on housing-relatedconsumption from 537 households. Ecological Footprinting was then used asan analytical tool to analyse the environmentalconsequences of this consumption. Theseecological footprint analyses suggest thatsustainable urban development points towardsdecentralized concentration, i.e.,relatively small cities with a high density andshort distances between the houses andpublic/private services." .

A passive integrating radon and thoron discriminative monitor was used in the survey. The annual mean radon concentration was 22±14 Bq . m-3, and ranged from 12 to 93 Bq . m-3 among the 56 surveyed rooms. Radon concentration in offices was generally higher than that in the dwellings, with the arithmetic averages of 29 and 17 Bq . m-3, respectively. Radon concentrations were generally lower in the traditional Japanese wooden houses than those houses built with other building materials. Seasonal variation of indoor radon was also observed in this survey. Compared to summer and autumn, radon concentrations were generally higher in spring and winter. The mean value of thoron to radon ratio was estimated to be 1.3, higher values were observed in the dwellings than in the offices. The annual effective dose from the exposure to indoor radon was estimated to be 0.47 mSv after taking the occupancy factors of offices and dwellings into account." .

However, the nature of the long-range planning procedure that is required is substantively different from that of most extant approaches. Some of the specific requirements and capabilities of a new procedure are described, and existing procedures are compared against these. In the latter part of the paper, some of the elements of a new long-range planning procedure are characterized. It is suggested that the procedure be built around a scenario approach to confronting and bounding future uncertainty. Second, the need to incor porate financial forecasting in the process is laid out and related to the scenario concept. Third, the need for travel- and impact-forecasting procedures is recognized and a set of input, output and operating requirements for such procedures are specified. It is suggested that improved sketch-planning tools may fit the requirements to a large extent. It is also suggested that some procedures or models in the process should be “synthetic” models, not needing calibration for each new application. Finally, a number of requirements are specified for the display and evaluation of planning proposals from this procedure. A major emphasis is placed here on transparency of the process and responsiveness to direct intervention by the decision-maker." .

Technologies are changing the role of such spaces, allowing a more in-depth knowledge diffusion and social interactions. Static places become dynamic cultural environments in which people can discover and share new knowledge. Nowadays, cultural heritage is approaching to a new digital era in which people become active elements, as recipients of the actions ensuring the sustainability of such heritage, both moneywise but also simply as the perceived quality of life. In this perspective, this paper presents a novel recommender system to individual and people group in order to create a social recommendation service for cultural ICT applications. As key aspect of the presented work, we introduce a method for discovering and exploiting social affinity between users based on artwork features and user experience. In addition, we propose an architecture of the recommender system related with the affinity and discuss the architecture in terms of sparsity, group recommendation, and sustainability." .

These issues lead to increasing interest in environmental impacts of buildings using various building materials and structural systems. Buildings play a significant role in energy consumption and emission production through all phases of their life cycle. Over the last decade, development toward sustainability has become an important issue in building design decisions. The relative contribution of embodied impacts of building materials and constructions has been recognised as being significant, especially for energy-efficient buildings. Life-cycle assessment as a widely used methodology helps make decisions in sustainable building design. The construction details of the foundation, wall and floor are by far the most significant contribution of embodied impacts associated with the construction phase. The goal of this paper is to assess alternative material solutions for the construction details of foundation, wall and floor to support decisions at the design phase of a project. The selection and combination of the materials influences the amount of energy consumption and associated production of emissions during the operation of the building. Therefore, the thermo-physical properties of designed variants of construction details are very significant. This study uses life-cycle analysis with system boundary from cradle to gate and focuses on the embodied energy and equivalent emissions of CO2 and SO2. Methods of multi-criteria decision analysis are used for interpretation of the results." .

Two factors, length of the observed route and observed sequence in which destinations are visited, were used to define temporal heuristics. Further, two spatial heuristics were investigated: the tendency of some pedestrians to choose first the destination farthest away from the point they entered the city center and the tendency of others to choose first the destination closest to their entry point. Empirical analysis demonstrated that only a small proportion of the pedestrians reveals optimal choice behavior." .

Individual comfort votes were averaged for each group and regressed, firstly on estimates of microclimatic warmth, and secondly, in combination with external meteorological parameters. It appeared that thermal comfort was related not only to indoor temperatures, but also to outdoor warmth. The most similar regressions between the sexes, however, contained variables also representing humidity and changes in the external warmth — humidity environment. In particular cool-humid days and changes to warmer-drier weather were related to a decreased need for indoor warmth." .

In medium-, high-, and ultrahigh- head hydraulic facilities, the dam is one of the basic elements that determines their architectural appearance.2.The development of the architectural form of any dam should be subordinate to an expression of the functions satisfied by that dam, while the principal form should express their basic notion of the architecture of any hydraulic facility, the notion of the capture and reorganization of the water element.3.Each type of dam has its own architectural notion and its own architectural value. The basic task of the architect is to develop these values, giving consideration to the interrelationships between the dam and other elements of the ensemble.4.Since contemporary architecture is created not by special architectural components, but by aesthetically intelligent designs of functionally necessary structures and by the equipment required for their operation, the design and construction of all the elements of a dam and its equipment, which are frequented or viewed by man, should come under the architect's careful serutiny." .

The kinematic design of this manipulator was made based on one main criterion, namely, accuracy. Thus, the main issue determining the underlying architecture, defined by its Hartenberg—Denavit (HD) parameters, was the optimization of its kinematic conditioning. This main criterion led not to one set of HD parameters, but rather to a manifold of these sets, which allowed the incorporation of further requirements, such as structural behavior, workspace considerations and functionality properties. These requirements in turn allowed the determination of the link shapes and the selection of actuators. The detailed mechanical design led to heuristic rules that helped in the decision-making process in defining issues such as link sub-assemblies and motor location along the joint axes." .

Optimal subsidy principal-agent models under conditions of asymmetric information and complete information are established, and equivalent models are presented to get the optimal solutions. The results show that from the perspective of policy benefits, subsidy policy is influenced by construction costs, transfer paid by the end-user and developer’s preference toward green buildings. Furthermore, comparisons of models under two conditions demonstrate that eliminating asymmetric information can contribute to more green building areas and fewer unit subsidies. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the model." .

Few known studies, however, have attempted to quantify the benefits of green roofs into monetary values. We use hedonic regression techniques to obtain estimates that apartment rents in buildings with green roofs in the Battery Park City area of New York were about 16% higher on average than in buildings without green roofs. Battery Park City is located in the Upper Bay Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) watershed. If we were to extend the Battery Park City findings to the entire Upper Bay CSO watershed and if all buildings in the CSO watershed were to install green roofs, our results imply that rental receipts in the watershed could increase by as much as approximately $2.1 billion monthly." .

In [2] it was shown that a finite Cn geometry (n ≥4) in which all lines are thick and all C3 residues are either buildings or flat has to be a building. Here we observe that the finiteness assumption of [2] was unnecessary in order to achieve the major part of the result. If we drop the finiteness assumption we can still prove that such a geometry is either a quotient of a building or flat. Flat Cn geometries for n ≥4 are seen to be degenerate in a certain sense. In the finite case with thick lines such degenerate geometries are easily shown not to exist, while finite buildings of type Cn with thick lines do not admit non-trivial quotients (Brouwer and Cohen, [1]). Thus the result of [2] follows as an immediate corollary of this more general case. The result does not hold when we drop the assumption that all lines are thick. In Section 3 we produce some examples of geometries of this type." .

A comparison with steel (guardrail and guard pipe) types was conducted to investigate the GHG emission reduction effect of wooden guardrails. It was shown that the greatest GHG emissions for all types of guardrails occur during the raw material procurement and production process. The amount of total (life cycle) GHG emissions for pressure-injected wooden type no. 3 guardrails (92 % of steel guardrails and 72 % of steel guard pipes) shows that replacing steel with this type of wooden guardrail can reduce GHG emissions. On the other hand, comparison of the GHG emissions for pressure-injected type no. 1 guardrails with steel (175 % of guardrail; 138 % of guard pipe) shows that no reduction is achieved. When the disposed wooden beams (painted type no. 1; painted and pressure-injected type no. 3) are chipped and used for energy as a substitute for Type-A heavy oil, the volume of the GHG emission reduction significantly exceeds the GHG emission volume, and GHG emissions can be reduced by up to a maximum of 117.67 kg-CO2-eq/m." .

The analyses focus on the ways in which participants deal with the relation between formulations of intention and designed objects. Claimed mismatches between stated intention and design make relevant instructional sequences elaborating alternative ways of understanding the design and possible routes by which articulated intentions could have been realized. The practice of topicalizing intentions appears to be a technique by which aspects of architectural competence are made visible and instructed. In particular, the practice makes otherwise unattended aspects of the design process accountably available for assessment and remark. Furthermore, the complexities of architectural consequence in relation to individual design decisions are addressed as an instructional matter. The study expands existing work on intention ascription and avowal by examining a setting where participants deal with the intentional status of designed objects. It is argued that the analyzed assessment sequences are shaped and organized with reference to the particularities of architectural knowledge as well as to the educational character of the activity. Their basic logic, however, is grounded in ordinary understandings of action and intentionality." .

Multi-faceted activity-travel preferences can be accommodated in supernetworks. Using a micro-simulation approach, the adaptation of individuals’ travel patterns to policies can be readily captured.

Recent initiatives have focused on resilient building design, and one approach under consideration is a voluntary resilience certification program for commercial buildings. The intent of this program would be to encourage the adoption of resilient design practices in construction and planning of the buildings. While resilience may be a frequently discussed concept within the security communities, its level of awareness within the construction, design, insurance, and building owner communities is not well known. Given the voluntary nature of the certification program under consideration, program development requires a comprehensive understanding of resilience as defined by the commercial building stakeholders. Toward this end, Sandia National Laboratories conducted a study of stakeholder perspectives on resilience to ascertain factors that would serve as motivation for participation in the resilience certification program. This paper describes how Sandia performed the study and the resulting conclusions. One of the key conclusions that the study found is that the term resilience is unfamiliar to many and inconsistently defined across the industries. Those familiar with the term frequently linked it to sustainability concepts. The study also found that increased participation in the resilience certification program is very likely affected by demonstrable returns on resilience investments and a public–private partnership model for program administration." .

The main aims of this research are (1) to identify useful cultural heritage resources from geotagged social media (more precisely, spatial folksonomy), and (2) to rank them, with respect to the user context (e.g., location). Thus, the smart cultural tourism service can deliver smart interactions between the visitors of smart tourism environments by collecting and analyzing geotagged multimedia data (e.g., photos, tags, and comments) from available social media. In order to evaluate the proposed service, the system has been implemented with the real-world datasets related to cultural heritage sites (e.g., Hue, Hoi An, My Son in Vietnam, and Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Gyeongju in Korea)." .

It has been shown that wood is regarded as the most environmentally-friendly material in building design and construction. ‘Beauty’ and ‘proprietor’ are the most two essential factors identified by professionals that may influence their decisions to use wood, whereas the deconstruction phase and post-use of demolished wood are considered less important. With respect to the wood utilisation in construction, building professionals prefer using wood in the substructure to main structure at present. On the other hand, the differences between professionals’ experience in designing wood houses or wood elements, and their attitudes towards the importance of reasons in using wood are generally insignificant, except for the easy assembly (p = 0.03) and easy disassembly (p = 0.02) of wood construction. Professionals in favour of wood substitution are more likely to choose wood in column, beam, window, outdoor wall and door. Moreover, there are significant differences between professionals’ occupations and their opinions upon the recyclability issues of materials (p = 0.02). In the future, more sufficient communications are required through the design process among various professional groups." .

As it is the case for most of the known optimal EKR-sets in finite buildings, our EKR-sets have a natural center.

Crowdsourcing design imports vast knowledge and produces creative ideas. It publishes design tasks, collects dozens of contributors’ ideas and reward the best. Contributors in crowdsourcing design work individually when generating ideas. However, those who collaborate could make better use of crowd’s knowledge, which might produce ideas of higher quality. By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of crowdsourcing design, this article proposes a collaborative crowdsourcing design method that integrates crowd’s sketching processes. This method uses a tree to arrange crowd’s ideas and enable flexible modifications of prior ideas. A demonstration system named Sketchfans is developed, and the results of a crowdsourcing sketching experiment using this system are presented. The experimental results validate that this method is effective; participants rely heavily on the idea tree for inspiration, and the best ideas appear around the ends of branches on the idea tree. Moreover, participants displayed unique development patterns. They often developed high-quality ideas from initial ideas that were regarded as poor quality. The demonstration system Sketchfans, supports this method well. Finally, we optimize Sketchfans based on analysis of participants’ activities and feedback." .

This study investigates the impact of photovoltaic canopy shade and tree shade on thermal comfort through meteorological observations and field surveys at a pedestrian mall on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus. During the course of 1 year, on selected clear calm days representative of each season, we conducted hourly meteorological transects from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and surveyed 1284 people about their thermal perception, comfort, and preferences. Shade lowered thermal sensation votes by approximately 1 point on a semantic differential 9-point scale, increasing thermal comfort in all seasons except winter. Shade type (tree or solar canopy) did not significantly impact perceived comfort, suggesting that artificial and natural shades are equally efficient in hot dry climates. Globe temperature explained 51 % of the variance in thermal sensation votes and was the only statistically significant meteorological predictor. Important non-meteorological factors included adaptation, thermal comfort vote, thermal preference, gender, season, and time of day. A regression of subjective thermal sensation on physiological equivalent temperature yielded a neutral temperature of 28.6 °C. The acceptable comfort range was 19.1 °C–38.1 °C with a preferred temperature of 20.8 °C. Respondents exposed to above neutral temperature felt more comfortable if they had been in air-conditioning 5 min prior to the survey, indicating a lagged response to outdoor conditions. Our study highlights the importance of active solar access management in hot urban areas to reduce thermal stress." .

They changed within the colonial era, and again during the different influences of French, British or North American domination. Today there can be noticed a decline of the traditional symbolic elements of towns. On the other hand there are certain symptoms of a crisis of self-identity of the Latin Americans.

Cities have long been known to be society’s predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also a main source of pollution and disease. MethodsWe conducted a review around the topic urban and transport planning, environmental exposures and health and describe the findings. ResultsWithin cities there is considerable variation in the levels of environmental exposures such as air pollution, noise, temperature and green space. Emerging evidence suggests that urban and transport planning indicators such as road network, distance to major roads, and traffic density, household density, industry and natural and green space explain a large proportion of the variability. Personal behavior including mobility adds further variability to personal exposures, determines variability in green space and UV exposure, and can provide increased levels of physical activity.Air pollution, noise and temperature have been associated with adverse health effects including increased morbidity and premature mortality, UV and green space with both positive and negative health effects and physical activity with many health benefits. In many cities there is still scope for further improvement in environmental quality through targeted policies. Making cities ‘green and healthy’ goes far beyond simply reducing CO2 emissions. Environmental factors are highly modifiable, and environmental interventions at the community level, such as urban and transport planning, have been shown to be promising and more cost effective than interventions at the individual level. However, the urban environment is a complex interlinked system.Decision-makers need not only better data on the complexity of factors in environmental and developmental processes affecting human health, but also enhanced understanding of the linkages to be able to know at which level to target their actions. New research tools, methods and paradigms such as geographical information systems, smartphones, and other GPS devices, small sensors to measure environmental exposures, remote sensing and the exposome paradigm together with citizens observatories and science and health impact assessment can now provide this information. ConclusionWhile in cities there are often silos of urban planning, mobility and transport, parks and green space, environmental department, (public) health department that do not work together well enough, multi-sectorial approaches are needed to tackle the environmental problems. The city of the future needs to be a green city, a social city, an active city, a healthy city." .

Comparisons between agents are difficult due to a lack of unity between the theories of emotion, tasks of agents and types of action selection utilised. A set of architectural qualities is proposed as a basis for making comparisons between agents. An analysis of existing agent architectures that include an emotion mechanism can help to triangulate design possibilities within the space outlined by these qualities. With this in mind, twelve autonomous agents incorporating an emotion mechanism into action selection are selected for analysis. Each agent is dissected using these architectural qualities (the agent architecture, the action selection mechanism, the emotion mechanism and emotion state representation, along with the emotion model it is based on). This helps to place the agents within an architectural space, highlights contrasting methods of implementing similar theoretical components, and suggests which architectural aspects are important to performance of tasks. An initial framework is introduced, consisting of a series of recommendations for designing emotion mechanisms within artificial agents, based on correlations between emotion roles performed and the aspects of emotion mechanisms used to perform those roles. The conclusion discusses how problems with this type of research can be resolved and to what extent development of a framework can aid future research." .

In order to attract cultural tourism dollars, Maasai communities have established cultural bomas, typically pseudo Maasai villages where they display cultural performances and crafts before tourists. Such cultural contact has resulted in the growing influence of globalization that challenges traditional ways. The economic, social and environmental impact of heritage tourism on intergenerational relationships and community well-being has not been examined among the Maasai people. In this study, focus groups were conducted with different age-groups of Maasai people residing in Esilalei and Oltukai villages. Results suggest that for the Maasai, heritage tourism appears to be a double-edged sword. While tourism results in some trickled down economic benefits for the Maasai community, economic change appears to have created a social distance between generations." .

The study took place during July 2003, at Agricultural University of Athens, Greece. Meteorological and environmental measurements were carried out at six sites. The selected sites differ in regard to sky view factor (SVF) values, environmental configuration and green (vegetation) coverage. The results of this study indicate a striking influence of site configuration on human thermal comfort. For example, in an outdoor lawn area surrounded by trees (green atrium) the PET was greater than 41 °C (human perception of “very hot”) for 13 % of the measurement time, while in an open building atrium (courtyard) PET was greater than 41 °C for 28 % of the time. In addition, ‘comfortable’ conditions as PET quantifies formed during 26 % of the measurement time in green atrium but less than 15 % of the time in the building atrium. Especially during daytime the difference between these two sites reached 8.7 °C according to the PET and 4.3 °C according to the Humidex. At sites with low SVF values and dense green coverage the human biometeorological conditions were improved compared to sites with high SVF values and those with buildings nearby. Significant relationships between SVF and biometeorological indices classes were indicated. The PET index better represented human comfort than Humidex." .

Cultural heritage is an important example, and substantial investments are needed to keep ancient inner cities and characteristic monumental buildings in good shape. The costs of these policies are usually clear, and the benefits are often much more difficult to assess. This paper attempts to fill part of this gap by studying the destination choices of urban recreation trips that have urban recreation as the main travel motive. We estimate a discrete choice model for destination choice that takes into account the potential importance of unobserved characteristics. The model allows us to compute the marginal willingness-to-travel for destinations offering more cultural heritage, which we measure as the area of the inner city that has a protected status because of the cultural heritage that is present there." .

In this paper, I take stock of the effect on subjective well-being in present day Germany. Overall satisfaction with life appears not to be lower in shrinking cities and satisfaction with several domains of life even higher. This is not because inhabitants are unaware of the situation of their city, since they appear to be more concerned about job-chances and crime." .

Among the ten largest cities in the world in terms of population sizes, three are in Southeast Asia alone and more than one in two people will be living in cities in 2025. These primate cities—Metro-Manila in the Philippines, Jakarta in Indonesia and Bangkok in Thailand—are seeing not only rapid rates of in-migration but also rapid expansion and urban sprawl. Such rapid rates of change pose growing challenges to Southeast Asian cities including smaller capital cities like Kuala Lumpur, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore. The strongest challenge concern infrastructural provision and particularly that provided for urban transport and mobility. Urban traffic congestion is an issue that is common to most Southeast Asian cities including Singapore which has introduced relatively draconian policy measures to both contain the level of car ownership and the use of the car. A comparison with several European cities highlight where Southeast Asian cities can review their own urban transport policies. This paper focuses on the lessons that can be learnt from a comparative study of the infrastructural provision and public policies that are in place in Southeast Asian and European cities." .

This issue is important because it will improve the application of thermal indices in predicting the thermal perception of tourists. This study aims to compare the differences in thermal perception and preferences between local and overseas visitors to the Royal Botanic Garden (RBG) in Melbourne during summer. An 8-day survey was conducted in February 2014 at four sites in the garden (n = 2198), including 2 days with maximum temperature exceeding 40 °C. The survey results were compared with data from four weather stations adjacent to the survey locations. One survey location, ‘Fern Gully’, has a misting system and visitors perceived the Fern Gully to be cooler than other survey locations. As the apparent temperature exceeded 32.4 °C, visitors perceived the environment as being ‘warm’ or ‘hot’. At ‘hot’ conditions, 36.8 % of European visitors voted for no change to the thermal conditions, which is considerably higher than the response from Australian visitors (12.2 %) and Chinese visitors (7.5 %). Study results suggest that overseas tourists have different comfort perception and preferences compared to local Australians in hot weather based at least in part on expectations. Understanding the differences in visitors’ thermal perception is important to improve the garden design. It can also lead to better tour planning and marketing to potential visitors from different countries." .

Yet, odours play an important role in our daily lives: they affect us emotionally, psychologically and physically, and influence the way we engage with history. Can this lead us to consider certain smells as cultural heritage? And if so, what would be the processes for the identification, protection and conservation of those heritage smells? In order to answer these questions, the connection between olfaction and heritage was approached in three ways: (1) through theoretical analysis of the concept and role of olfaction in heritage guidelines, leading to identification of places and practices where smell is fundamental to their identity, (2) through exploration of the evidence for use of smells in heritage as a tool to communicate with audiences; and (3) through experimental evaluation of the techniques and methods for analysing and archiving the smells, therefore enabling their documentation and preservation. We present this through the framework of Significance Assessment—Chemical Analysis—Sensory Analysis—Archiving. The smell of historic paper was chosen as the case study, based on its well-recognized cultural significance and available research. Odour characterization was achieved by collecting visitor descriptions of a historic book extract through a survey, and by conducting a sensory evaluation at a historic library. These were combined with the chemical information on the VOCs sampled from both a historic book and a historic library, to create the Historic Book Odour Wheel, a novel documentation tool representing the first step towards documenting and archiving historic smells." .

We therefore explore the potential role of norms and awareness of problems caused by excessive car traffic for car purchase and mode choice decisions. With a sample of 465 responses collected via an online survey in Shanghai, our study suggests that the perception of “everyone around me is using public transport” (descriptive norms) is negatively correlated with car ownership. More importantly, we find that expectation of important others (subjective social norms) and internalized responsibility to use greener transport (personal norms activated by social problem awareness) stimulate the intention to use public transport and increase actual public transport usage. We further find that income does not influence public transport usage intentions or the actual modal choice directly but only via car ownership as mediating factor. We discuss that our findings support regulations to limit private car ownership and use but also to utilize “soft policy measures” in order to achieve a voluntary shift towards more sustainable travel behavior in Shanghai." .

The strip of land, with an area of 22.5 sq. km, is 17 km long and has an average width of 1.3 km. It has a population of approximately one million and provides over 700,000 jobs. Despite its small size, it accommodates the CBD, residential districts, shopping complexes as well as most of the civic/institutional facilities that a city needs. Its urban form is linear not by design but by default – the topography of the area has constrained the development from spreading sideways. Surprisingly however, apart from economy in land utilization, it is considered to possess three other good qualities: high accessibility enjoyed by residents; few roads and commercially viable public transport. Its travel characteristics are analyzed, using results of a home interview survey conducted by the Government in 1992. In addition, various statistics published by the Government and public transport authorities are also used in the analysis." .

This paper tests and supports the latter claim through application of a number of binomial logistic regression models, controlling for socioeconomic, household composition, location and service level factors. Analysis draws from over 10,000 home-based work and school commute trips from each of Montreal’s 1998, 2003, and 2008 origin-destination surveys. One large factor in Montreal’s increased youth public transport usage has been the 1997 introduction of graduated driver’s licensing, which appears to have a substantial lasting licensure damper effect only on men. Controlling for effects of variables other than survey period and age group or birth cohort, recent young age groups show higher public transport use than did their predecessors. Moreover, a plateauing of public transport mode share within birth cohorts is seen to begin earlier in life than expected. This suggests not only continuance of higher than previous transit use, but also further potential for mode share improvements if challenges from lifecycle changes, such as school-to-work transition, can be identified and addressed." .

By comparing the middle and low-income group who mainly use public transit and higher income group who mainly travel by car, results show an accessibility gap for different modes of transportation as travel by public transit takes nearly double the amount of time as travel by car. While commuting time is closely linked to the location of the provided affordable housing, it is also dependent on the quality of local public transit service. Areas with substantial travel time differences between public transit and car travel reveal the weaknesses of public transit provision. Furthermore, average commuting time by both public transit and car from areas of affordable housing built after 2004 is much longer than that from previously built areas implying that low-income groups are being driven to more disadvantaged locations with time changes. In contrast to the classical job-housing mismatch hypothesis in U.S. cities, the mismatch model in Chinese cities is that while major job opportunities are still concentrated in the central city, affordable housing residents who rely on urban metro and bus are being moved further afield into distant suburban areas. The paper will provide the implication for affordable housing and transportation planning in Chinese cities in the future. Improving job accessibility by further establishment of urban metro system for this demographic will promote the urban economy and provide social welfare for the disadvantaged." .

This paper uses semi-structured interviews and agency consultations to supplement document reviews and news paper articles to address the dearth of research on the subject in Ghana. Findings show that dominant political elites, with little or no urban planning background, control and dictate urban planning activities resulting in chaotic scenes and urban blight across Ghanaian cities. Analyses here reinforce the growing recognition that urban planning outcomes in Ghana, and most African countries are not shaped by professional practice and do not reflect the aspirations of the community, but instead political elites. Urban planning agencies are left vulnerable as their activities are interfered, dictated and hindered by both traditional and mainstream political elites. This paper advocates for independence of urban planning agencies in the performance of their duties." .

This problem results from a combination of tightened buildings, large scale use of man-made materials, and modern offices full of devices emitting noxious and toxic vapors. The state of knowledge about sick building syndrome has increased greatly in recent years. However, knowledge of these advances is not yet widespread. From an engineering perspective, solutions to sick building problems are not being held up by a lack of technological capability, but rather by a lack of awareness of the knowledge base that is available. From a policy perspective, the range of strategies that exist beyond increased regulatory control are not commonly appreciated. It is to these shortcomings that this paper is addressed. Hopefully, this overview of recent advances in engineering technology and policy making will help to improve our responses to this expanding problem." .

With its direct relevance to the safety of human life and property, the quality of fire safety engineering in buildings is of concern not only to builders and their clients, but also to various social groups and organizations, ranging from government bodies and business organizations to the individual users of the buildings. Results of the recent research by the authors indicate that the government, insurers, quality certification bodies, building authorities, fire authorities, and trade and professional bodies significantly influence the development of quality assurance in the fire protection industry in the United Kingdom. In this article, the authors explore how these social groups and organizations play their roles in the development of a macro system for quality assurance in the fire protection industry in the U.K." .

Most definitions of accessibility only consider spatial separation and ignore the influence of traveler choice on accessibility. In this paper, the combined travel demand model is employed in transport planning. The travelers’ choice behavior of the model is based on the random utility theory. The model overcomes inconsistence problem of the sequential four-step model on travel behavior and congestion effects. Based on the same random utility theory, an accessibility measure is proposed, which can be integrated into the combined travel demand model. The accessibility measure can reflect the traveler’s choices at different stages (travel choice, destination choice, mode choice and route choice). The properties of the accessibility measure are discussed through a numerical example." .

Variables such as building heights and orientations, spaces between buildings, plot coverage alter solar access, wind speed and direction at street level. To improve microclimate and comfort conditions urban design elements including vegetation and shading devices can be used. In warm-humid Dar es Salaam, the climate consideration in urban design has received little attention although the urban planning authorities try to develop the quality of planning and design. The main aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between urban design, urban microclimate, and outdoor comfort in four built-up areas with different morphologies including low-, medium-, and high-rise buildings. The study mainly concentrates on the warm season but a comparison with the thermal comfort conditions in the cool season is made for one of the areas. Air temperature, wind speed, mean radiant temperature (MRT), and the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) are simulated using ENVI-met to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the existing urban design. An analysis of the distribution of MRT in the areas showed that the area with low-rise buildings had the highest frequency of high MRTs and the lowest frequency of low MRTs. The study illustrates that areas with low-rise buildings lead to more stressful urban spaces than areas with high-rise buildings. It is also shown that the use of dense trees helps to enhance the thermal comfort conditions, i.e., reduce heat stress. However, vegetation might negatively affect the wind ventilation. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis shows that the provision of shade is a more efficient way to reduce PET than increases in wind speed, given the prevailing sun and wind conditions in Dar es Salaam. To mitigate heat stress in Dar es Salaam, a set of recommendations and guidelines on how to develop the existing situation from microclimate and thermal comfort perspectives is outlined. Such recommendations will help architects and urban designers to increase the quality of the outdoor environment and demonstrate the need to create better urban spaces in harmony with microclimate and thermal comfort." .

One of the most important objectives in design is to create a strong organization which forms a whole by combining different parts. While creating this organization, it is essential to establish relationships, make the designed elements related and obtain a unique design product. This relationship can be established only with the systems approach. It is a difficult process. For this reason, it was aimed in this study to teach Landscape Architecture students how to achieve designs meeting both creative and user needs. Thus, students will learn how to create successful open spaces with the high level of use which is one of the most important problems nowadays. In this respect, this article has two purposes. The first purpose is to create a study diagram by suggesting the systems approach theoretically. Student works will be evaluated according to this study diagram. The second purpose is to investigate the contribution of the course conducted with the systems approach to the design education. In this study, the systems approach was explained to the students of the Department of Landscape Architecture at Karadeniz Technical University and they were made to design the residence and its immediate surroundings within the scope of the 3rd semester. Then, the effect of the systems approach on the creative and applicable designs of the students was determined with the survey study conducted. The results of this study reveal the importance of the systems approach for both design education and urban designers." .

As buildings develop and become more complex and new materials are used, the prescriptive fire safety rules may not provide an efficient solution to the new building design. A system approach to the design of fire safety in buildings on the basis of performance criteria may be necessary. The recently published fire codes in Hong Kong have recognized the use of a performance-based fire safety engineering approach as a means to demonstrate the adequacy of fire safety design in a building. However, the judgement on the adequacy is made by the building control officials. Whether they believe the use of such a performance-based fire safety engineering approach can provide adequate fire safety level in a building can have influence on promoting performance-based design. This paper discusses the Hong Kong system and a survey on the views of the building control officials. The investigation indicates that the officials, in general, agree with the need of using performance-based approach, in particular to keep pace with the advancement of building technology. However, they have reservations on the adequacy of current tools for fire safety engineering design. Such views are in line with that of the building officials in the United States." .

Typology, the systematic categorisation of precedent, may act as a means to interpret this information and identify relationships between existing buildings and new design. This work explores the link between typology and the design process and asks how typological thinking may benefit novice designers in the context of the architectural design studio. The research conceptually synthesises theories of typology with design methods to provide a practical framework for the application of typology in design studio teaching. Adopting a stage-based model of design, underpinned by the critical method as a description of individual design cycles, the framework offers a means of guiding project decisions, encouraging ideation and accessing information embedded in design precedents. The research is exploratory in nature and adopts a participant observation approach to develop and test the proposed framework. This is supported by data gathered from case studies, structured interviews and questionnaires. The typological learning framework is supported by the results of the research and considers various interpretations of typology at each stage in the design process, analytical processes required and practical guidance for designers and educators." .

Most of these regulations are based on the thermal quality of the buildings. In the Netherlands, the energy efficiency for new buildings is expressed as the EPC (energy performance coefficient). Studies have indicated that energy regulations are successful in lowering the energy consumption in residential buildings. However, the actual energy consumption is usually different from the expected energy consumption. This paper explores the effectiveness of energy performance regulations in lowering the energy consumption of dwellings built in the Netherlands after 1996. The effect of the EPC and thermal characteristics on energy consumption was determined by statistical analyses of data on actual energy consumption. The results showed that energy reductions are seen in dwellings built after the introduction of energy performance regulations. However, results suggest that to effectively reduce energy consumption, the tightening of the EPC in not enough. Policies aimed at controlling the construction quality and changing occupant behaviour are also necessary to achieve further energy reductions." .

To examine the role of cycling facilities, we used a newly assembled dataset on the length of bike lanes and paths in 2008 collected directly from 90 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. Pearson’s correlation, bivariate quartile analysis, and two different types of regressions were used to measure the relationship between cycling levels and bikeways, as well as other explanatory and control variables. Ordinary Least Squares and Binary Logit Proportions regressions confirm that cities with a greater supply of bike paths and lanes have significantly higher bike commute rates—even when controlling for land use, climate, socioeconomic factors, gasoline prices, public transport supply, and cycling safety. Standard tests indicate that the models are a good fit, with R 2 ranging between 0.60 and 0.65. Computed coefficients have the expected signs for all variables in the various regression models, but not all are statistically significant. Estimated elasticities indicate that both off-street paths and on-street lanes have a similar positive association with bike commute rates in U.S. cities. Our results are consistent with previous research on the importance of separate cycling facilities and provide additional information about the potentially different role of paths vs. lanes. Our analysis also revealed that cities with safer cycling, lower auto ownership, more students, less sprawl, and higher gasoline prices had more cycling to work. By comparison, annual precipitation, the number of cold and hot days, and public transport supply were not statistically significant predictors of bike commuting in large cities." .

The research done on 200 families from seven villages shows that these villages are faced with a shortage of flat land suitable for farming and other activities and as a result the villagers, specially the youth, having no job as a source of income, have to emigrate to cities. With the young force leaving the villages and shortage of means of production, the villages are now faced with a population decrease. In some cases, the villages have been totally abandoned in spite of the fact that they have the potential for economic activities specially tourism. By planning and actualizing the potential of these villages, it is possible to create jobs and return the villagers or to prevent further emigration." .

The evaluation is frequently based on setpoint temperatures and hours of operation. However, these fixed parameters are not suitable for social housing simulation as their performance tends to be in free running, excluding extremely cold or warm conditions. Therefore, a more successful assessment for the efficiency of these buildings is the users’ capability to live within adaptive comfort ranges without air conditioning systems. The aim of this research is to analyze new Chilean standards for sustainable social housing in the context of climate change using the adaptive comfort approach addressed in EN 15251:2007. Using EnergyPlus simulation software, 16 parametric series are analyzed for current conditions and validated against on-site measurements. Meanwhile, a prediction for the climate in 2050 has also been taken into account. The case study is the most widespread low cost dwelling model. The study demonstrates that the period of time within thermal comfort conditions varies substantially if analysis is done using the adaptive comfort standard or the Sustainable Construction Code (CCS) for Chilean housing. Considering climate change, the percentage of time fluctuates from −19.00% to 24.30%. Concluding that the adaptive comfort model has a greater capacity to positively assess indoor temperatures for social housing in Central-Southern Chile. This research also establishes that it is possible to provide homes where standards are improved within comfort conditions without using artificial means, 99.67% of the time currently and 88.89% in the future." .

Even so, wide variations in energy consumption are still observed between similar dwellings and between actual and predicted levels. It is thought that these variations stem from differences in occupant behaviour, the structural quality of the building, and a rebound effect. This paper statistically examines differences in occupant behaviour in relation to the building characteristics of the housing stock in the Netherlands and explores the possible existence of a rebound effect on the consumption of energy for space heating. Rebound effect can be defined as the increase on energy consumption in services for which improvements in energy efficiency reduce the costs. We found that although energy consumption is lower in energy efficient dwellings, analysis of the behaviour variables indicates their occupants tend to prefer higher indoor temperatures and to ventilate less. This finding might be related to a rebound effect on occupant behaviour. However, the improvement of thermal properties and systems efficiency still lead to a reduction on energy consumption for heating." .

In the literature a number of techniques have been proposed for energy management, but the trade-off between users comfort index and energy consumption is still a challenge and unsolved. Previously we have proposed PSO based power control methodology. Our technique achieved good performance up-to some extent. In this paper, we propose an improved optimized power control methodology for occupants comfort index, energy saving and energy prediction using genetic algorithm (GA). Our proposed GA based optimized technique improved the occupants comfort index and consumed minimum power as compare to our previous work. Here our focus is to increase occupants comfort index, minimize energy consumption and comparison of power consumption using GA and PSO based predicted systems. GA based predicted system consumed less power as compare to its counterpart PSO based predicted system. The output and comparative results show the efficiency of the proposed method in increasing the occupant’s comfort index and minimizing energy consumption." .

In this work, we aim to provide an initial approach to the question of how to model architectural data in a formal ontology structure and consider some of the problems involved. This question is challenging both for the inherent difficulties of the discourse to be modelled but also for the lack of available structured data sources that would distinctly represent the architectural perspective proper, as well as for the contentious nature of the definition of architecture itself. We, therefore, take the step of exploring in broad strokes the possible approaches to architecture, tracing the notion of architecture as idea, process or thing from the literature. On the basis of this enquiry, we propose a model of some top-level referents of architecture using FRBRoo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that can be used to model creative processes. We argue that with the addition of only four classes to this model, to capture certain architecturally specific concepts and activities, we are able to provide an adequate high-level first approach to this problem. Further, by connecting this work to the existing extension of CRMba, which models built work as a system of relations of filled and unfilled spaces, there is a sufficient high-level ontological structure to begin to test for its utility to explore the issues of the relation between architecture as idea, process and thing." .

A model is developed and calibrated in which a planning agency can influence the sequencing and densities of two phases of suburban development on the urban fringe. In this model an Ogawa-Fujita accessibility function plays an important role in determining rents per unit of built space and hence land values at any location. If the planner opts for a continuous rather than discontinuous development pattern, the result is lower densities but higher property values. It is concluded that planning efforts to limit sprawl are more consistent with tax base considerations than with concerns over density." .

In order to avoid costly reworks and delays, and to reduce the lead-time in product development, effective communication of design concepts among the various stakeholders such as customers, designers and engineers is of utmost importance. In this respect, functional representations provide a methodology, which can be used to describe a design or product effectively. However, function is not the only type of information that needs to be communicated among the various stakeholders during a design process. Other types of information such as design specifications and constraints, which are non-functional, also need to be taken into account. This non-functional information cannot be adequately expressed using existing functional representations. Accordingly, in this work, a novel purpose-behaviour-structure (PBS) representation scheme to capture vital design knowledge for collaborative product development is proposed. The proposed PBS representation scheme can be used by designers working in a collaborative environment for product development. A case study on the design of a vacuum cleaner is used to illustrate the functionality of the PBS representation scheme. The details of the representation scheme are presented in this paper." .

However, historical sites can have a rich and complex history, sometimes full of evolutions, sometimes only partially known by means of documentary sources. Various aspects condition the analysis and the interpretation of cultural heritage. First of all, buildings are not inexorably constant in time: creation, destruction, union, division, annexation, partial demolition and change of function are the transformations that buildings can undergo over time. Moreover, other factors sometimes contradictory can condition the knowledge about an historical site, such as historical sources and uncertainty. On one hand, historical documentation concerning past states can be heterogeneous, dubious, incomplete and even contradictory. On the other hand, uncertainty is prevalent in cultural heritage in various forms: sometimes it is impossible to define the dating period, sometimes the building original shape or yet its spatial position. This paper proposes a modeling approach of the geometrical representation of buildings, taking into account the kind of transformations and the notion of temporal indetermination." .

The aim of the study is to find out the building energy saving potentials of large-scale public and commercial buildings by energy audit. In this paper, the energy consumption, energy performance, and audit were carried out for a typical commercial mall, the so-called largest mall in Asia, located in a hot-summer and warm-winter climate zone. The total annual energy consumption reaches 210.01 kWh/m2, of which lighting energy consumption accounts for 30.03 kWh/m2 and the lift and elevator energy consumption accounts for 40.46 kWh/m2. It is by far higher than that of the average building energy consumption in the same category. However, the annual heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption is only 87.19 kWh/m2 even though they run 24/7. It proves that the energy performance of the HVAC system is good. Therefore, the building energy savings potential mainly relies on reducing the excessive usage of lighting, lifts, and elevators." .

Great difficulties are evident in problematic contexts as the Italian case, but in other countries as well, where planning and design traditions have certainly been reliable and influential (e.g. the Netherlands and the UK). However, there is an astonishing lack of critical reflections within the disciplinary field. The aim of this paper is to focus on a set of critical issues , and to suggest new directions in the current practice. This means to deal with three challenges of great importance: how to overcome the traditional divide between planning and design theory and practice; to select suitable and mutually consistent paradigms within each disciplinary field; and to outline a place-based approach to actual problems in regulation, visioning and urban designing." .

Landslide protection was developed in the 19th century and during 1960s on adjacent coastal areas, according to urban planning and landslide protection plans. The historical center was formed around the Odessa port and includes several unique architectural monuments such as the 142-m-long Potemkin Stairs, Primorsky Boulevard, and the Odessa Opera Theater. Architectural and urban planning designs in the city include landslide protection and preventive measures. Results of landslide studies show that landslide development along the Odessa coast is influenced primarily by tectonic movements and the heterogeneity of the geological substrata. All historical and contemporary protective and preventive landslide measures maintain their engineering geological integrity and effectiveness despite the differences in time of their construction and design." .

Both models are well accepted and evaluated within their individual scientific communities. The coupled scheme proposes a more realistic representation of buildings and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which allows a broader analysis of the two-way interactions between the energy performance of buildings and the urban climate around the buildings. The scheme can be used to evaluate the building energy models that are being developed within the urban climate community. In this study, the coupled scheme is evaluated using measurements conducted over the dense urban centre of Toulouse, France. The comparison includes electricity and natural gas energy consumption of buildings, building façade temperatures, and urban canyon air temperatures. The coupled scheme is then used to analyze the effect of different building and HVAC system configurations on building energy consumption, waste heat released from HVAC systems, and outdoor air temperatures for the case study of Toulouse. Three different energy efficiency strategies are analyzed: shading devices, economizers, and heat recovery." .

Over the three years for which the memorandum will apply, federally owned construction costs will increase by $844 million to $3.44 billion. If the memorandum is interpreted to apply to state and local construction projects funded with federal money, the cost could range between $3.2 and $13.0 billion." .

Understanding growth of urban trees exposed to air pollution will support planning, managing and expanding urban areas. This approach intends to determine growth patterns of urban trees to support future urban planning. Non-destructive samples were collected from trees of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze in Araucaria city, Parana State, Brazil. Growth rings were related to pollutant concentrations and meteorological series. Growth reduction was observed except in the border areas of the city. Trees established during or after the period of industrialization incentives were most affected by air pollution, indicating that immature plants are more vulnerable. Sulphur dioxide and nitric oxide significantly affected growth of smaller trees. Those greater than 60 cm dbh did not demonstrate significant correlation with any identified pollutant. As the trees established before accentuated urbanization were less affected by air pollution, it is reinforced the importance of preserving remaining urban trees. We suggest that planning urban afforestation should precede industries placing. When urban planning is impossible, new planted trees should not be expected to grow as in free pollution areas, but they will still present satisfactory diameter increment, contributing to improve local urban environment." .

One might be tempted to conclude that the current ‘state of the art’ is working well. However, application of PBFPD remains limited, several shortcomings exist, and an increasing number of countries are moving toward ‘prescribed performance’ to address the gaps. There are many factors contributing to these problems with PBFPD. Research has been carried out in two principal problem areas: the relationship between occupants and fire safety measures in the context of holistic building performance expectations during everyday use of the building, and also the lack of specifics within current PBFPD approaches. To address these concerns, a new framework for risk-informed PBFPD has been developed, centered on the study of systems formed by specific building types and their associated occupants. This framework replaces generic guidance with a more in-depth and targeted “building-occupant” system approach. This article focuses on how a successful implementation of the new risk-informed PBFPD approach will require acceptance of the need for a paradigm shift from one in which fire is the center of the problem to one in which building performance metrics are evaluated in case of fire events. This article also details the different steps of the new PBFPD process and how this process differs from the current ones, notably in separating technical steps from political steps related to decision making and policy. Finally, this article presents how the new approach is practically applied to a project, focusing on a proof of concept of the new PBFPD process." .

This may be partly to do with the difficulty experienced by those without an architectural training in trying to understand exactly what design of the built environment entails. This is hardly helped by the descriptions that architects themselves give of this activity which tend either to paint it as more rational than it is, or to surround it with the mystique of the individual artistic genius. However, computers are now firmly placed at the centre of architectural practice, and the number of computers embedded in buildings themselves is increasing rapidly. This paper reviews the relationship between computing and architecture by describing a series of recent and current research projects in which the boundary between the digital and real world is explored, taking as their basis architectural theories derived from space syntax research. It describes the changing role of computing as a design medium, the embedding of computing in the buildings we design, and the broader theoretical contribution that architectural research is beginning to make to our understanding of the nature of human cognition and so to the field of artificial intelligence. It concludes that the relationship between the discipline of architecture and contemporary developments in the theory surrounding computing result from the need for both to be based on an epistemology of the extended mind." .

With the use of the 1982 National Travel Survey, current travel patterns in and around the metropolitan cities are studied: the importance of external trips for urban transport planning shows clearly. They account for about half the number of city related car trips, and for nearly three quarters of the total vehicle kilometres of travel within the city." .

A universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to wait-free implement any object defined by a sequential specification. Herlihy’s paper shows that the basic system model, which supports only atomic read/write registers, has to be enriched with consensus objects to allow the design of universal constructions. The generalized notion of a k -universal construction has been recently introduced by Gafni and Guerraoui (Proceedings of 22nd international conference on concurrency theory (CONCUR’11), Springer LNCS 6901, pp 17–27, 2011). A k-universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to simultaneously implement k objects (instead of just one object), with the guarantee that at least one of the k constructed objects progresses forever. While Herlihy’s universal construction relies on atomic registers and consensus objects, a k-universal construction relies on atomic registers and k-simultaneous consensus objects (which are wait-free equivalent to k-set agreement objects in the read/write system model). This paper significantly extends the universality results introduced by Herlihy and Gafni–Guerraoui. In particular, we present a k-universal construction which satisfies the following five desired properties, which are not satisfied by the previous k-universal construction: (1) among the k objects that are constructed, at least $$\\ell $$ ℓ objects (and not just one) are guaranteed to progress forever; (2) the progress condition for processes is wait-freedom, which means that each correct process executes an infinite number of operations on each object that progresses forever; (3) if any of the k constructed objects stops progressing, all its copies (one at each process) stop in the same state; (4) the proposed construction is contention-aware, in the sense that it uses only read/write registers in the absence of contention; and (5) it is generous with respect to the obstruction-freedom progress condition, which means that each process is able to complete any one of its pending operations on the k objects if all the other processes hold still long enough. The proposed construction, which is based on new design principles, is called a $$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -universal construction. It uses a natural extension of k-simultaneous consensus objects, called $$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -simultaneous consensus objects ($$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -SC). Together with atomic registers, $$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -SC objects are shown to be necessary and sufficient for building a $$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -universal construction, and, in that sense, $$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -SC objects are $$(k,\\ell )$$ (k,ℓ) -$$ {universal}$$ universal ." .

A modified version of an algorithm developed by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory is used to evaluate energy requirements. Energy loads for two buildings of interest are estimated for changing climatic conditions (air temperature) as well as changing environments around the building. An isolated building and a building surrounded by several other buildings are considered. Results indicate that climate warming may lead to energy savings in a wide range of climates while savings also depend on the nature of the building and its use. In cool climates, climate warming forces net energy-load decreases through reductions of the winter heating loads. For example, a one-degree increase in annual air temperature in Duluth led to a 10 kWh decrease in net energy loads for a small office building. In warm climates, urbanization tends to accelerate energy consumption although shadowing may contribute significantly to decreases in summer cooling loads. In Phoenix, annual mean daily net energy loads decreased by about 10 kWh due to shadowing for the same office building. Even in relatively cool regions, summer cooling-load reductions caused by shadowing are effective." .

The attributes of 61 gardens, including patterns of landcover and vegetation cover, were explored in relation to housing characteristics and the nature of the surrounding landscape. The number of surrounding houses, and the areas of buildings and of roads were negatively correlated with garden area. The proportion of a housing parcel comprising garden increased with parcel size, although the proportion that was rear garden remained relatively constant. Garden size played an overwhelming role in determining garden composition: larger gardens supported more landcovers, contained greater extents of three-quarters of the recorded landcovers, and were more likely to contain trees taller than 2 m, vegetable patches, and composting sites. Unvegetated landcovers made greater proportional contributions as garden size declined. All categories of vegetation canopy increased with garden size, and large gardens supported disproportionately greater cover above 3 m. House age was a less significant factor determining garden landcover. Gardens of newer houses were more likely to occur towards the edge of the urban area, and older properties, that contained fewer hedges, possessed less canopy between 2–3 m. The extent and occurrence of different landcovers in gardens, and their consequences for wildlife, are considered for residential patches in urban areas. The implications for urban planners are discussed." .

This means delivering facilities that satisfy all the needs of the client. Correct decision-making during design and construction planning is the best means for assuring a quality project. Performance-based design is a framework that enables the project team to approach the project delivery process systematically and provides basic principles for evaluating and comparing alternative solutions. The principles of axiomatic design (as previously advanced by Suh) and the concept of an interface index are key elements of the framework. Axiomatic design provides an operational structure for the design process as well as a set of basic principles or axioms for guiding each decision-maker. The interface index complements the design axioms by quantifying the effort associated with integrating the contributions of multiple decision-makers into a total system. Elements of the framework are demonstrated through application to an actual facility." .

Constrained by limited space, a comprehensive set of land transport policies has been in place to balance the growth in transport demand and the effectiveness and efficiency of the land transport system. A multi-pronged approach has been used to achieve the objective of a world-class transportation system. These include integration of urban and transport planning, expansion of the road network and improvement of the transport infrastructure, harnessing the latest technology in network and traffic management, managing vehicle ownership and usage, and improvement and regulations of public transport (Ministry of Transport (MOT) (2003) Policy and Regulations, Land Transport, Available: www.mot.gov.sg, Date of Access: 15 September 2003). Singapore was the first country in the world to introduce various new techniques, notably the Area License Scheme (ALS) in 1975 and the Vehicle Quota System (VQS) in 1990. An Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system replaced the ALS in 1998 to take the role of congestion management, the experience of which has also drawn particular attention from many large cities in the world. In 2003, the world’s first and only fully automatic heavy rail Mass Rapid Transit system was opened to the public, marking a new chapter in Singapore’s innovative approach to solving its land transport problem. This paper reviews the land transport policy implemented in Singapore and pays special emphasis to its public transportation systems." .

It was an agriculturally oriented region but is becoming an industrialized region. Rural green landscaping in this region possesses characteristics of traditional Chinese gardens. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the visual quality of green landscaping in rural residential areas through public perception-based and expert/design approaches. The former approach enables us to rank green landscaping based on a survey of public preference; the latter weighs the contributions of the attributes contained in a photograph to its overall scenic beauty via correlation, regression, and factor analyses. The photographs used in the survey included road greenways, riparian greenways, residential public gardens and green landscaping around houses, with each type of landscape represented by seven photographs. In total, 141 college students and 41 other participants ranked photographs of each landscaping type from highest to lowest preference. The results indicate that the preferences of students are similar to those of the general public. Examples of green landscaping depicted in the “best” four photographs possessed more attractive qualities regarding the variety of vegetation, richness of colors and a selection of human additions compared to those depicted in the “worst” photographs. The perceived visual quality was positively influenced by, in decreasing order of importance, the variety of vegetation, color contrast, the openness of green spaces, the area of vegetation, and positive man-made elements; conversely, it was negatively influenced by the type of topography. Moreover, some suggestions were offered for future rural greening regarding perceived visual beauty." .

About 40 % of all primary energy is used in buildings all over the world. This paper is the second part of the study on the life-cycle energy (LCEA), emissions (LCCO2A) and cost (LCCA) assessment of two residential buildings constructed in urban and rural areas. MethodsIn the first part, the methodology, formulations and procedure for such a comprehensive analysis are provided, while this paper provides an application of the methodology that considers two actual buildings located in Gaziantep, Turkey. The proposed model focused on building construction, operation and demolition phases to estimate energy use, carbon emissions and costs per square meter over a 50-year lifespan. The optimum thickness of insulation used to reduce energy consumption and emissions per square meter is determined. Results and discussionIt is found that the operating phase is dominant in both urban and rural residential buildings and contributes 87–85 % of the primary energy requirements and 88–82 % of CO2 emissions, respectively. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions were 5.8 and 3.9 tons CO2 eqv. for BT1 and BT2, respectively. It is calculated that the life-cycle energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the residential buildings can be reduced by up to 22.8 and 23.4 %, respectively, by using a proper insulation material for the external walls. The life-cycle cost, consisting of mortgage, energy, maintenance, service and demolition payments are calculated to be 7.28 and 1.72 million USD for BT1 and BT2, respectively. ConclusionsBuilding envelope developments, such as better wall insulation, provide noteworthy potential energy savings and contribute to the reductions from cooling and space heating. Therefore, primary strategies and technologies needed for efficient buildings include optimal insulation of external walls. The economic insulation thickness of the residential buildings in Gaziantep is determined to be 80 mm by using a life-cycle cost analysis. The results show that because of the differences in building structures and living standards, life-cycle energy intensity and CO2 emissions in urban residential buildings are 29 and 25 % higher than in rural conditions." .

The evaluation by tourists was carried out by means of an Internet survey with 693 answers collected over 6 weeks. The sites visited most frequently by the respondents are loess gullies and river valleys with small waterfalls. The sites were mostly visited during car trips and as part of walking excursions during a long-term stay. The main motivation for visiting the surveyed sites was the aesthetic value of the landscape. The respondents sought information, mainly on the Web, about nature, culture and tourist attractions. The results of the survey indicate a need for further promotion of the geotouristic values of lesser-known sites in Lubelskie province and this will also enable tourism to be better managed." .

This integration will support energy efficiency, load balancing, and the incorporation of renewables. This study introduces a residential building energy management solution to control connected devices based on economic signals from the grid and occupant behavior. An air-conditioning unit, a water heater, and an electric vehicle (EV) were modeled and controlled using a traditional on/off controller and model predictive controller (MPC). The MPC is designed to minimize the total building electricity costs while maintaining occupant comfort. The MPC utilizes the building thermal mass, the EV battery storage, and the water heater’s hot water tank to shift electricity use to a period when the price is lower. This controller considers occupant behavior as a constraint in controlling these devices to maintain users’ comfort. The simulation results show a 10%–30% reduction in the electricity bill by applying the MPC in a dynamic electricity price scenario, as compared to the traditional methods of control. The proposed method of control makes buildings responsive to grid signals that provide the potential of peak shaving and ancillary services." .

Recently, the city of Beijing decided to have a target of becoming as a ‘public-transport city’ with a fascinating mass transit system within a larger plan, of building humanistic, scientific and technological, and green public-transport systems. This work discusses the governance evolution of the mass transit system of Beijing between 1949–2008, comprised of two groups of transit systems, the road surface public-transport system (bus, tram, trolley, etc.), and the subway public-transport system. In addition, a time-series analysis is introduced in an attempt to examine the effect of governance evolution on the two transit systems, and of the impacts of the governance structural changes on the mass transit system. The time-series model is introduced using the annual statistics data of the period 1949–2008. The outcome of the analysis is viewed with precaution because of the incompleteness of the many endogenous and exogenous factors to affect the public-transport demand. Generally speaking it is concluded that the governance evolution provides beneficial effect of the Beijing mass transit activity; however, for satisfying the significant increase of the Beijing city’s travel demand and maintaining sustainable development, the governance-involvement pattern needs to be reformed." .

In this work we present a novel approach to energy saving in buildings through the identification of the relevant parameters and the application of Soft Computing techniques to generate predictive models of energy consumption in buildings. Using such models it is possible to define strategies for optimizing the day-to-day energy consumption of buildings. To verify the feasibility of this proposal, we apply our approach to a reference building for which we have contextual data from a complete year of monitoring. First, we characterize the building in terms of its contextual features and energy consumption, and then select the most appropriate techniques to generate the most accurate model of our reference building charged with estimating the energy consumption, given a concrete set of inputs. Finally, considering the energy usage profile of the building, we propose specific control actions and strategies to save energy." .

Three components of the design complexity are identified, they are variability, vulnerability and correlation, in which the vulnerability is related to the size of the design problem, the interdependency of design parameters and the sensitivity of functional requirements of the design towards the change in design parameters." .

Setting the driving time, and thus the departure time at stops, is an important decision when optimizing reliability in urban public transport. The choice of the percentile out of historical data determines the probability of being late or early, while the scheduled departure time determines the arrival pattern for travelers. A hypothetical line and a case study are used to determine the optimal percentile value for long-headway services without and with holding points. If no holding points are applied, it is shown that the 35-percentile value minimizes the additional travel time to 25 % of the reference situation. In the case of holding, two holding points combined with a 30–60-percentile value yield the best performance: a further reduction of the additional travel time with 60 %." .

This case study explores the notion of acoustic comfort for all in the context of university education. One auditorium, situated in a historic building and subject to renovation in the near future, is studied in detail: acoustic obstacles are identified in collaboration with user/experts and are measured in situ; specific interventions are proposed in consultation with building professionals, technicians and conservation specialists and are tested using dedicated acoustic simulation software. The study draws attention to the importance of acoustic comfort for all and offers a first view of which solutions are possible and desirable and how these can be obtained." .

Three recent actual or potential weapons of mass destruction (WMD) attacks did not involve nuclear bombs or other devices designed as weapons, but rather benign objects used with evil intent. Just as unplanned events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, and user misuse have been codified into design requirements based on the likelihood and potential impact of the event, “evil intent” has to become part of the design process for buildings, vehicles, equipment, and other items. The endstate should be reasonable additions to existing codes and standards such that it is clear what is and is not designed for. In the absence of specific design guidance, professionals with appropriate expertise can assess potential for “evil intent” and provide recommendations to design out or warn against this potential harm to public safety, particularly when codified requirements are not present." .

The automation of conceptual design practices will decrease design and manufacturing risks by allowing system designers to view the entire performance design space early in the design cycle prior to the initiation of traditional physical design activities. This article describes a software tool that performs interdisciplinary trade-off analysis and partitioning for multichip systems including multichip modules (MCMs) and traditional assembly approaches. The tool concurrently computes physical, electrical, thermal, reliability, testability, and cost performance metrics for multichip systems. This tool allows a large fraction of possible design, technology, material, test, and manufacturing approaches to be explored before decisions are made and resources committed. An example set of trade-off results are presented which examine the trade-off between peripheral I/O format die and area array I/O format die in an MCM, as a function of partitioning a fixed functionality into a variable number of die." .

The current capabilities of the system are demonstrated by the example of designing a library building.

First, three dominant contemporary urban discourses developed in the field of urban planning are scrutinized on their inclusiveness of families and daily family life. The attractive city, the creative city and the city as an emancipation machine are examples of urban discourses communicated top-down via reports, debates and media attention. It is argued that these three discourses do not address families as urban citizens nor the very notion of reproduction and its daily manifestation. The exclusionary character of contemporary urban discourses does not only result in a neglect of urban families, it also legitimates non-intervention when it comes to family issues. This conclusion activated the search for an alternative discourse as expanded in the second part of the paper. This alternative discourse is constructed from the bottom-up and is rooted in the day-to-day experiences of urban families themselves. It is a refined discourse, with interrelated geographical scales including the city as a whole, the neighbourhood, the street and the home. This is a city that integrates—as families themselves do—the different domains of life. The city is appreciated for its qualities of proximity, the neighbourhood for its ethnically mixed children’s domains, the street as an urban haven and the house as the place that accommodates private life for each member of the family. This alternative discourse is called the balanced city. The empirical basis is drawn from middle-class urban families in Rotterdam, The Netherlands." .

It has contributed in both a positive and negative way to the quality of life, transforming our cities, our way of life, and giving us a greater command over time and space. Concern over the undesirable social and environmental impacts has increased over time, with calls for governments to take action to reduce the automobile's dominant role. New investment in fixed-track public transport and bus priority systems together with strategies to discourage travel have been proposed to improve accessibility and to aid in cleaning up the physical environment. This paper reviews some of the issues facing society as it works to identify policies to achieve an economically and environmentally sustainabie future. There is a need for a broader set of policies to facilitate alternative land use-transport lifestyles while facing appropriate pricing signals. Some of the key issues are adjustments in the relative prices of location and transport, spatial incentives to make public transport economically viable (i.e. changing urban densities, zoning/incentive changes to allow more infill), road pricing (i.e. charging cars the economic cost of using the roads), new information technology systems (e.g. IVHS) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of transport infrastructure, major improvements in the fuel efficiency of fossil fuelled vehicles, and alternative-fuelled vehicles (“clean-air vehicles”)." .

The castle is visited by a large number of visitors, around one million every year and a maximum of 9,000 in one day. Experiments on a 1/25 scale model are carried out to grasp the feature of smoke movement within the main tower, so as to improve life safety and mitigate damage to the building in case of a fire. The Froude number is considered for similarity, and the movement of smoke is visualized. The experiments demonstrate certain interesting effects resulting from the architectural features of the castle; in particular, deep soffits on the lower stairs, along with tall windows, which are generally left open during the day, can significantly reduce the risk of smoke penetration to the upper-level stairs. The tests produced detailed data on the distribution of smoke in different fire scenarios, particularly the zones that are unaffected and inundated by smoke. Integration of these results with the evacuation characteristics of the building will be an essential part of functional safety planning for the castle." .

This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between global warming and the demand for space cooling in buildings. It then estimates two key parameters that link energy for space cooling to cooling degree days (CDDs) using data for nine U.S. Census divisions, which is the spatial resolution of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). The first parameter is the set point temperature for calculating CDDs; the second is the exponent for representing the relationship between changes in CDDs and changes in electricity consumption for space cooling. We find that the best-fitting CDDs have a set point of 67 °F (19.4 °C), for both residential and commercial buildings, rather than the conventional 65 °F (18.3 °C). Set points also vary by region, with warmer regions tending to have higher set points. When CDDs are based on the conventional set point, the best fitting exponent is 1.5 for both residential and commercial buildings, indicating that space cooling is more climate-sensitive than is specified in NEMS. As a result, the official projections of U.S. energy consumption would appear to underestimate the energy required for space cooling." .

From a basic fare of I 5c in 1969, two increases brought the fare to 25c by 1972, and cut sharply into a previously stable patronage. The “Muni”, in an effort to reduce costs and meet its budgeted deficit, attempted to reduce service by ten to fifteen percent. From an analysis of the data which could be obtained, it appears that neither efficiency not equity in the City would have been served by the proposed cutbacks. The analysis draws from a variety of sources and methods in exploring the interactions within the transportation system and within the city budget." .

Yet the full range of transport, health, environmental and economic impacts of new cycling infrastructure and the extent to which observed changes are sustained is not well understood. The City of Sydney is currently building a new bicycle network, which includes a new bicycle path separated from road traffic in the south Sydney area. This protocol paper describes a comprehensive method to evaluate this new cycling infrastructure. MethodA cohort of residents within two kilometres of the new bicycle path will be surveyed at baseline before a new section of bicycle path is built, and again 12 and 24 months later to assess changes in travel behaviour, sense of community, quality of life and health behaviours. Residents in a comparable area of Sydney that will not get a new separated bike path will act as a comparison group.

With the rapid development of urbanization and constant advancement of suburbanization, the middle class has increasingly come to influence city traffic. Research into middle-class commuting activities thus has practical significance for improving traffic congestion and reducing the commuting burden in metropolitan cities. Based on a dataset formed by 816 completed surveys, this paper analyzes the commuting mode, time and distance of middle-class residents in Guangzhou City using the descriptive statistical method. The results indicate that private cars are the main commuting mode, followed by public transport. Meanwhile, middle-class residents mainly undertake medium-short time and medium- short distance commuting. The study subsequently uses multilevel logistic regression and multiple linear regression models to analyze the factors that influence commuting mode choice, time and distance. The gender, age, number of family cars, housing source and jobs-housing balance are the most important factors influencing commuting mode choice; housing, population density, jobs-housing balance and commuting mode significantly affect commuting time; and transport accessibility, jobs-housing balance and commuting mode are the notable factors affecting commuting distance. Finally, this paper analyzes what is affecting the commuting activities of middle-class residents and determines the differences in commuting activity characteristics and influence factors between middle-class and ordinary residents. Policy suggestions to improve urban planning and urban management are also proposed." .

Under the “carrot-and-stick” rationales, the government has formulated public transport policies and exercised a series of related initiatives by providing sufficient and higher quality of public transport services so as to attract more private vehicle users. In this paper, the planning philosophy and policy formulation of Taiwan’s public transport development are highlighted. The most important initiatives, including the Five-year Enhancement of Mass Transportation Program and the upgrading public transport schemes in the National Development Plan are examined. Based on previous experience and lessons, we point out the most challenging issues that the government will encounter. Suggestions for the future of public transport planning are also addressed." .

The transformation of Bogotá included building the TransMilenio Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, a city-wide system that offers speed and convenience similar to that of an underground metro. TransMilenio is widely regarded as a success, and cities around the world are planning or building similar systems. In this paper, we use a repeated cross-section labor market dataset to assess whether access to the new BRT system affects the incomes of those who live in station area neighborhoods. Our results indicate that the opening of the TransMilenio system was associated with increased income for those living near—but not immediately adjacent to—trunk line stations. This relationship is strongest in the lower and middle-income range. There are at least two possible explanations for this result: 1. existing residents earn higher wages, or 2. higher income workers move to the neighborhood. Our data do not allow us to distinguish clearly between them, but available evidence suggests that much of the effect is likely due to relocation. Our results stand in contrast to prior work, which has largely suggested that improvements in public transit will tend to reduce wages in station areas." .

It appears that the electrical conductivity, a measure of the natural ionization of air, is one atmospheric-electric parameter that can manifest itself inside occupied buildings without appreciable difference in physical character from outside values. The probable importance of these experimental results for the field of bioclimatology is pointed out and the possibility is discussed that the electrical conductivity of air might be one of the searched—for parameters in associating physiological phenomena with weather changes." .

A dworek, or small manor house, became one of the most popular models for designers of all building types, including synagogues. Those synagogues designed and built by Henryk Stifelman, an active member of the Warsaw Jewish Community and an assimilationist, were the best proof of a continuity of the general local architectural tradition. Other examples can also be found of synagogues in the dworek style, designed by non-Jewish architects in the 1920s for small towns in central and eastern Poland." .

However, assisting product designers to understand the concept of product experience, what sort of experiences they want for their products and how to include these into their design are topics that still need to be addressed. The aim of this study is to propose a design approach that begins with the use of narration and collects narration cases of product use for a specific product experience. This design approach guides designers through a four-step process, to develop a design model that fits in with the product experience. In order to better understand how this design approach works, this study takes the concept of analepsis as an example of product experience to demonstrate the process. The definition of analepsis, a term used in narratology, is “an event that took place earlier than the point in the story where we are at any given moment.” When the term is used in the product design field, it refers to use past experiences to solve current problems. This study explores the conceptual framework of the topic and proposes a product experience-orientated design model for product design, an issue that has rarely been discussed before. Directions for future research are also discussed." .

From both the environmental and the equity component of sustainability, a comparison of accessibility by car versus public transport is of utmost importance. However, most studies in this direction have used rather rough estimates of travel time, especially by public transport. In this paper, we present Urban.Access, an ArcGIS extension for estimating car-based and transit-based accessibility to employment and other land uses. Urban.Access enables a detailed representation of travel times by transit and car and thus makes it possible to adequately compare accessibility levels by transport mode. The application of Urban.Access to the Tel Aviv metropolitan area shows that the gaps between car-based and transit-based accessibility are larger than those found in other studies. We argue that this is not the result of a poorer transit system, but rather of a more detailed description of travel by transit in the Urban.Access application. The larger gaps point to a greater need for adequate policy responses, both for reducing car dependence as well as for creating a more equitable transport system. Hence, we uphold that an adequate representation of transit travel times is more than a scientific matter—it is a matter of great social importance." .

Amongst the range of environmental sustainability issues arising from housing construction and occupation, the energy demand for heating and/or cooling to maintain thermal comfort has the longest history and is most widespread in policy and regulation. Since energy in our homes is mainly fossil-derived, a key issue is global climate change impacts. Since greenhouse gas emissions can be emitted in various locations across the globe with similar results, it follows that a given greenhouse gas emission arising from residential space heating and cooling has approximately equal impact, irrespective of the location of the building. These emissions are therefore an appropriate candidate for benchmarking internationally, yet there have been few attempts to undertake this activity. This paper reports on a study undertaken in Australia which compares the thermal energy performance of housing in the United States, Canada, UK and Australia. The comparison is based on energy ratings of over 50 house designs from the comparison countries. Each design was assessed as being current and verified as complying with rather than significantly exceeding local regulatory requirements. Issues in design of both the buildings and the modelling tool used are highlighted, and the results are presented. Conclusions are drawn on the reasons for wide variations in thermal energy performance, the implications for benchmarking, and the case for globally consistent housing environmental performance policies and regulation." .

This serious global problem calls for improvement in energy efficiency from all sectors, especially the building sector which is considered a major energy consumer. Adoption of energy efficiency design practices in the housing sector has been perceived to have a significant potential to contribute greatly to the sustainable building process. Additionally, most studies indicate that the understanding and integration of stakeholder requirements has an enormous potential towards increasing the sustainability perspectives that relate to social, environmental, economic and technical issues of buildings. However, there is enough evidence from several studies suggesting a lack of common perspective on stakeholder requirements towards building energy efficiency (BEE) in housing development. Hence it is argued that stakeholders’ alignment for energy efficiency improvement is crucial and a fundamental challenge that needs to be addressed if the goal of energy use reduction in buildings is to be achieved. The aim of this paper is to identify the important building energy requirements among stakeholders of mass housing projects and their impact on technical characteristics of mass housing projects. Through a survey of building industry stakeholders and using the House of Quality model for analysis of the data obtained, the study identified five (5) most rated BEE stakeholders’ requirements in respect of housing development. The study gives a new insight into the considerations of building stakeholders regarding energy efficiency. This insight is useful towards achieving sustainable building solutions that meet the sustainability features of housing development in Ghana and other countries with similar energy and housing challenges." .

From a basic fare of 15c in 1969, two increases brought the fare to 25c by 1972, and cut sharply into a previously stable patronage. The “Muni”, in an effort to reduce costs and meet its budgeted deficit, attempted to reduce service by ten to fifteen percent. From an analysis of the data which could be obtained, it appears that neither efficiency not equity in the City would have been served by the proposed cutbacks. The analysis draws from a variety of sources and methods in exploring the interactions within the transportation system and within the city budget." .

It seeks to identify the key elements and methodologies they employ and to answer the research question: How do designers design? The need to gain understanding on how designers work, gave me occasion to visit and speak with designers about their approach to design. To look inside a designer’s practice has left me with an overriding impression that these designers know and trust their own way of working, they do not map their thoughts onto a pre-existing process; rather, each new work dictates its own direction. Their understanding has come about through a wealth of design experiences, a way of seeing, and perceptive reflection-in-action." .

The goal of the present study, carried out within the Advance Tools for Rational Energy Use towards Sustainability (ATREUS) European research network, is the evaluation of the wind field around buildings with walls heated by solar radiation. Two computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes were validated against extensive wind-tunnel observations to assess the influence of thermal effects on model performance. The code selected from this validation was used to simulate the wind and temperature fields for a summer day in a specific region of the city of Lisbon. For this study, the meteorological data produced by a non-hydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model (MM5) were used as boundary conditions for a CFD code, which was further applied to analyze the effects of local roughness elements and thermodynamic conditions on the air flow around buildings. The CFD modelling can also provide the inflow parameters for a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, used to evaluate the building energy budgets and to predict performance of the air-conditioning system. The main finding of the present three-dimensional analyses is that thermal forcing associated with the heating of buildings can significantly modify local properties of the air flow." .

It is clear that a (v,Z_k,1)-PCD simply is a(v, k, 1)-PMD. This generalization has concretemotivations in at least one case. In fact we observe thattriplewhist tournaments may be viewed as resolved(v,Z22,1)-PCD's but not, in general, as resolved(v, 4, 1)-PMD's. We give four composition constructionsfor regular and 1-rotational resolved PCD's. Two of them make use of differencematrices and contain, asspecial cases, previous constructions for PMD's by Kageyama andMiao [15] and for Z-cyclic whist tournaments by Anderson,Finizio and Leonard [5]. The other two constructions succeed wheresometimes difference matrices fail and their applications allow us to get new PMD's, new Z-cyclic directed whist tournaments and newZ-cyclic triplewhist tournaments. The whist tournaments obtainable with the last twoconstructions are decomposable into smaller whist tournaments.We show this kind of tournaments useful in practice whenever, at theend of a tournament, some confrontations between ex-aequo players areneeded." .

Consequently, knowledge transfer and reuse opportunities are missed. Our objective is to capture and mine rich, contextual, social communicative events for further knowledge reuse. We present a methodology and prototype called I-Dialogue that: (1) captures the knowledge generated during informal communicative events through dialogue, sketching and gestures in the form of unstructured digital design knowledge corpus; (2) adds structure to the unstructured digital knowledge corpus; and (3) processes the corpus using an innovative notion disambiguation algorithm in support of knowledge retrieval. The paper concludes with results of evaluation experiments with I-Dialogue using a testbed of design–construction projects." .

By using a steady-state model for the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the CO2 and odour mass flows, the indoor climate of mechanically ventilated livestock buildings can be calculated. These equations depend on the livestock (number of animals and how they are kept), the insulation of the building and the characteristics of the ventilation system (ventilation rate). Since the model can only be applied to animal houses where the ventilation systems are mechanically controlled (this is the case for a majority of finishing pig units), the calculations were done for an example of a finishing pig unit with 1000 animal places. The model presented used 30 min values of the outdoor parameters temperature and humidity, collected over a 2-year period, as input. The projected environment inside the livestock building was compared with recommended values. The duration of condensation on the inside surfaces was also calculated." .

The area of the plots times the urbanization pressure was used as a size measure. The central question of this study is whether the sampling with probabilities proportional to size leads to gain in precision compared to equal probability sampling. On average 1.03 isolated buildings per 100 ha have been built, while 0.90 buildings per 100 ha have been removed, leading to a net change of 0.13 building per 100 ha. The area with unspoiled natural relief has been reduced by 2.3 ha per 100 ha, and the length of linear relicts by 137 m per 100 ha. On average 74 m of linear green elements have been planted per 100 ha, while 106 m have been removed, leading to a net change of −31 m per 100 ha. For the state variables ‘unspoiled natural relief', ‘ linear relicts', ‘removed linear green elements', and ‘new – removed linear green elements' there is a gain in precision due to the pps-sampling. For the remaining state variables there is no gain or even a loss of precision (`new buildings', ‘removed buildings', ‘new – removed buildings', ‘new linear green elements'). Therefore, if many state variables must be monitored or when interest is not only in the change but also in the current totals, we recommend to keep things simple, and to select plots with equal probability." .

Wright Mills repeatedly assumed two main roles throughout his life: those of designer and craftsman. Indeed, design and craftsmanship influenced, substantively and stylistically, most everything he did. Mills’s implementation of these two qualities extended to a number of areas including writing books and building houses, but also to motorcycle mechanics, photography, and carpentry. After consideration of Mills’s biography and philosophy in the context of design, style, and craftsmanship, two talks that he delivered in Aspen and Toronto, in 1958 and 1959 respectively, are examined. In both cases he addressed his remarks, specifically, to engineers, city planners, artists, and architects. Mills’s handwritten notes and various excerpts as well as published sources are consulted to show that Mills—through his biographical exemplification as designer and craftsman, as well as through his writings on power and the cultural apparatus—has had a decisive influence on the sociological study of design and designers; indeed, on designers themselves and on our understanding of design culture. But more than that, I contend that just as sociology and sociologists have wholly embraced Mills’s notion of the sociological imagination, so too must they fully espouse and embody his ideals and practices on design and craftsmanship. It is in this way that the discipline and its practitioners can strive for the standard of excellence that Mills set for himself and for his work." .

They have the potential to teach us important lessons, such as where we came from and subsequently, the people it has made us today. As members of a large, heritage-led, regeneration project, we are working with the Hafod–Morfa Copperworks, a heritage site in the Lower Swansea Valley where there is not much to see or hear. The few ruins at the site make it difficult to imagine what the site would have been like back in its heyday. Our goal at the site is to draw people together, not to view a finished piece of curated heritage, but rather, to start conversations about their memories and the significance of the site to them and to discover what they would like to see at the site in the future. The technology we are producing is about engaging with the local community and stakeholders as groups to provoke discussion. This contrasts with previous uses of mobile guides which only attempt to be tourist aids. In this article, we report on two prototype technologies we have developed to help accomplish this task. Throughout the article, we discuss how and why designing performative technologies could help encourage people to visit, socialise and communicate within the area. Our early results suggest that expressive performative technologies are good at gaining spectators’ attention and encouraging an active engagement between performer and spectator." .

The methods currently available were found to be largely empirical in nature and unsophisticated. The two main quantities used to describe design fires are the heat release rate (pre-flashover scenario) and temperature-time profiles (post-flashover). The most commonly used pre-flashover design fires are t 2 fires, whereas a host of empirical correlations are available for post-flashover design fires." .

The heat transfer across the walls of buildings is modeled using a simple heat diffusion model. In this way, the passive heat storage from the sun (passive solar) and the heat load from internal heat sources are stored in the walls of buildings that provide internal cooling during the day and internal heating at night. The simple analytical model of heat diffusion is used to identify the merit indices for the optimization of affordable passive solar performance. The time dependence of wall/internal temperature is then simulated using a simple finite difference model. The results from the analytical model and finite difference model are validated by conducting temperature measurements in two affordable housing complexes in Egypt. The implications of the results are then discussed for the design of thermal comfort in affordable housing." .

The kingdom style of nobility architecture has endured for hundreds of years, and a few structures may still date to ca. ad 900–1200. The complex floor plans of these large compounds appear to be based upon traditional kingdom social organization that is fast changing, however. Since most structures are still residences, some renovated, a study utilizing both ethnographic fieldwork and the technique of space syntax analysis proved useful to examine historical room meanings and functions and room access. This paper discusses a particular World Heritage site, Ogiamien’s Palace, and other Benin kingdom chieftaincy sites. It describes the symbolic and ritual meanings of residential room use and room plans that on observation show seemingly wide layout variation. The results of the cultural analysis are then compared against the permeability plans and the quantitative formulas of space syntax analysis, to confirm the traditional social nature of spatial use in chieftaincy palaces of the former kingdom and suggest an adherence to an underlying ideological paradigm. This paper takes the additional step of employing the software GraphPad Prism to determine real correlations among calculated values; the results indicate a strong cognitive consistency of design and use for the structures over time in spite of visible layout variability." .

With the continuous compilation, amendment and enforcement of urban planning, the functional structure, spatial environment, street patterns and textures and even the social aspect of cities have changed conspicuously, all of which have directly happened to the spatial forms of the dimension, or even the multi-dimension of a certain city. By describing and analyzing the structure, evolution and explicit tokens of the spatial forms of cities, this thesis attempts to set up a model of factors that affect urban forms, as well as discuss the attributes, protection, adjustment and development-potential of urban land closely associated with forms. In addition, on the basis of the professional features for urban design to participate in the modeling and construction-management of desirable spatial forms of cities, the author has put forward technical measures for quantitatively appraising and analyzing the large-scaled spatial forms of cities, thus offering technical support to municipal governments and management departments of planned construction." .

These buildings not only reduce negative environmental impact but also improve human comfort and safety. Sustainable Buildings need to be assessed by ‘Assessment tool’ for checking its overall contribution towards achievement of ‘sustainability’. In this paper an attempt is made to know Indian Architects ‘perceptions’ and ‘preferences’ regarding the framework of “Sustainable Building Assessment Tool (SBAT)” for India. Feedbacks were collected from the Architects of major metro cities of India. Total 81 responses were analyzed with SPSS 12 statistical analysis software. Indian Architects’ gave an opinion that ‘SBAT’ for India should be prepared firstly for commercial buildings. It should target ‘Architects’ first and must be applied at the building level. ‘SBAT’ should be a comprehensive one with flexible and easy to calculate scoring system. ‘SBAT’ must cover non-controllable factors along with negative scoring system. Results can be utilized in the coming years to prepare a comprehensive ‘SBAT’ for developing country like India." .

We argue that a focus on decision-making in design is necessary for understanding participation in design. Referring to Schön we see design as involving creating choices, selecting among them, concretizing choices and evaluating the choices. We discuss how these kinds of activities have played out in four PD projects that we have participated in. Furthermore, we show that the decisions are interlinked, and discuss the notion of decision linkages. We emphasize the design result as the most important part of PD. Finally, participation is discussed as the sharing of power, asking what the perspective of power and decision-making adds to the understanding of design practices." .

Every application in the family obeys these architectural restrictions. Such frameworks are typically delivered as collections of inter-dependent abstract classes, together with their concrete subclasses. The abstract classes and their interdependencies implicitly realize the architecture. Developing a new application reusing classes of a framework requires a thorough understanding of the framework architecture. We introduce an approach called “Design by Framework Completion”, in which an exemplar (an executable visual model for a minimal instantiation of the architecture) is used for documenting frameworks. We propose exploration of exemplars as a means for learning the architecture, following which new applications can be built by replacing selected pieces of the exemplar. For the piece to be replaced, the inheritance lattice around its class provides the space of alternatives, one of these classes may be suitably adapted (say, by sub-classing) to create the new replacement. “Design by Framework Completion” proposes a paradigm shift when designing in presence of reusable components: It enables a much simpler “top-down” approach for creating applications, as opposed to the prevalent “search for components and assemble them bottom-up” strategy. We believe that this paradigm shift is essential because components can only be fitted together if they all obey the same architectural rules that govern the framework." .

Means of escape is one of the most important design aspects in building designs. Alternative means of escape is often required for any large room,where the maximum travel distance, the number of occupants, or the total floor area, exceeds the code prescribed limit. Whilst the definition of the alternative means of escape, and the purpose of providing alternative means of escape, are the same for all countries, the criterion to be satisfied as alternative means of escape varies from code to code. This paper examines the actual performance requirement for alternative means of escape, and proposes performance criteria to examine the alternative means of escape. Such an approach can be used in a performance-based fire safety design. This paper further examines situations where means of escape will exist only for a short time, after which the escape route will be affected by fire. A methodology is proposed,and examples are given to illustrate the use." .

BIM is a process of generating and managing data during a building’s life cycle. It can be used to demonstrate the entire building’s life cycle, including its construction and operation. Because the design of a build may vary from an abstract shape to precise details, the building’s database should vary accordingly. To store, manage and utilize the building’s data efficiently, we suggest an evolving database structure for our design aid system. A case study verifies that the system can acquire data from CAD, run a number of simulations and generate Pareto solutions automatically during several design stages." .

In the building sector, the primary energy-saving target allocated during the 11 FYP period is 100 Mtce. Savings are expected to be achieved through the strengthening of enforcement of building energy efficiency codes, existing building retrofits and heat supply system reform, followed by energy management of government office buildings and large-scale public buildings, adoption of renewable energy sources. To date, China has reported that it achieved the half of the 20% intensity reduction target by the end of 2008; however, little has been made clear on the status and the impact of the building programs. There has also been lack of description on methodology for calculating the savings and baseline definition, and no total savings that have been officially reported to date. This paper intends to provide both quantitative and qualitative assessment of the key policies and programs in building sector that China has instituted in its quest to fulfill the national goal. Overall, this paper concludes that the largest improvement for building energy efficiency were achieved in new buildings; the program to improve the energy management in government and large scale public buildings are in line with the target; however, the progress in the area of existing building retrofits, particularly heating supply system reform lags behind the stated goal by a large amount." .

Despite such growth, there is not a shared understanding of many aspects of the tourism development framework for all kinds of agricultural heritage sites. Given that meanings and characteristics are critical to determining the appeal of a particular activity among tourism consumers and because the development directions of AHST are essential for achieving heritage conservation goals, a study was conducted in 2014–2015 to assess stakeholder preferences for definitional phrases and their perceptions. This manuscript summarizes the characteristics of AHST in four aspects, taking agricultural heritage systems in China as examples: 1) synthesis of agritourism, cultural heritage tourism, and ecotourism; 2) annual variation of tourism attractions and activities; 3) the dominant role of artisan farmers; 4) the unique gastronomic experiences of traditional food. Finally, there are some objectives offered by this research from economic, environmental, cultural, social and political perspectives to build a framework of AHST according to its features and characteristics. Based on environmental and cultural objectives, with political and social support, through reaching the core objectives of economic development, AHST will be sustainable and agricultural heritage systems will be well conserved. This study carries important implications for the further applications of AHST." .

This paper focuses on the question: is the framework of generic elements that we developed for explicating the design process helpful to compare the differences in architectural design approaches? The results of interviewing a variety of 15 architectural, urban and landscape designers show all kinds of personal approaches that have a set of five underlying generic elements in common. Therefore, the framework may be helpful for teachers and students to describe these personal approaches and may help students in understanding differences and similarities and in finding out what their own personal approach may be." .

Almost all of these investigations have been undertaken since the introduction of the Victorian Heritage Act 1995. With the Act recently under review, it is timely to look back on the lessons learned by heritage managers and archaeologists over the last 25 years. It is also an opportunity to review current practices to ensure that future site investigations are conducted efficiently and achieve meaningful outcomes. How can information obtained from the previous 150 projects inform and enhance the research frameworks of future work? What can we learn about Melbourne’s historical archaeology that we do not already know? How can community benefits be optimized? This paper will evaluate the successes and failures associated with the implementation of historical archaeology legislation in an urban setting and consider how the past 25 years of archaeology in the city can inform our approach to future opportunities in the field." .

It puts the social component of the city into relationship with the destroyed and dangerous urban environment. In the period between 1992 and 1996 in Sarajevo and in other Bosnian cities, survival became the most important activity for citizens. In the period directly preceding the war, urban conditions—mobility, infrastructure, and services—started to malfunction. As a result, ordinary city life became an object of new urban imageries influenced by new urban conditions and rules of behavior. The first bombing of the city on 6 April 1992 was a sign that the war had started. It brought with it war urban conditions: lack of public transport, electricity, water, and food. The inability of the city and the people living in it to function normally demanded new patterns of urban resilience, which were partly a product of the city’s prewar conditions. Using Sarajevo as a case study, this article examines whether the city had predisaster coping strategies and, if so, the extent to which these plans were used during the war. Finally, the article observes how citizens, with their own imageries about cities, can participate in the creation of patterns of urban resilience and future predisaster strategies." .

The goals of this study were to characterize the different interactions meeting participants had with design artifacts, to identify bottlenecks in the design coordination process, and to develop design considerations for CSCW technology that will support in-person design coordination meetings of building design teams. We found that gesturing, navigation, annotation, and viewing were the four primary interactions meeting participants had with design artifacts. The form of the design information (2D vs. 3D, digital vs. physical) had minimal impact on gesture interactions, although navigation varied significantly with different representations of design information. Bottlenecks in the design process were observed when meeting participants attempted to navigate digital information, interact with wall displays, and access information individually and as a group. Based on our observations, we present some possible directions for future CSCW technologies, including new mechanisms for digital bookmarking, interacting with 2D and 3D design artifacts simultaneously, and enriched pointing techniques and pen functionality." .

Acceptable levels specified for area damage and fatality rate will provide design values for means of escape facilities, fire resistance and size of compartments, and other passive measures. Subject to these levels, the building's design can be altered, depending on active fire protection measures." .

Throughout most of this cultural area, the practice of orienting civic and ceremonial buildings followed similar principles, although regional and time-dependent variations are present. Analysis of alignment data has revealed the existence of distinct and widespread orientation groups; most refer to sunrises and sunsets on particular dates, although two groups can be related to lunar and Venus extremes. Astronomically relevant directions frequently dominate considerable parts of urban layouts. The orientation and the location of important buildings often were conditioned by astronomical criteria and beliefs about specific landscape features; particularly notable are structures that were aligned to prominent mountaintops on the local horizon. Based on a variety of contextual data, I interpret the uses and significance of orientations in terms of agricultural concerns, cosmological concepts, and political ideology. I outline the evolution of orientation practices, drawing attention to pan-Mesoamerican trends, regional patterns, and diffusion processes." .

Dissatisfaction with the amount of air motion is very common, with too little air movement cited far more commonly than too much air movement. Workers were also surveyed in a detailed two-season study of a single naturally ventilated building. About one-half the building’s population wanted more air movement and only 4% wanted less. This same ratio applied when the air movement in workspaces was higher than 0.2 m/s, the de facto draft limit in the current ASHRAE and ISO thermal environment standards. Preference for “less air motion” exceeded that for “more” only at thermal sensations of −2 (cool) or colder. These results raise questions about the consequences of the ASHRAE and ISO standards’ restrictions on air movement, especially for neutral and warm conditions." .

This landscape has a multiplicity of values—its geoheritage cannot be separated from its ecological or cultural heritage. When designing a network of heritage sites for such a diversely valued landscape trade-offs must be made between differing and potentially conflicting objectives such as geotourism and geoconservation. To solve this multi-criteria decision problem, sites with potential value for people were designated as heritage sites, adapting the concept of geomorphosites—i.e., geomorphological heritage sites—to represent the intersection of anthropic values. In a GIS-based spatial decision support system heritage values for each site were weighted and ranked using the analytic hierarchy process and scenarios for alternative trail systems, and networks of tourism sites were generated by multi-criteria map overlay analysis and networking algorithms. The scenarios generated show how trade-offs can be made between oft-conflicting tourism and conservation objectives, how the design of parks can be optimized for multiple objectives, and how alternative design strategies can be explored. Such an approach could be used in scenario planning workshops to engage stakeholders in participatory design and consensus-based decision-making driven by geospatial science." .

At this time, the study of architecture from the perspective of geography has significant meaning for treasuring regional characteristics and protecting the essence of ethnic culture. The study of geo-architecture includes two aspects: the influence of geographical environment upon architecture and reflexively, architectural responses to geographical environment. In “Geo-Architecture and Landscape in China’s Geographic and Historic Context Series” (4 volumes), published by Springer Nature in 2016, the contents of “geo-architecture” has been interpreted from various angles as form, function, semantics and symbol. This book is the first to be entitled “Geo-Architecture”, which studies the relationship between geography and architecture from the perspective of geographical environment and historical context in China. The book’s research reveals the influences of different geographical scales, such as zone (macro), region (middle) and site (micro) scales, on architecture; it discusses dynamic and systematic thought, including such research elements as “Object-Subject-Time”, and it reflects views on pattern and process of cultural landscape. Research on geo-architecture aims to help construct the security pattern of the cultural landscape for the new requirements of a new era, which is used to optimize spacial structure, stimulate heritage conservation and renewal, respect the geographical environment, pay attention to historical culture and sustain emotional memory." .

Efficient use of the fully differential architecture nevertheless requires a completely symmetrical layout and routing, which may contradict with the requirements of component matching. Some design choices have to be made at this point, depending on what requirements can be compromised. This paper discusses the importance of certain layout features which may serve as a guide in making these design choices." .

We make use of survey data collected for the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area, a large Western European city known for its rich cultural heritage and the semi-legalized use of cannabis. The econometric analysis shows that trip purposes are associated with substantial differences in total daily expenditure as well as on budget shares. However, the results also show that the activities undertaken by tourists are not limited to their (initial) trip purposes." .

However, this transfer from private car to these more sustainable modes is only a real alternative where distances are small and the public transport supply competitive enough. This paper proposes a methodology to calculate the number of trips that can be transferred from private car to other modes in city centres. MethodThe method starts analyzing which kind of trips cannot change its mode (purposes, conditions, safety , etc.), and then setting a process to determine under which conditions trips made by car between given O-D pairs can be transferable. Then, the application of demand models allow to determine which trips fulfil the transferability conditions. The process test the possibility of transfer in a sequential way: firs to walking, then cycling and finally to public transport. ResultsThe methodology is tested through its application to the city of Madrid (Spain), with the result of only some 18% of the trips currently made by car could be made by other modes, under the same conditions of trip time, and without affecting their characteristics. Out of these trips, 75% could be made by public transport, 15% cycling and 10% on foot. The possible mode to be transferred depends on the location: city centre areas are more favourable for walking and cycling while city skirts could attract more PT trips. ConclusionsThe proposed method has demonstrated its validity to determine the potential of transferring trips out of cars to more sustainable modes. Al the same time it is clear that, even in areas with favourable conditions for walking, cycling and PT trips, the potential of transfer is limited because cars fulfil more properly special requirements of some trips and tours." .

The physical urban environment can be shaped through various planning and design processes including urban planning, urban design, landscape architecture, infrastructure design, architecture, and transport planning. The resultant urban environment has important impacts on the health of the people who live and work there. Urban planning and design processes can also affect health equity through shaping the extent to which the physical urban environments of different parts of cities facilitate the availability of adequate housing and basic infrastructure, equitable access to the other benefits of urban life, a safe living environment, a healthy natural environment, food security and healthy nutrition, and an urban environment conducive to outdoor physical activity. A new research and action agenda for the urban environment and health equity in LMICs should consist of four main components. We need to better understand intra-urban health inequities in LMICs; we need to better understand how changes in the built environment in LMICs affect health equity; we need to explore ways of successfully planning, designing, and implementing improved health/health equity; and we need to develop evidence-based recommendations for healthy urban planning/design in LMICs." .

In Kuala Lumpur for example, public transport services are somewhat poor in part because of the failure of major operators to secure ample funding. Previous funding programs implemented in the city have failed to produce a replicable model for financing public transport. Due to numerous financial problems and the dismal performance of privately owned transport firms, the State has in the recent past emerged as a key source of funding for the public transport sector in Kuala Lumpur. This article argues that, despite the insuperable challenges, prospects for the future funding of public transport in Kuala Lumpur appears to be good. The article also draws lessons from both Tokyo and Hong Kong. In order to address the funding deficit facing the public transport industry in the city it is crucial that more viable strategies and policies such as value capture and public–private sector partnerships are adopted by the urban authorities." .

A recent research project sponsored by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE, RP-884) critically evaluated these assumptions by statistically analysing a large database of research results in building comfort studies from all over the world (n=22,346). The results reported in this paper indicated a clear dependence of indoor comfort temperatures on outdoor air temperatures (instead of outdoor effective temperature ET* used in RP-884), especially in buildings that were free-running or naturally ventilated. These findings encourage significant revisions of ASHRAE’s comfort standard in terms of climatically relevant prescriptions.

The study is distinguished by its breadth of coverage, for it includes tertiary sectors and activities. Although impacts in tertiary activities are often not included in assessments of the potential impacts of climatic change, many of these activities are very important to the U.K. economy, and therefore even a small perturbation in output due to a weather extreme can have significant implications for the economy as a whole. The activities and sectors studied include energy consumption, retailing and manufacturing, construction and buildings, tourism, health, human behaviour, and fires. Both negative and positive impacts were incurred within most sectors. Net positive impacts (to the general public) were found convincingly for energy consumption and health, and clear negative impacts for buildings insurance and fires. Sectors which show clear differences in their response to winter and summer warm anomalies are energy consumption, tourism and health (greater sensitivity to winter anomalies) and buildings insurance and fires (greater sensitivity to summer anomalies). Changes in sensitivity to climate extremes may have occurred over time, and a comparison of impacts of the 1995 anomalous weather with the unusually warm dry period of 1975–1976 is approached for several series." .

This paper mainly discussed the features of urban land use in economic developed coastal cities: one is that the index of urban land per person in middle-small cities was higher than in large cities; another is that urban land has not been used highly and strongly; the third is that the industrial land occupied an irrationally large percentage of whole urban land; the final is that rural enterprises took up a quantity of land. Thereafter, this paper put forward five land-saving measures: first, to adopt the idea of saving land; next, to adjust the land-use structure when redeveloping the old city and alternate some land use when adjusting the industry structure of the city; the third, to develop the system of payment for using land and the management of urban planning; finally to enhance the effective regional plan and the urban landuse plan." .

The distribution of draft sensation shows that only 25.7, 38.5, and 28.7% of the subjects in winter, spring, and summer, respectively, felt that the available air movement was just right, suggesting that indoor air velocity may be a big problem in naturally ventilated buildings in humid subtropical China. Air movement preferences show that 15.8, 61.3, and 80.6% of subjects in winter, spring, and summer, respectively, wanted more air movement. Only a handful of subjects wanted less air movement than they were actually experiencing in any season, suggesting that draft was not much of an issue for thermal comfort. Occupants’ preference for air movement is strongly related to thermal sensation, showing that people want to control air movement as a means of improving their comfort. The demand for less air movement under cool sensation is much smaller than the overwhelming demand for more air movement when the sensation was warm. The above results indicate that air movement might have a significant influence over the respondents’ comfort sensation and that people required a high level of air movement in order to be comfortable during the summer season. Thus, one efficient way to improve the thermal environment in summer in humid subtropical China could be to provide occupants with effective natural ventilation and allow personal control of the air movement. Our findings are also applicable to other buildings, to encourage designers to provide air movement as a low energy cooling strategy and to ensure that sufficient levels of air movement are available." .

To make sure that they eventually choose the most optimal one, they have to keep on collecting information, reconsidering continuously whether their own decisions are still justified in the light of the latest insights. We have studied the role of iteration during instructional design. For our research, we have used an ISD-based method for the specification of training simulators. During our empirical evaluation study, we introduced five events that are likely to cause iteration. The results show that the quality of the designs is not directly related to the amount of iteration. We conclude that there are different kinds of iteration, triggered by different kinds of actions and events. We propose a list of triggers for iteration some of which originate from outside (new information, new opinions/arguments and acquisition procedures); others are caused by, or evolve from interaction with the design process itself (discovery of missing input, need to repair errors, new insights based on work later on in the design process, and new ideas of the designers)." .

The stability of a slope should be increased by drainage, by stabilizing berms, etc., and the buildings should be founded as deep as possible. When the slope is formed of clay soils its angle of dip should not be greater than 8 degrees. The importance of this question induced the authors to report on a case of a building-up of a slope dipping 10 degrees, formed by clay and situated in the boundary area between the Bohemian Massif and the Carpathians. The items of statical character, e.g. the horizontal forces acting on piles can be evaluated using the finite element method." .

The critical political situation in the country urges the development of cultural heritage management policies in order to protect it more thoroughly and consistently. Moving on from the numerous international initiatives and projects dealing with a mostly “remote” approach to the issue, the project here presented to engages with staff members of the Department of Antiquities (DoA) in the development of a joint strategy for the application of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) to the preservation and monitoring of Libyan cultural heritage. A series of training courses resulted in an initial development of new ways of recording and analysing field data for a better awareness of the full range of threats that the archaeology of the country is subject to. Focussing on the case of the Jebel Nafusa, the training involved the assessment of site visibility on satellite imagery, the analysis of high-resolution satellite datasets for archaeological mapping, the creation of a GIS spatial database of field data, and the mapping of risks and threats to archaeology from remote sensing data. This led to the creation of of a risk map showing the areas that are affected by a number of threats, thus giving the DoA a tool to prioritise future fieldwork to keep the assessment of site damage up to date. Only a collaborative approach can lead to a sustainable strategy for the protection of the invaluable cultural heritage of Libya." .

Two main groups of reasons have been revealed for the change in a city’s location: catastrophes and state administrative decisions. At different historical stages, the reason for the migration of cities changed. In the 20th century, the transfer of hundreds of villages and tens of cities in Russia is mainly related to the creation of large flatland reservoirs. Relocated cities possess significant resources of geographic imagination, which can be used for their stable development." .

Bike Score® is a metric capturing environmental characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between and within-city variability in cycling behavior. MethodsWe used linear regression to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities. ResultsAt the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 % (95 % CI: 0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 %) in many North American cities. Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores (>90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 % higher (β = 4.0, 95 % CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0–25). City specific analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 %. ConclusionsThe Bike Score metric was associated bicycle mode share between and within cities, suggesting its utility for planning bicycle infrastructure." .

The move has an impact on how technology is understood and its relation to architecture conceived.

Such exclusion often arises because of a mismatch between designers’ perceptions of the wants and needs of the end-user and their actual wants and needs. Sometimes the mismatch originates from the designer being unaware of the need to design inclusively, or of methods for implementing inclusive design. Other times the mismatch comes from the commissioner of the design, for example the client of a design consultancy. If the design commissioner specifies a target socio-economic group, but does not explicitly recognise that the group consists of users of varying functional capabilities, then the designers will often be given a design brief that overlooks the need to address the wider range of users, beyond simply the able-bodied. In either case, for universal access to be achieved effectively, information is required to identify the need for inclusive design and thus to generate demand, and design guidance is needed to help designers make inclusive design a reality. Currently, that information is largely unavailable to designers in an appropriate off-the-shelf format. This paper investigates methods for researchers to provide the kind of information that HCI designers need to design for universal access. It focuses on the profiling, recruitment and selection of users, along with the interpretation of the data gathered. In many instances, the HCI designer may also be the person performing the research, where specialist researchers are not available." .

New hotels, office blocks, housing projects and most recently shopping centres have become a prominent feature of the landscape in several districts of the city. The paper first outlines a conceptualisation of the `Transition' in terms of eastern Europe as a whole identifying internationalisation, Europeanisation and national government policies as key strands in a specific case of a process of change interpreted as the interaction of antecedent conditions and current processes. It then addresses the question of conceptualising the built environment in terms of the `Transition' and three `schools of thought' in geography stressing the urban morphogenesis approach. It thus poses the question of how radical a change has `occurred on the ground' since 1989–1990. Consequently the paper examines the transition in the built environment of Budapest under three principal headings: (a) the antecedent conditions of the built environment of Budapest by spatial structure, (b) the relationship between new buildings and current processes, (c) comparing models of the spatial structure of Budapest as a socialist city and as a post-socialist-(industrial) city or post-industrial (capitalist) city. It concludes that although the processes shaping the city's built environment have changed quite radically since 1990 the physical fabric of the city and its antecedent usage have strongly influenced the spatial impact of the current processes. Budapest is a post-socialist industrial city with capitalist forms fitted into it. The city is passing from socialist to capitalist processes in a way that suggests that morphological analysis has clear potential in theorising the relationship between the global and the local." .

Planning for implementation of urban transportation programs, particularly during periods of rapidly changing human values, requires a continuing re-evaluation of both technical and organizational strategies and their interrelationships. This paper raises some fundamental questions about the traditional activities and relationships that have characterized most urban transportation planning programs in the past. It also suggests a number of strategies, both technical and organizational, that may contribute to the implementation of plans and programs resulting from the transportation planning process. The first portion of this paper discusses the implications of not providing transportation services to match metropolitan growth. The experience of the Washington Metropolitan Area over the past decade is used to illustrate these implications. A discussion of organizational and institutional constraints upon the planning process follows. Then, the implications for the planning process are explored, and the scale of planning is reviewed as well as the need for monitoring the performance and impact of facilities. Next, the paper deals with the need to broaden the range of solutions to transportation problems, including consideration of economic and land development policies to reduce travel demand, as well as the provision of new facilities. Finally, techniques for involving decision-makers in the planning process are discussed. Examples of special project activities in the Washington area are used to illustrate these techniques and their value." .

This paper investigates simple economic models of bus demand, examines alternative variables that can be used and discusses some alternative model forms. It demonstrates the results of a model using data from twelve urban bus operators in Britain and compares the results with those from other types of study. The model utilises fare and service quality elasticities to explain the decline in passengers on urban bus services, and derives an average elasticity with respect to fare changes of −0.31 and with respect to service quality changes of +0.62. It is estimated that fare rises accounted for 13% of the 43% decline in passengers over the last fifteen years, vehicle mileage reductions for 14.3% and that only 15.7% was due to such factors as rising car ownership which are often given as the cause of declining bus patronage. The results, by showing that passengers are far more sensitive to changes in service than they are to fare rises, are a useful guide to the broader public transport policy issues, and the paper concludes that the model does provide a useful method of forecasting public transport demand at a strategic level. Further work is needed, however, to establish more accurate forecasts for different types of passenger and studies are now being undertaken to establish these and to construct an operational forecasting model that can be applied with only limited data requirements" .

We observe an increase in the average level of satisfaction with the commute to work of participants who switch to public transport after the temporary intervention. This increase is sustained to some extent several months after the intervention. Moreover, participants’ dissatisfaction is almost eliminated. We conclude that public transport use incentives are promising not only for encouraging sustainable travel behavior but also for increasing people’s satisfaction." .

These building systems were exposed to typical summer and winter climatic scenarios for latitudes 10, 34, and 50 N. Systematic variations of interior building temperatures were also introduced. The resultant changes in the components of the systems' energy budgets were examined with respect to cause and effect. The simulations produced a variety of unexpected features which intuitively had not been anticipated. It is believed that energy budget features of real cities cannot vary drastically from those simulated, and described in this report." .

The Kano model has been found to be a useful tool to establish the relationship between performance criteria and customer satisfaction. To achieve the desired customer satisfaction weight of each product criteria is determined by using Kano model. This study presents an integrative design approach combining the Kano model, Taguchi method and grey relation analysis to obtain the optimal combination of shape parameters and aesthetic aspects.

In this paper, we will construct a new simple 3 − (2 m , 7, 14/3 (2 m − 8)) design from codewords of Hamming weight 7 in the Z 4-Goethals code for odd m ≥ 5. For 3 arbitrary positions, we will count the number of codewords of Hamming weight 7 whose support includes those 3 positions. This counting can be simplified by using the double-transitivity of the Goethals code and divided into small cases. It turns out interestingly that, in almost all cases, this count is related to the value of a Kloosterman sum. As a result, we can also prove a new Kloosterman sum identity while deriving the 3-design." .

When dealing with transit design in real systems, detailed descriptions of cities are too complex to allow an analytical formulation that leads to exact results, so heuristics have been used. Alternatively, optimal design of transit systems at a strategic level has been done based on simplified descriptions using regular patterns or small networks to face and solve ad-hoc transit design problems. In this paper we propose a parametric description of cities for the normative analysis of transit systems. This is achieved after a synthesis of different ways to describe a city’s urban form that can be found in the literature, with an emphasis on the road network and the role of centers and subcenters. These diverse descriptions are assessed with the help of topological indicators and synthetic information regarding real cities. The parameters characterize the underlying network, the zones involved and the spatial pattern of transport demand, such that the design of public transport systems can be studied normatively for different city shapes. The model is applied to describe three very different real cities." .

If these needs and consequent roles of heritage, whether for the political legitimacy of governments, for social and ethnic cohesion, for individual identification with places and groups, or for the provision of economic resources in heritage industries change rapidly, then clearly we expect the content and management of that heritage to do likewise. The cities of Central Europe have long been the heritage showcases that reflected the complex historical and geographical patterns of the region's changing governments and ideologies. The abrupt economic and political transition and reorientation of the countries of Central Europe has thus, unsurprisingly, led to many equally abrupt changes in the content and management of urban heritage throughout the region. The uses made of heritage are clearly drastically changing but so also is the way that heritage is currently managed. What is happening, as well as how, is however uncertain and investigated here. The revolutionary eradication of a rejected past, a return to some previous pasts or the beginnings of a new past in the service of a new present are all possibilities. Answers are sought to these questions through the examination of a selection of cases of types of heritage city and their management in the region. These include an archetypical European gem city (Eger, Hungary), a tourist-historic honey-pot (Česky Krumlov, Czechia), a medium-sized multifunctional city (Gdansk, Poland), a major metropolis (Budapest, Hungary), the relict anomaly (Kaliningrad/ Königsberg, Russia) and the national cultural centre of Weimar." .

Insects and rapid changes in humidity are among the main causes of deterioration. To preserve antique wooden buildings, nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are required. Various methods of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) such as X-ray, stress wave, drilling resistance test, and ultrasound are used to inspect the safety of wooden antique buildings. The ultrasonic method is relatively simple, inexpensive, and accurate. The rafters are one of the main components of antique buildings and are seriously affected by deterioration. This study aimed to develop a nondestructive ultrasonic technique for evaluation of wooden rafter deterioration. Regression models describing the relationship between the artificial deterioration of the specimen and ultrasonic parameters were proposed. The method was found to be reliable for evaluating wooden rafter deterioration." .

Demand response is one of the emerging tools in this new landscape. Targeting service sector buildings, we investigated a tariff driven demand response model as a means to shave electrical peak loads and thus reducing grid balancing energy. In this paper is presented a software framework for load shifting which uses a tariff signal for the electric energy as minimization target. The framework can be used both on top of an existing building management system to shift heat generation towards low-tariff times, as well as to simulate load shifting for different buildings, heat pumps and storage configurations. Its modular architecture allows us to easily replace optimizers, weather data providers or building management system adapters. Our results show that even with the current TOU tariff system, up to 34 % of cost savings and up to 20 % reduction in energy consumption can be achieved. With Sub-MPC, a modified MPC optimizer, we could reduce computing times by a factor 50, while only slightly affecting the quality of the optimization." .

The impacts of the building sector can be reduced drastically by implementing a net-zero approach in both design and sustainability management of buildings. Net-zero building is a building system that uses sustainable materials and produces its needed energy and water throughout its life cycle. Unlike green buildings, there is a limited number of sustainability rating systems for net-zero buildings (e.g., Living Building Challenge). Despite the importance of geographical characteristics and local environmental conditions, spatial consideration in green and net-zero buildings is largely lacking in the literature. Considering the variability of environmental behavior around the globe and its significant effects on energy, water demands, and availability of construction materials, it is a major shortcoming to ignore the role of geography in net-zero buildings. This paper discusses a new methodology in the assessment of net-zero buildings by integrating regional characteristics and life cycle sustainability assessment. The methodology outlined in this paper can assist in sustainability design and decision making of net-zero buildings." .

Daily, hourly, and degree-day indices were applied to hourly data to evaluate the difference within the complex urban environment of Florence. Stations were grouped in four clusters with similar thermal regimes in each season. Our results evidence a mean difference of almost 2°C between the hottest and the coolest cluster in all seasons. Furthermore, the coolest cluster had on average more than ten frost days in winter and the hottest cluster more than 12 summer days in summer. The intra-urban difference of tropical nights was even more evident, with values of 42 versus 10 days between the hottest and the coolest cluster during the summer period. The results of this study contribute to quantify the thermal intra-urban differences in the city of Florence, suggesting important applications in plant phenology, aerobiology, human health, urban planning, and biometeorology." .

It suggests that a locally appropriate theoretical framework for heritage management and archaeological research can only be achieved if this local approach is taken into consideration and integrated into archaeological and heritage methodologies. The lack of qualified Somalis and indigenous perspectives in the archaeological research and heritage management policies characterizes Somali cultural heritage and archaeological research history. This research shows that previous approaches that have been pursued lacked dialogue and incorporation of local views of heritage practice. This lack of dialogue has been of paramount importance for the failure of the preservation of Somali cultural heritage, evident both in the previous neglect of its preservation and in the current looting and destruction of archaeological sites in Somaliland, Puntland and south-central Somalia. It is demonstrated how Somali indigenous perspectives are concurring and contributing to world heritage management and archaeological research methods. I suggest that any heritage work must integrate local approaches and trained local groups should lead archaeological research and heritage management in order to achieve sustainable development and self-representation." .

According to the information about the works performed by various organizations — from wide practical use to research and development — the following aspects of using jet geotechnology in construction are known: jet grouting, by means of which various geotechnical problems are solved, including the construction of grout curtains, stabilization of soils, creation of supporting and retaining members in the foundations of structures and in the construction of underground structures; excavation of frozen ground by forming workings of various purposes (for supports, for uncovering places of damage to underground supply lines, etc.) or separating the ground into blocks with their subsequent removal by earthmoving or underground mechanisms; construction of various types of drainage, increasing the operating efficiency of water wells; compaction of collapsing soils by soaking, including with the use of limiting the sections being compacted by cuts; trenchless laying of pipelines and other supply lines. In addition to this, jet geotechnology is used in mining, for instance, for mining sandy soils. Jet geotechnology can be used both as an independent type of work and together with other technologies. Compared with alternative methods, jet geotechnology has a number of technical and economic advantages such as high output, mobility of equipment, possibility of conducting works both during new construction and in the foundations of existing structures, and in a number of cases unique problems can be solved with the use of this technology. All this permits hoping for the wide use and development of jet geotechnology in construction." .

Although this definition is inevitably subjective, the Standard gives formulae for two thermal comfort indices, predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD). The PMV formula is based on principles of heat balance and experimental data collected in a controlled climate chamber under steady-state conditions. The PPD formula depends only on PMV. Although these formulae are widely recognized and adopted, little has been done to establish measurement uncertainties associated with their use, bearing in mind that the formulae depend on measured values and tabulated values given to limited numerical accuracy. Knowledge of these uncertainties are invaluable when values provided by the formulae are used in making decisions in various health and civil engineering situations. This paper examines these formulae, giving a general mechanism for evaluating the uncertainties associated with values of the quantities on which the formulae depend. Further, consideration is given to the propagation of these uncertainties through the formulae to provide uncertainties associated with the values obtained for the indices. Current international guidance on uncertainty evaluation is utilized." .

Some companies have leveraged this natural synergy but many remain on the sidelines, unable to fully exploit the potential offered by BIM in green projects. Moreover, most literature focus on technical aspects of BIM use while ignoring social and cultural aspects of its application. This narrow, tactical focus can undermine the synergy between BIM and green building, and prevent achieving strategic, sustainable goals. The objectives of this article are to: (1) review BIM status in the context of social and cultural sustainability within the building industry; and also, (2) propose criteria for furthering integrative applications that achieve social and cultural sustainability in the green building industry. Five layers of social and cultural sustainability were identified and classified within a framework of BIM applications for purposes of analyzing guidelines and standards. The proposed criteria relates to complexity found in the green building industry and uses BIM integration capability in attempt to achieve social and cultural integration. The criteria proposed serve as a basis for evaluation of BIM performance and therefore, as a solution to mitigate differences in existing guidelines and standards." .

The risk in early design (RED) method plays a significant role in identifying failure modes by functions, and these modes are then analyzed through modeling equations or lifespan analyses, in such a manner that emphasizes variables under the designers’ control. With the valuable insight this method provides, informed decisions can be made early in the process, thereby eliminating costly changes later on." .

In order to detect such small size damages, the analysis of attenuation is required, but elastomeric couplant and inconsistent contact condition of transducer make it difficult, in which only the elastomeric couplant is allowed to be applied to cultural heritage because of the paintings on the surface and the pressure employing transducers make effects on the attenuation measurement. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate if the ultrasonic spectrum analysis can detect internal small hole, in which ultrasonic test was conducted with varied contact pressure. In this study, the diameter of drill hole was only 3 mm and this experiment was carried out under severely varied contact pressure. Nevertheless, spectral analysis with 2nd derivative pretreatment (Root mean square error of prediction, RMSE: 1.609) predicted the number of holes with much higher accuracy than the conventional methods (RMSE: 5.925). This result indicates that the spectral analysis has a high possibility in detection of insect damage in cultural heritage, even though contact condition is not consistent." .

The first study completed in 1999 was designed to assess the potential use of PLM as a safety communication system to support office occupant evacuation. The study measured the occupant premovement time, movement time and evacuation speed in four stairways with different lighting and PLM installations. The positive outcome of the first study regarding a comparable speed of movement in the different stairways used and the conclusive feedback from the evacuees regarding the PLM wayguidance system led to a second study. The second study, completed in 2008, compared 3 stairway installations of PLM markings and a stairway with emergency lighting, which acted as a reference stairway. Results show comparable speed of movement under severe crowd conditions for the 4 stairways studied. Overall, two-thirds of the respondents felt comfortable going down the stairways with PLM markings particularly in the 2 stairways where the marking was installed across each step. The stairway, which had only emergency lighting, and the stairway with L-shaped markers at the edge of each step were less appreciated by the occupants. Occupants commented that the landings and mid-landings were difficult to identify in all the stairways, which suggest that additional marking should be provided in these areas. The findings of these two studies led to the development of a best practice Guide for installation of PLM marking in exit stairways." .

The architectural design, spatial organization, and connection with the natural environment make it a valuable example of residential architecture. The use of local natural materials such as wood, stone, and adobe brick, brings this typology back into the limelight. This study illustrates that due to the increasing need to save energy, the importance to use natural materials, and integration of sustainable design into architectural design processes, our contemporaries turn to past examples in order to reference benchmarks combined with cutting edge technology for buildings of the future. Because Bosnia has large wooded areas, and a policy goal is to use local resources, the research aim was to establish if modern prefabricated wooden houses can reproduce traditional Bosnian architecture while meeting the highest energy efficiency requirements. Many Bosnians fear that traditional Bosnian architecture will be lost due to new construction, therefore there is opposition against the harmonization of standards. The solutions for redesigning traditional Bosnian single-family homes to meet energy efficiency requirements were obtained using the “BuildOpt_VIE” dynamic thermal simulation software. It was used to find optimal solutions in building physics, along with several variations to be applied during construction of new buildings and reconstruction of existing buildings. This research sets a foundation for further developments in contemporary individual residences, optimized according to recent building physics standards. The purpose of this paper is inter alia to show that nothing stands in the way to harmonize technical guidelines and regulations in the field of energy-efficient buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H), and the adaption of existing norms. Despite the EU requirements as mandated in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the rich architecture of B&H has potential to fulfill the directive’s conditions. By selecting the best solutions from the rich architectural tradition of B&H and optimizing the architectural design and building physics, B&H takes a step towards EU integration. Here, we show the possibility to keep traditional architecture while achieving state of the art energy efficiency." .

This paper traces several of the many themes brought together under different professional banners, and shows how a confluence of interest is emerging. The themes are the developments in urban planning analysis, transport and time use studies, telecommunications and industrial location, all of which contribute to the area of locational effects of improved telecommunications technology, and are affected by alterations in the nature of work and the uses made of time by individuals. The convergence of geographical, planning, transportation and communication developments now requires explicit investigation, as the timings of technological and theoretical developments appear to coincide with the emergence of a significant need to do so. Some of the gaps between present knowledge and expertise that need to be filled are specified. These include the investigation of the testing and use of current land use integrated analyses for road and development assessment, investigation of the nature and characteristics of work and education which are most affected by telecommunications and computer support, development of longitudinal monitoring methods for overall urban development leading indicators, exploitation of newly-available cross-sectional household and city data sets in conjunction with historical data for longitudinal investigations and forward projections, accounting for altered family structure and activity patterns and the anticipation and assessment of probable further technological change, which can and will undermine many current long term commitments." .

MethodsA questionnaire was used to investigate the degree of dampness in public apartment houses in Asahikawa, Japan, and its effect on SBS symptoms, involving 480 residents in 64 buildings. Dampness indicators were as follows: condensation on the windowpanes, condensation on the walls and/or closets, visible mold in the bathrooms, visible mold on the walls, window frames, and/or closet, moldy odor, slow drying of the wet towels in bathrooms, water leakage, and bad drainage in bathrooms. ResultsAll dampness indicators except for visible mold in bathrooms had significantly higher odds ratios (ORs) for all or any SBS symptoms after adjustment. The dampness index, the number of positive dampness indicators, was significantly related to all SBS symptoms after adjustment. ConclusionsThere are serious problems relating to dampness in Japanese public housing, which affects the health of residents. There is a need to educate the residents about the relationship between dampness and SBS, and building problems should be rectified." .

However, not all cities give due consideration to cycling issues in the planning process. In many transport systems, cycling and issues of vélomobility are still neglected. Recent research considers several aspects of cycling, however, few studies have shown why differences in for example modal split and bicycle infrastructure exist between cities. This article deals with the differences in cycling issues between Copenhagen and Stockholm and furthermore why such differences occur in these two Scandinavian capitals. The focus here is on transport planning and the dissimilarities in the structures and aspects that have affected the thinking of planners and politicians and the planning outcomes in these two cities. Questions of marginalisation of cyclists in the public space and different planning politics or politics of vélomobility are touched upon. The results are set in a theoretical frame of power relations, mobility theory and political economies. The results show that these two cities have very different planning approaches and economic, structural and cultural presumptions leading to the fact that Copenhagen prioritises cycling, whereas Stockholm focuses more on facilitating public transport and motorised modes of person transport." .

In such conditions, a person’s energy balance is not disturbed because of stresses from extreme heat or cold. Bioclimatic structure has been well researched and should be a consideration in the planning process for arranging comfortable spaces. It represents the understanding that energy balance is one of the basic elements of a sustainable landscape design. The goals of this study have been to create ideal places for human thermal comfort and to advance objectives focused on the importance of sustainable and ecological landscape planning and design work, along with their accompanying economic benefits. In this study, which focuses on the climate of the Province of Aydin, the most suitable areas for bioclimatic comfort have been identified. The climate values for the Aydin Province have been taken from a total of 22 meteorological stations. Stations at altitudes ranging from 11 to 871 m were used to note the climate changes that occurred. The average temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed from each station, including data collected using Geographic Information System (GIS) software, were transferred. GIS maps were then created from the imported data, and areas of optimal comfort around the city of Aydin were determined. The results show the range that is suitable for a bioclimatic comfort zone in Aydin. The bioclimatic comfort range was determined to be roughly 17 °C for Aydin, and the city of Aydin demonstrated a comfort range between 14 and 19 °C. As a result, the city of Aydin was shown to be a suitable area for bioclimatic comfort." .

Using extensive literature review, best value (BV) contributing factors are identified. Experts are involved to get their feedback for shortlisting the identified factors. An ANP-based decision support system has been developed using data collected through a detailed questionnaire survey in the local construction industry for evaluating the selection process. Further, five case studies of completed road construction projects have been used to validate the decision support system. The findings indicate that in almost all the cases, the traditional procurement system, owing to its stringent prequalification measures, subliminally took into consideration the overall value proposition, and only one case study showed anomalies for which detailed reasoning is deliberated. This highlights the tendency of practitioners to overweigh the cost-based criteria, despite an established significance of other factors, treating the intangible value factors of quality, health and safety, environmental impact, etc. as less important. It reflects that the local construction industry attaches marginal value to qualitative factors. The construction industry will benefit from implementation of BV procurement system and a prolonged exposure may help improve its value system to realize the contribution of non-cost-based factors." .

This present essay focuses on how radial geometry can be used as a tool placed for designing comfortable, affordable housing. Octagonal geometry can be used as a tool for controlling nature, or as a system for controlling construction. This duality is synthesized in Fowler’s use of the octagon. The analysis is extended to two other buildings with octagonal plans, one ancient, the Hellenic “Tower of the Winds,” the other contemporary, Álvaro Siza’s “Mickey Mouse House.”" .

This indicates that the routes may in part also be described as Lévy-flights. The latter property may result from the fact that the routes are planned to be adapted to the fluctuating demand densities throughout the served area. We also relate this to optimization properties of Lévy flights." .

To quantify the impact, the Transient System Simulation Program software was used to simulate the heating loads of office buildings in Harbin, Tianjin, and Shanghai, representing three major climate zones (i.e., severe cold, cold, and hot summer and cold winter climate zones) in China during 1961–2010. Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to determine the key climatic parameters influencing heating energy consumption. The results showed that dry bulb temperature (DBT) is the dominant climatic parameter affecting building heating loads in all three climate zones across China during the heating period at daily, monthly, and yearly scales (R 2 ≥ 0.86). With the continuous warming climate in winter over the past 50 years, heating loads decreased by 14.2, 7.2, and 7.1 W/m2 in Harbin, Tianjin, and Shanghai, respectively, indicating that the decreasing rate is more apparent in severe cold climate zone. When the DBT increases by 1 °C, the heating loads decrease by 253.1 W/m2 in Harbin, 177.2 W/m2 in Tianjin, and 126.4 W/m2 in Shanghai. These results suggest that the heating energy consumption can be well predicted by the regression models at different temporal scales in different climate conditions owing to the high determination coefficients. In addition, a greater decrease in heating energy consumption in northern severe cold and cold climate zones may efficiently promote the energy saving in these areas with high energy consumption for heating. Particularly, the likely future increase in temperatures should be considered in improving building energy efficiency." .

The two components of this system – a quantitative approach based on statistical indicators and a qualitative analysis based on the citizens’ perceptions of the conditions of life – are presented. The strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches adopted in the project are reviewed. It is argued that, in order to achieve a deeper understanding and more effective measurement of urban quality of life, both kinds of measurements are useful and complement each other." .

The hypothesis of a double metric scale justifies the modulation size in buildings throughout a long historical period, using a simple and practical procedure whose fundamentals and characteristics are presented here. Validation by other researchers of the method proposed, would be a milestone in the history of the proportion of architecture, a step towards gaining knowledge of a common metric system used since ancient times in the construction of important buildings." .

With the Energy Crisis there is a demand for the promotion of greater saving in energy and efficient use of available energy. This not only has the potential to meet the ever-increasing demand but it must be recognized as an important and sustainable solution for the energy crisis as energy saved is energy produced. Many studies have shown that, to the occupants, the most important consideration is thermal comfort. Thermal comfort is defined by ASHRAE, as that state of mind, which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. The context of the study of thermal comfort is the multi-billion dollar air-conditioning (AC) industry. The need to define ‘comfortable environments’ arose from this industry. Before air-conditioning buildings were built on the experience of countless builders of the past, experience being passed down the generations. One of the more contentious theoretical issues in the applied research area of thermal comfort has been the dialectic between “adaptive” and “static” models. Apart from having disparate methodological bases (the former laboratory-experimental, the latter field-based), the two approaches have yielded starkly differing prescriptions for how the indoor climate of buildings should be managed. These prescriptions carry implications for the types of permissible building designs, the means by which their thermal environments are controlled, and the amounts of energy they consume in the production of habitable indoor climates. Static models have led to indoor climate standards that have been universally applied across all building types, are characterized by minimal recognition of outdoor climatic context, and are contributing to an increased reliance on mechanical cooling. In contrast, proponents of adaptive models have advocated variable indoor temperature standards that more fully exercise the adaptive capabilities of building occupants. This approach potentially leads to more responsive environmental control algorithms, enhanced levels of occupant comfort, reduced energy consumption, and the encouragement of climatically responsive building design. Despite these apparent differences, our review of the research literature emerging from both approaches indicated that this seemingly irreconcilable split was primarily the result of narrow definitions of the term “thermal adaptation”, and that there were opportunities to bridge some of the gap between the hypotheses. This paper attempts to discuss the methods of evaluating the thermal preferences of the people of composite climate for developing an adaptive model of thermal comfort and preference." .

Despite a high level of scholarly interest in climate change impacts on natural and socio-economic systems, a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change on cultural heritage and resources across various continents and disciplines is noticeably absent from the literature. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review methodology to identify and characterize the state of knowledge and how the cultural heritage and resources at risk from climate change are being explored globally. Results from 124 reviewed publications show that scholarly interest in the topic is increasing, employs a wide range of research methods, and represents diverse natural and social science disciplines. Despite such increasing and diverse interest in climate change and cultural heritage and resources, the geographic scope of research is limited (predominantly European focused). Additionally, we identified the need for future studies that not only focuses on efficient, sustainable adaptation planning options but also documents if, and how, the implementation of cultural heritage and resources adaptation or preservation is taking place. This systematic literature review can help direct scholarly research in climate change and cultural heritage and resource area. Ultimately, we hope these new directions can influence policy-making for preservation and adaptation of cultural heritage and cultural resources globally." .
