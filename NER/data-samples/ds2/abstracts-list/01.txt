It is shown that the equations of such a mixture obey Truesdell's third metaphysical principle. Then the governing equations, specialized by assuming that both phases have the same motion, are studied by means of a suitable asymptotic approach. It is derived an evolution equation representing a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation containing also nonlinear terms in the higher order derivatives. Finally, the travelling wave solutions of this evolution equation are discussed." .

The cases considered constitute a particularly simple opportunity to study the mutual consistency of the various assumptions usually used. It is demonstrated that the assumption of unsubtracted dispersion relations for integrals over matrix elements of current commutators leads to contradictions, when applied to all invariants in the kinematic decomposition of the tensors. These difficulties can be avoided only if one accepts operators of isospin one in Schwinger terms. The same contradictions are found, if in the infinitemomentum approach one admits commutators of current time and space components. The equivalence of the two approaches depends on the validity of superconvergence relations for the asymptotic behaviour of some form factors." .

The relative state of a pair or formation of satellites can be controlled via relative accelerations provided by a differential drag force. The drag acceleration of each vehicle can be altered by changing the area of the vehicle in the direction of motion. In research to date, differential drag controllers have been considered separately from state estimation systems that will be used for orbit determination. This paper examines an integrated system that combines a state estimator with a differential drag controller. A Kalman filter is used to estimate position and velocity elements with realistic levels of measurement noise, as well as measurement biases and atmospheric density. A differential drag controller based on the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations is presented that takes estimates from the Kalman filter and determines the appropriate control behavior. Modifications are made to the controller to reduce unnecessary actuations due to relative state error. The integrated system is tested with a nonlinear propagation model including the effects of J 2, dynamic modeling errors, and an altitude-varying atmosphere to determine the controller performance in a realistic mission environment." .

Meanwhile, we provide a better convergence relation for the BB method. The influence of the starting point and the condition number to the convergence rate is comprehensively addressed." .

We wish to characterize such common lines in terms of the unembedded geometric data detected in experiments. MethodsWe use techniques from spherical geometry, real algebraic geometry, and linear algebra. ResultsWe show that common lines are the solutions to a system of polynomial equalities and inequalities, i.e., they form a semi-algebraic set. These polynomials are low degree, and we explicitly derive them in this paper. ConclusionsThe polynomials we derive provide the desired intrinsic characterization of common lines.

Res. 56:607–617, 2008) introduced a multi-level Monte Carlo method for approximating the expected value of a function of a stochastic differential equation solution.

Giles analysed globally Lipschitz payoffs, but also found good performance in practice for non-globally Lipschitz cases. In this work, we show that the multi-level Monte Carlo method can be rigorously justified for non-globally Lipschitz payoffs. In particular, we consider digital, lookback and barrier options.

Researchers, however, rarely employ nonlinear models to examine the determinants and make little effort to identify a superior prediction model among competing ones. This paper reviews the time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) regression and the predictive abilities of neural network (NN) utilizing panel data concerning debt ratio of high-tech industries in Taiwan. We built models with these two methods using the same set of measurements as determinants of debt ratio and compared the forecasting performance of five models, namely, three TSCS regression models and two NN models. Models built with neural network obtained the lowest mean square error and mean absolute error. These results reveal that the relationships between debt ratio and determinants are nonlinear and that NNs are more competent in modeling and forecasting the test panel data. We conclude that NN models can be used to solve panel data analysis and forecasting problems." .

Nevertheless, in recent years, studies of whole populations, e.g., all cases of a certain cancer in a given country, have become more common, and often report p values and confidence intervals regardless of such concerns. With reference to the social science literature, the current paper explores the circumstances under which statistical inference can be meaningful for such studies. It concludes that its use implicitly requires a target population which is wider than the whole population studied — for example future cases, or a supranational geographic region — and that the validity of such statistical analysis depends on the generalizability of the whole to the target population." .

Comprehensive molecular phylogenetic studies have been carried out on many genera in the Poaceae. The different DNA sequences, including nuclear and chloroplast sequences, had been extensively employed to determine relationships at both higher and lower taxonomic levels in the Poaceae. Chloroplast DNA ndhF gene and atpB-rbcL spacer were used to construct phylogenetic trees and estimate the divergence time of Oryzoideae, Bambusoideae, Panicoideae, Pooideae and so on. Complete sequences of atpB-rbcL and ndhF were generated for 17 species representing six species of the Oryzoideae and related subfamilies. Nicotiana tabacum L. was the outgroup species. The two DNA datasets were analyzed, using Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian analysis methods. The molecular phylogeny revealed that H. aristata (Retz.) Nees was the sister to Chikusichloa aquatica Koidz. Moreover, P. coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka was in the genus Oryza.

In this algorithm, like standard CBO, each agent is modeled as a body with a specified mass and velocity and collision occurs between pairs of objects, but unlike the standard CBO, the collision is based on two-dimensional law. In addition, a memory is added to the standard CBO for saving the best-so-far solution. In this paper, a new improved version of the 2D-CBO algorithm, namely Enhanced Two-Dimensional Colliding Bodies Optimization (E2D-CBO), is developed. E2D-CBO has a memory not only for saving the best-so-far solution, but also saving the number of best-so-far solutions and replacing them with the worst solutions in each iteration; moreover, it uses a mechanism to escape from local optima. By applying these changes, the exploitation ability and convergence rate of the 2D-CBO have been improved. The performance of this algorithm is compared to three recently developed meta-heuristic algorithms consisting of the standard CBO, Enhanced CBO and Two-Dimensional CBO algorithms on optimization of grillage system design. The results confirm the superiority of the E2D-CBO in comparison with the previous variants of the CBO algorithm." .

As a result of the Δ m term, the equilibrium value of the between-population variability is increased compared to the corresponding value for deterministic migration by a factor of approximately (1 − m)−2 for small m. An equivalent result is derived for mutation, using the infinite allele model for a single population.

Here we present similarity maps, a straightforward and general strategy to visualize the atomic contributions to the similarity between two molecules or the predicted probability of a ML model.

Most mathematical models for interfaces and transition layers in materials science exhibit sharply localized and rapidly decaying transition profiles. We show that this behavior can largely change when non-local interactions dominate and internal length scales fail to be determined by dimensional analysis: we consider a reduced model for Néel walls, micromagnetic transition layers which are observed in a suitable thin-film regime. The typical phenomenon associated with this wall type is the very long logarithmic tail of transition profiles. Recently, we derived logarithmic upper bounds. Here, we prove that the latter result is indeed optimal. In particular, we show that Néel wall profiles are supported by explicitly known comparison profiles that minimize relaxed variational principles and exhibit logarithmic decay behavior. This lower bound is established by a comparison argument based on a global maximum principle for the non-local field operator and the qualitative decay behavior of comparison profiles." .

Five-day and 10-day predictions of the start and end of the pollen season were also addressed with a nonparametric regression technique combining regression analysis with the method of temperature sum. Our methods were applied to three of the most polluted regions in Europe, namely Lyon (Rhône Valley, France), Legnano (Po River Plain, Italy) and Szeged (Great Plain, Hungary). For a 1-day prediction of both the daily pollen concentration and daily threshold exceedance, the order of these cities from the smallest to largest prediction errors was Legnano, Lyon, Szeged and Legnano, Szeged, Lyon, respectively. The most important predictor for each location was the pollen concentration of previous days. The second main predictor was precipitation for Lyon, and temperature for Legnano and Szeged. Wind speed should be considered for daily concentration at Legnano, and for daily pollen threshold exceedances at Lyon and Szeged. Prediction capabilities compared to the annual cycles for the start and end of the pollen season decreased from west to east. The order of the cities from the lowest to largest errors for the end of the pollen season was Lyon, Legnano, Szeged for both the 5- and 10-day predictions, while for the start of the pollen season the order was Legnano, Lyon, Szeged for 5-day predictions, and Legnano, Szeged, Lyon for 10-day predictions." .

The equations are Laplace transformed, and the nonlinear terms are represented by He’s polynomials. The solutions are obtained in the form of rapidly convergent series with elegantly computable terms. This approach, in contrast to classical perturbation techniques, is valid even for systems without any small/large parameters and therefore can be applied more widely than traditional perturbation techniques, especially when there do not exist any small/large quantities. A good agreement of the novel method solution with the existing solutions is presented graphically and in tabulated forms to study the efficiency and accuracy of IHPTM. This study demonstrates the general validity and the great potential of the IHPTM for solving strongly nonlinear problems." .

The foundation for this analysis is a symmetry-preserving Dyson–Schwinger equation treatment of a vector×vector contact interaction. Our results exemplify and highlight the deep impact of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the hadron spectrum: an accurate description of the meson spectrum entails a similarly successful prediction of the spectrum of baryons, including those with strangeness. The analysis also provides numerous insights into baryon structure. For example, that baryon structure is largely flavour-blind, the first radial excitation of ground-state baryons is constituted almost entirely from axial-vector diquark correlations, and DCSB is the foundation for the ordering of low-lying baryon levels; viz., (1/2)+, (1/2)+, (1/2)−." .

This problem is constrained by various technical limits and can offer different objectives that would provide many benefits to the network. These include minimization of power losses, index of voltage profile, load balancing index, and annual cost saving index which have been considered in this paper. In the present work, the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is employed for optimizing the distribution systems where an optimal location and sizing of DSTATCOM is investigated. In this study, an aggregating operator named Max-geometric mean is used for combination of objectives and providing overall objective function. The scaling of objectives is performed in the fuzzy framework. The proposed algorithm is implemented in 33 and 69 buses IEEE test systems. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the loads of the balanced system is modeled by using a fuzzy technique. Based on the numerical results of this work, one can extract that the performance of the ICA is slightly higher than other meta-heuristic algorithms; hence the introduced approach can be used by utility services for optimal DSTATCOM allocation and sizing in the distribution systems." .

The model represents well-driven flow in terms of an effective permeability for linear flow coupled with an effective near-well skin. This representation is different from previous descriptions, which represent the problem solely in terms of a system-dependent equivalent permeability for radial flow. Extensive comparisons between the model predictions and numerical calculations for single wells and two-well systems in log-normally distributed permeability fields are presented. These results demonstrate the high degree of accuracy of the approximate model over an extensive parameter range. For the problems considered, the method is shown to be more accurate than a previous spatial averaging approach. More importantly, the new method provides a basis for extending existing semianalytical solutions, applicable to homogeneous or layered systems, to more general heterogeneous systems in three dimensions." .

For this, we used 54 CMEs and their interplanetary counterparts (interplanetary CMEs: ICMEs) that constitute the list of events used by the NASA/LWS Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) on CME flux ropes. We considered the location, angular width, and speed as well as the direction parameter, D. The direction parameter quantifies the degree of asymmetry of the CME shape in coronagraph images, and shows how closely the CME propagation is directed to Earth. For the 54 CDAW events, we found the following properties of the CMEs: i) the average value of D for the 23 MCs (0.62) is larger than that for the 31 EJs (0.49), which indicates that the MC-associated CMEs propagate more directly toward the Earth than the EJ-associated CMEs; ii) comparison between the direction parameter and the source location shows that the majority of the MC-associated CMEs are ejected along the radial direction, while many of the EJ-associated CMEs are ejected non-radially; iii) the mean speed of MC-associated CMEs (946 km s−1) is faster than that of EJ-associated CMEs (771 km s−1). For seven very fast CMEs (≥ 1500 km s−1), all CMEs with large D (≥ 0.4) are associated with MCs and the CMEs with small D are associated with EJs. From the statistical analysis of CME parameters, we found the superiority of the direction parameter. Based on these results, we suggest that the CME trajectory essentially determines the observed ICME structure." .

Simulations are performed to investigate the operational characteristics, such as collapse voltage and the resonant frequency of the P-CMUT. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with experimental observation. Having confirmed validity and accuracy of the proposed numerical model, the study of influence of each defined parameter on the collapse voltage and resonant frequency of the P-CMUT are also presented. To solve some conflict problems taken place in diverse physical fields, an integrated multi-objective design method involving electrical and mechanical characterization is developed to optimize the geometric parameters and material properties of the P-CMUT. The optimization search routine conducted using the genetic algorithm (GA) is connected with the commercial FEM software ANSYS to obtain the best design variable using multi-objective functions. The results show that the optimal parameter values satisfy the conflicting objectives of the design procedures, namely to minimize the collapse voltage while simultaneously maintaining a high resonant frequency.

We are able to determine for which k-rowed F we have that forb(m,F) is O(m k−1) and for which k-rowed F we have that forb(m,F) is Θ(m k ). We need a bound for a particular choice of F. Define D 12 to be the k×(2 k −2 k−2−1) (0,1)-matrix consisting of all nonzero columns on k rows that do not have [11] in rows 1 and 2. Let 0 denote the column of k 0’s. Define F k (t) to be the concatenation of 0 with t+1 copies of D 12. We are able to show that forb(m,F k (t)) is Θ(m k−1). Linear algebra methods and indicator polynomials originated in this context in a paper of the authors and Füredi and Sali. We provide a novel application of these methods. The results are further evidence for the conjecture of Anstee and Sali on the asymptotics for fixed F of forb(m,F)." .

Thus, each generalization to non-Euclidean planes turns out to be just another representation of the classical Euclidean cases. We believe that even the Euclidean cases of circle geometries comprise, in principle, already all non-Euclidean cases. Representations of such non-Euclidean circle geometries might also be of interest in themselves. For example, among the planar Cayley–Klein geometries, the quasi-elliptic and quasi-hyperbolic geometry usually are neglected. They can be treated similarly to the isotropic Möbius geometry by suitable projections of the Blaschke cylinder." .

Application fields such as forestry, epidemiology and ecology have been the main engine driving such raised interest. The inclusion of spatially varying covariates in the models for the intensity function is becoming of particular interest, but little attention has been paid to testing the significance of such covariates. Testing the significance of covariates is important if one seeks to explain which covariates have an effect in the spatial or spatio-temporal distribution of the point pattern observed. We thus provide practical procedures to build statistical tests of significance for covariates that have an effect on the intensity function of a point pattern. Our approximation focuses on the conditional intensity function, by considering nonparametric kernel-based estimators. We calculate thinning probabilities under the conditions of absence and presence of a covariate and compare them through divergence measures. Based on Monte Carlo experiments, we approximate the statistical properties of our tests under a variety of practical scenarios. An application on testing the significance of a covariate in a spatio-temporal data set on wildfires is also developed." .

Our main results include a backward Harnack inequality, and the Hölder continuity up to the boundary of quotients of non-negative solutions vanishing on the lateral boundary. Furthermore, to each such solution one can associate a natural Riesz measure supported on the lateral boundary and one of our main result is a proof of the doubling property for this measure. Our results generalize, to the setting of non-linear equations with linear growth, previous results concerning the boundary behaviour, in Lipschitz cylinders and time-independent NTA-cylinders, established for non-negative solutions to equations of the type $$\\partial _tu-\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathrm{A }(x,t)\\nabla u)=0$$ ∂tu-∇·(A(x,t)∇u)=0 , where $$\\mathrm{A }$$ A is a measurable, bounded and uniformly positive definite matrix-valued function.

We present an enhancement to DE that introduces greater diversity while also directing the search to more promising regions. The Combinatorial Sampling Differential Evolution (CSDE) is introduced which can sample vectors in two ways; highly correlated with the search space or around a ‘better’ individual. The CSDE approach can provide a similar number of samples as crossover, without being biased towards the principle coordinate axes of a decision space. This approach to sampling vectors is capable of optimizing problems with extensive parameter interactions. It also demonstrates fast convergence towards the global optimum and is highly scalable in the decision space on a variety of single and multi-objective problems due to the balance between sampling highly directed correlated vectors and non-correlated vectors which contribute to sampling diversity." .

Nevertheless, the assumption is no longer valid for encounters at extremely low velocities, and a new algorithm is urgently needed for computing collision probability for space objects having nonlinear relative motion. In this particular case, the direction associated with relative velocity is reintroduced for integration. The different integral limits would lead to the variations of probability and integral time. Moreover, the application scope of this new algorithm is also presented. Since the nonlinear effect is only significant in some certain situations, the new algorithm needs to be considered only in such certain situations. More specifically, when space objects in circular orbits encounter with a tiny inclined angle (the extreme situation), the new algorithm can derive much more accurate collision probability than the linear method, that is to say, the linearity assumption involved in general collision probability formulation is not adequate anymore. In addition, the deviation of the probability derived by the linear method (linear collision probability) from that derived by the nonlinear method (nonlinear collision probability) also weakly depends on the relative distance and combined covariance, and essentially depends on their ratio." .

Paul Zinn–Justin observed that the Izergin– Korepin formula can be re-expressed in terms of the partition function of a random matrix model with a nonpolynomial interaction. We use this observation to obtain the large N asymptotics of the six-vertex model with DWBC in the disordered phase.

Multi-objective GAs facilitate the evaluation of several model evaluation objectives, and the examination of massive combinations of parameter sets. Typically, the outcome is a set of several equally-accurate parameter sets which make-up a trade-off surface between the objective functions, usually referred to as Pareto set. The Pareto set is a set of incomparable parameter sets as each solution has unique parameter values in parameter space with competing accuracy in the objective function space. As would be required for decision making purposes, a single parameter set is usually chosen to represent the model calibration procedure. An automated framework for choosing a single solution from such a trade-off surface has not been thoroughly investigated in the model calibration literature. As a result, this study has outlined an automated framework using the distribution of solutions in objective space and parameter space to select solutions with unique properties from an incomparable set of solutions. Our Pareto set was generated from the application of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to calibrate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for simulations of streamflow in the Fairchild Creek watershed in southern Ontario. Using cluster analysis to evaluate the distribution of solutions in both objective space and parameter space, we developed four auto-selection methods for choosing parameter sets from the trade-off surface to support decision making. Our method generates solutions with unique properties including a representative pathway in parameter space, a basin of attraction (or the center of mass) in objective space, a proximity to the origin in objective space, and a balanced compromise between objective space and parameter space (denoted BCOP). The BCOP method is appealing as it is an equally-weighted compromise for the distribution of solutions in objective space and parameter space. That is, the BCOP solution emphasizes stability in model parameter values and in objective function values—in a way that similarity in parameter space implies similarity in objective space." .

The space integration is carried out by dividing the cable inton straight elements with equilibrium relationships and geometric compatibility equations satisfied for each element. The position of each element is described by its elevation and azimuth angles and, therefore, a system of 2n non-linear ordinary differential equations is established. The time integration of this set of equations is performed using a high order Runge-Kutta technique.

In this paper, a simple method is presented to obtain an analytical solution for Eshelby's problem of an inclusion of arbitrary shape within an anisotropic plane or half-plane of the same elastic constants. The method is based on an observation that the interface conditions for arbitrary inclusion-shape can be written in a decoupled form in which three unknown Stroh's functions are decoupled from each other. The solution is given in terms of three auxiliary functions constructed by three conformal mappings which map the exteriors of three image curves of the inclusion boundary, defined by three Stroh's variables, onto the exterior of the unit circle. With aid of these auxiliary functions, techniques of analytical continuation can be applied to the inclusion of any shape. The solution is given in the physical plane rather than in the image plane, and is exact provided that the expansion of every mapping function includes only a finite number of terms. On the other hand, if at least one of the mapping functions includes infinite terms, a truncated polynomial mapping should be used, and thus the method gives an approximate solution. A remarkable feature of the present method is that it gives elementary expressions for the internal stress field within an inclusion in an anisotropic entire plane. Elliptical and polygonal inclusions are used to illustrate the construction of the auxiliary functions and the details of the method." .

Firstly, multivariable nonlinear systems were described based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models; assuming that the antecedent parameters of T-S models were kept, the consequent parameters were identified on-line by using the weighted recursive least square (WRLS) method. Secondly, the identified T-S models were linearized to be time-varying state space model at each sampling instant. Finally, by using linear predictive control technique the analysis solution of the optimal control law of AFPFC was established. The application results for pH neutralization process show that the absolute error between the identified T-S model output and the process output is smaller than 0.015; the tracking ability of the proposed AFPFC is superior to that of non-AFPFC (NAFPFC) for pH process without disturbances, the overshoot of the effluent pH value of AFPFC with disturbances is decreased by 50% compared with that of NAFPFC; when the process parameters of AFPFC vary with time the integrated absolute error (IAE) performance index still retains to be less than 200 compared with that of NAFPFC." .

The main point stressed here is that this passage did not consist of successive refinements, a gradual evolution by adaptation as it were, but required radical changes of direction, to be compared to evolution by migration. These conflicts are illustrated by reference to set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. At the end there is a brief autobiographical note, including the touchy point to what extent the original aims of logical foundations are adequate for the broad question of the heroic tradition in the philosophy of mathematics concerned with the ‘nature’ of the latter or, in modern jargon, with the architecture of mathematics and our intuitive resonances to it." .

The purpose of this paper is to carefully study the extent to which finite morphisms of algebraic K-curves are controlled by certain combinatorial objects, called skeleta. A skeleton is a metric graph embedded in the Berkovich analytification of X. A skeleton has the natural structure of a metrized complex of curves. We prove that a finite morphism of K-curves gives rise to a finite harmonic morphism of a suitable choice of skeleta. We use this to give analytic proofs of stronger ‘skeletonized’ versions of some foundational results of Liu-Lorenzini, Coleman, and Liu on simultaneous semistable reduction of curves. We then consider the inverse problem of lifting finite harmonic morphisms of metrized complexes to morphisms of curves over K. We prove that every tamely ramified finite harmonic morphism of Λ-metrized complexes of k-curves lifts to a finite morphism of K-curves. If in addition the ramification points are marked, we obtain a complete classification of all such lifts along with their automorphisms. This generalizes and provides new analytic proofs of earlier results of Saïdi and Wewers. As an application, we discuss the relationship between harmonic morphisms of metric graphs and induced maps between component groups of Néron models, providing a negative answer to a question of Ribet motivated by number theory. This article is the first in a series of two. The second article contains several applications of our lifting results to questions about lifting morphisms of tropical curves." .

However, in this paper, it is showed that if neural networks are used as feedforward compensators instead of feedback ones, then we can ensure the globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of closed-loop systems and determine the neural network approximation domain via the bound of known reference signals. It should be pointed out that this domain is very important for designing the neural network structure, for example, it directly determines the choice of the centers of radial basis function neural networks. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches." .

Countable projective limits are, as in the case of positive measures, particularly simple, the sole condition now being the boundedness of the total variations.

Direct absorption spectra of compounds were used to optimise the spectral data set performs the calibration by PLS-1, PLS-2 and PCR algorithms. These calibration models were evaluated through internal validation (prediction of compounds in its own designed training set of calibration), cross-validation (obtaining statistical parameters that show the efficiency for a calibration fit model) and external validation over synthetic and pharmaceutical mixtures.

This class of problems associated with precedence constraint has been previously modeled and optimized by the authors, in which, it requires a multidimensional optimization at the same time: what to make, how many to make, where to make and the order to make. It is a combinatorial, NP-hard problem, for which no polynomial time algorithm is known to produce an optimal result on a random graph. In this paper, the further development of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for this integrated optimization is presented. Because of the dynamic nature of the problem, the size of its solution is variable. To deal with this variability and find an optimal solution to the problem, GA with new features in chromosome encoding, crossover, mutation, selection as well as algorithm structure is developed herein. With the proposed structure, the proposed GA is able to “learn” from its experience. Robustness of the proposed GA is demonstrated by a complex numerical example in which performance of the proposed GA is compared with those of three commercial optimization solvers." .

For a positive integer N, we define the N-rank of a non singular integer d × d matrix A to be the maximum integer r such that there exists a minor of order r whose determinant is not divisible by N. Given a positive integer r, we study the growth of the minimum integer k, such that A k − I has N-rank at most r, as a function of N. We show that this integer k goes to infinity faster than log N if and only if for every eigenvalue λ which is not a root of unity, the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces relative to eigenvalues which are multiplicatively dependent with λ and are not roots of unity, plus the dimensions of the eigenspaces relative to eigenvalues which are roots of unity, does not exceed d − r − 1.

Numerical examples show that the cocktail algorithm can lead to dramatically improved speed, sometimes by orders of magnitude, relative to either the multiplicative algorithm or the vertex exchange method (a variant of VDM).

In Coulomb’s charges method, Laplace’s equation is solved for the electric field distribution in rock medium with internal boundaries between different resistivity layers. There, the boundary problem is reduced to Fred-holm integral equation of the second kind. The second method uses a finite element array to model apparent resistivity from laterolog. The task is treated as DC problem and the Laplace equation is solved numerically. The presented methods were applied to borehole data covering a typical stratigraphie section of the Fore-Sudetic Monocline in southwestern Poland. Apparent resistivity was calculated using the Coulomb’s charges method and alternatively modeled using a finite element method which gave similar results. Then, a series of linear corrections for borehole, shoulder bed, and filtration effects for apparent resistivity obtained by the Coulomb’s charges method demonstrated the feasibility of calculating true resistivity of virgin and invaded zones. The proposed methods provide a flexible solution in modeling which can be adapted to other logs." .

We study the following growth model on a regular d-ary tree. Points at distance n adjacent to the existing subtree are added with probabilities proportional to α −n , where α < 1 is a positive real parameter. The heights of these clusters are shown to increase linearly with their total size; this complements known results that show the height increases only logarithmically when α≧ 1. Results are obtained using stochastic monotonicity and regeneration results which may be of independent interest. Our motivation comes from two other ways in which the model may be viewed: as a problem in first-passage percolation, and as a version of diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), adjusted so that “fingering” occurs." .

Mathematical modelling may help guide the design of treatment programs and also may help us better understand the potential benefits and limitations of prevention strategies. MethodsTo explore further the potential synergies between modelling of drug resistance in HIV and in pandemic influenza, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Mathematics for Information Technology and Complex Systems brought together selected scientists and public health experts for a workshop in Ottawa in January 2007, to discuss the emergence and transmission of HIV antiviral drug resistance, to report on progress in the use of mathematical models to study the emergence and spread of drug resistant influenza viral strains, and to recommend future research priorities. ResultsGeneral lectures and round-table discussions were organized around the issues on HIV drug resistance at the population level, HIV drug resistance in Western Canada, HIV drug resistance at the host level (with focus on optimal treatment strategies), and drug resistance for pandemic influenza planning. ConclusionSome of the issues related to drug resistance in HIV and pandemic influenza can possibly be addressed using existing mathematical models, with a special focus on linking the existing models to the data obtained through the Canadian HIV Strain and DR Surveillance Program. Preliminary statistical analysis of these data carried out at PHAC, together with the general model framework developed by Dr. Blower and her collaborators, should provide further insights into the mechanisms behind the observed trends and thus could help with the prediction and analysis of future trends in the aforementioned items. Remarkable similarity between dynamic, compartmental models for the evolution of wild and drug resistance strains of both HIV and pandemic influenza may provide sufficient common ground to create synergies between modellers working in these two areas. One of the key contributions of mathematical modeling to the control of infectious diseases is the quantification and design of optimal strategies, combining techniques of operations research with dynamic modeling would enhance the contribution of mathematical modeling to the prevention and control of infectious diseases." .

Consequently, decrease of noise radiation challenges a growing community of engineers. One of the most efficient techniques for finding quiet structures consists in numerical optimization. Herein, we consider structural-acoustic optimization understood as an (iterative) minimum search of a specified objective (or cost) function by modifying certain design variables. Obviously, a coupled problem must be solved to evaluate the objective function. In this paper, we will start with a review of structural and acoustic analysis techniques using numerical methods like the finite- and/or the boundary-element method. This is followed by a survey of techniques for structural-acoustic coupling. We will then discuss objective functions. Often, the average sound pressure at one or a few points in a frequency interval accounts for the objective function for interior problems, wheareas the average sound power is mostly used for external problems. The analysis part will be completed by review of sensitivity analysis and special techniques. We will then discuss applications of structural-acoustic optimization. Starting with a review of related work in pure structural optimization and in pure acoustic optimization, we will categorize the problems of optimization in structural acoustics. A suitable distinction consists in academic and more applied examples. Academic examples iclude simple structures like beams, rectangular or circular plates and boxes; real industrial applications consider problems like that of a fuselage, bells, loudspeaker diaphragms and components of vehicle structures. Various different types of variables are used as design parameters. Quite often, locally defined plate or shell thickness or discrete point masses are chosen. Furthermore, all kinds of structural material parameters, beam cross sections, spring characteristics and shell geometry account for suitable design modifications. This is followed by a listing of constraints that have been applied. After that, we will discuss strategies of optimization. Starting with a formulation of the optimization problem we review aspects of multiobjective optimization, approximation concepts and optimization methods in general. In a final chapter, results are categorized and discussed. Very often, quite large decreases of noise radiation have been reported. However, even small gains should be highly appreciated in some cases of certain support conditions, complexity of simulation, model and large frequency ranges. Optimization outcomes are categorized with respect to objective functions, optimization methods, variables and groups of problems, the latter with particular focus on industrial applications. More specifically, a close-up look at vehicle panel shell geometry optimization is presented. Review of results is completed with a section on experimental validation of optimization gains. The conclusions bring together a number of open problems in the field." .

The reference models using this approach are those based on the strong ion approach, but these models do not currently take into account the effects of oxygen on the buffering characteristics of haemoglobin. As such these models are limited in their ability to simulate physiological situations involving simultaneous changes of O2 and CO2 levels in the blood. This paper describes a model of acid–base chemistry of blood based on mass action and mass balance equations and including the effects of oxygen. The model is used to simulate the mixing of venous blood with the same blood at elevated O2 and reduced CO2 levels, and the results compared with the mixing of blood sampled from 21 healthy subjects. Simulated values of pH, PCO2, PO2 and SO2 in the mixed blood compare well with measured values with small bias (i.e. 0.000 pH, −0.06 kPa PCO2, −0.1% SO2, −0.02 kPa PO2), and values of standard deviations (i.e. 0.006 pH, 0.11 kPa PCO2, 0.8% SO2, 0.13 kPa PO2) comparable to the precision seen in direct measurement of these variables in clinical practice. These results indicate that the model can reliably simulate the mixing of blood and has potential for application in describing physiological situations involving the mixing of blood at different O2 and CO2 levels such as occurs in the mixing of lung capillary and shunted pulmonary blood." .

We consider N single server infinite buffer queues with service rate β. Customers arrive at rate Nα, choose L queues uniformly, and join the shortest. We study the processes for large N, where R N t (k) is the fraction of queues of length at least k at time t. Laws of large numbers (LLNs) are known, see Vvedenskaya et al. [15], Mitzenmacher [12] and Graham [5]. We consider certain Hilbert spaces with the weak topology. First, we prove a functional central limit theorem (CLT) under the a priori assumption that the initial data R N 0 satisfy the corresponding CLT. We use a compactness-uniqueness method, and the limit is characterized as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Then, we study the R N in equilibrium under the stability condition α<β, and prove a functional CLT with limit the OU process in equilibrium. We use ergodicity and justify the inversion of limits lim N →∞ lim t →∞= lim t →∞ lim N →∞ by a compactness-uniqueness method. We deduce a posteriori the CLT for R N 0 under the invariant laws, an interesting result in its own right. The main tool for proving tightness of the implicitly defined invariant laws in the CLT scaling and ergodicity of the limit OU process is a global exponential stability result for the nonlinear dynamical system obtained in the functional LLN limit." .

A locomotive-type turbocharger compressor with 24 blades under combined centrifugal and interference-fit loading was considered in the numerical analysis. The solution of elastoplastic frictional contact problems belongs to unspecified boundary problems where the interaction between two kinds of nonlinearities should occur. To save time in the numerical computation, a multi-substructure technique was adopted in the structural modeling. The effect of fit tolerance, wall thickness of the shaft sleeve, and rotational speed on the contact stress was discussed in detail in the numerical computation. To decrease the difficulty of the assembly process and ensure the safety of the working state, the amount of interference between the shaft sleeve and shaft by press-fitting should be controlled strictly to avoid the rapid increase of contact stress. The numerical results show that the algorithm has high accuracy and good convergence. The study can be referred to in deciding the proper fit tolerance and improving the design and manufacturing technology of compressor impellers." .

The discovery of the Higgs boson has drawn increased attention to the statistical methods employed within HEP. Here I argue that the warrant for the practice in HEP of relying primarily on frequentist methods can best be understood as pragmatic, in the sense that statistical methods are chosen for their suitability for the practical demands of experimental HEP, rather than reflecting a commitment to a particular epistemic framework. In particular, I argue that understanding the statistical methodology of HEP through the perspective of pragmatism clarifies the role of and rationale for significance testing in the search for new phenomena such as the Higgs boson." .

With few exceptions, however, statistical power did not become a regular textbook inclusion until some 30 years later. Modern concern for power evolved naturally from the “significance test controversy,” and was further stimulated by Cohen’s (1962) review in the Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. To date, eight power-analytic surveys have been conducted. Generally, the average power estimates derived from these analyses have been quite low. Providing sufficient power serves to decrease the commission of Type II errors, and may prevent misinterpretations of nonsignificant results. Including statistical power in the design and analysis of an experiment requires an a priori estimate of the effect size, as well as calculating obtained effect size. The obtained effect size reflects the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, and as such provides a better characterization of the research effort than does reporting only the significance level." .

Conventional actuation techniques such as hydraulic or pneumatic systems are no longer capable of fulfilling the demands of hi-tech micro-scale areas such as miniaturized biomedical devices and MEMS production equipment. These applications pose significantly different problems from actuation on a large scale. In particular, large scale manipulation systems typically deal with sizable friction, whereas micro manipulation systems must minimize friction to achieve submicron precision and avoid generation of static electric fields. Recently, the magnetic levitation technique has been shown to be a feasible actuation method for micro-scale applications. In this paper, a magnetic levitation device is recalled from the authors’ previous work and a control approach is presented to achieve precise motion control of a magnetically levitated object with sub-micron positioning accuracy. The stability of the controller is discussed through the Lyapunov method. Experiments are conducted and showed that the proposed control technique is capable of performing a positioning operation with rms accuracy of 16 μm over a travel range of 30 mm. The nonlinear control strategy proposed in this paper showed a significant improvement in comparison with the conventional control strategies for large gap magnetic levitation systems." .

Certain biological experiments investigating cell motion result in time lapse video microscopy data which may be modeled using stochastic differential equations. These models suggest statistics for quantifying experimental results and testing relevant hypotheses, and carry implications for the qualitative behavior of cells and for underlying biophysical mechanisms. Directional cell motion in response to a stimulus, termed taxis, has previously been modeled at a phenomenological level using the Keller-Segel diffusion equation. The Keller-Segel model cannot distinguish certain modes of taxis, and this motivates the introduction of a richer class of models which is nevertheless still amenable to statistical analysis. A state space model formulation is used to link models proposed for cell velocity to observed data. Sequential Monte Carlo methods enable parameter estimation via maximum likelihood for a range of applicable models. One particular experimental situation, involving the effect of an electric field on cell behavior, is considered in detail. In this case, an Ornstein- Uhlenbeck model for cell velocity is found to compare favorably with a nonlinear diffusion model." .

We confirm that although, in general, analyses under the correct missing at random and missing completely at random models are more efficient even for small sample sizes, there are exceptions where they may not improve the results obtained by ignoring the partially classified data. We show that under the missing not at random (MNAR) model, estimates on the boundary of the parameter space as well as lack of identifiability of the parameters of saturated models may be associated with undesirable asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio tests; even in standard cases the bias of the estimators may be low only for very large samples.

That is, we aim to estimate the probability that a control system with uncertain parametersq restricted to a boxQ attains a given level of performance γ. Since this probability depends on the underlying distribution, we address the following question: What is a “reasonable” distribution so that the estimated probability makes sense? To answer this question, we define two worstcase criteria and prove that the uniform distribution is optimal in both cases. In the second part of the paper we turn our attention to a subsequent problem. That is, we estimate the sizes of both the so-called “good” and “bad” sets via sampling. Roughly speaking, the good set contains the parametersq∈Q with a performance level better than or equal to γ while the bad set is the set of parametersq∈Q with a performance level worse than γ. We give bounds on the minimum sample size to attain a good estimate of these sets in a certain probabilistic sense." .

The availability of arbitrary parameters in these laws allows approximation to non-linear dielectric laws derived empirically.

We explore the geometry of isothermic meshes, conical meshes, and asymptotic meshes around the Christoffel dual construction of a discrete minimal surface. We present a discrete Legendre transform which realizes discrete minimal surfaces as conical meshes. Conical meshes turn out to be infinitesimally flexible if and only if their spherical image is isothermic, which implies that discrete minimal surfaces constructed in this way are infinitesimally flexible, and therefore possess reciprocal-parallel meshes. These are discrete minimal surfaces in their own right. In our study of relative kinematics of infinitesimally flexible meshes, we encounter characterizations of flexibility and isothermicity which are of incidence-geometric nature and are related to the classical Desargues configuration. The Lelieuvre formula for asymptotic meshes leads to another characterization of isothermic meshes in the sphere which is based on triangle areas." .

However, the frequency distribution of the flare durations cannot be fitted well by a single power-law. There is a weak correlation between the peak count rates and the characteristic times like rise times, decay times, or durations. But the correlation between the rise times and decay times seems to be strong. We discuss the results obtained and compare them with previous works. The frequency distribution of rise times for the sub-group events with a similar magnitude of peak count rates is also shown. In particular, we propose a new parameter R a , the growth factor of the count rate, defined as the peak count rate divided by the rise time, to reflect the characteristics of the rising phases of flares.

The general integral of the separated radial equation is determined in case of real field. The same for the separated real massless time equation. Particular complex solutions are also given. It is shown that the real solutions of the scheme are not solutions of the Einstein and scalar field equations coupled in the conventional way. They can be interpreted as generating possible cosmologies with self-settling gravitational field. As to the complex solutions, they satisfy an “orthonormality” relation, similar to the one that defines the normal modes of field equation in curved space-time.

Though there are numerous papers on both linear and non-linear stability analyses of dynamical systems with friction-induced vibrations, the effects of damping on the evolution of the stable–unstable regions is not yet fully understood. The purpose of this work is to study a pin-disc model describing a typical friction-induced vibration due to a geometric constraint in order to illustrate the effects of damping on linear stability analyses. The results not only illustrate the influence of damping for determining the stable and unstable zones, but they also indicate that the “most efficient damping factor of the coupling modes” is an important factor to be taken into account. The physical mechanism causing this change in instability as a consequence of the damping factor is also suggested to help avoid bad design." .

One of the most successful frameworks solves the Laplace equation using a weighting scheme to determine the importance of individual pixels. We provide a physical interpretation of this approach in terms of the Helmholtz equation which explains its superiority. For better reconstruction quality, we subsequently formulate an optimisation task for the corresponding finite difference discretisation to maximise the influence of the physical traits of the Helmholtz equation. Our findings show that sharper contrasts and lower errors in the reconstruction are possible." .

Various regression trend models were used to identify any trend variations over the regions during the period 1970–1990. The results of fitting the models to the data imply that the model which assumes a linear trend provides precise information about the long-term ozone trends (trends during the period 1970–1990). The study identifies short-term summer trends in the 1980s that are evidently more strongly negative than trends that occur in the 1970s (the differences are statistically significant at the 2σ level). The year-round loss (in all analyzed regions) and the winter loss in total ozone (the belt 30°N–60°N) N. America, during the 1980s are about 2–3 times higher than the losses during the 1970s (the differences are statistically significant at the 1σ level)." .

The principal problem considered in this paper can be formulated as follows: given an L-function satisfying the Riemann Hypothesis or at least a non-trivial density estimate, is it true that it has an Euler product expansion? A positive answer would mean that arithmetic is necessary for proving the Riemann Hypothesis or a non-trivial density estimate, respectively. The paper contains a solution for degree one L-functions from the extended Selberg class. The main tools in the proof are: explicit description of the structure of the extended Selberg class in degree one due to A.

The annual peak load of Shandong province in China from 2005 to 2014 is selected as the empirical example, and the analysis results demonstrate that the MVO algorithm for parameters’ determination of DGM (1, 1) model has significant superiority over the least square estimation method, particle swarm optimization and fruit fly optimization algorithm in terms of annual peak load forecasting. In addition, the proposed MVO-DGM (1, 1) peak load forecasting model has more excellent forecasting performance than other non-optimized forecasting techniques and other optimized DGM (1, 1) models due to its ascended local optima avoidance and better convergence speed.

But on the contrary, this paper tries to reduce multivariate time series to a univariate common factor sequence to adapt to the methods for segmentation of univariate time series. First, a common factor sequence is extracted from the multivariate time series as a composite index by a dynamic factor model. Then, three typical search methods including binary segmentation, segment neighborhoods and the pruned exact linear time are applied to the common factor sequence to detect the change points and the segmentation result is considered as the final segmentation result of multivariate time series. The case studies show the applicability and robustness of the proposed approach in hydrometeorological time series segmentation." .

From the detailed statistical analysis of the observed data it is found that the reported day time pulsing hiss emissions is a rare phenomena at low latitudes. The spectrograms of pulsing hiss emissions observed during daytime clearly show band limited spectrums regularly pulsing with almost equal period of the order of few seconds in the frequency range of 300 Hz–8 kHz. The intensity and bandwidth of daytime pulsing hiss remain almost constant in the frequency range of 300 Hz–8 kHz in clear contrast to the pulsing hiss emission observed during nighttime at low latitudes. The daytime pulsing hiss time period is about 0.5 s which is small in comparison to time period (~1.43 s) of the low latitude pulsing hiss observed during nighttime. The generation and propagation mechanisms of pulsing hiss emissions are discussed. The micropulsations propagating along the geomagnetic field lines modulate the growth rate of the wave resulting in hiss intensity." .

We consider d-dimensional Brownian motion in a scaled Poissonian potential and the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue (ground state energy) of the corresponding Schrödinger operator. The scaling is chosen to be of critical order, i.e. it is determined by the typical size of large holes in the Poissonian cloud. We prove existence of a phase transition in dimensions d≥ 4: There exists a critical scaling constant for the potential. Below this constant the scaled infinite volume limit of the corresponding principal Dirichlet eigenvalue is linear in the scale. On the other hand, for large values of the scaling constant this limit is strictly smaller than the linear bound. For d > 4 we prove that this phase transition does not take place on that scale. Further we show that the analogous picture holds true for the partition sum of the underlying motion process." .

The design of EBat is introduced and its performance is evaluated against 24 of the standard benchmark functions, and compared to that of the standard BA, as well as to several well-established metaheuristic techniques. We also analyze the impact of different parameters on the EBat algorithm and determine the best combination of parameter values in the context of numerical optimization. The obtained results show that the new EBat method is indeed a promising addition to the arsenal of metaheuristic algorithms and can outperform several existing ones, including the original BA algorithm." .

The periodic material distribution is expanded as a complex Fourier series and the interaction pressures are derived from the Lennard-Jones potential, which includes both attractive and repulsive terms. The interaction pressures for a general 2D distribution were derived, which is applicable to any periodic distributions of many materials. The equations derived have two contributions: (1) the conventional interaction pressures between half-spaces made of uniform materials and (2) the spatial fluctuation originating from the spatially periodic material distribution. As a typical example of the material distributions, a 2D periodic distribution of two materials is introduced to demonstrate the methods. We present calculation results for parallel and inclined planes, a comparison between 2D and one-dimensional analyses, and the effects of the refractive indices and the duty ratios." .

Twenty-three years of monthly time, series data was sourced from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Data were available for eight states and territories and their corresponding capital cities. The dependent variable was the aggregate levodopa equivalent dose (LED) for 51 Parkinson’s medications identified on the PBS. Two explanatory variables of interest, temperature and solar exposure, were identified in the BOM data set. Linear and cosinor models were estimated with fixed and random effects, respectively. The prescribed LED was 4.2% greater in January and 4.5% lower in July. Statistical analysis showed that temperature was associated with the prescription of Parkinson medications. Our results suggest seasonality exists in Parkinson’s disease symptoms and this may be related to temperature. Further work is needed to confirm these findings and understand the underlying mechanisms as a better understanding of the causes of any seasonal variation in Parkinson’s disease may help clinicians and patients manage the disease more effectively." .

Design discharges are currently estimated by fitting of probability distributions and extrapolation techniques. To this aim, reliable and homogeneous observations are needed. Unfortunately, time series of observed discharges are of a limited length. Consequently, different probability distributions lead to quite different extrapolated values, and the goodness-of-fit tests to select an appropriate probability distribution are usually inconclusive. The fact that the series of observations are short and physical knowledge about the catchment response is not included in this analysis, contributes to this inconclusiveness. Therefore, in the Netherlands, new methodologies are investigated. The new developments consist on one hand of a new statistical extrapolation method based on Bayesian approach, that takes account of statistical uncertainties. On the other hand, a methodology is being made to provide a better physical basis about the catchment response under extreme meteorological circumstances. This method consists of a statistical rainfall generator combined with hydrological and hydraulic models. Together with the current extrapolation method, these new developments are the subject of this paper." .

Recent work on mutation-selection models has revealed that, under specific assumptions on the fitness function and the mutation rates, asymptotic estimates for the leading eigenvalue of the mutation-reproduction matrix may be obtained through a low-dimensional maximum principle in the limit N→∞ (where N, or N d with d≥1, is proportional to the number of types). In order to extend this variational principle to a larger class of models, we consider here a family of reversible matrices of asymptotic dimension N d and identify conditions under which the high-dimensional Rayleigh-Ritz variational problem may be reduced to a low-dimensional one that yields the leading eigenvalue up to an error term of order 1/N. For a large class of mutation-selection models, this implies estimates for the mean fitness, as well as a concentration result for the ancestral distribution of types." .

In the fields like Astronomy and Ecology, the need for proper statistical analysis of data that are censored is being increasingly recognized. Such data occur when, due to noise or other factors, instruments fail to detect low luminosities of celestial objects, or low concentrations of certain pollutants. For multivariate censored data sets there are very few distribution free methods available and researchers in the various fields often impose an assumption on the joint distribution, such as multivariate normality, and carry out parametric inferences. Under censoring, however, such parametric inferences are asymptotically wrong if the imposed assumption is incorrect. In this paper we propose a class of goodness-of-fit procedures for testing assumptions about the multivariate distribution under random censoring. The test procedures generalize Pearson's goodness-of-fit test in the sense that they are based on the concept of observed-minus-expected frequencies. The theory of the test statistic, however, differs from that for the classical Pearson test due to the accommodation of censored data." .

The uncertainty in the extent of an ore body can be the largest source of uncertainty in ore resource estimation when drilling is sparse. These limits are traditionally interpreted deterministically and it can be difficult to quantify uncertainty in the boundary and its impact on ore tonnage. The proposed methodology is to consider stochastic modeling of the ore boundary with a distance function recoding of the available data. This technique is modified to incorporate non-stationarities in the form of a locally varying anisotropy field used in kriging and sequential Gaussian simulation. Implementing locally varying anisotropy kriging retains the geologically realistic features of a deterministic model while allowing for a stochastic assessment of uncertainty. A case study of a gold deposit in Northern Canada is used to demonstrate the methodology. The proposed technique generates realistic, curvilinear geological boundary models and allows for an assessment of the uncertainty in the model." .

Examination of Maxwell’s procedures opens many issues about the role of mathematical representation in physics and the learning background required for its success. Specifically, Maxwell’s training in ‘Cambridge University’ mathematical physics emphasized the use of analogous equations across fields of physics and the repeated solving of extremely difficult problems in physics. Such training develops an array of overlearned mathematical representations supported by highly sophisticated cognitive mechanisms for the retrieval of relevant information from long term memory. For Maxwell, mathematics constituted a new form of representation in physics, enhancing the formal derivational and calculational role of mathematics and opening a cognitive means for the conduct of ‘experiments in the mind’ and for sophisticated representations of theory." .

These tools, although particularly well suited to the behavioral sciences, have several potential pitfalls. Among other things, there is no statistical test for evaluating the significance of the results. This paper provides estimates of the statistical significance of results yielded by Kruskal's nonmetric multidimensional scaling. The estimates, obtained from attempts to scale many randomly generated sets of data, reveal the relative frequency with which apparent structure is erroneously found in unstructured data. For a small number of points (i.e., six or seven) it is very likely that a good fit will be obtained in two or more dimensions when in fact the data are generated by a random process. The estimates presented here can be used as a bench mark against which to evaluate the significance of the results obtained from empirically based nonmetric multidimensional scaling." .

Non-mixture models are not efficient in analyzing these data because these models are developed under the assumption that data do not change and come from one source. Mixture models could successfully analyze these data because mixture models contain more than one modal. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm has been widely used to estimate parameters of the mixture normal distribution for describing the statistical characteristics of hydro meteorological data. Unfortunately, the EM algorithm has some disadvantages, such as divergence, derivation of information matrices, local maximization, and poor accuracy. To overcome these disadvantages, this study proposes a new parameter estimation approach for the mixture normal distribution. The developed model estimates parameters of the mixture normal distribution by maximizing the log likelihood function using a meta-heuristic algorithm—genetic algorithm (GA). To verify the performance of the developed model, simulation experiments and practical applications are implemented. From the results of experiments and practical applications, the developed model presents some advantages, such as (1) the proposed model more accurately estimates the parameters even with small sample sizes compared to the EM algorithm; (2) not diverging in all application; and (3) showing smaller root mean squared error and larger log likelihood than those of the EM algorithm. We conclude that the proposed model is a good alternative in estimating the parameters of the mixture normal distribution for kutotic and bimodal hydrometeorological data." .

Not even a simple dispersion diagram is possible. In this article we propose a Gaussian process model to interpolate an unequally spaced time series and produce predictions for equally spaced observation times. The dependence between two observations is assumed a function of the time differences. The novelty of the proposal relies on parametrizing the correlation function in terms of Weibull and Log-logistic survival functions. We further allow the correlation to be positive or negative. Inference on the model is made under a Bayesian approach and interpolation is done via the posterior predictive conditional distributions given the closest $$m$$ m observed times. Performance of the model is illustrated via a simulation study as well as with real data sets of temperature and CO$$_2$$ 2 observed over 800,000 years before the present." .

Herein, we attempt to address the entropy/complexity resulting from hydrological and climatological conditions. Accordingly, mutual information function, correlation dimension, averaged false nearest neighbor with E1 and E2 quantities, and complexity analysis that uses sample entropy coupled with iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform were employed as nonlinear deterministic identification tools. We investigated forecasting of daily streamflow for three climatologically different Swedish rivers, Helge, Ljusnan, and Kalix Rivers using self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), k-nearest neighbor (k-nn), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The results suggest that the streamflow in these rivers during the 1957–2012 period exhibited dynamics from low to high complexity. Specifically, (1) lower complexity lead to higher predictability at all lead-times and the models’ worst performances were obtained for the most complex streamflow (Ljusnan River), (2) ANN was the best model for 1-day ahead forecasting independent of complexity, (3) SETAR was the best model for 7-day ahead forecasting by means of performance indices, especially for less complexity, (4) the largest error propagation was obtained with the k-nn and ANN and thus these models should be carefully used beyond 2-day forecasting, and (5) higher number input variables except for the dominant variables made insignificant impact on forecasting performances for ANN and k-nn models." .

In this way it is possible to show that at least one of the causes of the problem of phase-mixing, whose effect is the polynomial increase in time of the perturbation terms normally called secularities, arises from the shifts of the perturbation energy levels due to the unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian. An example is given for a two-level system that, anyway, shows a secularity at second order also in the standard theory of small perturbations. The theory is applied to the quantum analogue of a classical problem that can become chaotic, a particle under the effect of two waves of different amplitudes, frequencies and wave numbers." .

Speed as well as accuracy improves and we are able to solve the algebraic problem with partial inversion only. Using the standard spline-decomposition for the angle variable and the finite-difference approximation for the hyperradius optimizes considerably the inversion due to the sparse block structure of the matrix.

In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the onset of fluctuations, we proceed to perform a linear stability analysis for the convective model of Kiani et al. (Microvasc. Res. 45:219–232, 1993; Am. J. Physiol. 266(35):H1822–H1828, 1994), and show that this leads via a system of delay differential equations to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem.

In a moderate size subnetwork of one of the networks chosen by Kiani et al. (Am. J. Physiol. 266(35):H1822–H1828, 1994), the topology, vessel lengths, and diameters of which were based on microvascular networks in the rat mesentery, we compare results generated using the original explicit numerical method of Kiani et al.

From the linear stability theory, a critical value D RBC,crit of a red blood cell diameter parameter D RBC in the plasma skimming model of Fenton et al. (Pflügers Arch. 403:396–401, 1985b) is identified for the onset of oscillations about steady state and both the explicit and implicit methods are used to calculate the inflow hematocrit solutions in all vessels of the subnetwork at the critical parameter value, subject to perturbed initial conditions. The results of the implicit method are demonstrated to be in excellent and superior agreement with the predictions of the linear analysis in this case. For values of D RBC slightly larger than D RBC,crit the bifurcating periodic solutions calculated using either the explicit or implicit schemes are characteristic of those of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation and the graphs of D RBC vs. oscillation amplitude would seem to converge as Δt→0." .

In this study we set out to investigate the possibility of linking phenological phases throughout the vegetation cycle, as a local-scale biological phenomenon, directly with large-scale atmospheric variables via two different empirical downscaling techniques. In recent years a number of methods have been developed to transfer atmospheric information at coarse General Circulation Model's grid resolutions to local scales and individual points. Here multiple linear regression (MLR) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) have been selected as downscaling methods. Different validation experiments (e.g. temporal cross-validation, split-sample tests) are used to test the performance of both approaches and compare them for time series of 17 phenological phases and air temperatures from Central Europe as microscale variables. A number of atmospheric variables over the North Atlantic and Europe are utilized as macroscale predictors. The period considered is 1951–1998. Temporal cross-validation reveals that the CCA model generally performs better than MLR, which explains 20%–50% of the phenological variances, whereas the CCA model shows a range from 40% to over 60% throughout most of the vegetation cycle. To show the validity of employing phenological observations for downscaling purposes both methods (MLR and CCA) are also applied to gridded local air temperature time series over Central Europe. In this case there is no obvious superiority of the CCA model over the MLR model. Both models show explained variances from 40% to over 70% in the temporal cross-validation experiment. The results of this study indicate that time series of phenological occurrence dates are very compatible with the needs of empirical downscaling originally developed of local-scale atmospheric variables." .

Direct similarities, transformations consisting of a direct isometry and a positive uniform scaling, present even more of a challenge—one which we demonstrate and address here. In this article, we investigate divergences (a superset of distances without constraints on symmetry and sub-additivity) for comparing direct similarities, and means induced by them via minimizing a sum of squared divergences. We analyze several standard divergences: the Euclidean distance using the matrix representation of direct similarities, a divergence from Lie group theory, and the family of all left-invariant distances derived from Riemannian geometry. We derive their properties and those of their induced means, highlighting several shortcomings. In addition, we introduce a novel family of left-invariant divergences, called SRT divergences, which resolve several issues associated with the standard divergences. In our evaluation we empirically demonstrate the derived properties of the divergences and means, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on synthetic data. Finally, we compare the divergences in a real-world application: vote-based, scale-invariant object recognition. Our results show that the new divergences presented here, and their means, are both more effective and faster to compute for this task." .

The application of the techniques of dimensional scaling, and in particular the 1/D expansion, to higher angular-momentum states of multi-electron atoms requires the generalized Euler angles, which multiply with increasing D to be “factored out” of the wave function. The factorization must be performed in a way that produces from the Schrödinger equation a tractable set of differential equations which admit continuation in the dimension D. In two recent works the authors have achieved the necessary factorization of the wave function by generalizing the Schwartz expansion to N electrons in D dimensions. The present paper applies the N-electron D-dimensional Schwartz expansion to the two-electron problem in D dimensions. The resulting set of coupled differential equations in the internal variables admit continuation in D, enabling the methods of dimensional scaling to be applied to higher-angular-momentum states. In addition, the coupled differential equations clearly show the complete spectrum of exact interdimensional degeneracies of the two-electron system." .

This method provides information on the sensitivity of eigenvalues of the system under perturbations of a given size, allowing one to analyse uncertainties in, for example, structural dynamical systems. Furthermore, pseudospectra computations are a fast and efficient method by which to identify the spectra of NDDEs in any chosen part of the complex plane. This is of particular advantage as the spectra of NDDEs consists of infinitely many eigenvalues. We illustrate these methods by considering a scalar second-order NDDE with one or more fixed delays. Such systems are used to model real-time substructuring experiments, where the delay arises from the response time of actuator(s) forming a coupling between a numerical model and the substructure being tested. We identify changes in the stability and sensitivity to perturbation of this system both as the delay time and as the mass of the substructure are varied. In particular, the latter reveals an essential instability in which infinitely many eigenvalues move to the right-half plane. Finally, we investigate the relationship between pseudospectra and the effect of periodic forcing on the substructured system." .

This paper also develop the concepts of fuzzy type-I, fuzzy type-II errors and fuzzy power for the proposed hypothesis tests. To make decision as a fuzzy test, a well-known index is employed to compare the observed fuzzy p value and a given significance value. The result provides a fuzzy test function which leads to some degrees to accept or to reject the null hypothesis.

However, little information is available on the assessment of changes in body composition in top-level athletes using DXA. The present study aimed to assess the accuracy of DXA in tracking body composition changes (relative fat mass [%FM], absolute fat mass [FM], and fat-free mass [FFM]) of elite male judo athletes from a period of weight stability to prior to a competition, compared to a four compartment model (4C model), as the criterion method. MethodsA total of 27 elite male judo athletes (age, 22.2 ± 2.8 yrs) athletes were evaluated. Measures of body volume by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral content assessed by DXA, and total-body water assessed by deuterium dilution were used in a 4C model. Statistical analyses included examination of the coefficient of determinant (r2), standard error of estimation (SEE), slope, intercept, and agreement between models. ResultsAt a group level analysis, changes in %FM, FM, and FFM estimates by DXA were not significantly different from those by the 4C model. Though the regression between DXA and the 4C model did not differ from the line of identity DXA %FM, FM, and FFM changes only explained 29%, 36%, and 38% of the 4C reference values, respectively. Individual results showed that the 95% limits of agreement were -3.7 to 5.3 for %FM, -2.6 to 3.7 for FM, and -3.7 to 2.7 for FFM. The relation between the difference and the mean of the methods indicated a significant trend for %FM and FM changes with DXA overestimating at the lower ends and underestimating at the upper ends of FM changes. ConclusionsOur data indicate that both at group and individual levels DXA did not present an expected accuracy in tracking changes in adiposity in elite male judo athletes." .

The performance of DE highly depends on the chosen mutation strategy and control parameter settings. Although the conventional trial-and-error procedure can be used to elaborately select the proper strategy and to tune the parameter values, this procedure is often very time-consuming and is not suitable for practitioners without a priori experience. To tackle this problem, DE with a novel role assignment (RA) scheme is proposed in this paper. In the RA scheme, both the fitness information and positional information of individuals are utilized to dynamically divide the population into several groups. Each group is considered as a role, which has its own mutation strategy and parameter settings and is expected to play a different role in the evolution process. To verify the performance of our approach, experiments are conducted on 23 well-known benchmark functions. Results show that our approach is better than, or at least comparable to, several state-of-the-art DE variants." .

For multivariate data sets, large Mahalanobis distances in raw data space or large Mahalanobis distances in principal components analysis, transformed data space, are routinely used to detect outliers. Detection in principal components analysis space can also utilise goodness of fit distances. For spatial applications, however, these global forms can only detect outliers in a non-spatial manner. This can result in false positive detections, such as when an observation’s spatial neighbours are similar, or false negative detections such as when its spatial neighbours are dissimilar. To avoid mis-classifications, we demonstrate that a local adaptation of various global methods can be used to detect multivariate spatial outliers. In particular, we account for local spatial effects via the use of geographically weighted data with either Mahalanobis distances or principal components analysis. Detection performance is assessed using simulated data as well as freshwater chemistry data collected over all of Great Britain. Results clearly show value in both geographically weighted methods to outlier detection." .

The radar wind results are derived from Doppler wind measurements at zenith angles of 6° in two orthogonal planes and in the vertical direction. Measurements on a total of 398 days over a 2-year period are considered, but the major part of the study involves a statistical analysis of data collected during 75 radiosonde flights selected to minimise the spatial separation of the two sets of measurements. Whereas good agreement is found between the two sets of wind direction, radar-derived wind speeds show underestimates of 4–6% compared with radiosonde values over the height range 4–14 km. Studies of the characteristics of this discrepancy in wind speeds have concentrated on its directional dependence, the effects of the spatial separation of the two sets of measurements, and the influence of any uncertainty in the radar measurements of vertical velocities. The aspect sensitivity of radar echoes has previously been suggested as a cause of underestimates of wind speeds by VHF radar. The present statistical treatment and case-studies show that an appropriate correction can be applied using estimates of the effective radar beam angle derived from a comparison of echo powers at zenith angles of 4.2° and 8.5°." .

The SRNN approximator is used to online estimate an ideal tracking controller with the online structuring and parameter learning algorithms. The structure learning possesses the ability of both adding and pruning hidden neurons, and the parameter learning adjusts the interconnection weights of neural network to achieve favorable approximation performance. And, by the L 2 control design technique, the worst effect of approximation error on the tracking error can be attenuated to be less or equal to a specified level. Finally, the proposed ARNNC system with structure adaptation algorithm is applied to control two nonlinear dynamic systems. Simulation results prove that the proposed ARNNC system with structure adaptation algorithm can achieve favorable tracking performance even unknown the control system dynamics function." .

Let $f (Z) \\in {\\Bbb F}[Z]$ be a univariate, separable polynomial of degree n with roots x 1,…,x n in some algebraic closure $\\bar{\\Bbb F}$ of the ground field ${\\Bbb F}$. It is a classical problem of Galois theory to find all the relations between the roots. It is known that the ideal of all such relations is generated by polynomials arising from G-invariant polynomials, where G is the Galois group of f(Z).

Conceptual model selection is a key issue in risk assessment studies. We analyze the effect of a number of conceptual aspects related to solute transport in two-dimensional heterogeneous media. The main issues addressed are non-ergodicity, anisotropy in the correlation structure of the transmissivity field, and dispersion at the local scale. In particular, we study the development of a solute plume when mean flow is oriented at an angle with respect to the principal directions of anisotropy. The study is carried out in a Lagrangian framework using Monte Carlo analysis. Of special interest is the evolution of individual plumes. A number of aspects are analyzed, namely the location of the center of mass for each plume and the different ways to compute the angles that the main axes of the plume develop with respect to the direction of the mean flow. Stochastic theories based upon ergodicity conclude that the plume gets oriented in the mean flow direction. In our non-ergodic simulations, the mean of the offset angles, for each individual plume in each particular realization, is offset from the mean flow direction towards the direction of maximum anisotropy. If, instead, the analysis is performed on the ensemble plume (superposition of all different simulations), it is then found oriented closer to the direction of the mean flow than the average offset angle for the different plumes considered separately. This last result adds an extra word of caution to the use of ensemble averaged values in solute transport studies. Serious implications for risk assessment follow from the conceptual model adopted. First, in any single realization there will a large uncertainty in locating the plume at any given time; second, real dilution would be less than what would be expected if the macrodispersion values obtained for ergodic conditions were applied; third, the volume that is affected by a non-zero concentration is smaller than that predicted from macrodispersion concepts; fourth, the orientation of the plume does not correspond to that of the mean flow; and fifth, accounting for local dispersion helps reducing uncertainty." .

First, the infinite dimension DPS is approximated in a finite dimensional space via the finite difference method, and from this model, training data are generated. Principal component analysis is then used to project the finite, but still high, dimensional spatiotemporal training data into a low-dimensional time series using spatial basis functions. Next, an online-tuning IT2 T–S fuzzy model is proposed to predict the low-dimensional time series with a high accuracy by computing an optimal time-varying weight parameter. Furthermore, a new method for simplifying controller design is presented by transforming the control objective from the high-dimensional spatial outputs reaching their set points to the lower dimensional time outputs reaching their set points. These novel contributions increase the accuracy of the prediction model (thus improving control performance) and reduce the computational cost of the underlying MPC optimization. Lastly, simulations are presented on a typical DPS to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods." .

Research along these lines is performed either by relaxing the assumptions on the mappings in the settings (for instance, commonly seen assumptions for the mapping involved in the fixed point problem are nonexpansive or strictly pseudocontractive) or by adding a general system of variational inequalities into the settings. In this paper, we consider both possible ways in our settings. Specifically, we propose an iterative method for finding a common solution of the classical variational inequality problem, a general system of variational inequalities and a fixed point problem of a uniformly continuous asymptotically strictly pseudocontractive mapping in the intermediate sense. Our iterative method is hybridized by utilizing the well-known extragradient method, the CQ method, the Mann-type iterative method and the viscosity approximation method. The iterates yielded by our method converge strongly to a common solution of these three problems.

Here, hydraulic admittance theory is developed for a slit and experimentally measured for several hydraulic lengths (or partial saturation levels). Finite element modeling was included to address entrance effects associated with the sample. Both the theory and finite element modeling predicted higher hydraulic admittance magnitudes than measured, but the modeling predicted the resonance peak position better than the theory. The weak agreements to both the theory and modeling were mainly attributed to the slit approximation for the sample and additional interfacial curvature. Nonetheless, the resonance peaks were found to shift toward lower frequencies and decrease in magnitude with increasing hydraulic length for the theory, finite element modeling, and measurements." .

A critical study of theVan Hove-Brout-Prigogine long time-weak coupling theory which dispenses with these averages is made. The two main objections are 1) mathematical inconsistencies in the quantum-mechanical formulation of the «diagonal singularity» of the mixing perturbation, supposedly responsible for the irreversibility, and 2) a physically inadmissible prescription for treating poles in improper energy integrals. Particular consequences are 1) an ambiguous prescription for evaluating the long time-weak coupling limit of improper integrals and 2) violation of the unitarity of the transition operator, respectively. Diagonal singularity in the «continuum limit» is reformulated. The limit transition operator is explicitly evaluated and exhibits only reversible behavior." .

An ordered pair Ŝ = (S, S +) of subsets of a groundset V is called a biset if S ⊆ S+; (V S +;V S) is the co-biset of Ŝ. Two bisets $\\hat X,\\hat Y$ intersect if X X ∩ Y ≠ $\\not 0$ and cross if both X ∩ Y $\\not 0$ and X + ∪ Y + ≠= V. The intersection and the union of two bisets $\\hat X,\\hat Y$ are defined by $\\hat X \\cap \\hat Y = (X \\cap Y,X^ + \\cap Y^ + )$ and $\\hat X \\cup \\hat Y = (X \\cup Y,X^ + \\cup Y^ + )$. A biset-family $\\mathcal{F}$ is crossing (intersecting) if $\\hat X \\cap \\hat Y,\\hat X \\cup \\hat Y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for any $\\hat X,\\hat Y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ that cross (intersect). A directed edge covers a biset Ŝ if it goes from S to V S +. We consider the problem of covering a crossing biset-family $\\mathcal{F}$ by a minimum-cost set of directed edges. While for intersecting $\\mathcal{F}$, a standard primal-dual algorithm computes an optimal solution, the approximability of the case of crossing $\\mathcal{F}$ is not yet understood, as it includes several NP-hard problems, for which a poly-logarithmic approximation was discovered only recently or is not known. Let us say that a biset-family $\\mathcal{F}$ is k-regular if $\\hat X \\cap \\hat Y,\\hat X \\cup \\hat Y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for any $\\hat X,\\hat Y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with |V (X∪Y)≥k+1 that intersect. In this paper we obtain an O(log |V|)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary crossing $\\mathcal{F}$ if in addition both $\\mathcal{F}$ and the family of co-bisets of $\\mathcal{F}$ are k-regular, our ratios are: $O\\left( {\\log \\frac{{|V|}} {{|V| - k}}} \\right) $ if |S + \\ S| = k for all $\\hat S \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and $O\\left( {\\frac{{|V|}} {{|V| - k}}\\log \\frac{{|V|}} {{|V| - k}}} \\right) $ if |S + \\ S| = k for all $\\hat S \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Using these generic algorithms, we derive for some network design problems the following approximation ratios: $O\\left( {\\log k \\cdot \\log \\tfrac{n} {{n - k}}} \\right) $ for k-Connected Subgraph, and O(logk) $\\min \\{ \\tfrac{n} {{n - k}}\\log \\tfrac{n} {{n - k}},\\log k\\} $ for Subset k-Connected Subgraph when all edges with positive cost have their endnodes in the subset." .

The JADE mutation strategy, the “DE/current-to-pbest” which is a variation of the classic “DE/current-to-best”, is used for generating mutant vectors. After the mutation phase, the binomial (uniform) crossover, the exponential crossover as well as no crossover option are used to generate each pair of target and trial vectors. By utilizing the self-adaptation in SaDE, both trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameter values are gradually self-adapted by learning from their previous experiences in generating promising solutions. Consequently, suitable offspring generation strategy along with associated parameter settings will be determined adaptively to match different phases of the search process. MMTS is applied frequently to refine several diversely distributed solutions at different search stages satisfying both the global and the local search requirement. The initialization of step sizes is also defined by a self-adaption during every MMTS step. The success rates of both SaDE and the MMTS are determined and compared; consequently, future function evaluations for both search algorithms are assigned proportionally to their recent past performance. The proposed SaDE-MMTS is employed to solve the 19 numerical optimization problems in special issue of soft computing on scalability of evolutionary algorithms for large-scale continuous optimization problems and competitive results are presented." .

Parameter adaptations are the most commonly used techniques to improve its performance. The adoption of these techniques has assisted the success of many adaptive DE variants. However, most studies on these adaptive DEs are limited to some small-scale problems, e.g. with less than 100 decision variables, which may be quite small comparing to the requirements of real-world applications. The scalability performance of adaptive DE is still unclear. In this paper, based on the analyses of similarities and drawbacks of existing parameter adaptation schemes in DE, we propose a generalized parameter adaptation scheme. Applying the scheme to DE results in a new generalized adaptive DE (GaDE) algorithm. The scalability performance of GaDE is evaluated on 19 benchmark functions with problem scale from 50 to 1,000 decision variables. Based on the comparison with three other algorithms, GaDE is very competitive in both the performance and scalability aspects." .

The stress-energy tensor is obtained, via Einstein’s field equations, by adopting the «branch cut» interpretation of the equatorial disk which spans the ring singularity. The stress-energy tensor is thus assumed to be a distribution having its support throughout the disk and along the ring. A simple model, which accounts for the tensor so obtained, is set up. Upon the disk it consists in a mixture of gas and dust rotating as a whole about the symmetry axis with constant angular velocity ω=a −1. The linear velocity, in turn, increases from zero at the centre of the disk up to the speed of light on its edge. The energy densities of both perfect fluids have the same absolute value, but are of opposite sign. On the other hand, the source on the ring is made up of dustlike particles having infinite positive energy and a finite radial dipole moment. Although these particles circulate along the ring with the speed of light, they cannot escape because they are pulled by an infinite tension (negative pressure) of the gas lying on the disk. It is further verified that the stress-energy tensor correctly reproduces the values of the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr black hole." .

The effects of casing geometric parameters and motion parameters on the natural frequency of the system are studied. The transition sets and bifurcation diagrams of the system are obtained through a singularity analysis of the bifurcation equation, showing that various modes of the system such as the bifurcation and hysteresis will appear in different parameter regions. In accordance with the multiple relationship of the fan speed and stator vibration frequency, the fan speed interval with the casing vibration sudden jump is calculated. The dynamic reasons of casing cracks are investigated. The possibility of casing cracking hysteresis interval is analyzed. The results show that cracking is more likely to appear in the hysteresis interval. The research of this paper provides a theoretical basis for fan casing design and system parameter optimization." .

To this end, the algorithms should yield a wide amount of near-optimal solutions with a good diversity or spread along this front. This work presents a study on different coarse-grained distribution schemes dealing with Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms (MOACOs). Two of them are a variation of independent multi-colony structures, respectively having a fixed number of ants in every subset or distributing the whole amount of ants into small sub-colonies. We introduce in this paper a third method: an island-based model where the colonies communicate by migrating ants, following a neighbourhood topology which fits to the search space. All the methods are aimed to cover the whole PF, thus each sub-colony or island tries to search for solutions in a limited area, complemented by the rest of colonies, in order to obtain a more diverse high-quality set of solutions. The models have been tested by implementing them considering three different MOACOs: two well-known and CHAC, an algorithm previously proposed by the authors. Three different instances of the bi-Criteria travelling salesman problem have been considered. The experiments have been performed in a parallel environment (inside a cluster platform), in order to get a time improvement. Moreover, the system scaling factor with respect to the number of processors will be also analysed. The results show that the proposed Pareto-island model and its novel neighbourhood topology performs better than the other models, yielding a more diverse and more optimized set of solutions. Moreover, from the algorithmic point of view, the proposed algorithm, named CHAC, yields the best results on average." .

The purpose of this study is to measure and identify detailed time-frequency components in normal SEP using time-frequency analysis (TFA) methods and to obtain their distribution pattern in the time-frequency domain. MethodsThis paper proposes to apply a high-resolution time-frequency analysis algorithm, the matching pursuit (MP), to extract detailed time-frequency components of SEP signals. The MP algorithm decomposes a SEP signal into a number of elementary time-frequency components and provides a time-frequency parameter description of the components. A clustering by estimation of the probability density function in parameter space is followed to identify stable SEP time-frequency components. ResultsExperimental results on cortical SEP signals of 28 mature rats show that a series of stable SEP time-frequency components can be identified using the MP decomposition algorithm. Based on the statistical properties of the component parameters, an approximated distribution of these components in time-frequency domain is suggested to describe the complex SEP response. ConclusionThis study shows that there is a set of stable and minute time-frequency components in SEP signals, which are revealed by the MP decomposition and clustering. These stable SEP components have specific localizations in the time-frequency domain." .

Nevertheless, strong coupling may be needed to prevent asynchrony. We discuss how some neural networks may be designed to achieve only simple locking behavior when the coupling is strong. The design is based on the fact that the method of averaging produces equations that are capable only of locking or drift, not pathological complexity. Furthermore, it is shown that oscillators that interact by means of multiple pulses per cycle, dispersed around the cycle, behave like averaged equations, even if the number of pulses is small. We discuss the biological intuition behind this scheme, and show numerically that it works when the oscillators are taken to be composites, each unit of which is governed by a well-known model of a neural oscillator. Finally, we describe numerical methods for computing from equations for coupled limit cycle oscillators the averaged coupling functions of our theory." .

The limiting probability measure over D can always be extended to a probability measure over $${{\\wp(N)}}$$, but this measure is not always σ-additive. We conclude that probability measures can be regarded as idealizations of limiting frequencies if and only if σ-additivity is not assumed as a necessary axiom for probabilities. We prove that σ-additive probability measures can be characterized in terms of so-called canonical and in terms of so-called full f-approximations. We also show that every non-σ-additive probability measure is f-approximable, though neither canonically nor fully f-approximable.

Instead of applying the algorithm separately for each matrix row (as in the classical version of the algorithm) we employ more general block partitionings.

We apply this algorithm to a second kind Fredholm integral equation and show that the complexity of the method only depends linearly on the number, say n, of unknowns. The complexity of the classical matrix oriented approach is O(n 2) while, for the classical panel clustering algorithm, it is O(nlog7 n)." .

When interest is focused on the dependency structure, inferences can be made from a complex covariance matrix using a marginal modeling approach. In this marginal modeling framework, testing covariance parameters is not a boundary problem. Bayesian tests on covariance parameter(s) of the compound symmetry structure are proposed assuming multivariate normally distributed observations. Innovative proper prior distributions are introduced for the covariance components such that the positive definiteness of the (compound symmetry) covariance matrix is ensured. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed priors on the covariance parameters lead to a balanced Bayes factor, in case of testing an inequality constrained hypothesis. As an illustration, the proposed Bayes factor is used for testing (non-)invariant intra-class correlations across different group types (public and Catholic schools), using the 1982 High School and Beyond survey data." .

This work presents the derivation of general streamflow cumulants from daily rainfall time series. The general streamflow cumulants can be used to compute basic streamflow statistics such as mean, variance, coefficient of skewness, and correlation coefficient. Streamflow is considered as a filtered point process where the input is a daily rainfall time series assumed to be a marked point process. The marks of the process are the daily rainfall amounts which are assumed independent and identically distributed. The number of rainfall occurrences is a counting process represented by either the binomial, the Poisson, or the negative binomial probability distribution depending on its ratio of mean to variance. The first three cumulants and the covariance function of J-day averaged streamflows are deduced based on the characteristic function of a filtered point process. These cumulants are functions of the stochastic properties of the daily rainfall process and the basin-response function representing the causal relationship between rainfall and runoff." .

Both problems can be found in universities where students can select courses they would like to attend before or after the timetabling is done. When demand exceeds capacity, the universities may allocate the available seats independently from the timetabling, but students may have then to decide which courses they are going to attend because of clashes in their timetable. To avoid this situation, some universities prepare their timetable considering students selection. In addition to that, students may submit preferences over courses, and the school administration has to assign seats and do the timetable considering both preferences and clashes. In this paper, both problems, seats allocation and timetabling, have been modeled separately and combined as constraint satisfaction optimization problems (CSOP). Two algorithms have been designed and implemented to find a solution to both problems simultaneously maximizing the satisfaction of students using a CSOP solver and an Ant colony optimization algorithm for the timetabling problem. The results of both algorithms are then compared. The allocation and timetabling procedures are based on preferences for courses defined by students, and on the administration’s constraints at Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne. Three real data sets have been used to carry out a complete experimental analysis. High-quality solutions are obtained in a few minutes with both approaches; those solutions are currently used at Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne." .

As demand updates, dynamic economic dispatch is used to update utility generator dispatch. The marginal electrical price offered by the utility updates each time interval reflecting updated supply and demand (real time pricing). Time-of-use load scheduling through dynamic programing combined with dynamic pricing optimizes load scheduling and reduces total demand in the system. The method schedules utility generation minimizing supply-side operational cost, and in turn, demand-side electricity cost at all times (valley, peak, off-peak) and is thus mutually advantageous." .

In particular and in contrast to most other scientific disciplines, sports science research has been characterized by comparatively little effort investment in the development of phenomenological models. Practical applications of such models aimed at assisting trainees or sports professionals more generally remain nonexistent. The present paper aims at addressing this gap. We adopt a recently proposed mathematical model of neuromuscular engagement and adaptation, and develop around it an algorithmic framework which allows it to be employed in actual training program design and monitoring by resistance training practitioners (coaches or athletes). We first show how training performance characteristics can be extracted from video sequences, effortlessly and with minimal human input, using computer vision. The extracted characteristics are then used to fit the adopted model i.e. to estimate the values of its free parameters, from differential equations of motion in what is usually termed the inverse dynamics problem. A computer simulation of training bouts using the estimated (and hence athlete specific) model is used to predict the effected adaptation and with it the expected changes in future performance capabilities. Lastly we describe a proof-of-concept software tool we developed which allows the practitioner to manipulate training parameters and immediately see their effect on predicted adaptation (again, on an athlete specific basis). Thus, this work presents a holistic view of the monitoring–assessment–adjustment loop which lies at the centre of successful coaching. By bridging the gap between theoretical and applied aspects of sports science, the present contribution highlights the potential of mathematical and computational modelling in this field and serves to encourage further research focus in this direction." .

In order to solve these problems, an optimization algorithm is required that is able to apply a global search regardless of the problems’ particularities. This paper proposes a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm, called jDElscop, for solving large-scale optimization problems with continuous variables. The proposed algorithm employs three strategies and a population size reduction mechanism. The performance of the jDElscop algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems provided for the Special Issue on the Scalability of Evolutionary Algorithms and other Metaheuristics for Large Scale Continuous Optimization Problems. Non-parametric statistical procedures were performed for multiple comparisons between the proposed algorithm and three well-known algorithms from literature. The results show that the jDElscop algorithm can deal with large-scale continuous optimization effectively. It also behaves significantly better than other three algorithms used in the comparison, in most cases." .

Realizing the full potential of WSN poses many design problems, especially those which involve tradeoffs between multiple conflicting optimization objectives such as coverage preservation and energy conservation. While both energy conservation routing protocols in a cluster-based WSNs and coverage-maintenance problems have been extensively studied in the literature, these two problems have not been integrated in a multi-objective optimization (MOO) manner. This paper employs a recently developed MOO algorithm, the so-called multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve simultaneously the energy conservation and coverage preservation design problems in cluster-based WSNs. The performance of the proposed approach, in terms of network lifetime and coverage is compared with the heuristic LEACH and SEP clustering protocols and with another prominent MOEA, the so-called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II). Simulation results reveal that MOEA/D provides a more efficient and reliable behavior over other approaches." .

It is shown that the analysis of such infinite structures can be reduced to the analysis of the repeating module under transformed loading and boundary conditions. Consequently, both the design parameters and the analysis variables constitute a relatively small set which facilitates the optimization process. The approach hinges on the representative cell method. It is based on formulating the analysis equations and the continuity conditions for a sequence of typical modules. Then, by means of the discrete Fourier transform this problem translates into a boundary value problem of a representative cell in transformed variables, which can be solved by any appropriate analytical or numerical method. The real structural response any-where in the structure is then obtained by the inverse transform. The sensitivities can also be calculated on the basis of the sensitivities of the representative cell. The method is illustrated by the design for minimum compliance with a volume constraint of an infinite plane truss. It is shown that by employing this analysis method within an optimal design scheme one can incorporate a reduced analysis problem in an intrinsically small design space." .

For 1 ≤ i < j < d, a j-dimensional subspace L of ${\\Bbb R}^d$ and a convex body K in ${\\Bbb R}^d$, we consider the projection K|L of K onto L. The directed projection function v i,j (K;L,u) is defined to be the i-dimensional size of the part of K|L which is illuminated in direction u ∈ L. This involves the i-th surface area measure of K|L and is motivated by Groemer’s [17] notion of semi-girth of bodies in ${\\Bbb R}^3$. It is well-known that centrally symmetric bodies are determined (up to translation) by their projection functions, we extend this by showing that an arbitrary body is determined by any one of its directed projection functions. We also obtain a corresponding stability result. Groemer [17] addressed the case i = 1, j = 2, d = 3. For j > 1, we then consider the average of v 1,j (K;L,u) over all spaces L containing u and investigate whether the resulting function $\\bar{v}_{1,j}(K,u)$ determines K. We will find pairs (d,j) for which this is the case and some pairs for which it is false. The latter situation will be seen to be related to some classical results from number theory. We will also consider more general averages for the case of centrally symmetric bodies." .

The decentralized control law of the overall system is designed by integrating all controllers of the isolated subsystems, and it satisfies the optimality on the basis of optimal control laws of all the subsystems. For solving the optimal control problems of these isolated subsystems, the policy iteration algorithm is used to approximately solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations in the framework of ADP with the neural network implementation, where a set of critic neural networks is constructed to estimate the optimal cost functions, and the approximate optimal control laws can be obtained after the learning of critic neural networks. The weight estimation errors of the critic networks and the stability of all isolated subsystems are proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the performance of the proposed decentralized optimal control strategy is verified by simulation results." .

We prove a Wiener-type criterion for super-Brownian motion and the Brownian snake.If F is a Borel subset of ℝ d and x ∈ ℝ d , we provide a necessary and sufficientcondition for super-Brownian motion started at δ x to immediately hit the set F. Equivalently, this condition is necessary and sufficient for the hitting time of F by theBrownian snake with initial point x to be 0. A key ingredient of the proof isan estimate showing that the hitting probability of F is comparable, up to multiplicative constants,to the relevant capacity of F. This estimate, which is of independent interest, refines previous results due to Perkins and Dynkin. An important role is played by additivefunctionals of the Brownian snake, which are investigated here via the potentialtheory of symmetric Markov processes. As a direct application of our probabilisticresults, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence in a domain D of a positivesolution of the equation Δ; u = u 2 which explodes at a given point of ∂ D." .

The purpose of this paper is to present a simple and effective derivation of the analytic solution for pre-arrival epoch probabilities as a linear combination of specific geometric terms (except for the boundary probabilities when the number of servers is greater than the maximum batch size) involving the roots of the underlying characteristic equation. The solution is then leveraged to compute the waiting-time distributions of both first and arbitrary customers of an incoming batch. Numerical examples with various arrival patterns and batch size distributions are also presented.

Sufficient feasible conditions are obtained for the global asymptotic of the equilibrium state of the system. The main advantage of this approach is that it gives a full diagonal representation of the fractional operator, being able to achieve spectral convergence regardless of the fractional power in the problem. Additional advantage is that the application of the proposed method to two and three spatial dimensions requires a straightforward extension to the one dimensional case. Numerical simulation results of the space fractional reaction–diffusion system, especially in two and three dimensions provide some amazing dynamics when compared to the classical reaction-diffusion equation, and as such consider as a powerful modelling approach for understanding the various aspects of heterogeneity in excitable media.

Thus, systems biology will move biology from a phenomenological to a predictive science. Mathematical modeling of biological networks and processes has already greatly improved our understanding of many cellular processes. However, given the massive amount of qualitative and quantitative data currently produced and number of burning questions in health care and biotechnology needed to be solved is still in its early phases. The field requires novel approaches for abstraction, for modeling bioprocesses that follow different biochemical and biophysical rules, and for combining different modules into larger models that still allow realistic simulation with the computational power available today. We have identified and discussed currently most prominent problems in systems biology: (1) how to bridge different scales of modeling abstraction, (2) how to bridge the gap between topological and mechanistic modeling, and (3) how to bridge the wet and dry laboratory gap.

The constraints specify the graph nodes that must belong to the solution as well as mutual exclusions of graph nodes, i.e., pairs of nodes that cannot belong to the same solution. Our main contribution is a novel inference approach for solving this problem in a sequential monte carlo (SMC) sampling framework. Usually in an SMC framework there is a natural ordering of the states of the samples. The order typically depends on observations about the states or on the annealing setup used. In many applications (e.g., image jigsaw puzzle problems), all observations (e.g., puzzle pieces) are given at once and it is hard to define a natural ordering. Therefore, we relax the assumption of having ordered observations about states and propose a novel SMC algorithm for obtaining maximum a posteriori estimate of a high-dimensional posterior distribution. This is achieved by exploring different orders of states and selecting the most informative permutations in each step of the sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed inference framework significantly outperforms loopy belief propagation in solving the image jigsaw puzzle problem. In particular, our inference quadruples the accuracy of the puzzle assembly compared to that of loopy belief propagation." .

We consider the adaptive tracking problem for a chain of integrators, where the uncertainty is static and functional. The uncertainty is specified by L 2/L ∞ or weighted L 2/L ∞ norm bounds. We analyse a standard Lyapunov-based adaptive design which utilises a function approximator to induce a parametric uncertainty, on which the adaptive design is completed. Performance is measured by a modified LQ cost functional, penalising both the tracking error transient and the control effort. With such a cost functional, it is shown that a standard control design has divergent performance when the resolution of a “mono-resolution” approximator is increased. The class of “mono-resolution” approximators includes models popular in applications. A general construction of a class of approximators and their associated controllers which have a uniformly bounded performance independent of the resolution of the approximator is given." .

We consider solutions for distributed multi-commodity flow problems, which are solved by multiple agents operating in a cooperative but uncoordinated manner. We provide the first stateless greedy distributed algorithm for the concurrent multi-commodity flow problem with poly-logarithmic convergence. More precisely, our algorithm achieves $${1+\\varepsilon}$$ approximation, with running time $${O(H{\\cdot} \\log^{O(1)}m{\\cdot} (1{/}\\varepsilon)^{O(1)})}$$ where H is the number of edges on any allowed flow-path. No prior results exist for our model. Our algorithm is a reasonable alternative to existing polynomial sequential approximation algorithms, such as Garg–Könemann (Proceedings of the 39th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, Palo Alto, CA, USA, pp. 300–309, 1998). The algorithm is simple and can be easily implemented or taught in a classroom. Remarkably, our algorithm requires that the increase in the flow rate on a link is more aggressive than the decrease in the rate. Essentially all of the existing flow-control heuristics are variations of TCP, which uses a conservative cap on the increase (e.g., additive), and a rather liberal cap on the decrease (e.g., multiplicative). In contrast, our algorithm requires the increase to be multiplicative, and that this increase is dramatically more aggressive than the decrease." .

Due to the fact that an open system is allowed to constantly gain or lose mass, the classical conservation law of mass has to be recast into a balance equation balancing the rate of change of the current mass with a possible in- or outflux of matter and an additional volume source term. The influence of the generalized mass balance on the balance of momentum, kinetic energy, total energy and entropy is highlighted. Thereby, special focus is dedicated to the strict distinction between a volume specific and a mass specific format of the balance equations which is of no particular relevance in classical thermodynamics of closed systems. The change in density furnishes a typical example of a local rearrangement of material inhomogeneities which can be characterized most elegantly in the material setting. The set of balance equations for open systems will thus be derived for both, the spatial and the material motion problem. Thereby, we focus on the one hand on highlighting the remarkable duality between both approaches. On the other hand, special emphasis is placed on deriving appropriate relations between the spatial and the material motion quantities. The mathematical sciences particularly exhibit order, symmetry, and limitation; and these are the greatest forms of the beautiful. Aristotle, Metaphysica" .

The obtained results are applied to study the set of rational numbers having a purely periodic β-expansion. We indeed make use of the connection between pure periodicity and a compact self-similar representation of numbers having no fractional part in their β-expansion, called central tile: for elements x of the ring $${\\mathbb {Z}[1/\\beta]}$$ , so-called x-tiles are introduced, so that the central tile is a finite union of x-tiles up to translation. These x-tiles provide a covering (and even in some cases a tiling) of the space we are working in. This space, called complete representation space, is based on Archimedean as well as on the non-Archimedean completions of the number field $${{\\mathbb Q} (\\beta)}$$ corresponding to the prime divisors of the norm of β. This representation space has numerous potential implications. We focus here on the gamma function γ(β) defined as the supremum of the set of elements v in [0, 1] such that every positive rational number p/q, with p/q  ≤  v and q coprime with the norm of β, has a purely periodic β-expansion. The key point relies on the description of the boundary of the tiles in terms of paths on a graph called “boundary graph”. The paper ends with explicit quadratic examples, showing that the general behaviour of γ(β) is slightly more complicated than in the unit case." .

This modification is successfully applied to solve integral equations of the second kind thanks to a number of advantages over the quasi-Monte Carlo method. Thus, solving these equations by the quasi-Monte Carlo method requires estimating the sum of a series whose terms are integrals with infinitely increasing constructive dimension. As is known, this is one of the main factors hindering the application of the quasi-Monte Carlo method. Another difficulty is the dominated convergence condition, which ensures the absolute convergence of the series whose sum is to be estimated. The modification under consideration makes it possible to overcome the first difficulty and relax the dominated convergence condition. Two families of estimates are suggested, which can be applied in the modified algorithm of the quasi-Monte Carlo method. The integral equation $$ \\phi (x) = \\int {k(x,y)\\phi (y)\\mu (dy) + f(x)(\\bmod \\mu ),} $$ is considered, where x ∈ D ⊂ ℝ s and f and k are given functions defined on the supports of the measures μ and μ ⊗ μ. The values of ϕ n (x) = ∫k(x, y)ϕ n - 1(y)μ(dy) + f(x)are estimated step by step. The first group of estimates serves to evaluate ϕ n at a fixed point x’: $$ \\xi _1 (x') = \\frac{1} {N}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^N {\\xi _1^n (y_j )} ,where\\xi _1^n (y) = \\frac{{k(x',y)\\hat \\phi _{n - 1} (y)}} {{p_{n - 1} (y)}} + f(x'), $$ here, the y j are distributed with density p n−1 and $$ \\hat \\phi _{n - 1} (y) $$ is the estimate obtained at the preceding step. The other group of estimates makes it possible to evaluate ϕ n at random points. Optimal parameters of the estimates are found and the corresponding theorems are proved. The theory has been verified on the example of a difference analogue of the Navier-Stokes equation; experimental results are presented." .

Based on the Love first approximation theory, the basic relations, the modified Donnell-type stability and compatibility equations have been obtained for laminated orthotropic truncated conical shells, the material properties of which vary piecewise continuously in the thickness direction. To solve this problem an unknown parameter λ was included in the approximation functions. Applying Galerkin methods, the buckling pressures and fundamental natural frequencies of laminated homogeneous and non-homogeneous orthotropic conical shells are obtained. The parameter λ which is included in the obtained formulas is obtained from the minimum conditions of critical stresses and frequencies. The different generalized values are obtained for the parameter λ for buckling pressures and frequencies of cylindrical shells, truncated and complete conical shells. The appropriate formulas for single-layer and laminated cylindrical shells made of homogeneous and non-homogeneous, orthotropic and isotropic materials are found as a special case. Finally, the influences of the degree of non-homogeneity, the number and ordering of layers and the variations of conical shell characteristics on the critical hydrostatic pressure and natural frequencies are investigated. The results obtained for homogeneous cases are compared with their counterparts in the literature." .

The output is depicted as probabilistic rather than deterministic and is used to calculate the risk of low DO concentration. To demonstrate the new method, data from the Bow River in Calgary, Alberta from 2006 to 2008 are used. Low DO concentration has been occasionally observed in the river and correctly predicting, and quantifying the associated uncertainty and variability of DO is of interest to the City of Calgary. Flow, temperature and DO data were used to construct five MLR models, using different combinations of linear and non-linear fuzzy membership functions. The results show that non-linear representation of variance is superior to the linear approach based on model performance. Normal and Gumbel based membership functions produced the best results. The outputs from two non-linear fuzzy membership models were used to calculate risk of low DO. The predicted risk was between 3.9 and 4.9 %. This is an improvement over the traditional method, which can not indicate a risk of low DO for the same time period. This study demonstrates that water resource managers can adequately use MLR models to predict the risk of low DO using abiotic factors." .

A GWA study typically requires the inclusion of thousands of samples to have sufficient statistical power to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with only modest increases in risk of disease given the heavy burden of a multiple test correction that is necessary to maintain valid statistical tests. Low statistical power and the high financial cost of performing a GWA study remains prohibitive for many scientific investigators anxious to perform such a study using their own samples. A number of remedies have been suggested to increase statistical power and decrease cost, including the utilization of free publicly available genotype data and multi-stage genotyping designs. Herein, we compare the statistical power and relative costs of alternative association study designs that use cases and screened controls to study designs that are based only on, or additionally include, free public control genotype data. We describe a novel replication-based two-stage study design, which uses free public control genotype data in the first stage and follow-up genotype data on case-matched controls in the second stage that preserves many of the advantages inherent when using only an epidemiologically matched set of controls. Specifically, we show that our proposed two-stage design can substantially increase statistical power and decrease cost of performing a GWA study while controlling the type-I error rate that can be inflated when using public controls due to differences in ancestry and batch genotype effects." .

We evaluate through simulation studies mixtures of normals and latent class mixtures of Bernoulli responses. For normal mixtures we use a “gold standard” set of population models based on a well-known “testbed” data set—the galaxy recession velocity data set of Roeder (J Am Stat Assoc 85:617–624, 1990). For Bernoulli latent class mixtures we consider models for psychiatric diagnosis Berkhof et al. (Stat Sin 13:423–442, 2003). The new approach is based on comparing models with different numbers of components through their posterior deviance distributions, based on non-informative or diffuse priors. Simulations show that even large numbers of closely spaced normal components can be identified with sufficiently large samples, while for latent classes with Bernoulli responses identification is more complex, though it again improves with increasing sample size." .

Importantly, while these models describe the sample paths of the substitution rates along a phylogenetic tree, only the (random) average rate can be estimated on each edge. For mathematical convenience, the stochastic nature of these averages is generally ignored. In this article we derive the probabilistic distribution of the average substitution rate assuming a geometric Brownian motion for the sample paths, and we investigate the corresponding error bounds via numerical simulations. In particular we confirm the validity of the gamma approximation proposed in Guindon (Syst Biol 62(1):22–34, 2013) for “small” values of the autocorrelation parameter." .

Firstly, growth curves of L. monocytogenes in treated and untreated RTE lettuce were obtained at several isothermal conditions (4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C) and were then fitted into Gompertz model with a high correlation coefficient (R 2 > 0.99). Growth parameters such as growth rate (GR) and lag time (LT) estimated by Gompertz model were found mostly have significant difference (P < 0.05) with those predicted by Combined database for predictive microbiology (ComBase). Moreover, increased GR and decreased LT were observed with increasing storage temperatures from 4 to 35°C and untreated lettuce showed lowest GR or longest LT, and followed by treated lettuce and ComBase, respectively. Furthermore, square root equation was employed to establish the secondary models for the GR to evaluate the effect of different storage temperatures on the growth rate of L. monocytogenes in untreated lettuce and treated lettuce. After that, verification of the developed models has been carried out using several mathematical or statistical indicators such as R 2, the average mean square error (MSE), bias factor (B f) and accuracy factor (A f). It showed that R 2 values were close to 1 (>0.95), and MSE calculated from models of untreated and treated lettuce were 0.0011 and 0.0008, respectively. Also, B f values of 0.980 and 1.034 and A f values of 1.107 and 1.118 were all in the acceptable range. This demonstrated that overall predictions showed good agreement with the experimental values, indicating success at providing reliable predictions of L. monocytogenes growth in RTE lettuce." .

These tests include deviation/spread, Grubbs-type, Dixon-type, and high-order moment statistics. Performance for the statistical tests is evaluated using Geochemical Reference Material databases from the United States Geological Survey. Test efficiency is compared for the first application of statistics in version k = 1 and k = 2, as well as for tests in version k = 1 applied consecutively against block procedures in which k = 2, 3, or 4 values are evaluated at the same time. In both evaluations, the sensitivity of the statistical tests shows a general strong dependence on sample size. The best performance is observed for the block procedures compared to consecutive statistical tests affected by masking effects." .

Theoretically, these methods are not restricted to PDEs formulated on physical domains up to dimension three. Although at present there does not seem to be a very high practical demand for finite element methods that use higher dimensional simplicial partitions, there are some advantages in studying the methods independent of the dimension. For instance, it provides additional insights into the structure and essence of proofs of results in one, two and three dimensions.

Let η be a diffusion process taking values on the infinite dimensional space T Z , where T is the circle, and with components satisfying the equations dη i =σ i (η) dW i +b i (η) dt for some coefficients σ i and b i , i∈Z. Suppose we have an initial distribution μ and a sequence of times t n →∞ such that lim n →∞μS tn =ν exists, where S t is the semi-group of the process. We prove that if σ i and b i are bounded, of finite range, have uniformly bounded second order partial derivatives, and inf i ,ησ i (η)>0, then ν is invariant." .

It involves an ideal-gas framework in which quark and gluon masses depend on temperature. This model is able to reproduce the recent equations of state computed in lattice QCD for temperatures typically higher than 2 T c , in a range in which it is reasonable to neglect interactions between quasiparticles. In addition, the equations of state for a generic gauge theory with gauge groups SU(N c ) and quarks in an arbitrary representation are studied. The gauge independence in the pure glue sector and the large-N c equivalence between the gauge groups SU(N c ) and SO(2N c ) in a full plasma is finally shown for normalized thermodynamic quantities." .
