The deformation tests were performed in the temperature range of 900–1100°C and strain rate range of 5.0×10−2 −5.0/sec. The evolutions of flow stress and microstructure show the characteristics of continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX). The flow stress gradually decreased with strain over the peak stress without steady state. Below the 100% effective strain, grains appeared in small angle grain boundaries with a misorientation of 3–9°. In addition, when heavy deformation (>300%) was applied, higher misorientation (∼15°) was achieved. The tendency of CDRX increased with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature. The dependence of CDRX grain size on the strain rate and temperature was discussed." .

Several characterization tools were employed to study the phase structures, morphologies, and optical properties of the samples. The in situ chemically mixed prepared BiOX particles with diameters 3.0–5.0 μm, fabricated by nanoplates in the thickness range of 5–18 nm, exhibited the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity among the as-prepared samples and Degussa P25 for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). This result can be due to the narrow bandgap, broad sunlight range, high electronic negativity, and efficient separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism has been proposed." .

Electrodeposted Ni from a sulfamate bath was shown to possess a microcrystalline grain structure with a thermal conductivity (82 W/mK) and electrical resistivity (7.9 μΩcm) similar to bulk Ni. The addition of saccharin additives or Mn alloying resulted in refinement of the grain structure which elevated the electrical resistivity and decreased the thermal conductivity. The effects of thermal aging were studied through isothermal annealing. Data show that the Ni-Mn samples were most thermally stable both in grain structure and transport properties. Ni-Watts with saccharin resulted in rapid grain growth and an increase in thermal conductivity and decrease in electrical resistivity to that near bulk Ni. The measurements of transport properties were shown to be sensitive to the initial changes in grain structure in the Ni-Watts and Ni-Mn materials, and thus, can be used to track microstructural evolution." .

The Young’s modulus of LTCC DuPont 951 ceramic versus temperature is analysed theoretically. The sensor resonant frequency is tested from room temperature to 600 °C. Results show that resonant frequency drops nearly as a line. And the dropping of resonant frequency is mainly caused by the increase of LTCC material permittivity. A capacitor structure is proposed to reduce the change of frequency versus temperature and a compensation structure is proposed for the actual application. Moreover, the coupling effect between antenna and sensor fabricated using FERRO A6M-E and DuPont 951 is compared at 600 °C.

It is shown that the aggregate structure formed in the alloy —in which particles of Cr7C3 carbides are located preferentially along grain boundaries — block the migration of the carbides. The intensive dissolution of the strengthening carbide phase seen at T ∼ 1573 K is accompanied by the formation of two-phase (γ + γ′) boundary regions. These regions are the result of an increase in the concentration of chromium. The method of differential thermal analysis was used to detect the occurrence of an endothermic reaction in the alloy at T>1573 K. This reaction is associated with saturation of the γ-phase with carbon up to the eutectic concentration and the fusion of the eutectic." .

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the electrodeposited copper films follow “island growth mode” in the form of microdots and their number densities increase with the rise of the negative deposition potentials. At an electrodeposition potential of −0.2 V the number density of the copper microdots are found to be 4.5×104 cm−2 that are increased to 2.9×105 cm−2 at a potential of −0.8 V. Systematically, the distances between the microdots are found to be reduced from 26.6 μm to 11.03 μm with the increase of negative electrochemical potential from −0.2V to −0.8V. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses have confirmed the formation of copper stearate on the stearic acid modified copper films. The roughness of the stearic acid modified electrodeposited copper films is found to increase with the increase in the density of the copper microdots. A critical copper deposition potential of −0.6V in conjunction with the stearic acid modification provides a surface roughness of 6.2 μm with a water contact angle of 157°, resulting in superhydrophobic properties on the aluminum substrates." .

Surface morphology examinations were carried with AFM, while XRD was used to determine metal lattice parameters, texture and phase composition. Low-temperature annealing (at 225 °C) caused the formation of intermetallic Fe/Zn compounds, a transformation of amorphous oxide inclusions to the crystalline form and a decrease in the Zn lattice parameter for Zn-Co and Zn-Fe alloys. The mentioned structural modifications were not accompanied, however, by corrosion behavior changes of these coatings. On the Zn-Ni alloy, the annealing caused a significant reduction in the diffraction peak width and simultaneous considerable augmentation of the corrosion current. This effect is related to the formation of a less disordered lattice for this alloy." .

The cell dynamic performance was measured by employing a transparent cell and investigated with visualization images of the water distribution in the flow channels. Furthermore, the effect of the operating temperature on the cell transients was examined. The results show that the cell dynamic behavior for the tested operating temperature (30–50 °C) conditions is mainly governed by water transport characteristics related to cathode flooding. Also, we show that the time needed for the cell to reach steady-state after a current density step increase is retarded due to excessive water accumulation inside the cell at lower operating temperatures." .

The metal-dielectric-metal sandwich structure which possesses perfect absorption property is used to realize the filter. The calculated results show that different dual-band wavelengths of the reflection spectrum are filtered while the incident light has different polarization which is parallel or vertical to the x axis. Moreover, it is found that the filtered wavelengths (resonant wavelengths) can be tuned independently and freely by adjusting the length of the corresponding rectangular strips. In addition, it is found that all of the intensities at the filter wavelengths are closed to zero, which implies the filter exhibits good filtering performance." .

Stable and reproducible potentiometric characteristics were obtained for PEDOT doped by poly(4-styrenesulfonate) ions, PEDOT(PSS) (cationic characteristics), and PEDOT doped by hexacyanoferrate(II) anions, PEDOT(HCF) (anionic characteristics). As shown by voltammetric and EDAX results, the anion exchange properties of the latter polymer result from gradual replacement of HCF ions by Cl− anions from solution. The zero-current potentiometric detection limit of PEDOT(PSS), equal to 3×10−6 M, can be shifted to 7×10−7 M by polarization using a cathodic current density of 3×10−7 A cm−2. PEDOT films doped by Cl− or PSS− ions can be used as membranes for sensing anions or cations, respectively, under pulse amperometric conditions, within the range from 10−4 to 1 M, comparable with that accessible by zero-current potentiometry. Dissolved oxygen (redox interferent of low charge transfer rate) exerts a minor influence on the slope of the potentiometric and amperometric characteristics of PEDOT films. Although the presence of redox reactants characterized by a high rate of charge transfer [Fe(CN)6 3−/4−] results in the disappearance of the potential dependence on KCl concentration, this disadvantageous effect is much less significant under pulse amperometric conditions." .

All cuticular membranes exhibited distinct second-order phase transitions in the temperature range of about 40 to 50° C. Increases in the volumes of fruit cuticles (Lycopersicon, Cucumis, Capsicum, Solanum and Malus) were fully reversible, while leaf cuticular membranes (Ficus, Hedera, Nerium, Olea, Pyrus, Picea and Citrus) underwent irreversible structural changes. Below the phase-transition temperature, volumetric expansion coefficients ranged from 0.39·10−6 m3·kg−1·K−1 to 0.62·10−6 m3·kg−1·K−1, and above from 0.60·106 m3·kg−1·K\\-1 to 1.41· 10−6 m3·kg−1·K−1. Densities of cuticles at 25° C ranged from 1020 kg·m−3 to 1370 kg·m−3. Expansion coefficients and phase transitions were characteristic properties of the polymer matrix as a composite material, rather than of cutin alone. It is argued that the sudden increase of water permeability above the transition temperature, is caused by an increase of disorder at the interface between the polymer matrix and the soluble cuticular lipids.

In this work, we simulate a wedge sliding against a metallic specimen with a single, near-surface inhomogeneity or pseudograin, representative of unit asperity–grain interactions. The inhomogeneity is either plastically softer or harder than the surrounding substrate and is perfectly bonded to it. Remarkably, this simple model is able to reproduce numerous experimentally observed aspects of unsteady sliding, including the development of bumps and depressions on the prow, surface self-contact (fold) formation and the development of crack-like damage features on the residual surface. It is found that a hard inhomogeneity causes surface depressions, while a soft inhomogeneity causes surface bumps. Both features develop into folds, and subsequently, crack-like damage features. The model also reproduces the effects of sliding incidence angle, friction and size of inhomogeneity on the sliding response. The propensity to bump and fold formation decreases on increasing the depth at which the inhomogeneity is embedded. Analysis reveals that plastic buckling is a plausible mechanism for the development of perturbations on the surface of the prow. The present model differs from the classical triboplastic models of Oxley and Torrance mainly by way of the added inhomogeneity and is a minimal model to produce folding and associated damage in a single sliding pass. Implications for wear and deformation processing are discussed." .

A graphite phase, which is an artifact of the composite fabrication procedure, decorates the interfacial region of the composite. The presence of the graphite is believed to play a role in both the low interfacial bond strength in the as-fabricated composite and the further reduction in bond strength after 10 thermal cycles in the temperature range of 373 to 1373 K. In regions where the graphite phase was not present, there appeared to be an intimate bond between the NiAl matrix and the A12O3 filaments. Simulation of TEM diffraction contrast images based upon a three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis was employed to investigate the nature of the residual strains in regions along the interface.

These strains are believed to be related to dislocation nucleation in the NiAl, which results from the relaxation of the thermally generated residual stresses." .

Since film properties depend mainly on the content of incorporated oxygen and nitrogen, a method for quantitative analysis of the main constituents based on electron probe micro analysis with energy dispersive detection was developed. The excellent precision of the quantitative results for aluminium as well as oxygen and nitrogen are shown. Furthermore, a film layer analysis program was applied for the quantification of several films deposited under the same deposition parameters on silicon wafers, from 520 nm down to 40 nm thickness, showing that electron probe micro analysis with energy dispersive detection is a reliable method for quantitative compositional analysis of thin aluminium oxynitride films down to approximately 20 nm thickness. Since this method of analysis provides only bulk information, expected inhomogeneities of the depth distribution of the film components were checked by secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiles of two thin films and correlated to the EPMA results. The thickness of the films was determined by ellipsometry." .

Moreover, the implication on the pipeline integrity was analyzed. It was found that a layer of corrosion product, i.e., ferrous and ferric oxides, would form on the steel surface to inhibit the further corrosion of the steel. The structure of the corrosion product layer would change with time, resulting in the steel corrosion experiencing a mechanistic alteration. The effects of oxygen and temperature on the steel corrosion were determined. Moreover, the uniform corrosion rate of the steel is within the acceptable range, and thus does not affect the pipeline integrity." .

It is found that dispersed oxide particles in the compact material prepared from a mixture of oxide Y2O3 powder and a NiAl alloy (produced by calcium hydride reduction of a mixture of nickel and aluminum oxides) powder in a standard ball mill are nonuniformly distributed in the volume. The morphology of oxides changes during sintering: sintered samples contain rounded particles, which differ strongly from the clearly faceted angular particles of oxide Y2O3 added to a mixture (they represent conglomerates of single crystals). In the sintered samples, large aggregates of oxides are revealed along grain boundaries. Mass transfer is possible at the NiAl/Y2O3 interface in the system: it leads to partial substitution of aluminum and/or iron atoms for yttrium atoms in the Y2O3 lattice and to the formation of submicroscopic particles of (Fe,Al)5Y3O12-type oxides." .

We added the sample to a custom-designed system equipped with an electrostatic panel and optical interferometer. The system overcomes problems associated with using nano-indentation for testing, and reduces errors tied to the amount of contact force required to bend the beam. Accurate paddle cantilever beam deflection was obtained using a four-step phase-shifting process with a Michelson interferometer. Film strain was determined using a simple force equilibrium equation. Residual stresses were measured at −41.3 MPa for 150 nm silver film, −3.2 MPa for 150 nm gold film, and −16.8 MPa for 150 nm copper film. We observed residual stresses for copper films at different thicknesses. The results indicate high tensile stress forms during the early deposition stage for thin copper film due to grain coalescence, and a decrease in stress with an increase in film thickness. In copper films with thicknesses greater than 153 nm, lattice relaxation associated with the surface mobility of metallic atoms changed residual stress from tension to compression." .

Continuous local gas evolutions were observed at certain points on the blade-abraded surface, and second-phase particles were found at the same positions, revealing the presence of cathodic particles at the gas evolution sites. The continuous local gas evolution reaction was found to be coupled with not only oxide formation reaction on the Mg matrix around the cathodic particles but also dissolution of Mg at the area within 2–3 μm distance from the cathodic particle. The gas evolution rate appeared to be proportional to the size of cathodic particles, and various cathodic particles containing Fe, Mn, Al, and/or Si were found to be present in the Mg alloys. Based upon the experimental results, it is concluded that the new method is simple, fast, and non-destructive, and it can be used to detect all the cathodic second-phase particles present on the entire surface of Mg alloys, irrespective of the sample shape and size." .

The multilayer structure, ferromagnetic/conductive/ferromagnetic, is composed of a copper layer sandwiched with two Finemet® alloy films. The later, initially an amorphous material, is nanocrystallized by heat treatment. The fabrication process has been optimized in order to minimize coercivity and induce transversal anisotropy. The technological defects induced by the lift-off and sputtering processes change the magneto-impedance properties of the sensors. Eliminating these defects permits the sensor to reach to a sensitivity of 1,200 V/T/A at 30 MHz with a bias field larger than the anisotropy field and without hysteresis. The angular dependence of the sensitivity shows that the sensor is only sensitive to the axial component of the magnetic field." .

Due to the enhanced surface roughness, it is almost impossible to bond wafers after KOH etching. This also applies when wafers are heavily doped, have a thick LPCVD silicon nitride layer on top or have a LPCVD polysilicon layer of poor quality. It has been demonstrated that these wafers bond spontaneously after a very brief chemical mechanical polishing step. An adhesion parameter, that comprises of both the mechanical and chemical properties of the surface, is introduced when discussing the influence of surface roughness on the bondability. Fusion bonding, combined with a polishing technique, will broaden the applications of bonding techniques in silicon micromachining." .

The trapping of charge carriers in GaAs MOS capacitors during constant voltage stress has also been studied and the increase in gate leakage current observed during electrical stress is estimated and explained by taking into account the build up of trap charges and stress induced trap generation. The cross-section of traps is also estimated to be in the range of 10−18 cm2. Such a small value for the capture cross-section implies that the generated traps are neutral centers which are probably responsible for trap-assisted tunneling during voltage stressing." .

Three kinds of PVOH stapled fibres, having different melting temperatures and tensile mechanical properties, were considered as a reinforcement, whilst plasticized PVOH granules were selected as a continuous matrix. Calorimetric tests on the constituents showed significantly different melting temperatures between the matrix and the fibres, thus evidencing adequate processing windows for the preparation of SPCs. On the other hand, scanning electron microscopy on the cryofractured surfaces of melt-mixed and compression-moulded SPCs experimentally proved that the morphological integrity of the reinforcement was maintained only when high melting temperature fibres were utilized. Quasi-static mechanical tensile tests highlighted the capability of the selected PVOH fibres to remarkably increase the elastic modulus, the stress at yield and the Vicat softening temperature of the PVOH matrix. Moreover, dynamic storage modulus and glass transition temperature of SPC increased with respect to the neat PVOH over the whole range of considered temperatures, whilst short-term creep stability was strongly improved, proportionally to the fibre content. The application of a time–temperature superposition principle to creep data confirmed the effectiveness of these fibres in increasing the long-term creep stability of the resulting materials." .

As the result of the sufficient stability of the dispersed cementite toward solution in the ferritic matrix the ferritic-cementite structure is preserved with an insignificant degree of overheating and short (up to 5 h) holds at temperatures above the Ac1.3.An increase in the hold temperature in the first step of annealing to 620°C causes an increase in the stability of the dispersed cementite toward overheating and also some refinement of the ferritic grains after the full two-step recrystallization annealing cycle.4.Temperature-time cycles of bell-furnace annealing causing an increase in stability of the mechanical properties of 08GSYuT steel strip of different thicknesses have been developed and tested under production conditions." .

The basic connections between Hill–Rice theoretical framework and Eckart–Mandel approach, involving the mobile stress-free configuration, are discussed both in generalized coordinates and in the tensorial notation. To this end the selected fundamentals of solid mechanics including the work-conjugacy are recalled. The structure of the updated Lagrangean plastic increment of the total strain is exhibited accounting for the deformation and stress effects due to possible damage and pressure sensitivity of a solid.

When the probe was outside the Venus ionosphere and was in the solar wind, the probe current was entirely due to solar photons striking the probe surface. This probe thus measured integrated solar EUV flux (Ipe) over a 13-year period from January 1979 to December 1991, thereby covering the declining phase of solar cycle 21 and the rising phase of solar cycle 22. In this paper, we examine the behavior of Ipe translated to the solar longitude of Earth (to be called EIpe) during the two solar cycles. We find that total EUV flux changed by about 60% during solar cycle 21 and by about 100% in solar cycle 22. We also compare this flux with other solar activity indicators such as F_10.7 , Lα, and the solar magnetic field. We find that while the daily values of EIpe are highly correlated with F_10.7 (correlation coefficient 0.87), there is a large scatter in EIpe for any value of this Earth-based index. A comparison of EIpe with SME and UARS SOLSTICE Lα measurements taken during the same period shows that EIpe tracks Lα quite faithfully with a correlation coefficient of 0.94. Similar comparison with the solar magnetic field (Bs) shows that EIpe correlates better with Bs than with F_10.7 . We also compare EIpe with total solar irradiance measured during the same period." .

An improvement of the tribological behaviour of microsystems can be realized by optimizing the contact condition and by application of special coatings with low friction and low wear rates. For optimizing the contact condition a defined topography and surface profile is generated by photolithography. Furthermore tribological coatings with low friction and low wear rates are developed and investigated using nanoindentation and micro scratch experiments. Also novel results on micro structured surfaces coated with a-C:H and a-C films will be discussed. The results show the great potential of carbon-based coatings in combination with an optimized geometrical surface design." .

The morphology as well as the amount of the IMCs, in particular the interfacial IMCs, are important to mechanical performance of the solder joints in their service environment. This is especially the case in state-of-art ultrafine-pitch wafer-level packaging, in which solder joints could become as small as 50 μm in diameter or even less. However, research addressing growth kinetics of the IMCs in the existing literature has concentrated on fitting experimental data onto a simple parabolic growth equation, which cannot account for all the complicated physics involved in the process of IMC formation. There are a few models based on Fick’s diffusion equations in the literature, which assume the growing IMC interface is planar. A combined thermodynamic–kinetic model has been derived from the relationships amongst some thermodynamic parameters; however, this model is only one dimension (1-D) in nature. 2-D models have also been proposed, e.g. an implicit boundary tracking method, and a phase field model. This paper reviews the modeling techniques in the literature for both the growth kinetics and morphology of the interfacial IMCs, under the context of lead-free soldering in very fine interconnections. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Possible solutions to include the geometrical features of micro solder joints in the modeling of growth kinetics of interfacial IMC are presented." .

Through pit and corner crack pits were created prior to constant stress amplitude fatigue testing. The small crack growth life (SCGL) and crack initiation life (CIL) under salt water condition were about 5-8 times less when compared to those under ambient air. The ratio of SCGL to CIL was significantly smaller with large uncertainty (variation) under salt water environment. The small crack growth rates under salt water were 2-12 times larger than corresponding rates under laboratory air at identical stress amplitude and crack length. The crack lengths required to attain Paris region growth rates (Paris region threshold crack lengths) were about 1-3 mm for stress amplitudes less than 45 MPa. Sub-millimeter cracks attained 10−4 mm/cycle fatigue crack growth rates (FCGR) for stress amplitudes greater than 45 MPa. The crack growth rates of 0.25-mm-long cracks were about 2 times higher for salt water environment when compared to identical stress conditions in ambient air. Empirical crack growth rate versus stress intensity factor range equations similar to Paris law were developed for small crack growth and crack initiation under ambient air and salt water condition, for fatigue crack prognostics applications.

However, in the case, where a residual layer is absent, a photoresist film is completely exposed to the oncoming radiation down to the interface between the photoresist film and substrate. Even in the presence of a residual layer, it has been uncertain to the author if a photoresist structure with a circular cross-sectional shape could be obtained, and be made applicable for the fabrication of a microlens array. The author then executed a set of thermal reflow treatments under various conditions using a positive-tone photoresist AZP4903 known for its capability of forming relatively thick films. As a result, it became clear that the existence of a photoresist’s residual layer has large influence on the transformation of the cross-sectional shapes of photoresist structures. These observations can be attributed to whether the bottom surface of a photoresist structure is firmly fixed on a hard substrate, or if it happens to be in contact with a soft photoresist layer which can flow comparatively freely." .

The bistable switch is fabricated on SOI wafer with 10 µm thick device Si layer using Silicon-On-Insulator Multi User MEMS Process with three masks. The proposed device is comprised of a centrally clamped parallel curved beams (switching element) and a pair of electrothermal V-beam microactuators (actuating element). The bistability is achieved through the buckling of centrally clamped parallel curved beams and the critical buckling load is provided by the electro-thermal expansion of the V-beam microactuators. Hinges, latches, membranes are not used in the proposed design and thus the fabrication complexity is reduced to a greater extent. A maximum displacement of 20.7 µm is achieved at 14 V DC supply for the V-beam microactuator and this thermal expansion of the V-beam microactuator acted as the critical buckling load for the centrally clamped parallel curved beam. Electrical and mechanical characterization of switch is performed and after the analysis, it is verified that the nonlinear property (elasticity) of silicon material is poor and that is the reason for comparatively higher actuation voltage to simulation results.

Accordingly, thermosetting resin systems, which consist of multiple fillers, monomers and/or catalysts in thermoset-based glass fiber prepregs, are extremely complicated and closely associated with rheological properties, which depend on the temperature cycles for cure. For the process control of these complex systems, it is usually required to obtain a reliable kinetic model that could be used for the complex thermal cycles, which usually includes both the isothermal and dynamic-heating segments. In this study, an ultra-thin prepreg with highly loaded silica beads and glass fibers in the epoxy/amine resin system was investigated as a model system by isothermal/dynamic heating experiments. The maximum degree of cure was obtained as a function of temperature. The curing kinetics of the model prepreg system exhibited a multi-step reaction and a limited conversion as a function of isothermal curing temperatures, which are often observed in epoxy cure system because of the rate-determining diffusion of polymer chain growth. The modified kinetic equation accurately described the isothermal behavior and the beginning of the dynamic-heating behavior by integrating the obtained maximum degree of cure into the kinetic model development." .

Raman spectroscopic studies of the nanocomposites confirm the existence of graphene in the nanocomposites. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the nanocomposites revealed the formation of homogeneous nanocrystalline SnO2, SnS2, and SnS particle. The weight ratio of graphene and Sn compound in the nanocomposite was estimated using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The cyclic voltammetry experiment shows the irreversible formation of Li2O and Li2S, and reversible lithium-ion (Li-ion) storage in Sn and GNS. The charge–discharge profile of the nanocomposite electrodes indicates the high capacity for the Li-ion storage, and the cycling study indicates the fast capacity fading due to the poor electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite electrodes. Hence, the ratio of Sn compounds (SnO2) and GNS have been altered. Among the examined SnO2:GNS nanocomposites ratios (35:65, 50:50, and 80:20), the nanocomposite 50:50wt% shows high Li-ion storage capacity (400 mAh/g after 25 cycles) and good cyclability.

The study of the deposition kinetics has shown that the determining parameter is the ratio W/PTMS of the RF power over the TMS partial pressure. The role of oxygenated impurities present in the starting monomer is emphasized. High values of the W/PTMS ratio give films of low oxygen content as shown by IR spectroscopy measurements (<5% of Si-O bonds). These films have high densities (ρ∼1.7–2 g/cm3) and refractive indices (1.7) and are similar to amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide films. On the contrary, low values of W/PTMS result in the formation of a significant amount of Si-O bonds which are formed at the expense of Si-H bonds. The deposited films show lower densities (0.98–1.6 g/cm3) and lower refractive indices (1.47). It is postulated that this oxygen, which affects the kinetics and the film properties, comes from oxygenated pollutants (H2O) carried along with the monomer, and that its concentration depends on the temperature of the TMS cooling bath." .

After annealing above 1350°C (an average grain size d≥30 μm), the process of the outflow of interstitial elements onto the boundaries takes place incompletely, as a result of which a supersaturated solid solution is formed in the grain body. Subsequent annealing at 1150°C for 4 h leads to an additional increase in the oxygen content and to the formation of molybdenum-carbide particles on the boundaries; this causes a small decrease in the strength characteristics, and a sharp decrease in plasticity characteristics." .

We utilize an anion exchange polymer, protonated poly(4-vinylpyridine), into which hexacyanoferrate anions have been introduced. Owing to the presence of Fe(CN)6 3−/4− at the interface formed by the film and the steel, a sparingly soluble metal hexacyanoferrate (mostly Prussian blue, PB) is formed as an overcoating on the steel’s surface, presumably on the passive (metal oxide) layer. The redox polymer film on the steel seems to act as a composite three-dimensional bilayer-type coating in which hexacyanoferrate(III,II) anions (that are capable of effective charge storage) exist in the outer portions of the film, whereas the inner PB layer improves the system’s overall adherence and stability. By analogy to a conducting polymer (e.g. polyaniline, polypyrrole), introduction of the redox polymer composite film leads to stabilization of the steel substrate’s potential within the passive range." .

The alloy with about 16 wt. % Al has a structure of Ti3Al. The precipitation of {ie622-2} phase is evidently due to uneven distribution of aluminum in microvolumes of α phase.3.The precipitation of α2 phase affects the physical and mechanical properties of Ti−Al alloys." .

Aviation industry is working on promising technologies to mitigate this environmental impact. Lightweight design is a strong lever to lower the fuel consumption and, consequently, with it the emissions of aviation. High performance composites are a key technology to help achieve these aims thanks to their favourable combination of mechanical properties and low weight in primary structures. However, mainly synthetic materials such as petrol based carbon fibres and epoxy resins are used nowadays to produce composite in aviation. Renewable materials like bio-based fibres and resin systems offer potential environmental advantages. However, they have not found their way into aviation, yet. The reasons are reduced mechanical properties and, especially for the use of natural fibres, their flammability. Improvements of these shortcomings are under investigation. Therefore the application of bio-based and recycled materials in certain areas of the aircraft could be possible in the future. Good examples for applications are furnishings and secondary structures. The motivation for this paper is to give an overview of potential environmental properties by using such eco-materials in aviation. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool to calculate environmental impacts during all life stages of a product. The main focus is laid on the bio-fibres flax and ramie, recycled carbon fibres and bio-based thermoset resin systems. Furthermore an overview of environmental aspects of existing composite materials used in aviation is given. Generally, a lack of LCA results for the substitution of synthetic materials by bio-based/recycled composite materials in aviation applications has been identified. Therefore, available information from other transport areas, such as automotive, has been summarized. More detailed LCA data for eco-composite materials and technologies to improve their properties is important to understand potential environmental effects in aviation." .

These setups allow simulating undrained (UD), partial lateral drainage (PLD) and full lateral drainage (FLD) conditions and the measurement of resulting self-weight consolidation settlement of CPB. The results show that maximum drainage water percentages of 15 and 8 % of the CPB total initial water were observed for the FLD and the PLD columns. The results also suggest that in situ backfilled stopes behave in a similar way to that of FLD or PLD conditions." .

Among various problems are: (1) the time consumption in plating very tall parts or using microelectroplating as a replication technique; (2) the cost of material, in particular in the formation of very high-aspect-ratio absorber structures for X-ray masks in the deep and ultra-deep X-ray lithography step." .

The application of rule of mixtures for predicting the mechanical properties was critically discussed. Subsequently, a modified rule of mixtures was developed to estimate the mechanical properties of DP steels, which accounts for the variation of carbon content in martensite as a function of its volume fraction. The proposed model was able to predict the observed trends and values of hardness, yield stress, and tensile strength in a DP steel with ~0.1 wt.% C. Then, its applicability was also verified for a DP steel with ~0.2 wt.% C to cover the usual range of carbon content in DP steels. As a result, this simple and effective approach is anticipated to find application in estimating the properties of DP steels." .

The usage of COMSOL Multiphysics can improve the sensitivity of Bioelectronics to extend their stability and utility. Biosensors based on silicon nanowires promise highly sensitive dynamic label-free electrical for detection of biomolecules organic. In this paper, we investigated the effect of surface charge of the functional bio-interface of a nanowire field effect biosensor on the conductance of the nanowire through finite element calculations. The biosensor under consideration consisted of a silicon nanowire with radius of 15 nm surrounded by a 3-nm oxide layer, and it is surrounded by a 4 nm thick functional bio-interface layer. This whole system is immerged in an electrolyte and each of the layers was treated as a continuum medium characterized by the corresponding dielectric constant. First, the distribution of the electrostatic has potential in the narrower due to the surface charge. Then, the conductance of the nanowire was computed though integrating the effect of the potential on the charge carriers within the narrower and it is computed using Poisson equation with Boltzmann statistics. Finite element calculations showed the nonlinear dependence of the nanowire conductance on the bio-interface surface charge. The conclusion of the paper is the electrical potential distribution was found by solving these approximated equations." .

Starting with the beginning of polymerization, the Ce3+ cations actively form the special polymer morphology as demonstrated by SEM images. The chief consequence of the formation of so well-developed uniform nanostructure is that the latter allows the dopant anions, cations, and protons to easily enter and leave it. This, in turn, results in the high electrochemical activity of this polymer and enhances the conductivity of PANI samples doped with Ce3+ cations as compared with those doped with only protons." .

To simplify complicated biosynthetic matrices and achieve a novel class of potential materials, a model of polyion complex fibers was prepared from alginate and chitosan. In the current in vitro study, we thought that alginate-based chitosan hybrid biomaterials could provide excellent supports for fibroblast adhesion. In the current study, alginate polymer fiber (alginate group) and alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fibers (alginate with 0.05% chitosan, alginate-chitosan 0.05% group; alginate with 0.1% chitosan, alginate-chitosan 0.1% group) were originally prepared. We investigated the adhesion behavior of rabbit tendon fibroblast onto alginate polymer fibers versus the adhesion of the fibroblast onto alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fibers. Furthermore, mechanical properties and synthesis of the extracellular matrix were investigated. Mechanically, the novel fiber has considerable tensile strength of more than 200 MPa. We demonstrated that the alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fibers showed much improved adhesion capacity with fibroblast compared with alginate polymer fiber. Additionally, morphologic studies revealed the dense fiber of the type I collagen produced by the fibroblast in the hybrid polymer fibers. We concluded that an alginate-based chitosan hybrid polymer fiber has considerable potential as a desirable biomaterial scaffold for tendon and ligament tissue engineering." .

In the atmospheric layers the simulation reveals a correlation between field strength and inclination, with a nearly vertical strong-field magnetic component and a more horizontal weak-field component, in agreement with the observations. Our simulation also shows that magnetic flux is converted from one of these states to the other. In particular, magnetic flux sheets can also be formed when a new downflow lane starts due to granule fragmentation. The dynamics of the granulation and field-line reconnection are found to play a role in the initial stages of a magnetic element's formation. The simulation predicts that during or shortly after their formation magnetic elements could be associated with oppositely polarized flux at a small spatial scale." .

The interfacial zone is modeled by a nonhomogeneous interlayer having the power-law variations of shear modulus and mass density between the coating and the substrate of dissimilar homogeneous properties. Based on the Laplace and Fourier integral transform technique and the coordinate transformations of basic field variables, the transient crack problem is reduced to the solution of a singular integral equation with a generalized Cauchy kernel in the Laplace transform domain. The crack-tip response in the physical domain is recovered through the inverse Laplace transform to evaluate the dynamic mode III stress intensity factors as functions of time. The peak values of the dynamic stress intensity factors are further obtained versus the crack orientation angle, addressing the effects of crack obliquity on the overshoot characteristics of the transient crack-tip behavior for various combinations of material and geometric parameters of the layered medium." .

This paper presents direct observations of the diurnal variation (and dependence on solar zenith angle, SZA) of instantaneous aerosol direct radiative forcing efficiency (IADRFE) and aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) at surface during the period from December to March of 2010–2013 at Thiruvananthapuram (8.5°N, 77°E), an Indian peninsular station adjoining the Arabian Sea coast, which resides well within this aerosol plume. Magnitude of the IADRFE increases with SZA from −75 ± 20 W m−2 τ 500−1 at SZA of ~80° to attain a peak value of −170 ± 30 W m−2 τ 500−1 at SZA ~60° in March (~3 h before and after the local noon). Absolute magnitudes and SZA dependence of the observed seasonal mean IADRFE are in agreement (within 16 % of the absolute magnitudes) with those estimated using radiation transfer computations employing an aerosol model with visible band single-scattering albedo of ~0.90 ± 0.03. Observed values of the diurnal mean aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ADRFE) averaged during the season (December–March) vary between −71 and −76.5 W m−2 τ 500−1, which is in agreement with the model estimate of −71 W m−2 τ 500−1. The present observations show that the seasonal mean ADRF at surface (−25 to −28 W m−2) is about 10 % of the diurnal mean downwelling shortwave flux reaching the surface (in the absence of aerosols) during dry season at this location, indicating the major role of aerosols in regulating surface energetics." .

Creep rupture life was analyzed by the following two methods: the Monkman–Grant relationship and the θ projection concept. Based on accurate measurement of the creep strain rate, the prediction of creep life by the Monkman–Grant relation is very close to the test results. The θ projection concept is not only an effective way to predict the creep life, but also an appropriate approach to determine a precise value of creep strain rate.

Materials and methodsModerately rough (Ra 1.8–2.0 μm) sandblasted and acid-etched titanium disks were treated by UV light (0.05 mW/cm2 at λ = 360 nm and 2 mW/cm2 at λ = 250 nm) or by NTP (24 W, -0.5 mbar) of argon or oxygen for 12 min each. Surface structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Hydrophilicity was assessed by dynamic contact angle measurement. Cell attachment, viability, cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were assessed in vitro using murine osteoblast-like cells. ResultsUV irradiation or NTP treatment of titanium surfaces did not alter the surface structure. XPS analysis revealed a significantly increased oxidation of the surface and a decrease of carbon after the use of either method. NTP and UV light led to a significant better cell attachment of murine osteoblasts; significantly more osteoblasts grew on the treated surfaces at each time point (p < 0.001). ConclusionsUV light as well as NTP modified the surface of titanium and significantly improved the conditions for murine osteoblast cells in vitro. However, results indicate a slight advantage for NTP of argon and oxygen in a short time interval of surface functionalization compared to UV.

Tubular electrolyte-supported solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), with silver-gadolinium doped ceria (Ag-GDC) as both anode and cathode materials, are fabricated and operated directly with activated carbon as fuel. The kinetics of the DC-SOFCs is carried out through analyzing the correlations of the cell reaction rates to the emitting rates of CO and CO2. It turns out that higher operating current corresponds to higher rates of consuming and producing CO, through electrochemical oxidation at the anode and the Boudouard reaction at the carbon fuel, respectively. The rate of consuming CO can be maintained constant by controlling the operating current while the rate of producing CO decreases with time because of carbon consumption. When the CO producing rate becomes smaller than the CO consuming rate, the operation will be terminated. Compared to the rates of the chemical reactions, the diffusion rates of CO and CO2 are so fast that their impeding effect on the cell performance can be neglected." .

Physical properties (tensile strength, elongation, modulus, glass transition temperature (Tg), equilibrium modulus), yellowing after QUV exposure, water sensitivity, and coefficient of friction values for the 12 formulations were measured. The relationships between the formulation variables and the coating/film properties are discussed." .

Preliminary structural analysis of calcined powders of the materials by use of x-ray powder diffraction confirmed formation of single-phase systems with the tetragonal structure. Room-temperature scanning electron micrographs of the samples revealed uniform distribution of grains of low porosity and different dimensions on the surface of the samples. The frequency–temperature dependence of dielectric and electric properties was studied by use of dielectric and complex impedance spectroscopy over a wide range of frequency (1 kHz to 1 MHz) at different temperatures (25–500°C). The dielectric constant of BiFeO3 (BFO) was enhanced by substitution with Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3 (PZT) whereas the dielectric loss of the BPFZTO compounds decreased with increasing PZT content. A significant contribution of both grains and grain boundaries to the electrical response of the materials was observed. The frequency-dependence of the ac conductivity of BPFZTO followed Jonscher’s power law. Negative temperature coefficient of resistance behavior was observed for all the BPFZTO samples. Conductivity by thermally excited charge carriers and oxygen vacancies in the materials was believed to be of the Arrhenius-type." .

The low coefficient of friction of this material posed a challenge to securing specimens during tensile testing. Therefore, modification to the standard gripping method was implemented to facilitate the collection of meaningful test data. Furthermore, a long gauge length was selected to moderate the influence of slippage on the measure of the elastic modulus. A new experimental setup is presented to characterize the bending behavior at elevated-temperature conditions based on the vertical cantilever method. The material properties derived from the test data were implemented in a finite element model of the cross-ply lamina. The finite element model is generated using a hybrid discrete mesoscopic approach, and deep-draw forming of the material is simulated to investigate its formability. Simulation results are compared with an experimental forming trial to demonstrate the capabilities of the model to predict the development of out-of-plane waves during preform manufacturing." .

Copper additions reduced sheet grain size, decreased tensile flow stress and significantly increased tensile elongation under most elevated temperature test conditions.

In biaxial pan forming tests, only the Cu-containing alloys successfully formed pans at the higher strain rate 10−2 s−1. The high-Cu alloy showed the least die-entry thinning. Comparison of ambient temperature mechanical properties in O-temper state showed the high-Cu alloy to have significantly higher yield strength, ultimate strength, and ductility compared to the base 5083 alloy." .

Structural, magnetic, and ferromagnetic resonance characterization shows evidence for defect-free ferrites, but deterioration of manganite parameters. The resistivity and dielectric constants are smaller than expected values. The magnetoelectric effect (ME) is stronger in ferrite–PZT than in manganite–PZT. The ME voltage coefficient αE at room temperature is the highest in NFO–PZT and the smallest for LCMO–PZT. The transverse ME effect is an order of magnitude stronger than the longitudinal effect. The magnitude of αE correlates well with magnetic permeability for the ferrites." .

The test structure was designed on novel “paddle” cantilever beam coated thin film specimens with dimensions of a few hundred to 50 nm. This beam has a triangle shape that provides a uniform plane strain distribution. Standard clean room processing was used to prepare the paddle sample. The experiment can be operated using the electrostatic force to deflect the “paddle” cantilever beam and measure the mechanical response of the sample with surface deposited thin film. A capacitance measurement is used to observe the deflection of the cantilever plate on the other side of the sample with respect to the electrostatic force on the one side. The measured strain was then converted through this capacitance measurement to conduct mechanical behavior studies on the coated thin film. Both system performance experiments and calculations were studied to verify the design concepts. The residual thin film stress measurements were performed and compared with the calculated results from three different forces exerted on the “paddle” cantilever beam, including the force due to the film, compliance force, and electrostatic force." .

Under these conditions, the spinneret diameter could be reduced to the minimum value, 0.5 mm.

This technique meets the specific requirements of the microstructures, like a high flexibility concerning materials and geometry and low process temperatures ensuring the function of the joined components. Soldering offers the possibility of joining different materials in an easy way. Regarding the temperature aspects, the soldering processes can be carried out by low temperature to guarantee any damages in the joined components. Two soldering technologies are examined in this study: transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding and active soldering. Active solders based on Sn and different TLP systems have been developed and optimised according to the requests of the microsystems being joined. The application of the solder systems by magnetron sputter physical vapour deposition has been investigated. The deposition temperature has to be lower than the later joining temperature and lower than the melting points of the solder materials. This fact is a great challenge for the PVD process. The presented investigations and results are acquired within the project SFB 440 “Assembly of Hybrid Microsystems”, financed by the “German Research Foundation” (DFG)." .

Erosive wear behaviour was examined on newly fabricated nano-powder infiltration and transient eutectoid (NITE) SiC/SiC composites and two commercial composites by the chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) and NITE fabrication route. Microstructural observation was performed to examine the correlation between erosive wear behaviours and fabrication impurities. Conspicuous defects were observed in the prototype materials as the forms of porosity, fibre deformation, residual oxide, pyrolytic carbon (PyC) deformation, PyC cleavage, among others. Erosive wear behaviour was rather serious in the prototype of fabricated composites, which employ pre-SiC fibre and phenolic resin. Two dominant erosive wear mechanisms were observed: delamination of constituents, mainly caused by erosive crack propagation, and fragmentation and detachment of constituents, which usually resulted from erosive impact. A unit size of delamination was the most decisive factor affecting wear volume. The bonding strength of each constituent was mostly affected by various forms of porosities. Therefore, the fundamental cause and subsequent results must be carefully elucidated. The correlation of microstructural defect and wear behaviour was investigated with the aim of reducing dominant wear by improving fabrication conditions. The final product of the cost-effective composite had a 2.5-fold higher resistance than the commercial CVI composite. Consequently, by controlling fabrication impurities, we have been successful in developing and improving a new fabrication technique; consequently, the known defects are rarely observed in final product. A schematic wear model of erosive wear mechanisms is proposed for the newly fabricated SiC/SiC composites under particle erosion." .

Typical DRX behavior was observed under chosen deformation conditions and yield-point-elongation-like effect caused by DRX of δ-ferrite. The flow stress characteristics were determined by DRX of the δ-ferrite at early stage and the austenite at later stage, respectively. On the basis of hyperbolic sine function and linear fitting, the calculated thermal activation energy for the experimental steel was 294.204 kJ mol−1. The occurrence of DRX for both the austenite and the δ-ferrite was estimated and plotted by related Zener–Hollomon equations. A DRX kinetic model of the steel was established by flow stress and peak strain without considering dynamic recovery and δ-ferrite DRX. The effects of deformation temperature and strain rate on DRX volume fraction were discussed in detail. Increasing deformation temperature or strain rate contributes to DRX of both the austenite and the δ-ferrite, whereas a lower strain rate leads to the austenite grains growth and the δ-ferrite evolution, from banded to island-like structure." .

Due to the high surface-to-volume ratio for reinforcing particles at nanometer scales, the surface effect along the nanosized hole is considered in the analysis. It is concluded that both components of the J k -integral vector vanish when the contour selected to calculate the integral encloses the whole nanosized hole. This leads to the independence of the M-integral from the global coordinate rotation or shift. Of great interest is that the value of the M-integral is significantly influenced by the size of the nanosized hole and the remote loading, whereas this value is independent of the surface effect when the surface energy density along the surface of the nanosized hole is assumed to be independent of the elastic strain." .

When combined with a barrier layer based on an InAs/AlSb superlattice or an AlSbAs alloy, respectively, they can be used to make diffusion-limited “barrier” detectors with very low dark currents. In this work we compare theoretical simulations with experimental bandgap and photoabsorption data for such superlattices, spanning from the mid to the long-wave infra-red (2.3–12 μm). The spectral response of detectors based on these materials is also simulated. The simulations are based on a version of the k · p model developed by one of the authors, which takes interface contributions and bandgap bowing into account. Our results provide a way of assessing the relative merits of InAs/GaSb and InAs/InAsSb superlattices as potential detector materials." .

Using different volume fractions of GNP, the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites were analyzed by impedance analyzer with various ranges of electric fields. To support our discussions, percolation theory was used to know the dielectric behavior of the PS-BFO-GNP nanocomposites and the percolation threshold was observed at 3 vol% of GNP. The dielectric constant of PS-BFO-GNP nanocomposites reached as high as ~75 at 0.1 kHz, which was much higher than that of pure PS, PS-BFO and PS-GNP nanocomposites. Furthermore, the P–E hysteresis loop study was carried out to observe the ferroelectric behavior of the nanocomposites." .

AFM was used in this study to image the surface morphology of a biaxially oriented polypropylene film. The polymer film is characterized by a nanometer-scale, fiberlike network structure, which reflects the drawing process used during the fabrication of the film. AFM was used to study polymer-surface treatment to improve wettability by exposing the polymer to ozone with or without ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Surface-morphology changes observed by AFM are the result of the surface oxidation induced by the treatment. Due to the topographic features of the polymer film, the fiberlike structure has been used to check the performance of the AFM tip. An AFM image is a mixture of the surface morphology and the shape of the AFM tip. Therefore, it is important to check the performance of a tip to ensure that the AFM image collected reflects the true surface features of the sample, rather than contamination on the AFM tip." .

The test results show that the addition of steel fibres have little effect on the workability and compressive strength of SFRC, but the ultimate tensile loads, post-cracking behaviour, residual strength and the fracture energy of SFRC are closely related to the shapes of fibres which all increased with increasing fibre content. Results also revealed that the residual tensile strength is significantly influenced by the anchorage strength rather than the number of the fibres counted on the fracture surface. The 5DH steel fibre reinforced concretes have behaved in a manner of multiple crackings and more ductile compared to 3DH and 4DH ones, and the end-hooks of 4DH and 5DH fibres partially deformed in steel fibre reinforced self-compacting concrete (SFR–SCC). In practice, 5DH fibres should be used for reinforcing high or ultra-high performance matrixes to fully utilize their high mechanical anchorage." .

Our results show that In x Ga1−x N forms a random alloy, in which several-atom In–N clusters and In–N chains can exist stably with a high concentration due to their small formation energy. These In–N clusters and chains form more easily in zinc blende structure than in wurtzite structure. The band gap of zinc blende In x Ga1−x N alloys insensitively depends on the In distribution. Moreover, we find that both small In–N clusters and straight In–N chains with three or more In atoms, acting as radiative recombination centers, highly localize the electrons of the valence band maximum state and dominate the light emission of Ga-rich In x Ga1−x N alloys. The strains of In x Ga1−x N layers can enhance the electron localization in In x Ga1−x N/GaN strained quantum wells. Our results are in good agreement with experiments and other calculations." .

Especially Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) Shape Memory Alloys offer high actuating forces and adjustment travel in combination with high cycle stability. The shape memory effect is based on the transformation between martensitic and austenitic microstructure depending on the temperature of the actuators. The transformation temperatures in the range of 20°C to 100°C make NiTi SMA attractive for engineering applications. This paper investigates the technical use of NiTi SMA as actuators within a start-up clutch.

This demand can be realized with NiTi-Shape Memory Alloys (NiTi-SMA) without increasing the nominal size of the clutch appreciable." .

Addition of DBTDL could enhance thermal property and reduce dynamic storage modulus (G') at 180°C for PVC containing LaSt3 or Ca/Zn stabilizers.

In addition, ion release and proliferation of bacteria located at the interface between the restorative material and dental tissues are also implicated in the tissue response.

Although thermochemical estimates indicate that reactions throughout the temperature range should be thermodynamically favorable, we found that no reaction takes place appreciably until Al is heated to around 1473 K (1200 °C). The reaction products consist of fine powders of Si, Al, and AlF3. Some of the reaction products were transported away from the reaction zone by strong convection currents resulting from the exothermic reaction. Even at approximately 1673 K (1400 °C), the reaction rate is slow and a significant amount of Al remains unreacted. When NaF powders were used to line the graphite reactor, NaAlF4, AlF3, and Si powders were observed on the upper cooler walls of the reactor, and Si whiskers were formed just above the Al-Si alloy globule on the bottom of the crucible. We found evidence of the formation of AlF and SiF2 vapor species in the reaction zone, which then disproportionated along the cooler walls of the reactor, generating powders of Al and Si and regenerating condensable AlF3 and SiF4 gas, respectively." .

Rev. Vol. B 69, (2004) art. 214203] are reinterpreted in terms of the phonon-assisted electron tunnelling model. It is shown that the experimental results, measured in the temperature range from 1.8 K to 300 K are consistent with the tunnelling rate dependence on field strength, computed for the same range of temperatures. An advantage of this model over that of Aleshin et al, using the variable range hopping (VRH) model, is the possibility of describing the behaviour of I — V data measured at both high and low temperatures with the same set of parameters characterizing this material. This assertion is confirmed by comparison of the temperature-dependent current-voltage data extracted from Aleshin et al’s work with tunnelling rate dependence on temperature, computed using two different expressions of the phonon-assisted tunnelling theory.

One of these approaches, the so-called phase field method, represents cracks by means of an additional continuous field variable. This strategy avoids some of the main drawbacks of a sharp interface description of cracks. For example, it is not necessary to track or model crack faces explicitly, which allows a simple algorithmic treatment. The phase field model for brittle fracture presented in Kuhn and Müller (Eng Fract Mech 77(18):3625–3634, 2010) assumes quasi-static loading conditions. However dynamic effects have a great impact on the crack growth in many practical applications. Therefore this investigation presents an extension of the quasi-static phase field model for fracture from Kuhn and Müller (Eng Fract Mech 77(18):3625–3634, 2010) to the dynamic case. First of all Hamilton’s principle is applied to derive a coupled set of Euler-Lagrange equations that govern the mechanical behaviour of the body as well as the crack growth. Subsequently the model is implemented in a finite element scheme which allows to solve several test problems numerically. The numerical examples illustrate the capabilities of the developed approach to dynamic fracture in brittle materials." .

Emphasis is placed on (relatively) simple dynamo models that are nonetheless detailed enough to be comparable to solar cycle observations. After a brief overview of the dynamo problem and of key observational constraints, we begin by reviewing the various magnetic field regeneration mechanisms that have been proposed in the solar context. We move on to a presentation and critical discussion of extant solar cycle models based on these mechanisms. We then turn to the origin and consequences of fluctuations in these models, including amplitude and parity modulation, chaotic behavior, intermittency, and predictability. The paper concludes with a discussion of our current state of ignorance regarding various key questions relating to the explanatory framework offered by dynamo models of the solar cycle." .

When movement is required, a transducer has to be integrated, capable to convert electrical into mechanical energy. Different types of actuators can be selected, using electrostatic forces, magnetic fields or thermal expansion, and reliability of actuators has proven to be a critical element in MEMS devices. In this paper we have demonstrated that the Raman spectroscopy technique (using the Raman peaks shift) is a suitable tool to assess the temperature of a thermal actuator in a MEMS device. The technique used is a spectrometric characterization, benefitting from the Raman peaks shift caused by an increase in temperature. This method shows that it is possible to map areas with a resolution of a few microns and a temperature accuracy of around 0.01 %/full scale. This technique provides good resolution and accuracy and allows several analyses: from simple thermal mapping to determination of the system’s thermal physical parameters and constant thermal resistance variation at a micrometric scale." .

Different machining methods and parameters have been adopted for high precision machining of titanium alloys. Machining of titanium alloys can be improved by microstructure optimization. The present study focuses on the effect of microstructure on machinability of Ti6Al4V alloys at different cutting speeds. Samples were subjected to different annealing conditions resulting in different grain sizes and local micro-strains (misorientation). Cutting forces were significantly reduced after annealing; consequently, sub-surface residual stresses were reduced. Deformation twinning was also observed on samples annealed at a higher temperature due to larger grain size. Initial strain free grains and deformation twinning during machining reduces the cutting force at higher cutting speed." .

It was shown that electrical and thermal conductivity cross-property (Lorenz number) is almost constant and increases only slightly (no more than 10 % increase was observed). This implies that in the investigated composition range the Lorenz number of a copper–graphite composite system behaves according to Franz–Wiedemann law for pure metals at constant temperature. On the contrary, the conductivity to tensile strength cross-property connections showed significant linear increase (over 200 % in the investigated composition range) for both electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of composite materials.

One of the most elegant methods to achieve this, is to use chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). However the CMP technology as developed in the IC industry needs to be adapted to cope with typical magnetic heads characteristics like thick layers, stiff substrates and cleaning of heterogeneous surfaces.

The basic concept used in describing the elastic free energy is that strain due to a lattice mismatch accumulates in a thin film and interfacial misfit dislocations form when the strain energy exceeds a certain energy barrier. Our calculations showed that the single-phase region of a zinc-blend-type compound forms in the GaSb-GaAs/InP and InAs-GaAs/InP systems. This result is in fairly good agreement with the experimental examination of epitaxially grown thin film. The compositional latching phenomenon frequently observed in alloy semiconductor systems can be interpreted in terms of the phase separation generated by the accumulated strain in the thin films." .

Powder metallurgy technology was elaborated for consolidation of shape memory NiTi powders. The shape memory alloy was compacted from the prealloyed powder delivered by Memry SA.

The hot compaction was performed in a specially constructed vacuum press, at temperature of 680°C and pressure of 400 MPa. The alloy powder was encapsulated in copper capsules prior to hot pressing to avoid oxidation or carbides formation. The alloy after hot vacuum compaction at 680°C (i.e. within the B2 NiTi stability range) has shown similar transformation range as the powder. The porosity of samples compacted in the as delivered state was only 1%.

Diffraction gratings with high refractive index modulation amplitude (up to 1.25 × 10−2) have been formed due to the periodic distribution of high refractive index nanoparticles in a low refractive index polymer matrix. The diffraction efficiency increases strongly on increasing the nanoparticle concentration. Taking the mixture with 10 wt.% TiO2 nanoparticles, gratings with high diffraction efficiency, low level of scattering and high transparency in the visible-wavelength range have been obtained. This will ultimately lead to different applications of diffractive optical elements based on nanocomposites. The dependence of the gratings’ diffraction efficiency on the intensity of probe laser pulses at 1064 nm has been explored. It is shown that the nonlinear response of the gratings is attributed mainly to the nonlinear properties of the TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in the polymer matrix.

It is used for instance for thermal actuators, micro-grippers, or RF-switches. The defined electro deposition of the nickel matrix is crucial for the properties and functionality of e.g., thermal actuators. Micro galvanic processes are the basis of this electro deposition, and require knowledge of the electrochemical fundamentals as well as numerical electrochemical process simulation for adjustment. Especially, realization of high aspect ratios requires the application of sophisticated plating techniques such as pulse reverse deposition. The pulse plating process is adjusted using the results of electrochemical numerical simulation routines, visualizing the (local) potential field and the current field line distribution as a function of the applied electrochemical parameters. Compact, completely void free structures can be obtained by applying the developed pulse plating process to Si wafers that are structured with photo resist. Nickel is chosen for electro deposition due to its chemical stability and its hardness. MEMS structures are designed to convert the thermal expansion of the material into an in-plane deflection. A custom made measurement setup, consisting of a sealable chamber, a Peltier element with a temperature control unit, and an optical microscope is used to measure these deflections at different temperatures. A set of cantilever structures with different lengths is used to evaluate the Young’s modulus and the vertical stress gradient of the plated materials. Additional, finite element simulations are carried out to determine the thermal expansion coefficient of the plated Nickel, by fitting the simulation and the measurement results." .

Consequently, information on the operating parameters (vessel pressures, gas compositions, and maximum temperatures) for eleven low-Btu gasifiers was analyzed to characterize the gaseous environments in terms of the oxygen, sulfur, and carbon potentials in these systems. In general, the product gas from low-Btu gasifiers exhibits lower oxygen potentials than that from high-Btu gasifiers. Sulfur is a more important corrodant than carbon in these environments. A comparison of the environments in various high- and low-Btu processes shows that even the conventional high-chromium alloys, such as Type 310 stainless steel and Incoloy 800, will develop a sulfide mode of attack in nearly all low-Btu atmospheres, regardless of the sulfur content of the coal feedstock. The results also show that there exists a threshold in oxygen partial pressure above which a continuous protective oxide scale is developed on the alloys. At 1144 and 923 K, this threshold oxygen partial pressure is, respectively, ∼103 and ∼105 times the oxygen partial pressure for the Cr oxide/Cr sulfide equilibrium. The analysis of the process environments and the experimental evidence clearly shows that novel design approaches and alternate materials are needed for effective utilization of coal via low-Btu gasification schemes." .

For bit patterned media (BPM) to be successful as a revolutionary technology to further increase recording areal density, it must experience the touchdown process with similar robustness as conventional continuous media. Here we numerically study the tribological impact of TFC touchdown detection on the continuous media and unplanarized BPM by three-dimensional (3D) transient finite-element models with the frictional heating and thermal-elastic-plastic materials included. Our results demonstrate that the continuous media exhibits no plastic deformation due to the TFC touchdown with an over-push as large as 2 nm, whereas the plastic strain of the BPM may reach 3 % at higher sliding velocities, and it exists over a wide range of bulge radius and disk velocity. Such plastic deformation can lead to permanent media damage and data loss. Besides, the temperature rise of the BPM (~27 K) is approximately 1.3 times of that of the continuous media (~21 K), and may have to be considered when designing a robust head-disk interface for BPM. Although planarization may improve slider’s flyability performance, our analysis shows that planarizing BPM with SiO2 deteriorates the tribological robustness of the media in particular at a high disk velocity probably due to the inhomogeneous composition and mismatch of material properties between the filling material and recording material. Hence extreme caution must be exercised when choosing a filling material." .

It is shown that, as these parameters increase, the propensity toward seizure diminishes as a result of an increase in the strength of atomic bonds in the lattice and a fall in temperature in the contact zone.2.The correlation is analyzed between the wear of the tool electrode and the degree of localization of valence electrons in the material being machined. It is demonstrated that, with rise in the degree of localization, the propensity toward seizure decreases. The propensity toward seizure of tool electrode materials is a measure of their ability to yield electrons. For the carbides investigated, the order of donor capacities is WC> NbC> TiC. Titanium diboride occupies an intermediate position between niobium and titanium carbides." .

We discuss how wrinkles develop as a result of in-plane compression of thin sheets. As the wavelength of wrinkles is only dependent on elastic properties and thickness of the sheets, the phenomenon can be used in metrology for determination of elastic properties. The second aspect is its use for patterning and topographical structuring of surfaces. If mechanical properties and thickness are well controlled, wrinkle orientation and geometry can be tailored. Wavelengths between fractions of a micron and many micrometers are feasible. This process is based on a macroscopic deformation and upscaling to larger areas is possible which provides an attractive alternative to bottom-up or top-down approaches for surface patterning. We describe the formation of stable surface wrinkles in thin sheets of different materials having different surface chemistries, report on applications, and discuss the usefulness of wrinkles for building hierarchical structures." .

By use of material studio software, the lattice constant, band energy gap and optical permittivity of silica are calculated, and to be used as the key parameters to investigate the microwave dielectric properties of silica. It is found that its permittivity and loss are increased with increasing temperature. In addition, the ionic conduction loss caused by the defects in silica is very small from the calculation and the value is about 10−5 level at 2 000K. The application of this analysis allows to estimate the permittivity and dielectric loss of silica both at high temperature and microwave band, which is currently still difficult to be measured directly." .

Performance of these composites was evaluated under continuous impact abrasion tests (CIAT). Towards this purpose, a novel testing equipment was designed and developed at AC2T.

Characterization of the worn surface was done by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical 3D profilometry. In this work, it was shown that wear rates are higher for 45° impact angle compared to 90° for all composites investigated. Fibre debonding and fibre pull out was observed to be the dominating wear mechanisms for these composites during CIAT procedure under normal impact abrasion. Removal of chunk of material contributes to wear under oblique impact abrasion." .

At all temperatures, the strength of the as-tempered steels depends primarily on the dislocation structure inherited from the martensite transformation and work softening observed during deformation at 600° and 700° is attributable to recovery of this structure. Strain enhanced precipitation of M3C is observed after deformation at 200° to 600°C in all the steels, independent of the nature of the carbide present after tempering. Serrated yielding occurs at temperatures increasing from 200° to 400°C with increasing chromium content and is associated with an increase in strength and strain-hardening rate in all cases. It is concluded that dynamic strain-aging results from dislocation locking by chromium-interstitial complexes in the alloy steels." .

The standard respiratory costs associated with the stationary aspect of the strategy were estimated by means of a Gilson respirometer run at the different temperatures prevailing month by month in the beech woodland litter layer which comprises the spider's natural habitat. Respiration rate is related to weight by an exponent with a mean value of 0.7398. The Q 10 of respiration rate is 2.41 between 5°C and 10°C and 1.97 between 10°C and 15°C. The energy costs of producing a web comprise the active respiratory costs associated with the locomotory activity involved in spinning a web together with the energy value of the silk used in the web manufacture. The former were evaluated by allowing a spider to spin a web in a respirometer, subtracting the calculated standard respiratory energy costs for a spider of equivalent weight and multiplying by a correction factor for web size. The relationship between spider weight and area of web produced was established in the laboratory. The respiratory cost of spinning a web is effectively constant with temperature at 724.46·10-3 J for an adult (4 mg) spider. The energy value of spider silk was estimated by means of a bomb calorimeter and found to be 17,435 J g-1. The energy content of the silk of a single adult's web is 1.16 J, giving energy cost of web production of 1.88 J at all temperatures." .

The content of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was 0.39±0.08 pg per mg adenohypophysis. Immunoreactivity was localized by immunocyto-chemistry in three pituitary cell types: somatotrophs, lactotrophs and thyrotrophs, but not in corticotrophs and gonadotrophs. In these three pituitary cell types the SS28- and the SS14-like immunoreactive materials were localized in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm the immunoreactivity was seen in the cytoplasmic matrix and in the secretory granules. In the nucleus it was present mainly in the euchromatin close to the heterochromatin. In somatotrophs and lactotrophs, SS14- and SS28-like immunoreactive materials have been detected at the plasma membrane level. These results suggest that (1) endogenous SS14 and SS28 are present in adenohypophysis in somatotrophs, lactotrophs and thyrotrophs, and (2) the two peptides act on both the cytoplasmic components and the nucleus." .

Using a specific case, the cooling of a cylinder made of eutectoid carbon steel, an analysis of how the stress phase transformation interactions affect the internal stresses, and plastic strain evolutions during cooling are performed. The calculated results show that internal stresses have an important effect on the kinetics of pearlitic transformation.

The results show that the fracture behavior of thin polycrystalline diamond films synthesized by direct current plasma jet chemical vapor deposition is closely related to the substrate temperature and CH4 concentrations. A high substrate temperature, due to difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the diamond film, causes thin polycrystalline diamond films to generate high residual stresses, which usually exceed fracture strength of thin diamond film and even that of diamond. The fracture toughness is found to drop with the increasing ratio of CH4 concentration. In case of high CH4 concentrations, various defects and impurities, such as cracks, microscopic holes, graphite, and amorphous carbon were observed in the films. Thus, the substrate temperature and CH4 concentrations should be strictly controlled within an appropriate range" .

A crucial challenge to the repeatability and large-scale application of this technique is successful demolding, which escalates in difficulty with increasing aspect ratio, due to increased polymer-mold mechanical interlocking. Some of the key factors affecting UV embossing include the crosslinked polymer shrinkage and material properties, interfacial strength between polymer to mold and the demolding method. This paper presents a new method to simulate the demolding of UV cured polymer from a nickel mold. Hyperelastic material model and rate-independent cohesive zone modeling were employed in the numerical simulation; linear elastic polymer response, although relatively easy to apply, was not adequate. Progressive shrinkage was implemented, leading to delamination of the polymer-mold interface. The subsequent peeling of the cured polymer from the mold was modeled with increasing prescribed displacement. The optimal shrinkage degree was found to increase from 0.92 to 1.9% with increasing mold aspect ratio (aspect ratio is defined as height to width ratio) from 5 to 10." .

In this paper, as an example of the two interim dies, three die combinations of different angles and extrusion ratio are designed. Aviation magnesium alloy ZM6 is studied, and the results show that dynamic recrystallization is even more complete when continuous shear deformation occurs, so that the refinement and homogenization of microstructure are obtained. By the use of different die combinations, the accumulative strain increases under the conditions of same total extrusion ratio. Thus, the refined crystalline strengthening effect of extrusion deformation can be further analyzed. Due to the dead-zone defects, the actual accumulative strain decreases significantly and the effect of microstructure and performance improvements also decreases with it. Therefore, the optimal design of die combination is the key to the process and product of CVCDE, which provides a scientific basis for the development of severe plastic deformation." .

We find a series of transition temperatures at which the behaviour of the cell critically changes. As the cell is cooled from the smectic A phase past the first critical temperature there is a second order transition which forms two tilted layer states with lower energy than the smectic A bookshelf structure. Although these low energy tilted structures exist the bookshelf structure is the stable state for zero shear. However, upon further cooling this bookshelf structure becomes unstable to the formation of a chevron state. Now when the cell is sheared the chevron structure smoothly transforms into the tilted layer structure. As each further critical temperature is passed an additional multiple chevron solution is formed which although a high energy, unstable state may be observed transiently. For sufficiently low temperatures the transition from chevron to tilted layer becomes first order. This first order transition occurs as the chevron interface merges with the surface alignment region to form the tilted layer structure." .

Electrically induced birefringence is studied in photonic bi-oriented crystals in terms of molding lightflow in optical devices. In photonic bi-oriented crystals, misorientation of dielectric anisotropic grains results in a dielectric contrast at the grain boundaries. The translational periodicity of the optical constants depends upon a regular network of twisted dielectrics. Due to the anisotropy of the bicrystalline structure the direction of light propagation determines the dielectric contrast at the grain boundaries. In a specific crystallographic arrangement the optical properties of the bi-oriented crystal can be tuned by the electro-optical effect: the periodic dielectric contrast is electrically induced and photonic bandgaps are generated by applying external electric fields. The geometrical requirements for tunable photonic bicrystals are evaluated based on materials employed for electro-optical applications. Tunable photonic bi-oriented crystals may be candidates for fast optical switches, modulators and multiplexers in the optical communication network." .

A critical match of pigment and photoinitiator package is crucial, for good cure. Another issue facing the coatings chemist is the popularity of low energy lamps, which offer ease of handling, reduced safety concerns, and a low price tag. Obviously, the combination of curing pigmented coatings and using low energy lamps poses a special challenge. To improve the pigmented coating development cycle, a rapid workflow was needed to screen formulations for cure under low energy UV-A radiation. For these types of applications, a high-throughput, screening assay for discovering desirable photoinitiator packages was developed. Fluorescent dye-doped coatings cured under UV-A radiation were extracted with solvent. The relative degree-of-cure, of the film was determined to be inversely related to a combination of the absorbance and fluorescence of the extractant. When this assay is used in conjunction with automated liquid handling and a spectrophotometer with an x-y scanning stage, the coatings formulator can analyze a large variable set in a short period of time.

(211) Cd0.96Zn0.04Te samples were implanted either with hydrogen (5×1016 cm−2; 40–200 keV) or co-implanted with boron (1×1015 cm−2; 147 keV) and hydrogen (1–5×1016 cm−2; 40 keV) at intended implant temperatures of 253 K or 77 K. Silicon reference samples were simultaneously co-implanted. The change in the implant profile after annealing at low temperatures (<300°C) was monitored using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical microscopy. The samples implanted at the higher temperature did not show any evidence of blistering after annealing, although there was evidence of sample heating above 253 K during the implant. The samples implanted at 77 K blistered at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 300°C, depending on the hydrogen implant dose and the presence of the boron co-implant. The production of blisters under different implant and annealing conditions is consistent with nucleation of subsurface defects at lower temperature, followed by blistering/exfoliation at higher temperature. The surface roughness remained comparable to that of the as-implanted sample after the lower temperature anneal sequence, so this defect nucleation step is consistent with a wafer bond annealing step prior to exfoliation. Higher temperature anneals lead to exfoliation of all samples implanted at 77 K, although the blistering temperature (150–300°C) was a strong function of the implant conditions. The exfoliated layer thickness was 330 nm, in good agreement with the projected range. The “optimum” conditions based on our experimental data showed that implanting CdZnTe with H+ at 77 K and a dose of 5×1016/cm2 is compatible with developing high interfacial energy at the bonded interface during a low-temperature (150°C) anneal followed by layer exfoliation at higher (300°C) temperature." .

Resorting to full-wave simulations, we investigate the accuracy of the effective medium predictions and we relate their discrepancy with rigorous numerical results to the fact that $$|\\epsilon| \\ll 1$$ is a critical requirement. We show that a simple method for reducing this discrepancy, and hence for achieving a prescribed and very small value of $$|\\epsilon|, $$ consists in a subsequent fine-tuning of the nanoparticles volume filling fraction." .

Constant ΔK fatigue crack growth tests were also performed on CT type specimens with three different thicknesses of BS 4360 steel. Applying the proposed stochastic model and statistical analysis procedure, the experimental data were analyzed for different specimen thicknesses for determining the autocorrelation functions and probability distributions of the fatigue crack growth resistance." .

Due to their inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and thermal properties, it is challenging to achieve desired accuracy and to avoid from delamination, chip-off, cracking, and burning especially in the drilling process. The cutting force is the critical parameter which is required to minimize in order to drill a hole with better accuracy and minimize defects. In this research, the brittle fracture approach was adopted and a cutting force model was developed for CFRP-T700 based on the rotary ultrasonic drilling (RUD) process. The experimental RUD was carried out on CFRP-T700 material and found that the feed rate and spindle speed are two main parameters that affect the cutting force in RUD. The cutting force data obtained from the model and experimental setup were then analyzed and found that there is small variation even below 10 % (max value of variation is 8.5 % and the average value is 0.49 %) between simulated and measured values. So, the developed cutting force model was validated and found robust. Also, it was found that with four times increase of feed rate, there is also an increase of material removal rate (MRR) four times with the decrease in the cutting force. Moreover, this model will be much helpful to keep cutting force within limits through the optimal set of parameters as feed rate and spindle speed without extensive experimentation of such costly materials." .

Actuators with parallel-arranged comb drives enhance the electrostatic driving force. By using proper flexures, secondary stage actuators will drive the magnetic head with fast response and high accuracy. Fabrication of the actuators starts with a 200-μm-thick n-type silicon wafer, and it is subsequently bonded to a Pyrex glass substrate, which can be called silicon-on-glass process. This process is more cost-effective than the SOI wafer process, and the high aspect ratio structures with large thickness also provide good strength and reliability for the microactuators. Deep RIE and wafer bonding techniques were utilized to fabricate the electrostatic actuators. The fabricated actuators were statically and dynamically characterized for three different designs of straight-flexures, folded-flexures and quad-flexures with bandwidth of 7.15, 5.85 and 15.85 kHz, respectively. With proper designed flexures, the proposed microactuators would fulfill the requirements of the dual-stage servo of hard disk drives." .

All the samples show metal-insulator transitions with Curie temperature (T C) ranging between 260 K and 309 K. At temperature below 60 K, the K-doped manganites exhibit a shallow minimum, which disappears under an applied field of 0·8 T. This field dependent minimum in resistivity, observed in K-doped lanthanum manganites is explained in the light of intergrain tunneling of the charge carriers between anti-ferromagnetically coupled grains of the polycrystalline samples. The field variation of magnetoresistance below T C follows a phenomenological model which considers spin polarized tunneling at the grain boundaries. The intergranular contribution to the magnetoresistance is separated out from that due to spin polarized tunneling part at the grain boundaries. The temperature dependence of intrinsic contribution to the magnetoresistance follows the prediction of the double exchange model for all values of field at T<T C." .

For this purpose, the tensor analysis on manifolds is utilized. We show that the material balance of energy equation, in general, cannot be invariant; in fact an extra term appears in the transformed balance of energy equation, which is directly related to the work performed by the configurational stresses. By making the fundamental assumption that the body and the ambient space manifolds are always related in the course of deformation and by utilizing the metric concept, we determine this extra term. Building on this, we derive several constitutive equations for the material stress tensor. The compatibility of these constitutive equations with the second law of thermodynamics is evaluated. Finally, we postulate that the material balance of energy equation is covariant, and we study this case in detail, as well." .

In non-continuous, it involves two different profiles which are with and without pre-treated at 1000°C. To summarize, the three processing profiles used for this study were (S1) non-continuous (without 1000°C), (S2) non-continuous (with 1000°C), and (S3) continuous (with 1000°C). Results from this study show that S2 gives better properties than S1 and S3. From microstructure evaluation, S2 provided lower total porosity.

The two cracks are symmetrically parallel located in the isotropic solid. Based on Eshelby's equivalent inclusion method and the superposition pronciple of the elasticity theory, a closed-form analytical elastic solution for the stress intensity factors (SIFs) on the boundaries of the cracks is obtained when the center distance between the two cracks is much larger than the crack sizes. A numerical method is employed to extract the solution for small center distance case. It is found that, due to the interaction between the two cracks, the first and second kinds of SIFs exist at the same time even if the applied stress is pure tension. Numerical examples are given for different configurations and it is clearly shown that the SIFs are strongly determined by the distance between the centers of the two cracks." .

This new method made it easy to control ɛr of 1-3 piezoelectric composites, which were made up of fine-scale PZT rods in epoxy resin. The PZT rods were fabricated using the LIGA process, realizing an array of PZT rods with a cross section, height and volume fraction of 25 μm square, 250 μm and 25%, respectively. The new method consists of a plasma treatment applied before sintering of the PZT rods. By controlling the output RF power and duration of the plasma treatment, ɛr could be controlled between 250 and 400. Although extended plasma etching reduced ɛr, there were no changes in the piezoelectric properties and no defects in the sintered body. The ability to control ɛr of piezoelectric composites allows good electrical impedance matching with the electric circuit of diagnostic systems, thereby reducing signal transmission losses. Changing ɛr by varying the piezoelectric material or the sintering conditions requires lengthy process optimization. In contrast, controlling ɛr to establish a good impedance match can be done relatively easily with this new plasma technique because the piezoelectric properties are not affected." .

It is, for example, difficult to predict the internal growth stress field within the tree stem. Growth stresses are progressively generated during the tree growth and they are highly influenced by climate, biologic and material-related factors. To increase the knowledge of the stress formation, a finite element model was created to study how the growth stresses develop during the tree growth. The model is an axisymmetric general plane strain model where material for all new annual rings is progressively added to the tree during the analysis. The material model used is based on the theory of small strains (where strains refer to the undeformed configuration which is good approximation for strains less than 4%) where so-called biological maturation strains (growth-related strains that form in the wood fibres during their maturation) are used as a driver for the stress generation. It is formulated as an incremental material model that takes into account elastic strain, maturation strain, viscoelastic strain and progressive stiffening of the wood material. The results clearly show how the growth stresses are progressively generated during the tree growth. The inner core becomes more and more compressed, whereas the outer sapwood is subjected to slightly increased tension. The parametric study shows that the growth stresses are highly influenced by the creep behaviour and evolution of parameters such as modulus of elasticity, micro-fibril angle and maturation strain." .

For AAO prepared in oxalic acid, the anodizing potential is set as 40 V in order to balance the oxidation and dissolution rates. In practice, a higher potential is beneficial in increasing the pore size. However, a higher potential increases the local electrolyte temperature and therefore damages the pore structure. In this article, this problem is resolved by means of a high-potential hybrid pulse anodization (HPA) technique, in which a period of small negative potential is applied to suppress the Joule heating effect during the AAO preparation process. The scanning electron microscope results showed that HPA with an anodizing potential of 60 V resulted in an intact pore structure on the AAO surface. By contrast, the AAO formed using conventional direct current anodization with the same anodizing potential contained many small irregular pores around each original pore. The present results suggest that HPA has significant potential for the fabrication of high-quality nanowires with various diameters for such applications as magnetic recording, super capacitors or field emission devices." .

In this paper, a formulation for the buckling of cylindrical thin shells made of functionally graded material (FGM) composed of ceramic and metal subjected to external pressure varying as a power function of time is presented. The properties are graded in the thickness direction according to a volume fraction power-law distribution. The modified Donnell type dynamic stability and compatibility equations are obtained using Love’s shell theory. Applying Galerkin’s method and then applying a Ritz type variational method to these equations for different initial conditions and taking large values of the loading parameters into consideration, analytic solutions are obtained for critical parameter values. The results show that the critical parameters are affected by the configurations of the constituent materials, loading parameters variations and the power of time in the external pressure expression variations. Comparing the results with those in the literature validates the present analysis." .

Low carbon and low alloy steels with different silicon and nickel contents were heat treated under industrial conditions, i.e. in the reheating furnace of the hot rolling mill. Other sets of samples were heat treated in a laboratory furnace in air atmosphere. Scales formed in both cases were examined by different chemical and physical methods. The speed of dissolution was measured by etching the samples in a special agent and measuring the mass of the sample as a function of the etching time. The main investigations, however, were performed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an ED analyser. EDS investigations showed that with increasing Si content of the base material the scale was more rigid and could easier be removed, while increasing Ni-content caused the scale/metal interface to be more rough. The latter was observed in the case of laboratory samples as well." .

Iron exhibited four distinct oxidation behaviors in perchlorate solutions that had a pH of 3.0. First, the active dissolution potential with two current waves was observed in the range of −0.7 to 0 V. Second, the range of stable passivation was observed between 0 and 0.3 V. Third, unstable passivation was observed in the range of 0.3 to 1.2 V. Finally, pitting corrosion was observed at a potential above 1.2 V. The increase in pH stabilized the passivation of iron, whereas the increase in temperature had a negative influence on both the passivation and pitting behaviors of iron. The presence of H2O2 at concentrations less than 1.45 mM had an adverse effect on the formation of the passive oxide layer. However, H2O2 at concentrations greater than 1.45 mM exerted a beneficial influence on the formation of stable iron oxide in the active dissolution region. In addition, H2O2 mitigated the pitting corrosion of iron regardless of the H2O2 concentration." .

During conventional hot embossing, the substrate and the stamp are brought into contact and are compressed directly by the hot plates of the machine. The accuracy and area of replication are limited due to the inherent non-uniform pressure distribution. Si-wafers are too brittle to be used as embossing tools with the conventional hot embossing operation. This paper describes an innovative pressurizing method for hot embossing using gas as pressure media. The film/stamper/substrate stack is placed in a closed chamber. After heating, the gas is blown in at high pressure to pressurize the stack. Micro patterns in the stamp can be successfully replicated onto the substrate. Perfectly uniform embossing pressure throughout the whole area can be achieved. Glass or wafers with micro-features on their surfaces can be used as stampers directly." .

Among the wide bandgap semiconductor materials, aluminum nitride (AlN), zinc oxide (ZnO), diamond-like carbon (DLC) and silicon carbide (SiC) are highlighted due to their inherent sensing properties and compatibility with MEMS fabrication processes.

The resonant structure, named four-leaf clover (FLC), is circular and based on four petal-like double mass-spring systems, kept suspended through four straight beams anchored to the surrounding Silicon frame. Differently from standard cantilever-type EHs that typically convert energy uniquely in correspondence with the fundamental vibration frequency, this particular shape is aimed to exploit multiple resonant modes and, thereby, to increase the performance and the operation bandwidth of the MEMS device. A preliminary non-optimized design of the FLC is discussed and physical samples of the sole mechanical resonator, fabricated at the DIMES Technology Center (Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands), are experimentally characterized. Their behaviour is compared against simulations performed in ANSYS Workbench™, confirming good accuracy of the predictive method. Furthermore, the electromechanical multiphysical behaviour of the FLC EH is also analysed in Workbench, by adding a layer with piezoelectric conversion properties in the simulation. The measured and simulated data reported in this paper confirm that the MEMS converter exhibits multiple resonant modes in the frequency range below 1 kHz, where most of the environmental vibration energy is scattered, and extracted power levels of 0.2 μW can be achieved as well, in closed-loop conditions. Further developments of this work are expected to fully prove the high-performance of the FLC concept, and are going to be addressed by the authors of this work in the on-going activities." .

The diagonal-pendulums are driven to swing via tilted transforming beams as the driving frame oscillated in plane, and rotate around their torsional beam out-of-plane as orthogonal lateral angular rate applied. The symmetric arrangement of whole structure lowers mechanical complexity and the sensing way of “one diagonal-pendulum for one lateral axis” eliminates sensing proof mass sharing which can effectively suppress the cross-talk effect. The prototype device has been successfully fabricated by using SOI-based bulk micromachining processes and vacuum packaged by Al–Ge eutectic bonding.

The electrochemical evolution of the interface formed on BV-grade A naval steel exposed to natural seawater in the presence and absence of marine micro-organisms has been studied over 30 days. The results obtained by electrochemical techniques including linear polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that a heterogeneous layer formed by a mixture of corrosion products and biofilm grew on the material surface in natural seawater, producing an increase of the corrosion rate and then a decrease in the corrosion resistance under diffusion process. In this case, the protective layer formed by the corrosion products can be subject to the localised breakdown. In sterile seawater, the formation of two layers at the metal surface generated by organic and/or inorganic compounds deposits (outer layer) and corrosion products (inner layer) is concluded. Using our experimental data, electrical models are proposed. They describe the impedance distribution for carbon steel exposed to both environments. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis and optic microscope reproductions were obtained. They allowed an interpretation of the effect of the marine biofilm on the behaviour of the carbon steel in seawater." .

The results show that a trade-off between the tip aspect ratio and diameter should be taken into account when choosing the oxidation temperature.

A significant advance in the analysis of deformation was made when the polar decomposition theorem was introduced, making it possible to separate large deformations into a stretch and a rotation. Consequences of the theorem affect the way rate processes should be characterized. In particular, rate of material rotation is different from vorticity, and the stress rate for finite strains is different from the usual stress rate of Zaremba, Jaumann, and Noll. It is convenient to define a strain rate that is different from the stretching that is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient. These concepts are described in detail in a 1979 paper. Various criticisms of that paper have appeared in the Journal of Applied Mechanics, which are discussed herein. To illustrate the distinction it is shown that the rate of rotation in a classical vortex does not vanish, though the vorticity is zero. It is also shown that the rate of material rotation recently computed by Nemat-Nasser, which involves an eigenvalue expansion, is equivalent to the one given in the 1979 paper, which makes use of matrix inversion, and it is asseverated that the matrix inversion approach is computationally more efficient." .

To reveal current transport mechanism, the BT films possessing microporous structures and surrounded by homogeneously grown islands were assessed in a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) conformation. The forward current conduction was observed to be purely thermionic up to respective voltages of ~1.4 and 2.2 V as for the fresh and 3-day aged samples. On the other hand, direct tunneling (DT)-mediated Ohmic feature was witnessed at a comparatively higher voltage, beyond which Fowler–Nordheim tunneling (FN) dominates in the respective MIM junctions. The magnitude of current accompanied by FN process was observed to be stronger in reverse biasing than that of forward biasing case.

Cobalt has no effect on the diffusion of carbon in austenite, but at temperatures, below 950°C it increases the diffusion coefficient of tungsten, and therefore during tempering cobalt promotes acceleration of the transformation of residual austenite." .

The growing nature of these bodies is due to reasons that are not related to the main deformation process, as for example is the case in solidifying or melting bodies and in magnetic tapes during winding. We assume that the growing boundary is completely described in time. The strain tensor in such growing bodies does not satisfy the compatibility conditions. However, the strain rate tensor satisfies the compatibility condition and as such a hypoelastic constitutive model is proposed as an appropriate elastic model and the whole deformation problem is casted in the form of an initial/boundary value problem. The obtained solution satisfies continuity of deformation and it can easily be extended to account for rate dependent phenomena. As an application of this theory, a two-dimensional axially symmetric model and its finite element implementation for computing the induced stresses and deformation in a magnetic tape pack during a winding operation, are presented. The effects on the stresses of a tape pack due to a non-uniform across the tape width applied winding tension, are examined and presented." .

Some members of the genus Tethya represent the most contractile poriferan species. All of them show a highly ordered skeleton layout. Based on three main spicule types, functional units are assembled, termed skeleton superstructures here. Using synchrotron radiation based x-ray microtomography and quantitative image analysis with specially developed particle and structure recognition algorithms allowed us to perform spatial allocation and 3D-morphometric characterizations of single spicules and skeleton superstructures in T. minuta. We found and analyzed three skeleton superstructures in the investigated specimen: (1) 85 megasclere bundles, (2) a megaster sphere, composed by 16,646 oxyasters and (3) a pinacoderm–tylaster layer composed by micrasters. All three skeleton superstructures represent composite materials of siliceous spicules and extracellular matrix. From structure recognition we developed an abstracted mathematical model of the bundles and the sphere. In addition, we analyzed the megaster network interrelation topology and found a baso-apical linear symmetry axis for the megaster density inside the sphere. Based on our results, we propose a hypothetical biomechanical contraction model for T. minuta and T. wilhelma, in which the skeleton superstructures restrain physical stress generated by contraction in the tissue. While skeletal structures within the genus Tethya have been explained using R. Buckminster Fullers principle of tensegrity by other authors, we prefer material science based biomechanical approaches, to understand skeletal superstructures by referring to their composite material properties." .

Particular attention was paid to formation of a magnetite seam, which is the Fe3O4 layer formed at the FeO/alloy interface at an initial stage of the phase transformation, since it has important effects on the overall phase transformation of FeO scale. A thin Au(Fe) layer was found to develop on the Fe–Au alloy at the FeO/alloy interface after 32 min of oxidation at 750 °C in air. This Au(Fe) layer prevented formation of a magnetite seam and accelerated the FeO eutectoid reaction. The Au(Fe) layer acted as a “chemical diffusion barrier” for inward diffusion of Fe from the FeO to the alloy substrate across the FeO/alloy interface and prevented magnetite seam formation." .

To reduce the magnetic spacing loss caused by these effects, we developed an active head slider with a nano-thermal actuator. The magnetic spacing of these sliders can be controlled in situ during drive operations. After simulating the heat transfer in the slider to obtain the thermal deformation of the air-bearing surface, we fabricated a thermal actuator using thin-film processing. An evaluation done using a read/write tester showed a linear reduction in the magnetic height as electric power was applied to the actuator. The actuator’s stroke was 2.5 nm per 50 mW with a time constant of 1 ms. There was no significant impact on the reliability of the read element." .

High anodic potential was applied to dissolve 1D S13Cr electrode to a target pit depth. Removal and reprecipitation of salt film on the growing 1D pit was then performed by applying low and high anodic potential in sequence. Finally, the potential of the 1D pit was scanned downward until the pit stopped growing. Diffusion-limited current density measured during pit growth and calculated pit depth were used to determine the product of diffusion coefficient (D) and saturation concentration (C sat) of metal ion. D∙C sat value decreased as bulk NaCl concentration increased. A pit dissolution model incorporating the effect of bulk NaCl concentration and temperature on D and C sat was developed for comparison of the results. The D∙C sat value predicted from the pit model resulted in a good fit with the D∙C sat value determined experimentally for different NaCl concentrations. To evaluate the effect of temperature on pit growth, D∙C sat values obtained in different temperatures were compared. The value of D∙C sat was found to increase at higher temperature because of higher C sat and larger D." .

Additionally, the influence of post-process annealing on the properties of studied coatings has been presented. The as-deposited coatings were amorphous, while annealing at 873 K caused a structural change to the mixture of TiO2 anatase-rutile phases. The prepared thin films exhibited good transparency with transmission level of ca. 50 % and low resistivity varying from 2 Ωcm to 5×10−2 Ωcm, depending on the time and temperature of annealing. What is worth to emphasize, the sign of Seebeck coefficient changed after the annealing process from the electron to hole type electrical conduction." .

The relative amounts of the matrix and carbide phases in the charge, type of the starting carbide, and the latter's iron content have no significant effect on the composition of the carbide phase in the resultant sintered composite. The discrete character of dissolution of iron in the carbide Nr7N3 and closeness of resultant carbides to the stoichiometric composition Nr4Fa3N3 or Cr5Fe2C3 lead to the conclusion that during the sintering of iron-chromium carbides the iron does not merely act as an alloying element, but rather takes part in the carbide formation reaction." .

Numerical results are presented for magnetoelectroelastic properties of piezoelectric–piezomagnetic composite materials. A comparison of the results to those obtained by other methods shows that the presented sensitivity analysis gives highly accurate and stable results, but the values of the results are dependent on the applied micromechanical model.

MethodsThe study was conducted on a sample of 125 rats. Transgastric pyloric exclusions with gastrojejunostomy were performed on the first 50 rats, which were divided into two groups each of 25: a resorbable (polyglactin) suture material was used in the first group and a nonresorbable (silk) material was used in the second group. External pyloric exclusion with a gastrojejunostomy were performed in a subsequent group consisting of 50 rats, again divided into two subgroups of 25 each with an absorbable (polyglactin) suture material used in one and a nonabsorbable (silk) material used in the other. For the last 25 rats external pyloric exclusion with a gastrojejunostomy were performed and a nonresorbable (polypropylene) material was used. ResultsThe ratio of pyloric reopening was higher in the transgastric group than the external exclusion group on the 14th day (P = 0.01). The external pyloric exclusion group with polypropylene suture material had the lowest ratio of pyloric reopening. ConclusionThe external pyloric exclusion technique with nonresorbable (preferably polypropylene) suture material was therefore found to provide a higher pyloric closure incidence on the 14th day, which is the necessary duration period for healing in duodenal injuries." .

An effective method to overcome the burning problem by increasing the sacrifice seed layer structure is proposed. It is shown that the thickness uniformity and the cross-sectional profiles of the microstructures can be controlled by changing the process conditions. The current crowding observed in patterned specimens is responsible for the saddle shape profile of individual microstructures, while the combination of the current crowding and the cathodic polarizability are believed to be responsible for the abnormal cap-like profile of individual microstructures.

A micro/nano-fluidic channel fabrication is demonstrated for the topic. As an application, in the fluidic channel fabrication we demonstrate two-step process; trench formation and automatic sealing in the micro-/nanometer range. This method channels from hundreds to tens of nanometers wide can be fabricated by using silicon as a channel substrate. The shape and dimensions of the channel cross-section are readily changed by varying the process parameters. This control of redeposition technique is advantageous because of the accuracy and simplicity of the process compare to other fluidic channel fabrication process." .

Mode I failure, coating delamination at the cup edge, correlated with residual compressive stresses in the drawn coating. Neither crosslinker concentration nor prepolymer molecular weight in the ranges studied significantly affected residual stresses. However, residual stresses were strongly affected by the amount of wax in the coating formulation to the extent that coatings with less than 1.5% wax exhibited mode I failure, whereas coatings with 1.5% or more did not fail. Some of the coatings that exhibited mode I failure also exhibited mode II failure. Loss of adhesion on the cup wall, mode II failure, correlated with adhesive strength of the coating to the metal substrate, which in the present study was most strongly affected by crosslinker concentration. Coatings with 15 and 20% crosslinker exhibited extended areas of mode II failure, whereas coatings with 10% crosslinker showed no mode II failure. Increasing the molecular weight of the prepolymer improved adhesion somewhat, but not enough to affect the failure mode in the coatings tested, and wax had no measurable effect on the adhesion." .

Both surfaces are assumed as elastic and parallel to one another. The flattened rough surface is treated as equivalent to a rough plane surface with uniformly distributed cylindrical asperities evenly truncated on the top. For understanding the elastohydrodynamic lubrication performance between these two plane surfaces, an inlet zone analysis is taken for the elastohydrodynamic lubrication formed between a truncated cylindrical asperity and the smooth plane surface. It is found from the obtained results that the asperity truncation reduces the elastohydrodynamic load-carrying capacity, and this effect is significant for low sliding speeds or/and heavy loads, while it is negligible for high sliding speeds and moderate loads. The asperity truncation increases the friction coefficient of the asperity contact especially at relatively light loads, while it only slightly increases the friction coefficient of the asperity contact at heavy loads. For heavy loads, the asperity truncation can have a significant effect on the reduction in the maximum surface temperature rise. It is recommended by the present study that the surface asperity be truncated in a certain degree in an elastohydrodynamic contact with high sliding speeds and relatively heavy loads because of giving the benefits of considerably reducing the maximum surface temperature rise while maintaining the elastohydrodynamic load-carrying capacity." .

The elastic modulus of the FGM is assumed to vary exponentially along the gradation direction.

The first four terms in the expansion of the stress field are derived to explicitly bring out the influence of nonhomogeneity on the structure of the stress field.

The hard carbon treated by pre-carbonization process resulted in increasing Raman I G/I D ratio, BET specific surface area, and micropore volume, which can serve as high reversible capacity anode material for Li-ion batteries. The 500-1 sample performed a first discharge capacity and reversible capacity of 540 and 390 mAh g−1, respectively, which was much higher than that of non-pretreatment (NP) (without pre-carbonization) sample (290 and 210 mAh g−1, respectively)." .

Gluconic acid (GA) can be produced by multi-enzyme conversion of sucrose using the enzymes invertase, glucose oxidase, and catalase. In this process, one of the byproducts is fructose, which has many commercial applications. This work concerns the batch mode production of GA in an airlift reactor fed with sucrose as substrate. Evaluation was made of the influence of temperature and pH, as well as the thermal stability of the enzymes. Operational conditions of 40 °C and pH 6.0 were selected, based on the enzymatic activity profiles and the thermal stabilities. Under these conditions, the experimental data could be accurately described by kinetic models. The maximum yield of GA was achieved within 3.8 h, with total conversion of sucrose and glucose and a volumetric productivity of around 7.0 g L−1 h−1." .

It has been shown that under the conditions of low-temperature (T = 200°C) coating deposition, a two-level grain structure forms with {200} texture and grains 0.1–0.3 µm in size fragmented into subgrains 15–20 nm in size. As the silicon content is increased, textureless coatings with the crystal phase grain size less than 15 nm and high amorphous component or coatings of amorphous-crystalline structure are produced. At coating deposition temperatures of 400–450°C, a nanocomposite structure with a grain size d = 10–15 nm and no texture is observed. For all test compositions and conditions of coating production, a Ti 1−x Si x N crystal phase with the lattice parameter a = (0.416–0.420) ± 0.001 nm has been detected.

Therefore, the thin film sensor systems can be applied into the main distribution of force within machine parts or used for universal interchangeable sensor systems, e.g. sensory washers. In this article the deposition of a self-contained thin film sensor system on a large technical component (spindle shaft) is shown. The spindle shaft with a length of 480 mm and an outer diameter of 90 mm is part of a belt driven machining spindle for planing machines in woodworking industries. In order to establish a measurement system, which allows monitoring the clamping force of the tool holder and the imbalance of the mounted tool, the thin film sensor system was directly applied to the front surface of the spindle shaft. For this application a novel self-contained thin film sensor system was developed, which consists of an alumina layer for electrical isolation, a chromium layer to establish internal sensor electrodes, a piezoresistive hydrogenated carbon layer (1 μm) and a second covering wear resistance and insulation layer (silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer). The piezoresistive sensor layer and the top layer are part of the diamond like carbon layer family (Robertson, Diam Relat Mater 12:79–84, 2003; Bewilogua et al.

In the criterion, a certain parameter ν′ occurs which depends on the structure of the material. Originally, the parameter was treated as a constant, which resulted in a linear form of the strength function F σ 1 = f(σ 3), where σ 3 = σ 2. Although the linear strength criterion is sometimes found to be applicable to various particular rock materials, it is not, in general, of a universal character. Analysis of the triaxial test results for 75 different sandstones revealed that parameter ν′ usually increases in an exponential or linear manner as confining pressure increases, and only in isolated cases does it seem to be independent of the confining pressure. For these three types of function ν′ = f(p) appropriate strength criteria F σ 1 = f(σ 3) are given in the present paper. These criteria were used to fit all of the collected empirical data sets.

The fundamental advantage of this method is the capability of multi-component part fabrication in one step avoiding first time consuming joining or assembling techniques; second the used material combinations can fulfill complex functionalities and enhanced mechanical properties. One of the most challenging factors in micro composite casting is a stable mechanical bonding between the used individual materials. But under consideration of the different physical properties like thermal expansion coefficient as well as of the wettability of the ceramic inserts and of the applied metal casting material it is possible to manufacture form and force fitting microsystems. Within the framework of this feasibility study complex metal-ceramic micro composites have been realized successfully using the lost-wax casting process. Casting experiments were performed at different muffle preheating temperatures with Al-bronze of the type CuAl10Ni5Fe4 as casting material.

Sufficient carbon to produce a 1.0 mm case on conven-tional carburizing steels can be introduced in 10 min at methane pressures in the range of 1.3 to 2.7 kPa (10 to 20 Torr). To reduce the carbon concentration at the surface to an acceptable level (007E1.0 wt pct) the plasma carburizing stage is followed by a short (007E30 min) diffusion step. To aid in optimizing the division of time between the carburizing and diffusion stages, and in separating the effects of plasma carburizing and high-temperature diffusion, a computer program was written to model the diffusion equation for appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Both model and experimental results show that a diffusion time/carburizing time ratio of at least 3: 1 is required. The diffusion model indicates that the exceptionally high carburizing rates observed arise from the rapid infusion of carbon into the surface from the plasma, during the carburizing stage and not from anomalously high diffusion rates. Exceptionally uniform cases on surfaces of irregular geometry are achieved, and significant amounts of natural gas are saved owing to both the reduced car-burizing time and the low pressures employed." .

Since a thinner liquid crystal display (LCD) panel can effectively reduce the thickness of an optoelectronic product, the thickness of a LCD panel is usually thinned out through polishing. However, polishing is likely to produce an uneven surface on the LCD panel which can lead to incomplete fracturing of the anisotropic conductive film (ACF), disabling electrical conductivity. This research focuses on the elimination of the influences of uneven LCD panels in the chip on glass (COG) process. In addition to the standard process parameters a thin film of Teflon was inserted between the bonding head and the driving IC to minimize the influences of an uneven LCD panel. Experiments show that a 0.1 mm thick Teflon film in association with a 290°C bonding head temperature, a 7 s bonding duration, and a 17 kg bonding pressure, can effectively overcome the influence of an uneven LCD panel with 20 μm surface roughness. The yield rate in the production line is thus improved from 95.5 to 99.5%." .

Additives of ytterium and erbium (0.02% each) in the grade-composition alloy do not exert a pronounced influence on its tendency to recrystallization.2.The texture of the β-phase in sheets 2 mm thick is nonuniform over the cross section after both rolling and annealing, and contains the (110) shear component in the layer at a distance of 1/4h from the surface, which is intensified as a function of alloying due to either dynamic recrystallization during rolling or static recrystallization during subsequent annealing. After rolling, the amount of (110)[001] texture ranges from 7 to 29% as a result of the nonuniform tendency of alloys with different additives to dynamic recrystallization. After static recrystallization during subsequent annealing, the volume fraction of this texture is equalized in all alloys investigated, and amounts to 20–36%." .

However, the raw material has a disordered structure and unsorted size, which restrict investigations of both the properties and applications of the nanotubes. In this paper, an alternative approach to the synthesis of mono-sized and parallel-aligned single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNs) is reported. The SWCNs are formed in 1 nm-sized channels of aluminophosphate zeolite crystallites by pyrolysis of tripropylamine molecules. As verified by tunnel electron microscopy and micro-Raman scattering, the SWNT is of zigzag structure. Electrical transport properties of the SWNT are measured in the temperature range of 0·3K∼300K. The temperature-dependent dc conductivity shows that the SWNT is an intrinsic semiconductor with a narrow band-gap of 52 meV. The well-aligned and mono-sized SWCNs allow us to make more controlled characterization as well as open a door to potential nano-technological application for the novel electronic nanotube system." .

Our numerical simulation involves air bearing pressure, air bearing shear stress, Laplace pressure, the dispersive component of surface free energy and disjoining pressure, a polynomial modeled polar component of surface free energy and disjoining pressure and shear stress caused by the surface free energy gradient. Using these models we perform the lubricant thickness evolution on the disk under a two-rail taper flat slider. The results illustrate the forming process of two depletion tracks of the thin lubricant film on the disk.

Recent efforts have therefore focused on the construction and modification of biomimetic surfaces targeted to support tissue-specific cell functions including adhesion, growth, differentiation, motility, and the expression of tissue-specific genes. Four decades of extensive research on the structure and biological influence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on cell behavior and cell fate have shown that three types of information from the ECM are relevant for the design of biomimetic surfaces: (1) physical properties (elasticity, stiffness, resilience of the cellular environment), (2) specific chemical signals from peptide epitopes contained in a wide variety of extracelluar matrix molecules, and (3) the nanoscale topography of microenvironmental adhesive sites. Initial physical and chemical approaches aimed at improving the adhesiveness of biomaterial surfaces by sandblasting, particle coating, or etching have been supplemented by attempts to increase the bioactivity of biomaterials by coating them with ECM macromolecules, such as fibronectin, elastin, laminin, and collagens, or their integrin-binding epitopes including RGD, YIGSR, and GFOGER. Recently, the development of new nanotechnologies such as photo- or electron-beam nanolithography, polymer demixing, nano-imprinting, compression molding, or the generation of TiO2 nanotubes of defined diameters (15–200 nm), has opened up the possibility of constructing biomimetic surfaces with a defined nanopattern, eliciting tissue-specific cellular responses by stimulating integrin clustering. This development has provided new input into the design of novel biomaterials. The new technologies allowing the construction of a geometrically defined microenvironment for cells at the nanoscale should facilitate the investigation of nanotopography-dependent mechanisms of integrin-mediated cell signaling." .

We have looked systematically for any kind of ‘anomaly’ or fine structure in the differential rotation latitudinal profile and any significant change occurring during the course of the solar cycle. Some latitudinal bands are found where the angular rotation rate, rather than decreases according to its overall tendency, increases or is constant with the latitude. The differential rotation profile is, therefore, finely structured. The whole fine-structure pattern is affected by a slow equatorward shift. It is suggested that these fine structure features are due to the Coriolis forces acting on the meridional motions associated with giant toroidal convective cells. Some of the properties of such cells are inferred. Moreover, while the spot zone shifts equatorward, it is found to expand poleward; this expansion occurs by the ‘addition’ of new belts of activity on the poleward side of the pre-existing active zone. The active zone is therefore found to consist, at the maximum activity epoch, of three different ‘belts’ of spot production, each of them being centered around a local maximum-activity latitude; each of these ‘centroids’ of activity is hypothesized to lie where a couple of meridional streams - associated with giant cells - converge. The activity belts are independent of each other as far as their activation, maximum, and end time, as well as their lifetime and level of activity are concerned. The angular rotation rate is correlated, in each belt, with the local level of activity." .

The composition of deposited film varied with deposition current density and in particular, a composition of Ni79Fe21 was achieved for a current density of 20 mA/cm2. The surface microstructure of the film deposited at the current density of 20 mA/cm2 was found to have excellent smoothness.

Data required for the model are obtained by image analysis of thin sections and concerns percentage areas of grains and matrix, length, breadth, perimeter, orientation and area of each grain in the viewing window. The results of rock strength, diamond and percussion drillability tests in eleven sandstones, marbles and igneous rocks are reported, and correlated with the developed texture coefficient. The texture coefficient returns highly statistically significant correlations with rock strength and drillability data. Sandstones have low texture coefficients and high drillability whereas igneous rocks have high texture coefficients and low drillability. With particular reference to percussive drillability it is suggested that extensional crack propagation in the sandstones in an energy efficient process since fracture paths propagate through the weak phyllosilicate matrix. Extensional crack propagation in the igneous rocks is an energy intensive process since a significant proportion of the available drilling energy is consumed in the formation of intra-granular fracture paths. Observational and correlated data are supportive of the suggestion that the texture coefficient is a measure of the resistance of the microstructure of a rock to crack propagation, whether it be inter-or intra-granular. The texture coefficient can be used as a predictive tool for the assessment of drillability and rock strength properties. The technique offers a useful approach in understanding fracture initiation and growth as controlled by the texture of intact rock samples." .

Materials and methodsFour flowable bulk-fill RBCs were investigated by assessing in 200 μm steps the variation in micro-mechanical properties (Vickers hardness (HV) and indentation modulus (E)) within simulated 6-mm-deep fillings (n = 5), considering 16 different curing modes/conditions. The exposure duration was 5, 20 and 40 s in the standard power mode; 3, 4 and 8 s in the high power mode; and 3 and 6 s in the plasma mode. Besides, the curing unit was placed at 0 and 7 mm distance away from the specimen’s surface. Measurements were performed after 24 h of storage in distilled water at 37 °C. The depth of cure (DOC) was calculated as the 80 % hardness drop-off. The curing unit’s irradiance at exposure distances up to 10 mm was monitored for all irradiation modes in 1 mm steps by means of a laboratory-grade spectrometer. ResultsResults were compared using one- and multiple way ANOVA and Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc test (α = 0.05). A multivariate analysis (general linear model) assessed the effect strength of the parameters material, energy density reaching the specimen’s surface (2.63 to 47.03 J/cm2), exposure distance and curing mode on HV, E and DOC. The effect of the parameter material was significant and strong on all measured properties (p < 0.05, partial eta-squared (η P 2) = 0.683 for E, 0.724 for HV and 0.199 for DOC). Energy density exerted in all materials the strongest influence on the measured properties, while the influence of distance was strong on DOC and low or even not significant on HV and E. ConclusionsThe susceptibility to variation in irradiance under the simulated clinical conditions was material dependent, while lower and upper energy density limits for curing the materials were defined. Clinical relevanceMaterials react differently to the supplied irradiance. An exposure time of 20 s at moderate irradiance is recommended for all materials. The highest mechanical properties were reached not at the specimens’ surface, but in deeper layers (0.4 to 3.1 mm)." .

The average value of Curie point temperature is (768.2 ± 3.5)°C for the lunar igneous rocks and (762.5 ± 3.4)°C for the lunar fines and breccias. A tentative conclusion about the ferromagnetic substance in the lunar materials would be that Fe is absolutely dominant with a slight association of Ni and Co, and probably Si also, in the lunar native irons. The antiferromagnetic phase of ilmenite and the paramagnetic phase of pyroxenes are considerably abundant in all lunar materials. However, a discrepancy of observed magnetization from a simulated value based on known magnetic elements for the temperature range between 10 and 40 K suggests that pyroxene phase represented by (M x Fe1-x ) SiO3 (whereM = Ca2+, Mg2+, etc and 0 ≤x ≤1/4) also may behave antiferromagnetically. Magnetic hysteresis curves are obtained at 5 K and 300 K, and the viscous magnetic properties also are examined for a number of lunar materials. The superparamagnetically viscous magnetization has been experimentally proven as due to fine grains of metallic iron less than 200 Å in mean diameter. The viscous magnetization is dominant in the lunar fines and breccias which is classified into Type II, while it is much smaller than the stable magnetic component in lunar igneous rocks (Type I). The superparamagnetically fine particles of metallic iron are mostly blocked at 5 K in temperature; thus coercive force (H c ) and saturation remanent magnetization (I R ) become much large at 5 K as compared with the corresponding values at 300 K. Strongly impact-metamorphosed parts of lunar breccias have an extremely stable NRM which could be attributed to TRM. NRM of the lunar igneous rocks and majority of breccias (or clastic rocks) are intermediately stable, but their stability is considerably higher than that of IRM of the same intensity. This result may imply that some mechanism which causes an appreciable magnitude of NRM and the higher stability, such as the shock effect, may take place on the lunar surface in addition to TRM mechanism for special cases. A particular igneous rock (Sample 14053) is found to have an unusually strong magnetism owing to a high content of metallic iron (about 1 weight percent), and its NRM amounts to 2 × 10−3 emu/g. The abundance of such highly magnetic rocks is not known as yet but it seems that the observed magnetic anomalies on the lunar surface could be related to such highly magnetized rock masses." .

The barrier efficiency of WTi thin films against indium (In) diffusion was experimentally studied by x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements during in situ annealing. Specific multilayered samples were designed to estimate the diffusion barrier properties using the Ni/In system. These diffusion samples were made up of a 100-nm-thick WTi layer prepared by magnetron sputtering from an alloyed target (W:Ti ≈ 70:30 at.%), sandwiched between Ni and Au/In layers. WTi film microstructures were observed to depend on the working pressure. Diffusion barrier breakdown was monitored upon annealing by the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMC) (intermixing between Ni and In). Annealing was performed at temperatures of 573 K, 623 K, and 673 K (homologous temperatures $$T/T_{\\rm m}^{\\rm In} \\simeq 1.34, 1.45$$ T/TmIn≃1.34,1.45 , and 1.57, respectively) and under primary vacuum. The diffusion coefficients of In in WTi were determined. The correlation between WTi film microstructure and diffusion barrier efficiency was established. Better diffusion barrier performance was obtained for WTi films with dense microstructure associated with a compressive residual stress state. Hence, tuning the sputtering conditions allows significant improvement of barrier performance against diffusion through a change of the film microstructure." .

The brittle to ductile transition in dry ganister occurs at about 600 MPa at room temperature. At lower pressures shear oriented grain boundary cracks form both pre and post peak strength, loosening the microstructure to the point at which axial transgranular cracks develop. Fault zone localization then occurs. At high pressures fault localization is suppressed by friction, and cataclastic flow occurs by the formation of ultracataclasite shear zones around each grain boundary, Rhomb shaped, relatively intact grain cores survive to high (greater than 20%) strains. Hardening mechanisms responsible for the ductility are discussed. It is shown that natural zones of intense cataclasis (fault zones) often develop microstructures comparable with those seen in these experiments, but the less intense cataclastic flow often associated with folding of rocks at high crustal levels in the external zones of orogenic belts is not comparable inasmuch as grain-scale catalaclasis does not normally occur. It is emphasised that finite strain microstructural similarity does not necessarily point to comparable deformation paths and stress history." .

Bending of the membrane is induced by pressure in pores arising due to diffusion of ions through a network of nanochannels. Transport of ions is governed by the applied electric field and redox reactions at the surfaces of electrodes. Constitutive equations for the mechanical response of a porous medium and diffusion of ions are derived by means of the free energy imbalance inequality under an arbitrary deformation with finite strains. Under the assumption regarding small strains, but finite changes in concentrations of ions and the electrostatic potential, an explicit expression is developed for the curvature of the membrane. A steady-state solution to the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations is obtained by means of the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Results of numerical analysis demonstrate the ability of the constitutive equations to describe observations. In particular, the model provides an explanation for bending to the anode and to the cathode and predicts qualitatively the effects of applied voltage, concentration of ionic liquid, and thickness of a membrane on its curvature." .

The microstructure of the mixed conducting composite is described by means of a square grain model, including grain boundaries of the matrix and interphase boundaries between the inclusions and grains of the host phase. An instantaneous change of the oxygen partial pressure in the surrounding atmosphere may give rise to an oxygen exchange process, i.e., oxidation or reduction of the ceramic composite. Relaxation curves for the total amount of exchanged oxygen are calculated, emphasizing the role played by fast diffusion along the interfaces. The relaxation curves are interpreted in terms of effective medium diffusion, introducing appropriate equations for the effective diffusion coefficient and the effective surface exchange coefficient. When extremely fast diffusion along the grain and interphase boundaries is assumed, the re-equilibration process shows two different time constants. Analytical approximations for the relaxation process and relations for the separate relaxation times are provided for this limiting case as well as for blocking interphase boundaries. Furthermore, conductivity relaxation curves are calculated by coupling diffusion and dc conduction. In the case of effective medium diffusion, the conductivity relaxation curves do not deviate from those for the total amount of exchanged oxygen. On the contrary, the conductivity relaxation curves differ remarkably from the time dependence of the total amount of exchanged oxygen, when the different phases of the composite re-equilibrate with separate time constants." .

In particular, the graphene dispersions, produced at high concentration (up to 6 mg/ml) by simple sonication of graphite in TEGDA monomer, have been used for the direct preparation of nanocomposite copolymers with Bis-GMA. The morphology of the obtained nanocomposites has been investigated as well as their thermal and mechanical properties. SEM analyses have clearly shown that graphene deeply interacts with the polymer matrix, thus resulting in a reinforcing effect on the material as proved by compression and hardness tests; at variance, graphene does not seem to affect the glass transition temperature of the obtained polymer networks." .

RDX and TNT were studied for comparison. ANTA and NTO are low-sensitive high explosives with detonation properties comparable to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). We showed previously that nitrated NTO and ANTA compounds, when used in a glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) matrix in rocket propellants, could give impulses above 2600 m/s and that the oxygen balance is positive. If used in aluminized explosives, the heat of detonation may be increased to a practical level significantly above RDX/aluminum compositions. Here, we use two different methods for sensitivity and two density functional theory functionals, B3LYP and M06-2X with the 6-31G(d) basis set, together with the complete basis set method CBS-4M. Calculations indicate that most of the nitrated derivatives have nearly equal sensitivity to RDX. Significantly different bond dissociation energies in the nitrimino functional group are predicted, although most models give much the same result." .

In this case strain hardening accelerates precipitation hardening processes.3.For the strain hardened steel the elastic limit decreases at a higher rate and the distortion of the elastic aftereffect increases at a higher rate with increasing testing temperatures. The larger the strain hardening, the more notable this effect.4.Plastic deformation does not change the shear modulus of quenched samples; it increases 6% with tempering. The temperature coefficient of the modulus of elasticity remains constant up to 700°.5.From the results of the investigation we recommend the following maximum operating temperatures for elastic elements made of steel Kh15N27T3MR; 600° for the quenched and tempered steel; 500° for the steel deformed 17 and 30% after quenching; 400° for the steel deformed 60%." .

The present paper deals with the investigation of the effect of process parameters on the strain paths and ductile fracture initiation of powder metallurgical (P/M) aluminum-copper preforms using FEM during metal forming. MethodsThe various Al-Cu preforms were prepared using P/M route. Ductile fracture criterion based on local compressive and tensile strains in combination with FEM was employed to determine the fracture limit. ResultsThe fracture loci were determined by using experimental method for P/M Al, Al-2wt%Cu, Al-4wt%Cu and Al-6wt%Cu preforms. The results were analyzed for the influence of material composition, initial relative density, aspect ratio and friction on the ductile fracture initiation. The FEM simulations provided detail information on the local compressive and tensile strain paths. ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that increase of copper content has decreased the plain ductility limit of the material and, hence the fracture limit decreases. In addition, the fracture limit increases with increase in the initial relative density and aspect ratio or decrease in the tool-work piece interface friction irrespective of the material composition." .

The 400-μm microspherule has a complex chemical composition and contains the following elements (in order of decreasing content): O, Ti, Si, Mn, Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, and K. The material of the micro-spherule shows a polyphase structure and chemical heterogeneity with separation into amorphous oxide-silicate (SiO2) and crystalline metallic (α-Ti + FeTi) constituents. The spherical shape and the character of internal heterogeneity suggest that the microspherule was formed owing to the rapid solidification of a melt droplet. The nanoscale heterogeneity of the microspherule is a consequence of a two-stage process. (1) Liquid immiscibility in the initial melt droplet before its solidification resulted in the incomplete spatial separation of Si + Al and Ti + Fe + Mn and appearance of SiO2 globules with admixtures of Al, Ca, K, Mg, Ti, Fe, and Mn approximately 100 nm in size. (2) Chemical heterogeneity developed subsequently both within the globules and within the matrix at the stage of melt solidification or after the solidification. The second-stage chemical heterogeneity was manifested in (a) the separation of heavy minor element oxides (Ti, Fe, and Mn) from the light elements Si, Al, K, Ca, and Mg(?) within the globules and (b) the separation of the matrix material into crystalline metallic (α-Ti + FeTi) and amorphous oxide-silicate [SiO2-MgO-Mn3O4(?)-Fe2O3(?)-TiO2(?)] parts. The obtained results do not rule out the possibility of formation of such microspherules during drilling operations." .

The source of the atomic hydrogen was a generator based on an arc reflected Penning discharge with a self-heating element. It has been shown that there is an optimal treatment regime (temperature (Ttr) 200–250°C; duration (ttr) 5 min) for which n and Vr reach a corresponding minimum and maximum. It is proposed that with lower Ttr and ttr there is nonuniform etching of the surface oxides and with higher it is possible to have nonuniform etching of the GaAs itself. The barrier height depends on the treatment regime in a more complicated way but on the whole decreases. The effect of passive impurities (decrease in the charge carrier concentration) is already pronounced at Ttr=100°C and changes relatively little with further growth of the temperature. Annealing (reactivation of impuritics) is observed for T≥250°C with sufficiently slow cooling of the sample after treatment." .

Adrenergic fibres (B-fibres) and their terminals have been detected in the neurohypophysis of these fishes. The terminal swellings of B-fibres as well as the terminals of the neurosecretory peptidergic fibres (A1 and A2) make contact with the basement membrane of the connective tissue layer separating the neurohypophysis from the intermediate lobe. Capillaries are situated within this layer and, therefore, the main part of the fibre terminals is in contact with the pericapillary space. The release of catecholamines from the adrenergic terminals into the capillaries connected with the general circulation is supposed. The diffusion of catecholamines through the connective tissue layer into the parenchyma of the intermediate lobe is also suggested. Hence, the glandular activity of the intermediate lobe seems to be under the dual control of adrenergic and peptidergic elements of the hypothalamus." .

The present review aims at reporting the systematic procedures put forward developing a novel concept of diopside-based bilayer GC seal, which contains a rigid GC and a self-healing (SH) GC. The concept behind the bilayer GCs is (i) a small gradient in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) will lead to lower thermal expansion mismatch between the sealing layers and other SOFC components, thus providing enhanced mechanical reliability for the stack; and (ii) cracks produced due to minor thermal stresses in the rigid GC layer can be healed by the SH GC layer due to sufficient amorphous content. In general, at high temperature, highly crystallized glass behaves as a rigid glass. On the other hand, due to low viscosity behavior, partially crystallized glass provides a SH behavior. Various glasses in the field of diopside crystalline materials have been systematically designed by varying the chemical composition of glass to achieve desired combination of functional properties for the rigid and SH GC layers. The glass Sr-0.3 where Sr replaced 30 % of Ca was revealed as a highly reliable rigid GC seal for high-temperature electrochemical applications. On the other hand, SH features have been achieved in 30 % Sr-containing diopside-based glass with Gd2O3 for MgO + SiO2 substitution (denoted as Gd-0.3). These GCs exhibit similar thermal properties and excellent thermal stability along a period of 1000 h, while differing in their amorphous fractions, and revealed excellent thermal stability along a period of 1000 h. The bilayered GC synthesized from Sr-0.3 and Gd-0.3 showed good wetting and bonding ability to the SOFC metallic Crofer22APU components. The results revealed superior performance for the newly proposed bilayer GCs in comparison to single-layer sealants." .

Crack surfaces are geometric entities whose shapes can be arbitrary, often described with ruled surfaces or polygonal subdivisions. The derivatives of distance functions for such surfaces are discontinuous across the surface, and continuous all around the edges. These properties of the distance function were employed to build intrinsic enrichments of the underlying mesh-free discretisation for efficient simulation of three-dimensional crack propagation, removing the limitations of existing criteria (reviewed in this paper). Examples show that the proposed approach is able to introduce quite convoluted crack paths. The incremental nature of the developed approach does not require re-computation of the enrichment for the entire crack surface as advancing crack front extends incrementally as a set of connected surface facets. The concept is based on purely geometric representation of discontinuities thus addressing only the kinematic aspects of the problem, such to allow for any constitutive and cohesive interface models to be used." .

The wall of the tub vile is formed by “four-winged” osmiophilic filaments which are located in the corners of the quadratic lattice; their interior is made up of a hydrophilic substance which contains either a tubule or a filament of moderate electron density. The osmiophilic substance of the walls is continuous with associated myelin figures which can be resolved into lamellae with a periodicity of 42 Å and can thus be considered to be water crystals of phospholipids. The nature of the content of the tubules, which presumably exerts the formative force on the phospholipid lamellae to form tubules, remains undetermined." .

Design of the device architecture was investigated using modeling and simulation methods to identify the optimal structure and to predict performance of the tandem cells. To address the challenge of current matching between the constituent subcells, the effect of active layer thickness, different device structure, and use of ultrathin Ag film were analyzed. It was found that the distribution of optical intensity in the tandem structure can be optimized through the optical spacer effect of interfacial layers and micro-cavity effect derived from the embedded ultrathin Ag film. Our results indicate that the efficient light utilization with appropriate subcells can allow achievement of power conversion efficiency of 12%, which can be 25% higher than that of a single cell of PTB7-Th." .

It decreases under phase-transformation-induced inelasticity and increases under plasticity. At the time the basic deformation mechanism changes, fluctuations are maximal.

The presented piezoelectric micro power harvester generates electrical energy resulting from wind flow around the harvester, while conventional ones produce electrical energy in response to parasitic vibration. The micro power harvester is composed of four silicon cantilevers coated with a piezoelectric film, each of which has a length of 2,000 μm, a width of 200 μm, and a thickness of 3.5 μm; the cantilevers are slightly bent (about 83.2 μm in a upward direction) using residual stress of the piezoelectric film to effectively convert flow-induced vibration into electrical energy. When the bent micro-cantilevers are exposed to wind, the structures undergo flow-induced vibration which results in electrical power based on piezoelectricity. Our micro power harvester generates enough electrical power, proportional to flow velocity, for structural health monitoring systems, for example an average maximum power density of 441.8 μW/cm2 at a flow velocity of 12.4 m/s with a single cantilever." .

The deformation and stresses of a thick-walled cylinder with multi-angle winding filament under uniform internal pressure are proposed. The stresses of each orthotropic unit of fiber layers, as well as longitudinal stress along the fiber direction, transverse stresses perpendicular to the fiber direction and shear stress in the fiber layer are derived analytically. An optimization model of FW closed ends vessel under uniform internal pressure subjected to Tsai–Wu failure criterion to maximize the lowest strength ratio through thickness with optimal variation of winding angle is built. Two optimization methods are adopted to find the optimized winding angle sequence through different ways, and their combination led to more efficient algorithm is suggested. The research shows that the material utilization and working pressure can be increased by proper winding angle variation, and several optimization winding angle sequence schemes are found for different thickness ratios cylindrical vessels with two typical composite materials E-glass/epoxy and T300/934, which are useful for many applications of FW vessel design and manufacture." .

Al and its alloys were severely deformed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) processes and the corrosion behaviors of the Al alloys were evaluated by means of potentiodynamic polarization in a neutral buffer solution containing 0.002 M chloride ion. Introduction of huge plastic deformation to both of Al-5.4 wt% Ni and Al-5 wt% Cu alloys increased pitting potential. In contrast, ECAP treatment of 4N pure Al resulted in a decrease in open circuit potential, slight increase of passive current and shift of pitting potential to the negative direction.

Depending on the specific component design, this volume expansion may cause changes in the mechanical stress, or even displacement of device structures. In most applications, these effects limit performance and reliability, and should therefore be minimized. The present paper describes an approach for the investigation of swelling phenomena in thin polymer layers. Polyimide PI2540 was chosen as a model polymer. After extensive characterization of the polymer layer properties, static and dynamic sorption behavior was investigated by different means. Based on our experimental results, we have developed linearized models to accurately describe the swelling behavior. Several polymers were characterized. Although the micro-physical mechanisms responsible for the humidity-induced swelling are still poorly understood, we are – based on our data – able to effectively reduce humidity induced stress by selecting suitable polymers and optimizing processing procedures." .

These SIRs and shocks produced a substantial heliospheric processing of the solar wind. Only a subset of the SIRs recurred on successive solar rotations and only about half of the well-defined SIRs observed poleward of S9.8° were bounded by forward-reverse shock pairs. The majority of the SIRs had local magnetic topologies and azimuthal orientations similar to, but meridional tilts different from, those observed in the first polar orbit when most SIRs corotated with the Sun. The irregular meridional tilts presumably were a consequence of a complex coronal geometry and the temporally evolving nature of the solar wind flow at this time. A lack of reverse shocks poleward of S54° (with one exception) and a lack of well defined SIRs poleward of S65° is evidence that SIRs develop more slowly with distance at high latitudes." .

By injection moulding, polymer micro components can be produced in large numbers at low costs. Micro assembly injection moulding as a combination of multi-component injection moulding and micro injection moulding enables to avoid offline process steps, as joining is already accomplished in the mould by overmoulding. In case of joint hybrid micro structures, the bonding strength between two components affects the stability of the micro system and is thus important for the part quality. Investigations carried out at the Institute of Plastics Processing (IKV), Aachen, Germany, deal with methods to increase the bonding strength of a plastic and a non-plastic part joint. As shown in the following, a plasma treatment of the inserts is an appropriate approach for this aim." .

Potential commercial applications of PBM, which is a fast direct write technique, will become feasible if the fabrication of metallic molds or stamps is realised. Metallic components can be produced by electroplating a master from a microstructure produced in resist. The production of high-aspect-ratio metallic stamps and molds requires a lithographic technique capable of producing smooth and near 90° sidewalls and a one to one conversion of a resist structure to a metallic microstructure. PBM is the only technique capable of producing high-aspect-ratio microstructures with sub-micron details via a direct write process. In PBM, SU-8 (Lorenz et al., 1997) resist structures are produced by exposing the SU-8 resist with a focused MeV proton beam followed by chemical development and a subsequent electroplating step using Ni or Cu. The data presented shows that PBM can successfully produce high-aspect-ratio, sub-micron sized smooth metallic structures with near 90° sidewall profiles." .

A series of uniaxial tensile cyclic tests with and without rest period has been conducted on a 19 mm nominal maximum size of aggregate (NMSA) AC at 20°C. During the fatigue tests, key AE parameters including emission counts were acquired from two piezo-type sensors attached to the middle of a 150 mm high, 75 mm diameter cylindrical specimen. Test results indicate that accumulative AE energy and AE count may be used not only to assess the initiation and propagation of fatigue damage, but also to quantify the beneficial effect of rest period on the performance of AC. The frequency-amplitude analysis shows that crack formations coincide with the peaks of maximum AE amplitude (Amax) with higher frequencies, while healing is best described by Amax with lower frequencies during the rest periods. In addition, it is demonstrated that the Kaiser effect, the stress dependence of AE generation, does not hold for fatigue in AC." .

When applied directly to cellulose fiber surfaces, TiO2 coatings form weak bonds with fibers. Therefore 3-glycidooxypropyl-trimethoxysilane was used as a coupling agent. It had been applied on the surface of cellulose fibers before the TiO2 coating was performed. In this case, the silane is in the interface region, where it can be most effective as an adhesion promoter. Silane coupling agents have unique chemical and physical properties not only to enhance bond strength, but more importantly to prevent de-bonding at the interface during composite aging and use as well. The coupling agent provides a stable bond between two otherwise poorly bonding surfaces. Surface properties of these coatings have been examined, such as surface morphology and surface microstructure. TiO2 nanoparticles were irreversibly attached to the surface of monodisperse silica (SiO2) spheres and to the surface of Lyocell fibers coated with an epoxy-containing silane coupling agent. Analysis using scanning electron microscopy showed uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the resulting coatings. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed changes in the surface microstructure occurring after different modifications. In addition, the influence of photocatalytic activity on the mechanical properties of Lyocell fibers was determined. In addition to that, the results indicated that SiO2 and the coupling agent provide a protection against high oxidizing power of TiO2 under exposure to daylight irradiation." .

ResultsParietex Composite, Sepramesh, and Tutomesh resulted in decreased surface coverage with adhesions, whereas Prolene, Dualmesh, Ultrapro, Timesh, and Proceed resulted in increased adhesion coverage. Parietex Composite, Prolene, Ultrapro, and Sepramesh resulted in the most mesh incorporation. Dualmesh and Tutomesh resulted in significantly increased shrinkage. There were no differences in mesh infection. Parietex Composite and Dualmesh resulted in a moderate inflammatory reaction, as compared with the mild reaction the other meshes exhibited. ConclusionParietex Composite and Sepramesh combine minimal adhesion formation with maximum mesh incorporation and tensile strength. The authors recommend the use of these meshes for hernia repair in which direct contact with the abdominal viscera cannot be avoided." .

The nanolens array was replicated on three different polymer surfaces of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) by means of replica molding and hot embossing with a nanodimpled aluminum mold that was manufactured by a chemical oxidation process. From the theoretical and experimental evaluations of the wettability it was found that the measured contact angles were very similar with the theoretically estimated ones and also the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the hydrophilic PMMA and hydrophobic PDMS, respectively, surfaces were reinforced by the nanolens array within the Wenzel wetting state." .

The main purpose is to investigate the consequences of current confinement rather than to produce a model. The physical and observational basis for this assumption are presented as well as the connection with previous studies on loop structure. A proper choice of the current profile allows us to treat quantitatively the equilibrium structure of the loops and their MHD and resistive stability properties. Regions of absolute stability against ideal kink modes are found. Explicit growth rates for the tearing-mode instability are computed. The possible relevance of other resistive effects is also discussed and the crucial importance of the small-scale geometry of the magnetic field outlined." .

Two types of dimples with different surface roughness and several types of gimbal materials were investigated. The load–displacement curves for the contact of the dimple and the gimbal exhibit hysteresis, which is related to the plastic deformation of the asperities, during the first few load/unload cycles. The roughness of dimple and gimbal samples was measured before and after load–unload testing using an AFM. The plasticity index was determined based on the roughness measurement. The results show that the roughness and plasticity index of the non-polished dimple decrease with the number of load/unload cycles significantly, i.e., the contact surface becomes smoother than the original surface due to plastic deformation. The roughness and plasticity index of the laser-polished dimple change slightly before and after the load–unload test." .

Maximum germinative power is attained in the afternoon or evening; thereafter it declines. Under conditions favourable to the fungus, infection mainly occurs in the afternoon, so that, if potentially infective conidial material is present, preventive spray or dust applications should be made before noon Whether conidia attached to sporophores will mature depends on atmospheric humidity; whether the loose conidia will retain their germinative power depends on solar (u.v.) radiation. Whether viable mature conidia become infectious depends on the persistence of a water film on the foliage after noon. Crop infection can be predicted with the help of sunshine and rainfall forecasts." .

The effect of reaction time on the microstructure and properties of the CNCs was investigated in detail, while microstructure and properties of different CNCs were compared. The rod-like CNCs (MCC) with hundreds of nanometers in length and about 10 nm in width, nanofibrillated CNCs (ginger fiber bamboo fiber) with average width of 30 nm and the length of 1 μm, and spherical CNCs (viscose fiber) with the width of 56 nm were obtained by one-step HCOOH/HCl hydrolysis. The CNCs with improved thermal stability showed the maximum degradation temperature (T max) of 368.9–388.2 °C due to the introduction of formate groups (reducibility) and the increased crystallinity. Such CNCs may be used as an effective template for the synthesis of nanohybrids or reinforcing material for high-performance nanocomposites." .

Objective quantification is performed for assessing the (i) film thicknesses, (ii) fibril diameters and (iii) fibril orientations, based on computer-assisted electron microscopy. The most frequent fibril diameter is 20–30 nm in diameter. A method for acquiring FE-SEM images of NFC surfaces without a conductive metallic layer is introduced.

It is shown that the influence of the interface oxidation is strong enough to dominate the effect of the electric field on the magnetic anisotropy of MgO/Fe-based films. The magnetoelectric coefficients are calculated to be positive for the ideal and overoxidized MgO/Fe interface, but an abnormal negative value emerges in the underoxidized case. By analyzing the interface states based on density of states and band structures, we demonstrate that the considerably different electronic structures of the three oxidized MgO/Fe interfaces lead to the strong discrepancy in the electric-field modulation of the interfacial magnetic anisotropy. These results are of considerable interest in the area of electric-field-controlled magnetic anisotropy and switching." .

In this work, thiourea (H2NCSNH2) was used as a corrosion inhibitor and microcapsuled using glutin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), respectively, as protective agent. The re-sealing process was used as a way to prolong the releasing time of the H2NCSNH2 encapsulated in microcapsules. It was found that the H2NCSNH2 microcapsule corrosion inhibitor using PVA as a protective agent had a better releasing time. The releasing times of the H2NCSNH2 microcapsule corrosion inhibitors were prolonged from 18 to 48 h by re-sealing process and using PVA as a protective agent. Both the use of PVA as a protective agent and the application of the re-sealing process decreased the encapsulation efficiency of the H2NCSNH2.

SnO2 NRA supported on the substrate of carbon fibers was prepared by the seed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis method. PANI/SnO2 NRA was then obtained by depositing PANI nanowires onto SnO2 NRA through an electro-polymerization process. SnO2 NRA presents quadrangular prism shape with a side length of 50~60 nm. PANI nanolayer is loaded into the interspace of the neighboring SnO2 nanorods to form the core-shell-structured PANI/SnO2 NRA. Additional PANI nanowires with a diameter of 100~150 nm are formed on the top surface of PANI/SnO2 NRA. Well-designed PANI/SnO2 NRA benefited a directional electron transfer along with highly ordered SnO2 nanorods during an electrochemical reaction process. The interface layer between SnO2 nanorods and PANI could act as the buffer space to restrain the volumetric change of PANI during the cycling charge-discharge process. Considering electroactive PANI, PANI/SnO2 NRA exhibited higher specific capacitance of 367.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 than that of 232.4 F g−1 for bare PANI film.

Based on a phenomenological approach, these materials are treated as a continuum, and a strain energy density is considered to describe their hyperelastic behavior. In this paper, the mechanical behavior characterization of these materials is studied from the continuum viewpoint. For this purpose, the strain energy density is expressed as sum of independent functions of the mutual multiple of principal stretches. These functions are determined by applying the governing postulates on the form of the strain energy density. It is observed that a consistent strain energy density is expressible in terms of the mathematical functions of polynomial, power law, logarithmic and particularly exponential. The proposed strain energy density functions cover modeling both of compressible and incompressible materials. Moreover, the material parameters of these models are calculated based on the correlation between the values of the strain energy density (rather than the stresses) cast from the test data and the theory. In order to investigate the appropriateness of the proposed models, several experimental data for incompressible and compressible isotropic materials under homogeneous deformations are examined in which the predictions of the proposed models show a good agreement with experimental data." .

It is widely accepted in the industry due to its advantages in high speed and suitability for automation. The RSW process is extremely important to quality in automotive industry because approximately 6000 spot welds were used in automotive body. In addition, the RSW process is a complicated process that includes electrical, thermal and mechanical phenomena. For this reason, it is necessary that researchers should perform electric field, heat transfer and thermo-elastic-plastic analysis, and consider phase change, contact conditions and temperature dependence of material properties in order to simulate a realistic RSW process. There were lots of previous studies for RSW simulation by using Finite element method (FEM), but most of studies have performed qualitative analysis which predicts the shape of weld nugget fatigue life and residual stress. Therefore, this study defines the contents which mentioned above based on the theoretical background and reproduces a 3D DC RSW process through using ABAQUS, commercial FEM program. It also obtains the reliability in terms of simulation results through quantitative approach by comparing between the nugget shape and the actual experimental results. The error percentage of nugget width between simulation and experiment shows outstanding results that from 0.44 % to 3.80 %. Based on the simulation results through these theoretical backgrounds, it is possible to effectively trace the weld nugget shape of all steels, provided the temperature dependent material properties are available. An illustration of such a simulation to predict the nugget shape and size of resistance spot welded SPRC 340 steel is presented in the paper." .

For this reason, alternative joining techniques for high-strength steels are of great interest. Some studies have shown that hybrid joints, which combine mechanical fasteners and adhesives, have improved fatigue resistance as compared to welded joints in high-strength steel structures. For reliable design, an in-depth understanding of the clamped and bonded interface under cyclic loading is needed. In this study, the napkin ring specimen geometry has been chosen for a series of constant-amplitude fatigue tests. The test setup provides a bonded interface with well-defined normal and shear stress boundary conditions. Test conditions included four different static normal pre-stresses for the grit-blasted surface finish and one pre-stress level for the fine ground. Fatigue strengths of all the pre-stress/surface type conditions were obtained by a statistical method. For grit-blasted surfaces, the bonded specimens with high static normal pre-stresses behaved identically to the non-bonded specimens with the same pre-stress, i.e. the fatigue strength was not improved by the addition of adhesive even though the static strength had previously been shown to improve significantly for the same conditions." .

Thermal analysis is used to obtain temperature profile by figuring out a heat conductions and convections model. Temperature profile is then applied into the mechanical structure of the gripper’s actuators to form the final equation of displacement and contact force of the jaws. Finally, the comparison among the calculation, simulation and actual measurement concludes that materialization methods are appropriate. Achieving the final equation of gripper’s jaws displacement and contact force is a major step to optimize or reform this novel structure for different sizes to meet specific applications." .

In the experiments, the prefire characteristics including the temperature and radiation characteristics of the wire insulations were presented. The temperature histories of the wire insulation in microgravity and the low-pressure environment in normal gravity were obtained. Effects of overloaded currents on the fire initiation were investigated for different wire coiled states. The results indicate that the natural convection almost vanished and the heat loss of the electric components decreased in the microgravity environment. It might cause overheating of the electric components and then results in fire, and thus the fire risks of wire in the microgravity condition are much more dangerous than that in normal gravity under the condition of overload." .

To date, CAD/CAM is the only way of producing implant components from high-strength ceramics such as densely sintered alumina and partially stabilized zirconia.The accuracy can be measured by vertical fit of CAD/CAM frameworks ranged from 1 to 27μm which was significantly better than cast implant frameworks. In addition, a similar level of fit was observed for implant CAD/CAM frameworks produced from zirconia and titanium.CAD/CAM produces zirconia workpieces that require no subsequent alteration, unnecessary weakening is avoided. This ensures durability of the prosthesis. Maximal abutment and framework thickness is desirable and increases the fracture resistance. The risk of veneering ceramic fracture is expected to be minimized in the future by the continuously improving veneering strategies.In comparison to the lost wax/casting protocol, CAD/CAM is much simpler and requires less technical time and involvement. The whole CAD/CAM process is fully automated following the scanning step. Conclusion:CAD/CAM plays a key role in fabrication of implant prosthesis framework because of bypassing most of the laboratory works and manual handling. By using CAD/CAM frameworks, fixed partial or full-arch dental prostheses can be fabricated. Clinical significance:Application of CAD/CAM is cost effective as well as less chair-side adjustments required especially with prosthesis requiring frameworks." .

The discovered phenomenon is anisotropy of thermal-oxidative degradation of the adhesive in the adhesive joints of metal-sealant-glass ceramics (glass), which appears at high-temperature modes of thermal aging and has a critical effect on the processes responsible for the decrease in the adhesive joint strength and formation of the relief of the surface degradation of adhesive joints. Possible reasons for abnormal thermal degradation and ways of its elimination have been considered." .

Porcelain laminate veneer specimens were embedded in the centers of acrylic resin blocks. Thirty-nine teeth were used for shear bond strength testing and the remaining three (one tooth for each group) were used for evaluation of the debonded bracket interface. Specimens were randomly divided into three groups, each containing 13 specimens. The details of the groups are as follows: Group SB, sandblasting with alumina particles (50 μm); Group HFA, 9.6 % hydrofluoric acid etching; Group ER, erbium-doped yttrium–aluminum–garnet (Er: YAG) irradiation (from 1 mm distance, 2 W, 10 Hz for 10 s). After conditioning, the upper central brackets were bonded to the porcelain surfaces. Porcelain laminate veneers were examined under stereomicroscope for adhesive remnant index and surface damage after debonding. The highest shear bond strength values were obtained with Group HFA (10.8 ± 3.8 MPa) and Group ER (9.3 ± 1.5 MPa), whereas Group SB revealed the lowest values. Scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis revealed that the silicon level in the porcelain decreased after debonding in all groups. The sandblasting method did not demonstrate any ideal bond strength values; however, the 9.6 % hydrofluoric acid etching and Er: YAG laser did. There were no significant differences among all groups in terms of laminate surface damages. The Er: YAG laser therefore can be selected for ideal bond strength and minimal damage to porcelain laminates." .

The environmental impact of these materials is compared to the impact of virgin PP and HDPE using life cycle assessment. Materials and methodsFrom-cradle-to-grave life cycle inventory studies were performed for 1 kg of each of the three new composites: PP+cotton linters, PP+rice husks, and HDPE+cotton linters. Inventory data for the recycling of thermoplastics and cotton were obtained from a number of recycling firms in Spain, while environmental data concerning rice husks were obtained mainly from one rice-processing company located in Spain. Life cycle inventory data for virgin thermoplastics were acquired from PlasticsEurope. Two different scenarios—incineration and landfilling—were considered for the assessment of disposal phase. A quantitative impact assessment was performed for four impact categories: global warming over a hundred years, nonrenewable energy depletion, acidification, and eutrophication. ResultsThe composites subject to analysis exhibited a significantly reduced environmental impact during the materials acquisition and processing phases compared to conventional virgin thermoplastics in all of the impact categories considered. The use of fertilizers for rice cultivation, however, impaired the results of the rice husk composite in the eutrophication category where it nevertheless outperformed its conventional counterparts. The compounding phase fundamentally implies an electric consumption. The disposal phase was analyzed with regard to emissions in the global warming category. DiscussionComposites obtained from renewable sources are still in an incipient state of development in comparison with petroleum-derived plastics. In the future, as mass production of these plastics becomes more widespread, their environmental impact can be expected to reach lower levels than those obtained in our study. The new materials exhibited adequate mechanical performance for the application analyzed (structures used in aquaculture). ConclusionsThe composites subject to analysis exhibited a significantly reduced environmental impact compared to conventional virgin thermoplastics using 1 kg of material as a functional unit. Recommendations and perspectivesIn accordance with the International Organization for Standardization 14044:2006 standard, it would be advisable to avoid impact allocation. This posed some difficulties, since rice husks are a coproduct of rice. Thus, some impact allocation was done in our study on the basis of economic value. It would also be advisable to take the land use impact category into consideration when performing comparative studies between composites and conventional plastics, albeit the definition of this category is currently the subject of scientific debate." .

We use the fact that the effective constants can be defined through the minimum of an energy functional. We express this minimum in terms of a path integral allowing us to use many-body techniques. We obtain the perturbation expansion of the effective constants to second order in disorder, for any kind of non-linearity. We apply our method to the case of strong non-linearities (i.e. , where is fluctuating from point to point), and to the case of weak non-linearity (i.e. where and fluctuate from point to point). Our results are in agreement with previous ones, and could be easily extended to other types of non-linear problems in disordered systems." .

Two aniline derivatives, o-phenylenediamine and o-aminophenol, were electrooxidized from H2SO4 aqueous solutions using the PPTA film-coated electrode. The PPTA film was permeable to the aniline derivatives, and the derivatives were electrooxidized on the electrode surface. When the derivatives were electrooxidized, the film immobilized the corresponding oligomer species as well as the polymers plain (o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) and poly(o-aminophenol) (PoAP), and the deposited amount of the polymers was increased by the PPTA film. The immobilized amount of PoAP was greater than that of PoPD because of the 1,4-substituted structure of PoAP. In the PPTA film, both PoPD and PoAP were electronically stabilized, and they became durable against oxidative degradation." .

This paper describes aspects of the microstructural evolution and associated small-scale motion in a dynamically recrystallizing sheet of octachloropropane. The material was deformed in progressive pure shear, at 2×10−3 sec−1 (with interruptions for photography and U-stage measurement), at 70 % of its absolute melting temperature. The dominant recrystallization process is migration of grain boundaries, with consequent major adjustment of the shapes and sizes of grains, but no marked change in the average grain size and no creation of new grains. Typical grains in the fully deformed material (30% bulk shortening) have a composite structure with primitive, high-strain regions inherited directly from the undeformed state, rimmed by successively younger regions of lower strain accreted behind outwardmoving boundaries. An array of second-phase marker particles permits distinction between grain boundary motion with and through the material, and reveals an unexpected ability of grains as a whole to migrate short distances up a bulk strain gradient. The markers also show that the only important deformation process is intragranular deformation and that it is proceeding at somewhat different rates in different grains. The central problem posed by the observations is to explain the direction and speed of each migrating boundary. Two hypotheses were tested, neither with outstanding success. One of these hypotheses is that grain boundary migration is part of a strain accomodation process, that operates between grains stretching or shortening at different rates parallel to their mutual boundary." .
