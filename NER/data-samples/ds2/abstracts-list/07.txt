Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 increase plant biomass, net primary production (NPP) and plant demand for nitrogen (N). The demand for N set by rapid plant growth under elevated CO2 could be met by increasing soil N availability or by greater efficiency of N uptake. Alternatively, plants could increase their nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), thereby maintaining high rates of growth and NPP in the face of nutrient limitation. We quantified dry matter and N budgets for a young pine forest exposed to 4 years of elevated CO2 using free-air CO2 enrichment technology. We addressed three questions: Does elevated CO2 increase forest NPP and the demand for N by vegetation? Is demand for N met by greater uptake from soils, a shift in the distribution of N between plants, microbes, and soils, or increases in NUE under elevated CO2? Will soil N availability constrain the NPP response of this forest as CO2 fumigation continues? A step-function increase in atmospheric CO2 significantly increased NPP during the first 4 years of this study. Significant increases in NUE under elevated CO2 modulated the average annual requirement for N by vegetation in the first and third growing seasons under elevated CO2; the average stimulation of NPP in these years was 21% whereas the average annual stimulation of the N requirement was only 6%. In the second and fourth growing seasons, increases in NPP increased the annual requirement for N by 27–33%. Increases in the annual requirement for N were largely met by increases in N uptake from soils. Retranslocation of nutrients prior to senescence played only a minor role in supplying the additional N required by trees growing under elevated CO2. NPP was highly correlated with between-plot variation in the annual rate of net N mineralization and CO2 treatment. This demonstrates that NPP is co-limited by C availability, as CO2 from the atmosphere, and N availability from soils. There is no evidence that soil N mineralization rates have increased under elevated CO2. The correlation between NPP and N mineralization rates and the increase in the annual requirement for N in certain years imply that soil N availability may control the long-term productivity response of this ecosystem to elevated CO2. Although we have no evidence suggesting that NPP is declining in response to >4 years of CO2 fumigation, if the annual requirement of N continues to be stimulated by elevated CO2, we predict that the productivity response of this forest ecosystem will decline over time." .

Under moist soil conditions, average daily sap flux density (J s) in the outermost xylem varied by a factor of 2.3 among the species (67–152 g cm−2 per day, n=5 trees per species), and declined in the sequence Fagus sylvatica > Acer pseudoplatanus > Tilia cordata > Carpinus betulus > Fraxinus excelsior. Decreasing soil moisture content (Θ) resulted in linearly reduced J s in four of the species. During a dry period, J s was reduced by 44% in T. cordata, 39% in F. sylvatica, 37% in A. pseudoplatanus and 31% in C. betulus compared to sap flux at equal vapour pressure deficit (D) in the wet period. F. excelsior, the only ring-porous species studied, lacked a significant response in J s to D and Θ. The relative reduction in water use during the dry period was not related to the assumed drought sensitivity of the species as inferred from their abundance in natural woodlands. J s was positively correlated with tree diameter at breast height (DBH) in three species but decreased with DBH in two species. Dyeing experiments revealed that DBH accounted for 94% of the variation in sapwood area found in a bulk sample of all diffuse-porous trees. This suggests that DBH is a reliable estimator of sapwood area of temperate diffuse-porous species irrespective of species identity. In contrast, sap flux density was found to be greatly dependent on tree species. The estimated whole-plant water use for diffuse-porous trees of a given diameter (49 cm) ranged between 74 and 168 kg per day per species under moist soil conditions. Thus, in temperate mixed forests, species-specific differences in water use can result in a considerable spatial heterogeneity of canopy transpiration." .

Forest biotechnology offers potential that cannot be realized from conventional breeding because of the long life of forest trees and because of the long time required to make genetic gains through tree improvement programs. Most of the biotechnology research in forest trees has concentrated on genetically variable traits that give a relative quick return on investment: growth, form, insect, disease and herbicide resistance, and wood properties. In the long run, other modified traits should have greater value than is obtained solely from timber management. At the tree or forest level, some of those traits will address carbon sequestration, bioenergy, bioremediation, biopulping and species restoration. At the gene level within a tree, the types of potential gains will include pharmaceuticals, resins, latexes, oils, flavonoids, and foodstuff, inclusive of increased fruit quantity and quality and the sugars and starches embedded in the cell walls. With the advent of nanotechnology, trees of the future will be dissected to form every wood product that is now commercially available and, in addition, a multitude of new products will appear." .

The model simulated the impacts of these projected changes on ecologically significant weather variables, such as the length of the frost-free period, average growing season temperature, average growing season degree days (4.4° C basis), summer precipitation, potential evaporation during the growing season, and the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation during July and August. The results indicate that even the lower range of predicted climate changes could lead to ecologically and commercially significant changes in the composition and productivity of these forests. Of particular concern is the possibility of climatically induced regional decline episodes for a number of important commercial species in the northern temperate forests of central North America." .

Additionally, distribution of the mineral contents along the trunk was studied in four trees. The seasonal increase and decrease of xylem sap mineral contents along the trunk is shown for the characteristic phenophases. The Ca, Mg, K, and Mn contents of xylem saps were determined by means of atomicabsorptionspectrophotometry." .

Such injury may primarily result from the direct, above-ground effects of air pollution or indirect, below-ground changes in mineral uptake. Typically, the new flush of spruce needles is green and exhibits high photosynthetic capacity. Mies and Zöttl concluded that the older foliage is damaged when nutrients are withdrawn to supply the current year's needles. By removing the terminal buds of single branches in the spring, we produced an experimental set of the previous year's needles with greater mineral reserves than the control needles. During the course of the growing period, the performance of the experimental needles, which lacked competition from the new flush, was compared to that of the control needles of the same age-class on intact branches with the new flush. Throughout the experiment, chloroplast pigments of a healthy control tree were not affected by the elimination of the new flush. However, the chlorophyll and carotenoid content as well as the photosynthetic capacity of the previous year's needles on those branches of a heavily damaged tree where the new flush had been eliminated increased substantially. This increase was associated with an increase in minerals, which seemed to be deficient in the control needles with the new flush. Thus, in contrast to needles of the same age-class on intact branches with undisturbed new growth in the same atmospheric environment, the experimental needles escaped bleaching and a decrease in photosynthesis. It would seem that the bleaching and the loss in photosynthetic capacity typical of trees damaged by forest decline indirectly result from nutrient deficiencies through soil environment changes and/or root damage than directly from atmospheric pollutants." .

The oil yields of leaves up to 5 months of age were significantly affected by physiological changes associated with leaf maturation. The extent of these changes depends on genotype and on external influences such as soil moisture conditions. Prolonged drought stress reduced oil production in young leaves but did not affect greatly the equilibrium reached between synthesis and removal of oils at leaf maturity. Waterlogging prolonged peak oil production. Trends in oil yields with time differed markedly between individual trees. Although genotypic variation was great, there was detectable variation attributable to site, season and year. A relationship between seasonal patterns and climatic factors could not be established. Part of the observed variation in oil yields with time was attributable to variability in leaf maturity. The relative superiority in oil-yielding capacity of certain individuals in each experiment was maintained throughout, despite substantial variation from non-genetic sources. This consistency in ranking is of advantage to tree breeders wishing to make selections amongst plantations of differing age, on different sites and at different times of the year. However, even with careful sampling controls, absolute values will vary substantially and progeny testing will be necessary to further assess the potential of the initial selections." .

Sensitivity analysis indicates that adult annual survivorship has by far the largest influence on λ, followed by the probability that juveniles survive dispersal, and the adult annual fecundity. Substantial temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters have little effect on the long-run growth rate of the population because of the long adult life expectancy. A model of dispersal and territory occupancy that assumes demographic equilibrium is evaluated using data on the amount of old forest habitat remaining in the Pacific Northwest and the current occupancy of this habitat by northern spotted owls. This model is employed to predict the effect of future habitat loss and fragmentation on the population, implying that extinction will result if the old forest is reduced to less than a proportion 0.21±0.02 of the total area in a large region. The estimated minimum habitat requirement for the population is greater than that allowed in management plants by the USDA Forest Service." .

There is no universally adopted method for measuring the gap size, although several options are available. In addition, few methods have been proposed for measuring the gap shape. This paper proposes a photographic method of estimating canopy gap size and gap shape. The proposed method is based on a vertical hemispherical photograph of the gap and is thus named the hemispherical photograph method (HPM). We tested the accuracy of the HPM measure of gap size by two ground-based methods and compared the HPM with other methods. Our results indicate that the HPM measurement of the canopy gap size is accurate, but is significantly influenced by the location of the camera. Compared with the ground-based methods, the HPM is more objective and repeatable. Compared with other photographic methods, HPM is more accurate due to the more actual assumptions, but is more labor-intensive because more field measurements are necessary. We conclude that the HPM is a powerful tool for comparative and long-term studies of forest gaps." .

However, despite their importance, their long-term dynamics associated with fire- or logging-origin and overstory type have not been examined in boreal forest. We hypothesize that (1) CWD compositional diversity increases with stand development whereas CWD volume follows a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, we attempted to test if (2) CWD volume and compositional diversity converge for postlogged and postfire stands through stand development, and (3) mixedwoods have more CWD volume and greater compositional diversity than conifer or broadleaf overstory types. We sampled 72 stands ranging in age from 7 to 201 years in fire-origin stands and 7–31 years in managed stands with conifer, mixedwood, and broadleaf overstory types in central boreal Canada. For fire-origin stands, snag volume was 100–260 m3/ha in 7-year-old stands, 5–20 m3/ha in 25-year-old stands, and 25–60 m3/ha in older stands; downed woody debris (DWD) volume decreased from 7 to 72–90 year-old stands, increased in 124- to 139-year-old stands, then either decreased or increased in 201-year-old stands depending on overstory type. CWD diversity increased from 25 to 124–139 year-old and plateaued, but in 7-year-old stands, CWD diversity was as high as that in the 124 and up year-old age classes. Logging resulted in a smaller amount and lower size variability of CWD in 7-year-old stands, with a larger portion being fast-decomposing Betula papyrifera. Most CWD characteristics had not converged by approximately 30 years since disturbance between the two stand origins. More diverse CWD occurred in mixedwoods, but conifer stands contained the greatest CWD volume except in 7 year-old postfire stands." .

Remaining green needles and needles that were shed were compared and removal of N from total, protein and arginine pools was calculated. Earlier investigations had shown that high arginine concentrations are found in needles of trees that have an excessive N supply (Näsholm and Ericsson 1990). This study aimed to elucidate the fate of the accumulated arginine during needle senescence. It was speculated that a low removal of arginine during senescence would implicate that the primary function of arginine is in N detoxification and not in N storage. Moreover, litter quality would be altered if needles are shed with high concentrations of arginine and this might affect the turnover of N in forest ecosystems. In remaining green needles, the concentration of total N increased with increasing N supply. Protein N concentrations were higher in fertilized trees, but did not differ between the two N treatments. Arginine N was low in C and N1 trees but high in N2 trees. Senescent needles from C and N1 trees had about equal total N concentrations while in N2 trees this concentration was significantly higher. Protein N in senescent needles did not differ between treatments. Arginine N, however, was less than 0.1 mg g−1 dw in C and N1 trees but was higher than 1.5 mg g−1 dw in N2 trees. Removal of N was highest in N1 trees followed by C trees while N2 trees removed least N from senescing needles. The high concentration of total N in senescent needles from N2 trees was to a great extent explained by a high arginine concentration. The δ15N value of remaining, green needles was higher (less negative) in N2 trees than in C and N1 trees. The same pattern was found for senescent needles. Comparisons of δ15N values between remaining, green and senescent needles within each treatment showed a significant increase in δ15N for all treatments during senescence possibly indicating losses of N as NH3 (g) from needles during senescence. It is concluded that arginine, accumulated in response to high N supply, is retranslocated only to a small extent during needle senescence. The ecological and physiological implications of this finding are discussed." .

The fitted model is proposed for further eco-physiological studies. AbstractThe physiological and ecological mechanisms controlling the knot richness in extractives require further investigations. We aim to design a model of the vertical distribution of the knot extractive concentrations as a prerequisite for further studies on the eco-physiological studies. At a first attempt, we use this model to test the effect of different competition situations. Fifteen Silver fir trees were sampled according to their social status within three thinning treatments. Discs containing knots were sampled according to their position in reference to the lowest living branch of each tree. Extractions were carried out with hexane and acetone successively. Extractive concentrations in both solvents as well as branch diameters were simultaneously modelled through the seemingly unrelated regression method. For all trees, knot extractive concentrations increase from the tree tip to the living crown base. According to the model, trees with the longest crowns, dominant or/and growing in the thinned stands, exhibited the largest knot extractive concentrations. The model depicted a vertical trend that strongly suggested inducing physiological factors such as protection zone, branch heartwood formation combined with compression wood formation. A strategy was proposed for the quantification of the effect of the ecological factors on the extractive concentrations of knots when these factors act either directly or indirectly via physiological factors. The model is thus an efficient tool to quantify the eco-physiological control on knot extractives." .

Variation in the wood and bark anatomy of the dominant species of a mangrove forest community in Mexico was evaluated in relation to some environmental factors, and their physiological adaptations to salinity and flooding period are discussed. The forest is characterized by three zones according to the presence of dominant tree species and flooding periodicity. Vessel arrangement and wood and bark ray height are strongly associated with flooding zones where trees are growing. Variance analyses revealed significant differences among zones for these anatomical characteristics. Soil texture and water salinity were the most useful parameters for the prediction of values of anatomical characteristics. More abundant vessels in radial multiples in a shorter flooding period suggest a functional advantage of multiple vessel groups. Taller wood and bark rays in response to prolonged flooding period can be attributed to anoxic conditions. Among zones, significant differences in the vulnerability index of the species were detected, but not with respect to relative conductivity. Significant differences among zones exist for wood and bark characteristics involved in vertical and horizontal water transport, photosynthates and gas exchange." .

A primary anti-insect defense of pines is oleoresin from a system of resin ducts throughout the tree. Resin defense traits are heritable, and evidence suggests that resin duct characteristics are associated with resistance to insects. However, comparisons of resin ducts in trees killed by bark beetles to trees that resisted attack are unavailable. We compared vertical resin duct characteristics (number, density, and size) and growth rates from trees that were “resistant” (survived mass attack) versus “susceptible” (killed by attack) to bark beetles in lodgepole (Pinus contorta) and limber (Pinus flexilis) pines. Resistant trees of both species had significantly more resin ducts in recent growth than susceptible trees. Discriminant analysis (DA) correctly categorized 84 % of lodgepole and 92 % of limber pines as susceptible/resistant based on combinations of resin duct and growth characteristics from recent 5- through 20-year growth intervals. DA models using measures from only the most recent 5 years of growth correctly categorized 72 and 81 % of lodgepole and limber pines, respectively. Comparing resistant to susceptible trees independent of species identity led to the correct categorization of 82 % of trees based on factors from 5- to 20-year intervals, and 73 % of trees using only resin duct counts from the most recent 5 years. We conclude that resin duct characteristics can be used to assess tree resistance to bark beetles across pine species, and offer a metric for management to enhance pest resistance." .

Two mature stand types, pure conifer stands of Abies spp., and mixed stands of Abies spp. and hardwoods (mainly the birch Betula ermanii), are distinguished. Pure stands are likely to show simultaneous decay, followed by evenaged regeneration of stand-floor seedlings (<20 cm tall), Rapidly growing A. veitchii dominates over A. mariesii in this type of regeneration, which is occasionally invaded by light-demanding Betula. In constrast, mixed stands degenerate rather slowly, followed by the regeneration of Abies from the bank of suppressed saplings (>20 cm tall), which persist only in mixed stands. The more shade-tolerant A. mariesii is supeior in this type of regeneration, while Betula does not succeed, and mixed stands change to pure stands with time. The fact that two patterns of Abies regeneration occur in a certain ratio in the forest is what enables the two Abies species to coexist. A simple dynamical system model supports this conclusion." .

Spatial variation in tree species distributions and forest composition control litter inputs across landscapes, but inputs to individual lentic habitat patches are determined by adjacent plant communities. In small, ephemeral, fishless ponds, resource quality and abundance can be the most important factor affecting habitat selection preferences of colonizing animals. We used a landscape of experimental mesocosms to assess how natural populations of aquatic beetles respond over time to variation in tree leaf litter composition (pine or hardwood). Patches with faster-decomposing hardwood leaf litter were initially colonized at higher rates than slower-decomposing pine pools by most species of Hydrophilidae, but this pattern reversed later in the experiment with higher colonization of pine pools by hydrophilids. Colonization did not differ between pine and hardwood for dytiscids and the small hydrophilid Paracymus, but there were distinct beetle assemblages between pine and hardwood patches both early and late in the experiment. Our data support the importance of patch quality and habitat selection as determinants of species abundances, richness, and community structure in freshwater aquatic systems, not only when new habitat patches are formed and initial conditions set, but as patches change due to interactions of processes such as decomposition with time." .

The nutcracker buries clusters of seeds in subterranean caches; germination of clustered seeds often results in a growth form characterized by two or more genetically distinct trees with fused or contiguous trunks (tree clusters). The occurrence of a morphologically similar form, the multi-trunk tree (a single genet branched near the base), as well as the typical single-trunked tree, complicates the study of limber pine populations. We examined growth form distribution and genetic relationships in tree clusters in limber pine populations at four elevations (from 2585 m to 3460 m) in the Colorado Front Range. At three study areas, relative occurrence of limber pine growth forms, as well as that of associated pines, was examined by a point-centered quarter survey. From the four study areas, we collected foliage from each trunk from a total of 74 “clumps” (combined tree clusters and multi-trunk trees) in order to differentiate the two growth forms using starch gel protein electrophoresis. Tree “clumps” were significantly more common in limber pine than in ponderosa or lodgepole pine (P<0.010). Although single-trunk limber pine was the most common growth form, except at the highest elevation, both multi-trunk trees and tree clusters were present in each stand. Tree clusters were estimated to comprise about 20% of the tree sites in each limber pine stand; the estimated proportion of multi-trunk trees varied by site from 5% to 77%. Trees in clusters were related, on average, as half to full siblings (mean r=0.43), but were unrelated to trees in other clusters (mean r=0.01). Electrophoretic analysis suggests possible genetic differentiation in limber pine that may be the result of different selection pressures on the growth forms." .

The oils were obtained from 500 g each of stem barks and leaves, respectively, by hydrodistillation, using a Clevenger-type apparatus with the following yields: 0.23% and 0.19% for C. patens and 0.1% and 0.3% for U. pierreanum (w/w relative to dried material weight). Analysis of 10% (v/v) oil in hexane by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry identified only terpenoids in the oils, with over 81% sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in C. patens extracts and U. pierreanum stem bark oil, while the leaf oil from the latter species was found to contain a majority of monoterpenes. For C. patens, the major components were α-copaene, δ-cadinene, and germacrene D for the stem bark oil and β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and germacrene B for the leaf oil. The stem bark oil of U. pierreanum was found to contain mainly β-bisabolene and α-bisabolol, while α- and β-pinenes were more abundant in the leaf extract. Concentrations of oils obtained by diluting 1-mg/mL stock solutions were tested against P. falciparum in culture. The oils were active, with IC50 values of 9.19 and 15.19 μg/mL for the stem bark and leaf oils, respectively, of C. patens and 6.08 and 13.96 μg/mL, respectively, for those from U. pierreanum.

Current research on plant N uptake in terrestrial ecosystems has focused mainly on inorganic N such as ammonium (NH4 +) and nitrate (NO3 −), while soluble organic N (SON) has received little attention. In recent years, the increasing evidence showing the direct uptake of various amino acids by plants and the predominance of the organic form in N loss by leaching in many forest ecosystems has drawn attention to critically re-examine the nature and the ecological role of soil SON in terrestrial N cycling. However, little is known about the sources and dynamics, chemical nature, and ecological functions of soil SON in forest ecosystems. This paper reviews recent advances in the areas of research on current techniques for characterizing soil SON and the size, nature, and dynamics of soil SON pools in forest ecosystems. Materials and methodsThe SON represents a significant pool of available and mobile N in forest soils. The SON can be sampled using a number of physical (e.g., suction cup, microdialysis) and chemical (e.g., extraction) methods and analyzed by the wet chemistry method (e.g., persulfate oxidation) and combustion. Chemical and physical fractionation, pyrolysis–mass spectrometry, 13C and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and 15N, 13C, and 14C isotopic techniques have been used for investigating the nature and dynamics of SON in forest ecosystems. Results and discussionThe amount of SON in soil may vary with land use type, forest species, management practices, and analytical procedures used. Statistical figures, based on 116 datasets available in the literature, have shown that concentrations of soil SON can range from 1 mg N kg−1 (dry weight basis) to up to 448 mg N kg−1, with an average of 35 mg N kg−1, representing an average of 48% of total soluble N. Soil SON consists of a mixture of structurally diverse N-containing compounds, possibly with the amide N, amino acids, and amino sugars being predominant. The biodegradability of SON largely depends upon its chemical characteristics (e.g., C-to-N ratio). ConclusionsDirect utilization of added amino acids by a large number of forest species may present a potentially important new pathway for plant N uptake. However, the evidence of direct utilization of soil native SON by forest plants is still lacking, and the extent of the contribution of SON to forest plants is far from certain. Transformation of soil organic matter into SON, rather than the conversion of SON to NH4 +/NO3 −, may be the rate-limiting step, which regulates the overall N cycling in N-limited forest ecosystems. Recommendations and perspectivesFuture work may well focus on the chemical and biological nature of SON in forest soils, microbial transformation of SON, the nutritional role of the SON pools in the N-limited forest ecosystems, and the potential role of SON in global climate change (e.g., N2O emission)." .

These are among the highest altitude forest types in the world, and the region under study is a center of diversity for the genus, and is located at the confluence of four biogeographical provinces. Nine main plant communities were distinguished. Correspondence Analysis revealed a strong dependence of community composition primarily on biogeographic as well as on bioclimatic features. The greatest forest type diversity is found in the central part of the Cordillera Oriental in the Tropical pluviseasonal bioclimate, within a Supratropical thermotype and a Subhumid ombrotype." .

In this study, wood properties at breast height (1.3 m) were studied on radial strips prepared from 12-mm pith-to-bark wood cores taken from 20 trees in a 22-year-old Eucalyptus nitens (Deane and Maiden) Maiden thinning trial in north-eastern Tasmania, Australia. Thinning treatments were applied at age 6 years. Trees were sampled from each of the 200, 400 stems ha−1 and unthinned control treatments. Intra-specific competition for each sampled tree was estimated using the basal area growth of surrounding trees. SilviScan™ technology was used to produce radial profiles of wood density, MFA and MoE. Results indicate a reduction in intra-specific competition through thinning of E. nitens plantations at an early age leads to a transient increase in MFA but has no significant effect on wood density or the intra-annual cycle of wood density. The correlation between the level of intra-specific competition and initial change in MFA following thinning, and a significant relationship between tree shape and mean MFA at breast height suggests the change in MFA is a post-thinning response to increased exposure and wind sway." .

Twenty five plots were Hypochaeris radicata-Quercus communities, comprising roadside verges in open landscapes on dry, acid, sandy soils, poor in nutrients. In each plot, the trees were even-aged but varied between 10 and 140 years. The relationship between tree age and numbers of ectomycorrhizal species and sporocarps was studied. The species composition of roadside verges was compared between young trees (10–20 years), medium-old trees (20–50 years) and old trees (50–140 years). The species composition in roadside verges in open landscape with old trees was also compared with the ectomycorrhizal fungi in two further different types of roadside verges with old oak trees, viz the Anthriscus sylvestris-Quercus type, comprising open to half-open plots on soil richer in nutrients, and the Mnium hornum-Quercus type, comprising shady plots surrounded by forest. The data reveal a distinct succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi with increasing tree age. The results are compared with data on succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest stands. It is concluded that the succession cannot be modeled simply as suggested by some authors. Instead, changes in species composition and diversity showed much variation in relation to different environmental conditions. The factors relevant to the course of ectomycorrhizal succession are discussed. The concepts of early- and late-stage fungi are critically considered. It is concluded that this classification is not appropriate for the description of the ectomycorrhizal succession during stand development. A new, provisional classification of ectomycorrhizal fungi on the basis of their appearance during forest succession is proposed." .

Results from singular spectrum analysis (SSA) allow a low-dimensional characterization of the complex and complicated tree motion patterns in response to non-destructive wind excitation. Since motion of the sample trees was dominated by sway in the first mode, the application of SSA on time series of sample trees’ stem displacement yielded characteristic and distinguishable non-oscillatory trend components, quasi-oscillatory sway, and noise, of which only the non-oscillatory components were correlated directly with wind characteristics. Although sway in the range of the dominant damped fundamental frequency dominated the measured stem displacement signals, it was almost decoupled from near-surface airflow. The ability to discriminate SSA-components is demonstrated based on correlation and spectral analysis. These SSA-components, as well as wind speed measured in the canopy space of the Scots pine forest, were used to train neural networks, which could then reasonably simulate tree response to wind excitation." .

There was near complete turn-over of dominant canopy tree species among sites, resulting in greater dominance of evergreen species with long-lived leaves as precipitation increased. Mean structural and physiological traits changed along this gradient as predicted by cost–benefit theories of leaf life span. Nitrogen content per unit mass (Nmass) and light- and CO2-saturated photosynthetic rates per unit mass (P mass) of upper canopy leaves decreased with annual precipitation, and these changes were partially explained by increasing leaf thickness and decreasing specific leaf area (SLA). Comparison of 1,800 mm and 3,100 mm sites, where canopy access was available through the use of construction cranes, revealed an association among extended leaf longevity, greater structural defense, higher midday leaf water potential, and lower P mass, Nmass, and SLA at wetter sites. Shorter leaf life spans and more enriched foliar δ15N values in drier sites suggest greater resorption and re-metabolism of leaf N in drier forest. Greater dominance of short-lived leaves with relatively high P mass in drier sites reflects a strategy to maximize photosynthesis when water is available and to minimize water loss and respiration costs during rainless periods. Overall, our study links coordinated change in leaf functional traits that affect productivity and nutrient cycling to seasonality in lowland tropical forests." .

AbstractThe forests in the region of so-called “Black Triangle” suffered from heavy air-pollution load until the end of the 1980s. Acid deposition reduction in 1990s led to an improvement of forest condition. However, the positive development was interrupted by an extreme climatic and pollution stress during the winter of 1995/96. It resulted in an acute damage of spruce stands, manifested by drying and falling of needles and significant decrease of bud vitality. The methods of tree-ring and quantitative wood-anatomy analysis were employed to study the impact of this event on growth and wood anatomy of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Reexamining the tree response remains challenging, because the knowledge about the impact of acute pollution stress on xylem traits is still lacking. The annual radial growth showed a clear reaction to the stress event, manifesting as a strong growth reduction in 1996–1998. Height growth was affected in similar manner, but only recovered in 2001. Anatomical features of both earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) were affected by the stress, however, with the maximal effect occurring with a lag of 1 year from the time of the event. The EW part was more responsive and showed a higher variability of parameters than the LW part. During the 1996–2000 stress period, tree growth was driven by climatic factors and by the air-pollution load; later, the impact of air pollution was no longer pronounced and tree growth was correlated to the content of nutrients." .

The most efficient sampling protocol consisted of rootball excavation and soil coring for bulk coarse roots, which when compared with total tree excavation estimated total coarse root biomass contained inside the sampled area to within 10%. Across all treatments, an average of 76% of the coarse root biomass was located within the rootball. The majority (>65%) of the coarse roots outside the rootball were located in the surface 20 cm of soil. When size class distribution was examined, 75% of coarse root biomass was found to occur in the larger (20+ mm) diameter size class, a size class that displayed considerable spatial heterogeneity. At the stand level, coarse root biomass ranged from 2.18 to 7.38 kg m−2 depending primarily on tree size but also on fertilization treatment, species and site. It is estimated that allocation to coarse root biomass production was around 0.2 kg m−2 year−1 (around 6% of estimated NPP) for the E. nitens stands examined in this study and around 1 kg m−2 year−1 (around 20% of estimated NPP) for the E. globulus stand examined. Robust relationships using above-ground parameters could be used to predict coarse root biomass regardless of fertilization or site, but species changed the relationship." .

We focused on the roles of microbial and plant root activities using a trenching method to prepare root-excluded and root-including plots. In root-excluded plots, P application did not change the amount of N2O emissions. By contrast, in root-including plots, P application significantly reduced N2O emissions (from 71.1 ± 20.2 to 19.3 ± 5.1 mg N m−2 106 days−1). Lower total P, Bray-2 P, and Bio-P (microbial P determined by chloroform fumigation extraction method) contents in the soils of root-including plots as compared to root-excluded plots a few days after P application shows that acacia trees absorbed P fertilizer rapidly. This rapid P uptake probably relieved the P limitation of acacia and might have consistently increased root N uptake. This interpretation is supported by lower inorganic N content in P-applied soils (the average of three sampling times is 8.9 and 11.3 μg N g soil−1 in P-applied soils and soils without P application, respectively), which in turn decreased N2O emissions. Our study suggests that P fertilizer suppresses N2O emissions from tropical leguminous forest plantations." .

We developed a model to test the effects of radial growth, tree age, climate, and seed-source origins on wood density in 21 diverse populations of jack pine in a common garden in Petawawa, Ontario, Canada over the last 24 years using a linear mixed-effects model. Although we found significant differences in wood density among diverse seed origins, there were no differences between seed origins having the same ring age and ring width, indicating an indirect effect on wood density of seed-source origin via radial growth. High variation in wood density among trees within the same population and between populations indicated high genetic control of wood density. The climate effect was significant on wood density in all populations, but smaller when radial growth was controlled. Climate effect did not differ significantly among populations. Precipitation in July negatively affected latewood density, whereas precipitation in May in the current year and September of the previous year negatively affected earlywood density. We concluded that a single model of jack pine wood density and radial growth could be used, either controlling for climate effects or not, as the relationship between wood density and radial growth is preserved among the diverse populations, and the climate effect controlling for radial growth in the model was only slight." .

The ecology of these two groups of species will largely determine the structure and dynamics of the savanna-forest boundary, but little is known about the ecological and physiological differences that might control their distributions. We performed field and nursery experiments to compare seedling establishment success, predawn leaf water potential, biomass allocation, and root carbohydrate concentration of congeneric species, each composed of one savanna species and one forest species. Seedling establishment of savanna and forest species responded differently to vegetation cover, with forest species having lowest establishment success in the open savanna and savanna species having lowest success in forest. Subsequent survival followed similar patterns, resulting in even greater differences in cumulative success. The low survival of forest species in the savanna appears related to drought stress, as seedlings of forest species had lower predawn leaf water potential than savanna species. Seedlings of savanna species had greater root: shoot ratios and root total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration, particularly among evergreen genera. Among evergreen genera, root TNC per shoot mass, which may largely determine resprout capacity, was seven times higher in savanna species than forest species. Although water availability and microclimate may reduce the success of forest species, these factors appear unable to completely exclude forest seedling establishment in savanna. Fire, on the other hand, appears to be a much more absolute constraint to success of forest species in savanna." .

At a “relative growth rate” slightly lower than in the parent species, hybrid larch achieved twice the annual carbon gain, increment in stem length and above-ground production, and its foliage-related stem growth was higher than in European (L. decidua) but similar to Japanese (L. leptolepis) larch. A similar “relative growth efficiency” and foliage-related total above-ground production in all trees did reflect the similarity of photosynthetic capacity of the hybrid found at the leaf level. While the lengths of lateral twigs on hybrid branches were intermediate between the European larch with short, and the Japanese larch with large, twigs the hybrid possessed the longest branches with the highest needle biomass. This resulted in a crown structure of the hybrid crown similar to the Japanese larch together with a high needle density on branches as in the European larch. In total, the foliage biomass per crown length was about 30% higher in hybrid larch than in both of the parent species. Thus, the high carbon input for the stem heterosis was based on a “complementation principle” of advantageous parent features at the crown level. Similar slopes of foliage against sapwood area of stem and branches did not indicate a special need for a thick hybrid stem with respect to water transport." .

The measured strains are not affected by the direction of pulling force. AbstractStem breakage is a common failure mode of standing trees. The stem of the tree with a lopsided crown is always subjected to bending and torsional combined deformation state under wind load. At a certain degree of torsional moment, the torsional stress exceeds the value of shearing strength of green timber resulting in longitudinal splitting. There is no valid experimental approach to measure shear strain of a trunk scientifically so far. In this paper, we propose an approach to measure the maximum torsional shear and bending strains of a stem which is under combined deformation state. It is that four strain meters are arranged on tree stem in a certain way. The measured strains are not affected by the direction of pulling force. We explain the principle of the measurement approach. To validate the measurement approach, tree-pulling tests are performed to model wind forces. The trunk strains are also converted to trunk stresses using Hooke’s Law. Analyses of the results demonstrate that the experimentally measured values are in good agreement with the theoretical values." .

During the outbreak, we noted that injured Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) developed secondary buds in response to the fungus attack, and we decided to study the relationship between injury, appearance of secondary buds and recovery of the trees thereafter. For this purpose, 143 trees from 10 to 50 years of age were chosen and grouped into crown density classes. Injury was assessed in detail, and buds were counted before bud burst in the spring of 2002. In addition, a subset of 15 trees was followed through the summer of 2002 to assess recovery. All injured trees developed secondary buds, with a clear overweight of dormant winter buds in proportion to interfoliar buds. Healthy control trees did not develop secondary buds at all. The secondary buds appeared predominantly on the injured parts of the tree; interfoliar buds in particular developed just beneath the damaged tissue. Most of the secondary buds died during the winter of 2001–2002, mainly because the fungus continued to spread after the first outbreak. Many of the remaining buds developed shoots with abnormal growth during the summer. Secondary buds may help trees to recover from Gremmeniella attacks, but this strategy may fail when the fungus continues to grow and injure the newly formed buds and shoots." .

Franco) trees from the Oregon Coast Range under different levels of crown removal. Natural frequency of trees, in both their unpruned and completely de-branched states, was linearly related to the ratio of diameter at breast height to total tree height squared (i.e., DBH/H2), as expected from the theory governing the oscillation of a cantilever beam. Pruning resulted in an increase in natural frequency; however, at least 80% of the crown mass needed to be removed before this increase was noticeable. A single equation was developed that enabled the natural frequency of a tree of given size and pruning intensity to be predicted. Damping ratios of unpruned trees varied considerably from 8% to almost critical, while those for completely de-branched trees ranged from 1% to 8%. Two different trends in damping ratio were observed during pruning. Some trees exhibited an increase in damping ratio with initial crown removal, followed by a sharp decrease when the uppermost portion of the crown was removed. Others showed little or no change in damping ratio followed by a sharp reduction upon removal of the uppermost portion of the crown. Damping was mainly due to aerodynamic drag and preventing interference with neighbouring trees had little effect. Theoretical analysis using the finite element method indicated that changes in natural frequency as a result of pruning are not due to changes in damping ratio, but rather changes in mass distribution. This analysis also suggested that treating branches as lumped masses rather than individual cantilevers attached to the main stem may not be appropriate." .

Results confirm a significant decrease of δ13C values from the tree canopy to the forest floor. The values measured in understory plants growing in gaps were not significantly different from the average for plants growing under the forest shade. Seedling leaf values tended to be more positive than those of saplings, probably reflecting the contribution of organic matter from the mother tree. Photosynthetic independence on the forest floor results in a reduction in °13C value. Stem and root tissue values of seedlings and saplings were less negative than those of the leaves of the same plants. It is suggested that this difference results from the slower change in isotopic composition experienced by the woody tissue, as the seedlings become photosynthetically independent in the forest floor." .

In the method, absolute global warming potentials (AGWP) of both the temporary carbon (C) debt of forest biomass stock and the C credit of the biomass use cycle displacing the fossil and non-renewable alternative are estimated as a function of the time frame of climate change mitigation. Dimensionless global warming potential (GWP) factors, GWPbio and GWPbiouse, are derived. As numerical examples, 1) bioenergy from boreal forest harvest residues to displace fossil fuels and 2) the use of wood for material substitution are considered. The GWP-based indicator leads to longer payback times, i.e. the time frame needed for the biomass option to be superior to its fossil-based alternative, than when just the cumulative balance of biogenic and fossil C stocks is considered. The warming payback time increases substantially with the residue diameter and low displacement factor (DF) of fossil C emissions. For the 35-cm stumps, the payback time appears to be more than 100 years in the climate conditions of Southern Finland when DF is lower than 0.5 in instant use and lower than 0.6 in continuous stump use. Wood use for construction appears to be more beneficial because, in addition to displaced emissions due to by-product bioenergy and material substitution, a significant part of round wood is sequestered into wood products for a long period, and even a zero payback time would be attainable with reasonable DFs." .

The proportion of juvenile to total foliage and growth was measured at the end of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year from establishment. Between the ages of 2 and 4 years annual stem volume increment increased in proportion to the amount of juvenile foliage retained. By age 4 years, stem volume of trees of the juvenile persistent form was significantly larger than that of the early adult form. Increasing differences in height growth with age between provenances, which were highly significant across sites by age 4, contributed to these differences in performance. There was some evidence that the largest trees of the juvenile-persistent form were those which combined mature foliage above juvenile foliage for the longest period during the transition from juvenile to mature foliage. In the early-adult form the largest trees were those which completed the transition to mature foliage rapidly. There was no difference in the ratio of foliage mass to basal area between the two forms. It is suggested that the faster growth of the juvenile-persistent form is related to higher leaf area index and not to foliage type. A provenance of E. globulus which had a higher retention of juvenile foliage at age 4 than a second provenance had a lower stem volume, thus indicating that in this species early growth rate is not determined by foliage type." .

We characterized the intraspecific functional trait variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Catalonia (NE Spain) in order to (1) compare it to the interspecific trait variability of trees in the same region, (2) explore the relationships among functional traits and the relationships between them and stand and climatic variables, and (3) study the role of functional trait variability as a determinant of radial growth. We considered five traits: wood density (WD), maximum tree height (H max), leaf nitrogen content (Nmass), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf biomass-to-sapwood area ratio (B L:A S). A unique dataset was obtained from the Ecological and Forest Inventory of Catalonia (IEFC), including data from 406 plots. Intraspecific trait variation was substantial for all traits, with coefficients of variation ranging between 8 % for WD and 24 % for B L:A S. In some cases, correlations among functional traits differed from those reported across species (e.g., H max and WD were positively related, whereas SLA and Nmass were uncorrelated). Overall, our model accounted for 47 % of the spatial variability in Scots pine radial growth. Our study emphasizes the hierarchy of factors that determine intraspecific variations in functional traits in Scots pine and their strong association with spatial variability in radial growth. We claim that intraspecific trait variation is an important determinant of responses of plants to changes in climate and other environmental factors, and should be included in predictive models of vegetation dynamics." .

These mortality events usually show certain level of host-specificity, translating into rapid changes in the relative abundance of the adult community. Despite these short-term changes, it is poorly understood whether the decline and mortality of certain tree species are likely to result in long-term vegetation shifts. Trajectories of forest recovery and the probability of occurrence of permanent vegetation shifts are to a large extent determined by post-mortality regeneration dynamics. Using a spatially explicit neighborhood approach, we evaluated the spatial patterns of natural regeneration of the woody plant community in mixed Mediterranean forests affected by the decline of their dominant tree species, Quercus suber. We predicted the abundance, survival, and richness of the seedling and sapling bank as a function of the distribution and health status of the tree and shrub community. Results indicated that Q. suber decline had detectable effects on seedlings and saplings of coexistent woody species from very different functional groups (trees, shrubs, and lianas). The sign and magnitude of these effects varied substantially among coexistent species, which could imply shifts in the species ranking of seedling and sapling abundance, affecting successional trajectories and potentially leading to vegetation shifts. Because most of these changes pointed towards a loss of dominance of Q. suber, management strategies are urgently needed in order to attenuate adult mortality or promote its regeneration, counteracting the negative effects of global change drivers (exotic pathogens, climate change) on these valuable forests." .

To investigate this, we grew 2-year-old saplings of three Betulaceae species (Betula platyphylla var. japonica Hara, Betula maximowicziana Regel, and Alnus hirsuta Turcz) for 2 years in a free air CO2 enrichment system in northern Japan. Since the effect of high [CO2] is known to depend on soil conditions, we evaluated the responses in two soils which are widely distributed in northern Japan: infertile and immature volcanic ash (VA) soil, and fertile brown forest (BF) soil. For B. platyphylla, photosynthetic down-regulation occurred in both soils, but for B. maximowicziana, down-regulation occurred only in VA soil. The explanation is reduced nitrogen and Rubisco content in the leaf. For A. hirsuta, down-regulation occurred only in BF soil because of the accumulation of starch in foliage, which restricts CO2 diffusion inside the chloroplast. The higher photosynthetic rate of A. hirsuta in infertile VA soil could be due to the sink for photosynthates in the N2-fixing symbiont. These three species are all able to down-regulate at high [CO2]. However, it is possible that A. hirsuta would dominate in VA soil and B. maximowicziana in BF soil in the early stages of forest succession in a CO2-enhanced world." .

It also has a major impact on site productivity, spatial arrangement of vegetation structure as well as forest succession. This paper presents a methodology to estimate variations in solar radiation reaching tree stands in a small mountain valley. Measurements taken in three inter-forest meadows unambiguously showed the relationship between the amount of solar insolation and the shading effect caused mainly by the contour of surrounding tree stands. Therefore, appropriate knowledge of elevation, aspect and tilt angles of the analysed planes had to be taken into consideration during modelling. At critical times, especially in winter, the diffuse and reflected components of solar radiation only reached some of the sites studied as the beam component of solar radiation was totally blocked by the densely forested mountain slopes in the neighbourhood. The cross-section contours and elevation angles of all obstructions are estimated from a digital surface model including both digital elevation model and the height of tree stands. All the parameters in a simplified, empirical model of the solar insolation reaching a given horizontal surface within the research valley are dependent on the sky view factor (SVF). The presented simplified, empirical model and its parameterisation scheme should be easily adaptable to different complex terrains or mountain valleys characterised by diverse geometry or spatial orientation. The model was developed and validated (R 2 = 0.92 , σ = 0.54) based on measurements taken at research sites located in the Silesian Beskid Mountain Range. A thorough understanding of the factors determining the amount of solar radiation reaching woodlands ought to considerably expand the knowledge of the water exchange balance within forest complexes as well as the estimation of site productivity." .

To elucidate how atmospheric CO2 enrichment, enhanced nutrient supply and soil quality interact to affect regrowth of temperate forests, young Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies trees were grown together in large model ecosystems. Identical communities were established on a nutrient-poor acidic and on a more fertile calcareous soil and tree growth, leaf area index, fine root density and soil respiration monitored over four complete growing seasons. Biomass responses to CO2 enrichment and enhanced N supply at the end of the experiment reflected compound interest effects of growth stimulation during the first two to three seasons rather than persistent stimulation over the whole duration of the experiment. Whereas biomass of Picea was enhanced in elevated CO2 on both soils, Fagus responded negatively to CO2 on acidic but positively on calcareous soil. Biomass of both species profited from enhanced N supply on the poor acidic soil only. Leaf area index on both soils was greater in high N supply as a consequence of a stimulation early in the experiment, but was unaffected by CO2 enrichment. Fine root density on acidic soil was increased in high N supply, but this did not stimulate soil respiration rate. In contrast, elevated CO2 stimulated both fine root density and soil CO2 efflux on calcareous soil, especially towards the end of the experiment. Our experiment suggests that future species dominance in beech-spruce forests is likely to change in response to CO2 enrichment, but this response is subject to complex interactions with environmental factors other than CO2, particularly soil type." .

Using a long-term data set on the colonization of a forest plantation, we tested the hypothesis that bird species tolerant to habitat fragmentation would detect and colonize the new habitat faster than intolerant species. The forest plantation under study is situated on an area of land reclaimed from the sea (a polder) in the central part of The Netherlands. We constructed an index of tolerance to habitat fragmentation and included it as a predictor variable in a set of three logistic regression models that compared the probability of colonization over four consecutive time periods. After controlling statistically for the effects of regional incidence, preferred habitat and life-history characteristics, there was a significant effect of tolerance to fragmentation on the ability of species to colonize the plantation, and a marginal effect on the timing of colonization. We then examined the effect of the same index of tolerance to fragmentation on colonization patterns over a larger spatial scale. Multivariate regression models showed that the proportion of three polders of different ages occupied by forest bird species was dependent upon the regional incidence of a species, its preferred habitat and its tolerance to fragmentation. The results support the hypothesis that species tolerant to habitat fragmentation detect and colonize new habitat faster than those intolerant to habitat fragmentation." .

AbstractOver the last several decades, riparian forests in Northwest China have been extremely vulnerable to the increasing pressures from human activity and climate change. However, it is unclear how forests correlate with these influences over time and on a wide scale. In the present study, we developed 28 tree-ring chronologies of Populus euphratica in the Ejina Oasis, in the lower reaches of Northwestern China’s Heihe River, to evaluate the oasis-scale riparian forest growth variation and its correlation with the runoff regulation. We identified three hydrologic periods using regime-shift analysis: a natural runoff period from 1954 to 1989, when the oasis was sustained by natural river flows; a degradation period from 1990 to 2002, when excessive upstream withdrawals of runoff decreased flows to the oasis; and a recovery period, from 2003 to 2010, when water allocation projects restored flows. In general, stem radial growth of poplar trees in the oasis showed decreasing and increasing trends in the degradation period and recovery period, respectively, with high spatial heterogeneity in each period. Our analysis of the relationship between the chronologies and corresponding hydrologic and climatic data revealed that the runoff-recharged hyporheic groundwater depth was the major factor that limited tree stem radial growth. Thus, it is important to allocate water between the middle and lower reaches, and inside the lower reaches, to mitigate or prevent the adverse effects of low runoff. Our study also demonstrates that researchers must carefully consider the high spatial heterogeneity during dendrochronological research in an arid riparian forest." .

Nighttime respiration was between 0.5 and 1.5 kg C ha−1 h−1, increasing with temperature. Net uptake of carbon during the day peaked at 3 kg C ha−1 h−1, and the daily net uptake over the experiment was 12 kg C ha−1 day−1. Photosynthesis dropped substantially at leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) greater than 7 mb, presumably as a result of stomatal closure. The response of ecosystem photosynthesis to incident PPFD was markedly non-linear, with an abrupt saturation at 600 μmol m−2 s−1. This sharp saturation reflected the geometry of the spruce canopy (isolated conical crowns), the frequently overcast conditions, and an increase in VPD coincident with high radiation. The ecosystem light-use efficiency increased markedly during overcast periods as a result of a more even distribution of light across the forest surface. A mechanistic model of forest photosynthesis, parameterized with observations of leaf density and nitrogen content from a nearby stand, provided accurate predictions of forest photosynthesis. The observations and model results indicated that ecosystem carbon balance at the site is highly sensitive to temperature, and relatively insensitive to cloudiness." .

Fires set in motion plant succession, potentially leading to an increase in snowshoe hares (Grange, 1965). Snowfall is also correlated with the lynx cycle and tends to account for the variation not accounted for by fires. I conclude that Grange's (1949, 1965) hypothesis that fire and plant succession drive the snowshoe hare cycle deserves serious consideration, as do Butler's (1962) and Watt's (1968, 1973) suggestions that precipitation may drive or decisively modify furbearer ‘cycles’. On this evidence, the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle seems likely to be a forced oscillation rather than a predator-prey, parasitehost, or herbivore-vegetation limit cycle, as proposed by several authors. Fire clearly appear to be a periodic phenomenon, not-withstanding the difficulty of showing periodicity in simple weather time series. Fire is itself a meteorological phenomenon, although complexly related to simple weather variables." .

Within a forest, disturbance events can greatly impact C cycling and subsequently influence the exchange of CO2 between forests and the atmosphere. This connection makes understanding the forest C cycle response to disturbance imperative for climate change research. The goal of this study was to examine the temporal response of soil respiration after differing levels of stand disturbance for 3 years at the Black Rock Forest (southeastern NY, USA; oaks comprise 67 % of the stand). Tree girdling was used to mimic pathogen attack and create the following treatments: control, girdling all non-oaks (NOG), girdling half of the oak trees (O50), and girdling all the oaks (OG). Soil respiratory rates on OG plots declined for 2 years following girdling before attaining a full rebound of belowground activity in the third year. Soil respiration on NOG and O50 were statistically similar to the control for the duration of the study although a trend for a stronger decline in respiration on O50 relative to NOG occurred in the first 2 years. Respiratory responses among the various treatments were not proportional to the degree of disturbance and varied over time. The short-lived respiratory response on O50 and OG suggests that belowground activity is resilient to disturbance; however, sources of the recovered respiratory flux on these plots are likely different than they were pre-treatment. The differential taxon response between oaks and non-oaks suggests that after a defoliation or girdling event, the temporal response of the soil respiratory flux may be related to the C allocation pattern of the affected plant group." .

However, climate sensitivity of broad-leaved lowland tropical trees is poorly understood. Dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) provides a powerful tool to study the relationship between tropical tree growth and annual climate variability. We aimed to establish climate–growth relationships for five annual-ring forming tree species, using ring-width data from 459 canopy and understory trees from a seasonal tropical forest in western Thailand. Based on 183/459 trees, chronologies with total lengths between 29 and 62 years were produced for four out of five species. Bootstrapped correlation analysis revealed that climate–growth responses were similar among these four species. Growth was significantly negatively correlated with current-year maximum and minimum temperatures, and positively correlated with dry-season precipitation levels. Negative correlations between growth and temperature may be attributed to a positive relationship between temperature and autotrophic respiration rates. The positive relationship between growth and dry-season precipitation levels likely reflects the strong water demand during leaf flush. Mixed-effect models yielded results that were consistent across species: a negative effect of current wet-season maximum temperatures on growth, but also additive positive effects of, for example, prior dry-season maximum temperatures. Our analyses showed that annual growth variability in tropical trees is determined by a combination of both temperature and precipitation variability. With rising temperature, the predominantly negative relationship between temperature and growth may imply decreasing growth rates of tropical trees as a result of global warming." .

For testing whether species richness increases below-ground biomass and production and thus complementarity between forest tree species in young stands, we determined fine root biomass and production of trees and ground vegetation in two experimental plantations representing gradients in tree species richness. Additionally, we measured tree fine root length and determined species composition from fine root biomass samples with the near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy method. We did not observe higher biomass or production in mixed stands compared to monocultures. Neither did we observe any differences in tree root length or fine root turnover. One reason for this could be that these stands were still young, and canopy closure had not always taken place, i.e. a situation where above- or below-ground competition did not yet exist. Another reason could be that the rooting traits of the tree species did not differ sufficiently to support niche differentiation. Our results suggested that functional group identity (i.e. conifers vs. broadleaved species) can be more important for below-ground biomass and production than the species richness itself, as conifers seemed to be more competitive in colonising the soil volume, compared to broadleaved species." .

In addition, we assessed uncertainties associated with the NPP projection at the grid and state levels. Climate data of the scenarios were derived from Community Climate System Model outputs. Changes in annual NPP between 2000 and 2050 were projected with the forest ecosystem model PnET-II. Results showed that forest productivity would increase under climate change scenarios A1B and A2, but with scenario B1, it would peak during 2011–2020 and then decline. The projected average NPP under B1 over the years from 2000 to 2050 was significantly different from those under A1B and A2. Forest NPP appeared to be primarily a function of temperature, not precipitation. Uncertainties of the NPP projection were due to large spatial resolution of the climate variables. Overall, this study suggested that in order to project effects of climate change on forest ecosystem at regional level, modeling uncertainties could be reduced by increasing the spatial resolution of the climate projections." .

We studied the seedling survivorship and morphological features of two tree species that play important roles in maintaining the ground-surface dynamics of a peat swamp forest in Sumatra. Large Swintonia glauca trees form mounds, whereas large Stemonurus scorpioides trees occupy non-mounds. We monitored the demography of naturally dispersed Swintonia and Stemonurus seedlings that germinated in 2000. Survivorship of Swintonia seedlings was high under conditions of late germination, high-light environment, and elevated ground surface, and was negatively affected by distance to the nearest conspecific adult. Survivorship of Stemonurus was high under conditions of early germination and high conspecific seedling density, and was also negatively affected by distance to the nearest conspecific adult. The allometric features of Stemonurus seedlings indicated characteristics of stress tolerance, that is, low growth rate and thick, porous roots. Stemonurus, which has large wingless seeds, regenerated in non-mounds around the parental trees, while winged Swintonia seeds dispersed farther from the parent and established in patchily distributed gaps and mounds. Thus, Swintonia seedlings can survive on non-mound sites within gaps and possibly create mounds, while Stemonurus seedlings tend to maintain non-mounds around the parental trees." .

This paper reviews research on leakage at the large (international and national) and small (subnational and project) scales to summarize what we already know, and highlight areas where research is urgently needed. Most (11 of 15) studies published until 2005 estimated leakage of fossil-fuel-based emissions from large-scale interventions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol. Many studies on leakage from landuse-based emissions more relevant for REDD+ emerged afterwards (11 of 15), mostly focusing on smaller-scale interventions (8 of the 11 studies). There is a deficiency in qualitative studies showing how leakage develops from an intervention, and the factors influencing this process. In–depth empirical research is needed to understand activities and actors causing emissions (Emissions), the way those activities move spatially in response to policies (Displacement), the way policies affect carbon (C) emitting activities (Attribution) and the amount of resulting emissions produced (Quantification). The cart is thence before the horse: the knowledge necessary to form practical and accurate working definitions, typologies and characterizations of leakage is still absent. Despite this, there is a rush to measure, monitor and mitigate leakage. The concept of leakage has not matured enough, leading to vague definitions of leakage, its components, and scale. We suggest ways to improve the concept of leakage and argue for more empirical research and at various scales to add to our collective knowledge of Emissions, Displacement, Attribution and Quantification." .

Seedlings of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) were planted in the plots and harvested at the end of the first and second growing seasons. Litter manipulation had no effect on total mycorrhizal colonization, but the distribution of Cenococcum geophilum mycorrhizae was altered. After the first year, percent mycorrhizal colonization of hemlocks not in Rm thickets (62%) was at least three times higher than in Rm thickets (19%), and the ramification index (no. of mycorrhizae cm–1) had increased by more than a factor of four (2.83 versus 0.61).

Soil respiration, i.e. respiration by mycorrhizal roots and by heterotrophic organisms decomposing above- and below-ground litters, is a major component in ecosystem carbon (C) balances. For decades, the paradigm has been that the biomass of fine roots of trees turns over several times a year, which together with large inputs of above-ground litter leaves little room for the contribution from root respiration. Here, we combine the results of a recent tree girdling experiment with the C budget of the classic Swedish Coniferous Forest (SWECON) project, in which root growth and turnover were estimated to be high. We observe that such a high rate of root turnover requires an unlikely high C use efficiency for root growth, and is not consistent with the 1:1 relation between root: heterotrophic respiration obtained in the girdling experiment. Our analysis suggests that 75% of the C allocated to roots is respired, while 25% is used for growth, and hence that root growth and turnover were grossly overestimated in the SWECON study." .

A proposed model precisely predicts crown width of Scots pine. AbstractCrown size is significantly correlated with growth and biomass of other parts of a tree, and therefore crown measures are used as predictors to develop tree growth and biomass models. We modelled crown width–diameter at breast height (DBH) allometry using data from permanent sample plots located in both monospecific and mixed species stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in various parts of the Czech Republic. Among various predictors evaluated, dominant height (HDOM), height-to-DBH ratio (HDR—also known as a tree slenderness coefficient), height to live crown base (HCB), relative spacing index (RS), and basal area proportion of a species of interest (BAPOR) significantly contributed to the variations in the crown width–DBH allometry. The sample plot-level random effect parameters, which account for stand heterogeneity and randomness caused by various stochastic factors, were included through the mixed-effects modelling approach. Heteroskedasticity in the residuals was reduced through the integration of a power variance function with DBH as an independent variable. Both mixed-effects model and ordinary least square (OLS) model described more than two-thirds of the total variations in the crown width–DBH allometry with no significant trend in the residuals. The model showed that crown width increased with increasing site quality (increasing HDOM) and relative spacing index (increasing RS), and decreasing species mixture per sample plot (increasing BAPOR). However, crown width decreased with increasing tree slenderness coefficient (increasing HDR) and height to live crown base (increasing HCB). Model validation by splitting data also confirmed a high precision of the model, because it described most of the variations in the crown width–DBH allometry with no significant trend in the prediction errors. Because of more attractive fit statistics and higher prediction accuracy than that of the OLS model, the mixed-effects model with the random effect parameters estimated from crown width measurements of a sub-sample of four randomly selected Scots pine trees per sample plot is suggested for application. Application of the crown width model may have various implications that are briefly mentioned in the article." .

We examine an alternative method involving the conversion of Pinus thunbergii forests to native broadleaf species through advancing their growth, but we have little knowledge about the response of advanced growth to overhead canopy release. To demonstrate the demographic and height growth response of advanced growth to the light change in a coastal Pinus thunbergii forest, canopy trees were removed and the sapling populations were monitored for 6 years. Inhibition in height growth caused by light increase was observed in Cerasus sargentii and Kalopanax septemlobus saplings. Especially in Kalopanax septemlobus, a remarkable decline was observed in the saplings growing in the darker positions which experienced light change. Therefore, large light changes should be carefully avoided for this species especially in the darker positions. In contrast, relative height growth rates of Quercus crispula and, especially, Quercus dentata increased with increasing light, and saplings tended to die in the darker positions. No dead trees of Sorbus commixta were observed during the study period. The saplings also showed good height growth even when under closed canopy. This species seems to be adaptive to a dark environment. Since Quercus dentata and Kalopanax septemlobus are the major components of the natural coastal forests in Hokkaido, gradual canopy release is available to foster advanced growth in coastal Pinus thunbergii forest, in accordance with the concept of density control in coastal forests." .

We used expert opinion to derive the links between coarse-scaled UK National Ecosystem Assessment scenarios and forest management alternatives (FMA) in a simulation of forest planning and management under climate change uncertainty. Nine indicators were used to compare the provision of forest ecosystem services from four alternative management trajectories based on FMA types under a changing climate. These show that by 2080 a ‘business as usual’ form of forest management at both Clocaenog and Gwydyr forests will become unsuitable under the two warmest and driest climate variants, marginal under four variants, and borderline suitable under the remaining five variants. This implies that if future forest policy requires the continued delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services, including, home grown timber, biodiversity, and the carbon mitigation benefit from woodlands, then there is 20–50 % chance of failing to deliver on some of these services, unless some adaptation measures to climatic impacts occurs, such as transformation to more diverse species forests managed using low-impact silviculture systems. We show that the benefits of achieving this will be to minimise most of the impacts that climate change would otherwise have on the delivery of ecosystem services from forests." .

Those analyses were complemented by wood anatomical studies on regularly collected microcores to determine the season of active cambial growth and the time of formation of annual growth boundaries. The length of the cambial active period varied between 3 and 7 months at the tropical lower montane forest and 2 and 4 months in the dry forest, respectively. During dry days, amplitudes of daily stem diameter variations correlated with vapour pressure deficit. During October and November, inter-annual climate variations may lead to dry and sunny conditions in the tropical lower montane forest, causing water deficit and stem diameter shrinkage in T. chrysantha. The results of the climate–growth analysis show a positive relationship between tree growth and rainfall as well as vapour pressure deficit in certain periods of the year, indicating that rainfall plays a major role for tree growth." .

Xylem water potential (Ψx), leaf relative water content (RWC; % turgid weight), and xylem specific conductivity (K S; kg s−1 m−1 MPa−1) of sprouts were measured on two occasions during the dry season. In addition, K S of seedlings (<1 year old) of one deciduous and one evergreen species was determined to allow comparison with sprouts. Ψx of deciduous species was significantly higher at the second sampling date and was accompanied by a significant increase in K S and RWC, while the brevi-deciduous and evergreen species did not show any difference in Ψx. Seedlings of Terminalia crenulata (deciduous) and Ixora parviflora (evergreen) had significantly lower K S compared to sprouts, while seedlings of all four deciduous species shed their leaves much earlier in the dry season than did conspecific sprouts. More favorable water relations of sprouts compared to seedlings during the peak of the dry season may explain the lower rates of die-back and mortality of sprouts observed in dry deciduous forests of India." .

Forst.) Oerst. trees are currently being replaced by plantations with Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco. This land use change is controversial because the region is prone to drought, and replacement of native vegetation by planted forests may increase vegetation water use. The goal of this study was to examine the physiological differences, especially the response of water flux and canopy conductance to microclimate, that lead to greater water use by exotic trees compared to native trees. Meteorological variables and sapflow density of P. menziesii and four native woody species were measured in the growing season 2005–2006. Canopy conductance (gc) was estimated for both the exotic (monoculture) and native (multi-species) systems, including the individual contributions of each species of the native forest. Sapflow density, stand-level transpiration and gc were related to leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference (VPD). All native species had different magnitudes and diurnal patterns of sapflow density compared to P. menziesii, which could be explained by the different gc responses to VPD. Stomatal sensitivity to VPD suggested that all native species have a stronger stomatal control of leaf water potential and transpiration due to hydraulic limitations compared to P. menziesii. In conclusion, differences in water use between a P. menziesii plantation and a contiguous native mixed forest of similar basal area could be explained by different gc responses to VPD between species (higher sensitivity in the native species), in addition to particular characteristics of the native forest structure." .

Information on associated changes in leaf gas exchange and other leaf traits can be valuable for modelling biogeochemical fluxes under altered land-use patterns. We studied in situ photosynthetic parameters and stomatal conductance for water vapour in eight abundant tree species of young secondary forest and eight tree species of natural old-growth forest in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. In sun leaves, the average maximal stomatal conductance (g smax) in the secondary forest (SF) species was 2.1 times higher than in the old-growth forest (OGF) species. Species with a high g smax reduced g s sharply when vapour pressure deficit of the air increased, whereas species with a low g smax were much less sensitive to air humidity. For area-based photosynthetic capacity (A max-area), the SF species had a 2.3 times higher average than the OGF species. For both, g smax and A max-area the variation among species was higher in the OGF than in the SF. When all tree species (n=16) are considered, species means of specific leaf area (SLA), leaf N concentration and leaf P concentration were significantly correlated with g smax and A max-area. The strong correlation between A max-area and foliar P (r 2=0.8) is remarkable as the alluvial soils in the study region are rich in nutrients. If the eight OGF species are analysed separately, the only significant correlation was observed between SLA and mass-based A max; in the SF species strong correlations were found between leaf size and A max-area and g smax. These results show that the conversion of old-growth forest to young secondary forest in Sulawesi significantly alters tree leaf gas exchange characteristics and that chemical and structural leaf traits can be used for the prediction of these changes. The best correlations between leaf gas exchange parameters and leaf traits were obtained by different traits in the SF species, the OGF species and the entire pool of studied species." .

But the closed forests of India have registered a fall from 36.02 million ha to around 33 million ha. The latter fact is both significant and disturbing. It proves that in spite of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, the process of degeneration of forests, in India, constantly continues. It is obvious that a part of the open forests must have come from closed forests due to the reckless denudation of forests, carried out in the name of development. A massive afforestation/reforestation programme is desired to achieve the target of one third of the geographical area of the country to be under forest cover for proper ecological balance. India has to develop a sound National Forest Policy to meet the requirements of the country, to produce industrial wood, for forest based industries, defence, communication and other public purposes, and small timbers fuel wood and fodder for the rural community. In this context the decision taken by the Control Board of Forestry in December, 1987, is quite encouraging. It was resolved that the extraction of wood from the forests would be stopped and the country's need for timber and fuelwood would be met by importing wood and by means of farm forestry. The reconstitution of the National Wasteland Development Board and the planting target of 5 million ha p.a. are other positive steps in this direction. Extensive research is needed for a better and new approach to social and commercial forestry." .

Seedlings were collected on a monthly basis at either a VAM-dominated chaparral scrub site or an EM-dominated forest site, both of which were burned. In both vegetation types, fully developed EM were observed from the third month after germination. EM fungi observed on the seedlings from the scrub site were limited to Rhizopogon subcaerulescens, R. ochraceorubens and Suillus pungens. Seedlings from the forest were colonized by a greater variety of EM fungi including Amanita spp., Russula brevipes and a member of the Cantharellaceae. VAM structures (vesicles, arbuscules or hyphal coils) were observed in the seedling root systems beginning 1 month after germination at the scrub site and 3 months after germination at the forest site. Seedlings from the scrub site consistently had more frequent VAM fungal colonization than those from the forest site through the fifth month after germination. DS fungi were observed in most seedlings from both the scrub and forest sites beginning in the first month post-germination. We propose that these fungi survived as a resident inoculum in the soils and did not disperse into the sites after the fire." .

The ECM communities in four plots of each forest type were described, from five soil cores collected in each plot, by morphotyping, internal transcribed spacer (ITS)–restriction fragment length polymorphism matching of mycorrhizas and sporocarps and ITS sequencing. Fifty-one distinct taxa were distinguished; 25 were identified to species level, 11 to genus and 15 remained unidentified. Seventy-one ECM species were recorded as sporocarps from the forest plots; most (43 species) were found in the Sitka spruce plots. The below-ground ECM communities of the different forest types did not differ significantly with respect to species richness of taxa on roots, but differed in species composition. Multivariate analysis produced a clear separation of the communities of the different forest types using below-ground data, but the above-ground sporocarp data did not separate the forest types. Moreover, results of a Mantel test found no relationship between the above- and below-ground similarity matrices. The oak plots had the most distinctive ECM community, with Laccaria amethystina and Elaphomyces granulatus being frequent. The Sitka spruce plots showed the lowest intra-forest type similarity and were often dominated by “nursery type” ectomycorrhizas. There was only 10% similarity between the above- and below-ground ECM species in these plots, different colonisation methods of ectomycorrhizal taxa and insufficient below-ground sampling being possible reasons for this disparity. Our results indicate that plantations of non-native Sitka spruce can support similar levels of ECM diversity as native forests." .

The objective of this study was to examine relationships among ECM fungal community measures, local soil nutrients, and stand age along a chronosequence of mixed forest stands that were similar in vegetation composition and site quality. Six combinations of age class (5-, 26-, 65-, and 100-year-old) and stand initiation type (wildfire and clearcut) were replicated on four sites, each representing critical seral stages of stand development in Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICH) forests of southern British Columbia. We found significant relationships between ECM fungal diversity and both available and organic P; available P was also positively correlated with the abundance of two ECM taxa (Rhizopogon vinicolor group and Cenoccocum geophilum). By contrast, ECM fungal diversity varied unpredictably with total and mineralizable N or C to N ratio. We also found that soil C, N, available P, and forest floor depth did not exhibit strong patterns across stand ages. Overall, ECM fungal community structure was more strongly influenced by stand age than specific soil nutrients, but better correlations with soil nutrients may occur at broader spatial scales covering a wider range of site qualities." .

A total of 1,006 soil samples were taken in ten forest stands (five Scots pine stands and five Norway spruce stands). Our results indicate that the spatial autocorrelation disappears at a distance of 75–225 cm. This spatial autocorrelation should be taken into account in the sampling design by locating the sampling points at adequate intervals. With a sample size of over 20–30 samples per site, additional soil samples do not notably improve the precision of the site mean estimate. An adequate sample size is dependent on the purpose of sampling and on the site-specific soil variation. Our results on the dependence between sample size and precision of the mean estimates can be applied in designing efficient soil monitoring in boreal coniferous forests." .

Twenty-one streams or valleys were selected considering watersheds and climate regions of four major rivers in South Korea. The study surveyed mature structures and growth environments of the forests typical of the study streams in 122 sample plots. Forest communities associated with environmental gradients from floodplains to uplands were typified based on importance values of woody plant species and classification criteria of forest types in the country. The riparian forests were classified into 6–12 community types for each river watershed. The majority of dominant community tree species were distributed widely over the study streams, but some tree species were dominant in community types found in warmer regions only. This study presented planning models for restoring riparian greenways that reflect the distinct structural characteristics of the native community types. The planning models included species selection and composition, density and distance, and soil properties for tree plantings by community type, as well as a minimum width for riparian greenways. The models emphasized highly diverse ecological planting to enhance the multiple functions of riparian greenways, and establish native landscapes earlier through direct tree plantings rather than natural succession. A case study greenway was designed and planted to illustrate application of the planning model." .

Here, we examined the effects of seed size and light availability on seedling growth and survival, and whether such effects were mediated by water use efficiency. Acorns of Quercus petraea and the more drought-tolerant Quercus pyrenaica were sowed within and around a tree canopy gap in a sub-Mediterranean forest stand. We monitored seedling emergence and measured predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd), leaf nitrogen per unit area (Na), leaf mass per area, leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13C) and plant growth at the end of the first summer. Survival was measured on the next year. Path analysis revealed a consistent pattern in both species of higher δ13C as Ψpd decreased and higher δ13C as seedlings emerged later in the season, indicating an increase in 13C as the growing season is shorter and drier. There was a direct positive effect of seed size on δ13C in Q. petraea that was absent in Q. pyrenaica. Leaf δ13C had no effect on growth but the probability of surviving until the second year was higher for those seedlings of Q. pyrenaica that had lower δ13C on the first year. In conclusion, leaf δ13C is affected by seed size, seedling emergence time and the availability of light and water, however, leaf δ13C is irrelevant for first year growth, which is directly dependent on the amount of seed reserves." .

Nine species exhibited CO2 response curves typical of C4 plants, but differed markedly in photosynthetic capacity. Light-saturated CO2 uptake rates ranged from 48 to 52 μmol m-2 s-1 in arid habitat species to 18 to 20 μmol m-2 s-1 in mesic and wet forest species. Two possessed unusual CO2 response curves in which photosynthesis was not saturated above intercellular CO2 pressures [p(CO2)] of 10 to 15 Pa, as typically occurs in C4 plants. Both leaf (g′1) and mesophyll (g′m) conductances to CO2 varied widely between species. At an atmospheric p(CO2) of 32 Pa, g′1 regulated intercellular p(CO2) at 12–15 Pa in most species, which supported nearly maximum CO2 uptake rates, but did not result in excessive transpiration. Intercellular p(CO2) was higher in the two species with unusual CO2 response curves. This was especially apparent in E. remyi, which is native to a bog habitat. The regulation of g′1 and intercellular p(CO2) yielded high photosynthetic water use efficiencies (P/E) in the species with typical CO2 response curves, whereas P/E was much lower in E. remyi. Photosynthetic capacity was closely related to leaf nitrogen content, whereas correlations with leaf morphological characteristics and leaf cell surface area were not significant. Thus, differences in photosynthetic capacity may be determined primarily by investment in the biochemical components of the photosynthetic apparatus rather than by differences in diffusion limitations. The lower photosynthetic capacities in the wet habitat species may reflect the lower light availability. However, other factors, such as reduced nutrient availability, may also be important." .

Our results also indicate one long-range transport episode from remote sources in Poland and Germany.

AbstractGap-model thinning (GT) is an effective management technique to improve the productivity of dense monoculture plantation. However, how GT intensity influence inter- and intra-annual radial growth of the gap-edge trees remains an open question. In order to explore this question, we implemented an experiment with four treatments (control and gap sizes of 74, 109, and 196 m2) in a 30-year-old spruce (Picea asperata) plantation in 2008. We used dendrochronological method to explore dynamic of the basal area increment (BAI) of gap-edge trees (n = 127) from 2009 to 2012 after GT treatments. We found that effects of GT on the BAI of gap-edge trees highly depended on GT intensity and their crown classes. The large gaps significantly increased the BAI of gap-edge trees and further the latewood growth responded more sensitively than the earlywood, whereas the influences of the small and intermediate gaps were weak; the large gaps effectively improved the BAI of the dominant trees, following by the intermediate, but not for the suppressed trees. Our results also displayed that the earlywood increment was strongly related to the soil temperature in spring and the latewood formation was influenced by the photosynthetically active radiation in autumn. It was eventually concluded that dynamic radial growth of gap-edge trees were driven by the improved microclimate caused by GT and their abilities in competing and utilizing resources. The present study highlights the importance of setting appropriate GT intensity and choosing the felled trees in GT operation." .

We regarded the planted forests that had undergone silvicultural practices such as weeding, pruning, and thinning since 1990 as Article-3.4 planted forests in accordance with the definition given by the Forestry Agency of Japan. Regression models were developed to predict the forest areas that had undergone silvicultural practices, employing silvicultural subsidies and forest workers' wages as predictor variables. Then the time series changes in the predictor variables were provided by extending their recent trends, with the result being that the forest areas that have undergone silvicultural practices were predicted on the basis of the three scenarios of the variables. Thus, the Article-3.4 forest area was calculated considering overlaps of silvicultural practices over fixed stands, and the area was converted into the amount of carbon sequestration by multiplying it by coefficients such as a volume table, biomass expansion factor, and others. The result implied that Article-3.4 private planted forests were expected to sequester 8.16–8.87 Mt-C year−1 during the first commitment period. These amounts cover 63%–68% of the carbon sequestration goal by land-use change and forestry activities capped under the Marrakesh Accords. To realize this prediction, it is important to provide a sufficient silvicultural subsidy to last until the end of the first commitment period and to implement silvicultural practices on the forest stands that have not undergone such practices since 1990." .

Examples of cross-scale pattern-process relationships and interactions among forest dieback, fire, and erosion are illustrated from northern New Mexico (USA) landscapes, where long-term studies have recently documented all of these disturbance processes. For example, environmental stress, operating on individual trees, can cause tree death that is amplified by insect mortality agents to propagate to patch and then landscape or even regional-scale forest dieback. Severe drought and unusual warmth in the southwestern USA since the late 1990s apparently exceeded species-specific physiological thresholds for multiple tree species, resulting in substantial vegetation mortality across millions of hectares of woodlands and forests in recent years. Predictions of forest dieback across spatial scales are constrained by uncertainties associated with: limited knowledge of species-specific physiological thresholds; individual and site-specific variation in these mortality thresholds; and positive feedback loops between rapidly-responding insect herbivore populations and their stressed plant hosts, sometimes resulting in nonlinear “pest” outbreak dynamics. Fire behavior also exhibits nonlinearities across spatial scales, illustrated by changes in historic fire regimes where patch-scale grazing disturbance led to regional-scale collapse of surface fire activity and subsequent recent increases in the scale of extreme fire events in New Mexico. Vegetation dieback interacts with fire activity by modifying fuel amounts and configurations at multiple spatial scales. Runoff and erosion processes are also subject to scale-dependent threshold behaviors, exemplified by ecohydrological work in semiarid New Mexico watersheds showing how declines in ground surface cover lead to non-linear increases in bare patch connectivity and thereby accelerated runoff and erosion at hillslope and watershed scales. Vegetation dieback, grazing, and fire can change land surface properties and cross-scale hydrologic connectivities, directly altering ecohydrological patterns of runoff and erosion. The interactions among disturbance processes across spatial scales can be key drivers in ecosystem dynamics, as illustrated by these studies of recent landscape changes in northern New Mexico. To better anticipate and mitigate accelerating human impacts to the planetary ecosystem at all spatial scales, improvements are needed in our conceptual and quantitative understanding of cross-scale interactions among disturbance processes." .

During this period, the farmer does not know whether his management is promoting black truffle development. To study the presence and abundance of T. melanosporum ectomycorrhizas in plantations, two sampling methods, direct sampling of root tips and soil core collection, are compared by analyzing 48 evergreen oak trees (Quercus ilex) inoculated with truffle. Those trees are grouped by age (<6, 6–9, >9 years old) and presence or absence of truffle production. T. melanosporum was present in 46 out of the 48 studied trees, and its ectomycorrhizas appeared in 65 % of the ectomycorrhizal tips. Its abundance is significantly higher with productive trees and young trees. Direct sampling of root tips and soil core collection were equally effective in detecting this species, although soil core collection proved a better method to also evaluate ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity. To detect the presence of T. melanosporum in a given plantation, three samples suffice, with a single sample per random tree. Although the presence of mycorrhizas is not a sure sign of the future success of a black truffle plantation, its absence influences managers as to whether to continue culturing truffles in a plantation." .

As empirical examination of DDW C net flux has rarely been conducted across large scales, the goal of this study was to use a remeasured inventory of DDW C and ancillary forest attributes to assess C net flux across forests of the Eastern US. Stocks associated with large fine woody debris (diameter 2.6–7.6 cm) decreased over time (−0.11 Mg ha−1 year−1), while stocks of larger-sized coarse DDW increased (0.02 Mg ha−1 year−1). Stocks of total DDW C decreased (−0.14 Mg ha−1 year−1), while standing dead and live tree stocks both increased, 0.01 and 0.44 Mg ha−1 year−1, respectively. The spatial distribution of DDW C stock change was highly heterogeneous with random forests model results indicating that management history, live tree stocking, natural disturbance, and growing degree days only partially explain stock change. Natural disturbances drove substantial C transfers from the live tree pool (≈−4 Mg ha−1 year−1) to the standing dead tree pool (≈3 Mg ha−1 year−1) with only a minimal increase in DDW C stocks (≈1 Mg ha−1 year−1) in lower decay classes, suggesting a delayed transfer of C to the DDW pool. The assessment and management of DDW C flux is complicated by the diversity of natural and anthropogenic forces that drive their dynamics with the scale and timing of flux among forest C pools remaining a large knowledge gap." .

The trees possessed a large proportion of heartwood, on average 60% of the wood cross-sectional surface. Spacing was a statistically significant source of variation of heartwood area, which ranged between 99 and 206 cm2 for the closer (3 × 2) and wider (4 × 5) spacings, respectively. There was a positive and high statistical significant correlation between heartwood diameter and tree diameter (heartwood diameter = −0.272 + 0.616 dbh; r 2 = 0.77; P < 0.001), and larger trees contained more heartwood regardless of spacing. Heartwood proportion in cross-section remained practically constant between spacings but increased with tree diameter class: 55.1, 62.2, 65.0 and 69.5% for diameter at breast height classes <15, 15–20, 20–25 and >25 cm, respectively. The sapwood width did not depend on tree diameter growth and remained practically constant at an average of 18 mm (range 15–21 mm), but sapwood area showed a good linear regression with tree diameter. Therefore, tree growth enhancement factors, such as wide spacings, will induce formation of larger heartwoods that can negatively impact raw-material quality for pulping. The increase in heartwood in relation with tree dimensions should therefore be taken into account when designing forest management guidelines." .

Pines on 50% of all plots were released from woody and herbaceous competition within a 61 cm radius of each tree stem. Woody competition was controlled by hand cutting for 5 consecutive years and herbaceous competition was controlled with herbicides (sulfometuron methyl and glyphosate) for 4 consecutive years. Competition control increased 5-year survival by 21–23% for natural and planted seedlings, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the two regeneration techniques. Five years after field establishment, planted pines averaged 85% more volume than naturally established pines. Nevertheless, greater volume gains (551–688%) were achieved within regeneration techniques, as a result of competition control, than were achieved between the two regeneration techniques." .

A total of 39 species in 13 genera of ECM fungi were recorded, with more species in the Russulaceae than any other family. Russula ochroleuca, Russula sp.1 and Strobilomyces confusus tended to produce their fruitbodies on the forest floor directly under the crown of A. firma, whereas those of Inocybe cincinnata, Gomphus floccosus and G. fujisanensis were aggregated in limited areas outside the A. firma crown. Interspecific spatial associations were analysed for Russula sp.1, which was the most dominant species, and three other frequent species, I. cincinnata, S. confusus and R. ochroleuca. Pairwise, Russula sp.1 with I. cincinnata, with S. confusus or with R. ochroleuca showed an association which was exclusive, overlapping or independent, respectively. Fruiting phenologies differed in that S. confusus showed a peak density in the summer, whereas the other three species peaked in the autumn. These results suggest that the formation of ECM fruitbodies can be partitioned among the species both spatially and temporally." .

National-level forest baselines are being established all over the world to guide the implementation of several policy mechanisms. However, identifying the direct and indirect drivers of deforestation and understanding the complexity of their interlinkages are often difficult. We first analyzed deforestation between 1990 and 2005 at the national level and found an annual deforestation rate of 0.62 %. Next, we performed separate analyses for four natural regions in Colombia and found annual deforestation rates between 0.42 and 1.92 %. Using general linear models, we identified several direct causes and underlying factors influencing deforestation at the national level: rural population density, cattle, protected areas, and slope. Significant differences in deforestation rates and causes were found across regions. In the Caribbean region, drivers of loss are urban population, unsatisfied basic needs, slope, and precipitation and four land use variables (illicit crops, pastures, cattle, and fires). In the Orinoco region, crops are the main driver of forest loss, and in the Amazonian region, deforestation is primarily due to fires related to the colonization front. Policy mechanisms will have to take into account regional patterns to successfully balance development and forest preservation in Colombia." .

Fine root growth in the upper soil layers (root mat+10 cm upper soil) was considerably higher in the Tierra Firme forest (1117 g m-2 yr-1) than in tall Cattinga (120) and Bana (235). Fine root growth on top of the root mat was stimulated significantly by added N in Tall Caatinga and Low Bana forests, by P in Tierra Firme and Bana forests, and by Ca only in the Tierra Firme forest. Rate of fine root growth in Tierra Firme forest on fresh litter is strongly correlated with the Mg and Ca content of litter. Rate of litter decomposition was inversely related to % lignin and the lignin/N ratio of litter. Litter contact with the dense root mat of the Tierra Firme increased rates of disappearance for biomass, Ca and Mg as compared with litter permanently separated or lifted weekly from the root mat to avoid root attachment. Nitrogen concentration of decomposing litter increased in all forests, net N released being observed only in Caryocar glabrum and Aspidosperma megalocarpum of the Tierra Firme forest after one year of exposure. Results emphasize the differences in limiting nutrients in amazonian forest ecosystems on contrasting soil types: Tierra Firme forests are particularly limited by Ca and Mg, while Caatinga and Bana forests are limited mainly by N availability." .

A high-temperature day was established when air temperature was higher than 20 °C at 850 hPa. The number of these days increased significantly in the study period, increasing the frequency of adverse weather conditions that could facilitate extreme fire behavior. Specifically, these high-temperature days are more frequent in June than they used to be.

This so-called nurse- or shelter tree effect was investigated in a montane semihumid site in southern Ethiopia where plantations of Pinus patula and Eucalyptus saligna grow in close vicinity to the natural Podocarpus falcatus mixed forest. Physiological performance of P. falcatus saplings growing in the exotic and the natural forests was investigated over the year. Compared with the natural forest, photosynthetic carbon gain and growth of the saplings were significantly enhanced under Pinus patula while likewise retarded under Eucalyptus saligna. Diverging effects of the differently dense shelter canopies on the saplings could be traced to differences in the sub-canopy microclimates and particularly to the intensities and temporal distribution of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Moisture also played an important role for photosynthetic carbon gain: while the morning patterns of CO2 uptake were significantly correlated with the patterns of sunflecks, stomatal conductance was the determinant factor in the afternoon. Analysis of the photosynthetic efficiency of sunflecks revealed a lower quantum yield than the basic diffuse PAR intensity. Compared with a theoretically even distribution of the daily PAR, CO2 uptake under the real light climate was 70% under Pinus and in the natural forest, and 59% under Eucalyptus. Relating growth rates of Podocarpus saplings to photosynthesis the microclimate under Pinus was 2.5 times as effective as that in the natural forest and five times more effective than under Eucalyptus." .

Continuous in situ measurements of whole trees during drought and as trees die hold promise to illuminate physiological pathways but are relatively rare. We monitored leaf characteristics, water use efficiency, water potentials, branch hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture, meteorological variables, and sap flux on mature healthy and sudden aspen decline-affected (SAD) trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) ramets over two growing seasons, including a severe summer drought. We calculated daily estimates of whole-ramet hydraulic conductance and modeled whole-ramet assimilation. Healthy ramets experienced rapid declines of whole-ramet conductance during the severe drought, providing an analog for what likely occurred during the previous drought that induced SAD. Even in wetter periods, SAD-affected ramets exhibited fivefold lower whole-ramet hydraulic conductance and sevenfold lower assimilation than counterpart healthy ramets, mediated by changes in leaf area, water use efficiency, and embolism. Extant differences between healthy and SAD ramets reveal that ongoing multi-year forest die-off is primarily driven by loss of whole-ramet hydraulic capability, which in turn limits assimilation capacity. Branch-level measurements largely captured whole-plant hydraulic limitations during drought and mortality, but whole-plant measurements revealed a potential role of other losses in the hydraulic continuum. Our results highlight the importance of a whole-tree perspective in assessing physiological pathways to tree mortality and indicate that the effects of mortality on these forests’ assimilation and productivity are larger than expected based on canopy leaf area differences." .

Ectomycorrhizal fungi production comprised of extramatrical mycelia, Hartig nets and mantles on fine root tips, and sporocarps was estimated to be 49 g m−2 year−1 in the control treatment plots. Extramatrical mycelia accounted for approximately 95% of the total mycorrhizal production estimate. Mycorrhizal production rates did not vary significantly among sample periods throughout the annual assessment (p = 0.1366). In addition, reduction in foliar leaf area via experimental scorching treatments did not influence mycorrhizal production (p = 0.9374), suggesting that stored carbon (C) may decouple the linkage between current photosynthate production and ectomycorrhizal fungi dynamics in this forest type. Nitrogen fertilization had a negative effect, whereas precipitation had a positive effect on mycorrhizal fungi production (p = 0.0292; r 2 = 0.42). These results support the widely speculated but poorly documented supposition that mycorrhizal fungi are a large and dynamic component of C flow and nutrient cycling dynamics in forest ecosystems." .

This work analyzes the effects of high-temperature days on medium and large fires (those larger than 50 ha) from 1978 to 2010 in Spain. A high-temperature day was defined as being when air temperature at 850 hPa was higher than the 95th percentile of air temperature at that elevation from June to September across the years 1978–2010. Temperature at 850 hPa was chosen because it properly characterizes the state of the lower troposphere. The effects of high temperature on forest fires were remarkable and significant in terms of fire number (15 % of total large fires occurred under high-temperature days) and burned area (25 % of the total burned area occurred under high-temperature days). Fire size was also significantly higher under the 95th percentile air temperature at 850 hPa, and a large part of the largest fires in the past 20 years were under these extreme conditions. Additionally, both burned area and fire number only decreased under non-high-temperature days in the study period and not under high-temperature conditions." .

In Switzerland, windthrow losses reached 12.7 Mio m3 of timber, corresponding to 2.8 times the annual national timber harvest. Although these exceptional losses were due to extreme peak velocities, recent changes in tree nutrition may have increased forest susceptibility. Previous controlled environment experiments revealed that wood density (associated with wood stiffness) tends to increase in elevated CO2, and to decrease when N-availability is enhanced (e.g., by soluble N-deposition). Such changes in wood quality could theoretically influence the risk of wind damage. We used the “Lothar” windstorm as a “natural experiment” to explore links between damage and wood properties. In 104 windthrow sites across the Swiss Plateau, more than 1,600 wood cores from (1) broken, (2) uprooted and (3) still standing (not damaged) spruce trees (Picea abies) were collected in February and March 2000. Wood properties, treering width and chemistry of the wood samples were analysed. Broken trees showed wider treerings in the decade 1990–99 compared to non-broken trees (either uprooted or undamaged trees). Broken trees also showed lower non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration in sapwood, reflecting active structural carbohydrate sinks associated with fast growth. There was also a trend for higher tissue N-concentrations in broken trees. No significant differences between damage types were found in wood density and wood shrinkage during desiccation. We conclude that stem breakage risk of P. abies is associated with a stimulation of growth in the past decade and with changes in tree nutritional status. However, the risk for windthrow of whole spruce trees (uprooted but not broken) was not related to the studied wood parameters." .

Agricultural field soil from the Cosumnes River Preserve was presumed to be low or lacking in ectomycorrhizal inoculum. The study was designed to (1) determine whether valley oak stand soil transfer could cause mycorrhizal infection on valley oak seedlings in an agricultural field and in a greenhouse, (2) describe ectomycorrhizal morphological types formed on valley oak seedlings, and (3) determine whether seedling growth is enhanced more by transfer of natural valley oak stand soil than agricultural field soil. In the field study, transfer of forest soil increased average ectomycorrhizal diversity (2.4 types) more than transfer of agricultural field soil (1.2 types). Valley oak seedlings were responsive to ectomycorrhizal infection in the field study. With increase in mycorrhizal infection there was an increase in shoot growth at the expense of root growth. In the greenhouse study, both percent mycorrhizal infection and mycorrhizal diversity were increased more by transfer of oak forest and woodland soils than agricultural field soil. Eight morphotypes occurred on seedlings in forest and woodland soils but only three morphotypes in agricultural soil. This result strongly suggests that the agricultural field also harbors ectomycorrhizal propagules but forest and woodland soils support a more abundant and diverse ectomycorrhizal flora." .

Stands did not differ in wood basal area/ha or forest floor C/N ratios, but the closed-canopy stand had a significantly larger accumulation of forest floor biomass and significantly higher levels of field-extractable nitrogen and nitrogen mineralization rates. Green foliage from trees in the closed-canopy stand had significantly lower nitrogen, astringency, and lignin contents, but higher cellulose concentration than trees in the open-canopy stand. These trends, inconsistent with the inverse relationship often observed between nitrogen and polyphenol contents of foliage, may result from differences in relative resource availability in the two stands. In contrast to green foliage, needle litter from the two stands had comparable contents of nitrogen, cellulose, and lignin, but astringency was significantly higher in litter from the closed-canopy stand. It is suggested that, within the constraints imposed by site conditions, evergreens may alter the tannin composition of senescing foliage, potentially affecting herbivory and decomposition differently." .

Nitrogen stocks in the mineral topsoil (0–30 cm) were, on average, 943 kg N ha−1 higher at the outer edges than in the interior, indicating that N retention in the soil is probably one of the processes involved in the relatively low DIN leaching in the outer edges.

Determination of past and present fluctuations of the forest-savanna boundary involved the measurement of natural 13C isotope abundance, expressed as δ13C, in soil organic matter (SOM). SOM 13C analyses and radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments were carried out on samples derived from soil profiles taken along transects perpendicular to the ecotonal boundary. SOM δ13C values in the upper soil horizons appeared to be in equilibrium with the overlying vegetation types and did not point to a movement of the boundary during the last decades. However, δ13C values obtained from deeper savanna and forest soil layers indicated that the vegetation type has changed in the past. In current savanna soil profiles, we observed the presence of mid-Holocene charcoals derived from forest species: fire frequency at that time was probably greater, and more extensive savanna may have resulted. Isotope data and the presence of these charcoals thus suggest that the forest-savanna boundary has shifted significantly in the recent Holocene period, forest being more extensive during the early Holocene than today. During the middle Holocene, the forest could have strongly regressed, and fires appeared, with a maximum development of the savanna vegetation. At the beginning of the late Holocene, the forest may have invaded a part of this savanna, and fires occurred again." .

To improve our understanding of post-fire C accumulation patterns within boreal forests, we evaluated above- and belowground C pools within 17 Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi) stands of northeastern Siberia that varied in both years since fire and stand density. Early-successional stands (<20-year old) exhibited low larch recruitment, and consequently, low density, aboveground larch biomass, and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPPtree). Mid-successional stands (21- to 70-year old) were even-aged with considerable variability in stand density. High-density mid-successional stands had 21 times faster rates of ANPPtree than low-density stands (252 vs. 12 g C m−2 y−1) and 26 times more C in aboveground larch biomass (2,186 vs. 85 g C m−2). Density had little effect on total soil C pools. During late-succession (>70-year old), aboveground larch biomass, ANPPtree, and soil organic layer C pools increased with stand age. These stands were low density and multi-aged, containing both mature trees and new recruits. The rapid accumulation of aboveground larch biomass in high-density, mid-successional stands allowed them to obtain C stocks similar to those in much older low-density stands (~8,000 g C m−2). If fire frequency increases without altering stand density, landscape-level C storage could decline, but if larch density also increases, large aboveground C pools within high-density stands could compensate for a shorter successional cycle." .

We found consistent linear positive relationships between the quantum yield of photosystem II (ϕ PSII), an index of photosynthetic capacity, and hydraulic conductivity per sapwood area (k S) and per leaf area (k L) across all species. The slope of the ϕ PSII–k S relationship was steeper for hardwood hammock than for pine rockland species. Mean ϕ PSII was greater in pine rockland species and was greater for a given k L than in hardwood hammock species. These results are consistent with previous observations demonstrating that pine rocklands tend to have better access to stable water sources than hardwood hammocks. We also found greater photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination with increasing k S and k L in pine rockland species, but not in hardwood hammock species, suggesting increased stomatal conductance with increasing k S and k L, consistent with greater water availability in pine rockland habitats. Our study thus utilizes relationships between water transport and photosynthesis to evaluate hydraulic constraints on physiological function between two contrasting vegetation types with contrasting stability of water sources." .

Specifically, rise of global temperatures, decline of winter precipitation, earlier loss of snowpack, and increased summer drought are altering the range of Pinus contorta. Simultaneously, flux in environmental conditions within the historic P. contorta range may facilitate the encroachment of P. ponderosa into P. contorta territory. Furthermore, successful pine species migration may be constrained by the distribution or co-migration of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF). Knowledge of the linkages among soil fungal diversity, community structure, and environmental factors is critical to understanding the organization and stability of pine ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to establish a foundational knowledge of the EMF communities of P. ponderosa and P. contorta in the Deschutes National Forest, OR, USA, and to examine soil characteristics associated with community composition. We examined EMF root tips of P. ponderosa and P. contorta in soil cores and conducted soil chemistry analysis for P. ponderosa cores. Results indicate that Cenococcum geophilum, Rhizopogon salebrosus, and Inocybe flocculosa were dominant in both P. contorta and P. ponderosa soil cores. Rhizopogon spp. were ubiquitous in P. ponderosa cores. There was no significant difference in the species composition of EMF communities of P. ponderosa and P. contorta. Ordination analysis of P. ponderosa soils suggested that soil pH, plant-available phosphorus (Bray), total phosphorus (P), carbon (C), mineralizable nitrogen (N), ammonium (NH4), and nitrate (NO3) are driving EMF community composition in P. ponderosa stands. We found a significant linear relationship between EMF species richness and mineralizable N. In conclusion, P. ponderosa and P. contorta, within the Deschutes National Forest, share the same dominant EMF species, which implies that P. ponderosa may be able to successfully establish within the historic P. contorta range and dominant EMF assemblages may be conserved." .

Diem from nodules of Casuarina equisetifolia from Senegal. One of these antibodies, mAb8C5, was shown by ELISA to have high, but not absolute specificity for 0RS020607. This antibody was employed to investigate the mobility and persistence of 0RS020607 in plantations of C. equisetifolia. Seedlings were inoculated in pots of sand in a forest nursery with 0RS020607, with local crushed nodule suspensions or were left uninoculated. They were planted out after 5 months in experimental plots on a moderately fertile black soil site and on a low organic, oxidised red soil site. Compared with crushed nodule inoculated seedlings or uninoculated controls, growth of seedlings at transplant was improved by inoculation with Frankia 0RS020607. However, 4 years after transplant to experimental plots, the growth of trees receiving different treatments was similar. The possibility that movement of ORS 020607 between treatment plots contributed to new nodulation and enhanced growth of uninoculated trees was tested using mAb8C5 in ELISA of Frankia mycelium, extracted from the nodules of trees of the three treatments. No significant differences in reactivity were detected between nodules from uninoculated and 0RS020607 inoculated trees at either the black or the red soil sites, showing that 0RS020607 moved between treatment plots at both sites. However, at both sites, nodules from plots of trees that were inoculated originally with local crushed nodules gave reactions in ELISA that were significantly lower than values for 0RS020607 inoculated trees, possibly due to the competitive effects for new nodulation of enhancement of the indigenous population of Frankia. Serological techniques using antibodies of high specificity against Frankia strains have value for rapid screening of field samples as a preliminary for further analysis by more discriminatory techniques based on assays of genetic polymorphisms." .

Hook.) plantation, and to compare three acoustic nondestructive methods for evaluating the static bending modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), and compressive strength parallel-to-grain (σc) of plantation wood as well. Fifteen Chinese fir plantation trees at 36 years of age were selected. Each tree was cut into four logs, for which three values of dynamic modulus of elasticity, i.e., E sw, of the north and south face based on stress waves to assume the measuring state of the standing tree, E fr, longitudinal vibration, and E us, ultrasonic wave, were measured in the green condition. After log measurements, small specimens were cut and air-dried to 12% moisture content (MC). Static bending tests were then performed to determine the bending MOE and MOR, and compressive tests parallel-to-grain were made to determine σc. The bending MOE of small clear specimens was about 7.1% and 15.4% less than E sw and E us, respectively, and 11.3% greater than E fr. The differences between the bending MOE and dynamic MOE of logs as determined by the three acoustic methods were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Good correlation (R = 0.77, 0.57, and 0.45) between E sw, E fr, and E us and static MOE, respectively, were obtained (P < 0.001). It can be concluded that longitudinal vibration may be the most precise and reliable technique to evaluate the mechanical properties of logs among these three acoustic nondestructive methods. Moreover, the results indicate that stress wave technology would be effective to evaluate wood mechanical properties both from logs and from the standing tree." .

In a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation and an adjacent Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata shrub, which are located in a dry-hot valley region of Minjiang River in the Southwest of China, the daily soil CO2 emission dynamics was measured in August 2004 and in May, July, and October 2005. The results showed that the soil CO2 emission in the oak shrub was significantly higher than the pine plantation in each measurement period. Additionally, soil organic matter, microbial biomass carbon, and the leaf litter decomposition rate in the two vegetations differed significantly from each other. The variation of soil organic matter and microbial biomass carbon partially contributed to the evident difference in soil CO2 emission. Moreover, the correlations between soil CO2 emission, soil temperature, and soil water content were evaluated in this study. The soil temperature positively controlled soil CO2 emission in the pine plantation and the oak shrub, while the soil water content negatively influenced soil CO2 emission in the two vegetation types. However, the soil temperature and soil water content played varied roles in the different vegetation types. By the means of stepwise regression, the soil temperature more significantly influenced the dynamics of soil CO2 emission for the plantation than the soil water content; oppositely, the soil water content was the more significant controlling factor for the shrub. Based on the exponent model between the soil CO2 emission and soil temperature, the Q 10 values were estimated, which was 1.7 in the pine plantation and 3.0 in the oak shrub. The former was lower than the global average level of 2.0, whereas the latter was higher than the global average level." .

Before planting, the site had been cleared of weeds with foliar translocated and pre-emergence herbicides. The first factor of the experiment examined the effects on tree growth of no post-planting weed control, control by hand or with three levels of application of granulated atrazine, 0.9, 1.8 and 8 kg ha−1. The second factor examined the effects of no fertiliser application or the application of nitrogen as urea at 200 kg ha−1 N plus triple superphosphate at 120 kg ha−1 P. Tree growth responses to treatments were examined at 11, 16, 23 and 29 months of age. Fertiliser application increased tree height and diameter growth. Application of atrazine generally reduced height and diameter growth, but this was statistically significant only at the highest rate of application. Growth reduction occurred even though atrazine reduced post-planting weed cover on the site and hence potential competition with the tree crop for site resources. Hand weeding reduced the weed crop on the site even more than atrazine, but this did not increase growth of the tree crop. Given satisfactory establishment practices which include the use of herbicides pre-planting, it was concluded that post-planting weed regeneration was not sufficiently vigorous to warrant post-planting weed control on these sites. The use of atrazine for post-planting weed control could even be deleterious to eucalypts." .

Nitrogen in needles is considered as distributed in two mutually exclusive pools, viz. mobile and structurally bound. The size of the former pool, relative to total needle biomass, determines the rate of production of new needle biomass; this process decreases the pool size due to immobilization of mobile nitrogen. Some implications of the theory are derived and compared with published experimental results. It predicts a one-year time delay between a pulse fertilization and commencement of growth response, the latter having a total duration of about ten years with a maximum after about three; these predictions are not contradicted by available data." .

In this study, we examined the community structure and species richness of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi associated with exotic pine plantations in relation to adjacent native ectomycorrhizal trees in Iran to elucidate the symbiont exchange between distantly related hosts, i.e. Fagales (Fagaceae and Betulaceae) and Pinaceae. The combination of morphological and molecular identification approaches revealed that 84.6 % of species with more than one occurrence (at least once on pines) were shared with native trees and only 5.9 % were found exclusively on pine root tips. The community diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the pine plantations adjacent to native EcM trees was comparable to their adjacent native trees, but the isolated plantations hosted relatively a species-poor community. Specific mycobionts of conifers were dominant in the isolated plantation while rarely found in the plantations adjacent to native EcM trees. These data demonstrate the importance of habitat isolation and dispersal limitation of EcM fungi in their potential of host range expansion. The great number of shared and possibly compatible symbiotic species between exotic Pinaceae and local Fagales (Fagaceae and Betulaceae) may reflect their evolutionary adaptations and/or ancestral compatibility with one another." .

AbstractFire frequency is considered to be a controlling factor for the structure of savanna vegetation, also affecting functional aspects of plants, yet studies contrasting long-term burnt and unburnt sites within the same area are rare. At fire-protected sites, one may expect to find woody vegetation with non-sclerophyllous leaves exhibiting a high nutrient concentration and growing on soils of high fertility. Using a burnt (14 times within the last 20 years) and an unburnt site (over the same period) within the same area of a mesic Australian savanna, we compared the soil fertility, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf macronutrient concentration of the exclusive (species that occur at a single site), common (species that occur at both sites) and total (exclusive and common species combined) sampled tree species from the two sites. The exclusive, common and total sampled tree species had a lower SLA when growing at the burnt site than at the unburnt site. Soil from the burnt site was less fertile than the soil from the unburnt site, and the plants from the burnt site exhibited lower leaf nutrient concentrations when compared with those from the unburnt site. The association between fire and soil fertility was consistent with the differences in leaf scleromorphism between the sites under contrasting fire frequencies." .

Field measurements and model predictions indicated relatively cold growth conditions of the Polylepis forests. Tree height, stem diameter, and basal area of the stands decreased markedly while stem density increased with elevation. Leaf morphology differed between the two occurring Polylepis species, and trees at the treeline had smaller leaves with higher specific leaf area. In contrast, fine root biomass increased from 37 g m−2 at the lowermost stand to 234 g m−2 at the treeline. Trees of the uppermost stand had higher specific root surface area and a much higher number of root tips per unit dry mass. Thus, root surface area and total number of root tips per unit ground area increased conspicuously from the lowermost stand to the treeline. Density of young growth inside the forest increased towards the treeline, while density in the open grassland decreased with elevation. Young growth originated from sexual reproduction at the lower forest but was comprised exclusively of root suckers at the treeline stand. We conclude that both the marked change in carbon allocation towards the root system, as well as the changes in root morphology with elevation indicate an adaptation to reduced nutrient supply under cold conditions of these Polylepis stands at the treeline in E Bolivia." .

As subapical branch buds are segregated from the leader meristem, resource allocation between ortho- and plagiotropic growth is determined. The relationship between treetop buds in young trees was studied in the natural state and after surgical removal in early July of either the leader bud (decapitation) or the subapical whorl branch buds (destipitation). The two bud types showed consistent cytokinin profile differences but similar seasonal dynamics in cytokinins and auxin (IAA). After bud excision, ZRP increased dramatically in the subapical stem within 1 h, followed by ZR within 1 week. Supernormal levels of ZR were maintained through autumn and persisted in spring in the destipitated trees, but had returned to normal in the decapitated trees. The treetop buds remaining after bud excision experienced an immediate decrease in most cytokinins, followed, however, by a large surplus later in the season. The following spring this high level persisted in the leader bud of destipitated trees, but not in whorl buds of decapitated trees. Conspicuous growth pattern changes followed from destipitation, but few from decapitation. Growth reactions suggest that resource allocation to main branch buds inhibits leader growth in normal trees, a kind of “lateral control.” Auxin and ABA content in buds and stems was largely unaffected by treatments. Data suggest that subapical leader tissues beneath the apical bud group are a primary source of cytokinin regulation." .

Analysis of variance with levels of crown size nested within levels of growth rate was used to test for differences in main stem permeability. Permeability at the top of the stem averaged 2.0×10−12 m2. There were no significant differences in permeability between families selected for fast and slow growth, but permeability was significantly lower for families selected for large crowns than for families selected for small crowns. Branch permeability averaged 0.74×10−12 m2 and decreased significantly with crown depth. Large-crown families had higher overall branch permeability than small-crown families. Average permeability in branches did not differ significantly between fast- and slow-growing families. Large crown-families had significantly larger current leaf area: total leaf area ratios in the lower two-thirds of the crown, and a weak but significant association was found between permeability and current leaf area: total leaf area ratios for a given relative crown depth.

The material comprised 50 coprophagous and 129 carnivorous species, represented by 26,650 and 35,850 individuals, respectively. The most important characteristics of each species are given in an Appendix. In the coprophages the species-abundance relations fitted the lognormal distribution well, but in the carnivores the distribution was strikingly less even. A great number of other differences (see below) apparent between the two trophic groups were explained as the result of a difference in the degree of specialization, apart from the difference in their trophic position: coprophages are microhabitat (dung) and food specialists, while carnivores are microhabitat generalists (and therefore their “critical” niche space was not completely covered in this study). In the coprophages, two important species guilds were observed: the first occurred at the very geginning of the succession (mean position 2.5 days), and consisted mainly of true dung specialists; the second guild contained species with wider utilization along the successional dimension (mean position 6.5 days), and species of more generalist nature (saprophages). The utilization of carnivores along the successional gradient was more continuous, probably because of their more diversified food resources. The total niche width among the coprophages increased from early successional species to species occurring mainly later on, but was more constant in carnivores. The environmental dimensions proved to be totally independent of each other among the carnivores, while the coprophages showed a clear supplementary relationship along them. Among the carnivores, a spherical niche shape dominated, but among the coprophages elongated and disk-liked shapes were also well represented, especially in specialist species. In both groups, a significant positive correlation existed between niche width and dominance, but not between niche width and abundance. It is suggested that the patchy distribution and transient occurrence of suitable microhabitats contributes to the coexistence of many ecologically similar species." .

Hydraulic failure and carbon starvation are likely interrelated, and bark beetles attacks did not seem to be directly involved. AbstractForests are extremely important for society given the many services they provide. Climate models reflect increases in temperature and less annual rainfall, which will generate hotter drier environments. Under these conditions, it is predicted that forest ecosystems will be severely affected, and recent studies have accumulated evidence for drought-induced tree mortality. Consequently, many studies have attempted to explain mechanisms of survival and mortality in forest species. However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie drought mortality are not completely understood. The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of an extremely dry year on the cause of mortality of pines and on forest decline in pine forest populations in southeast Spain. Specifically, we studied the effect of drought stress that caused pine mortality, dynamics of carbohydrates reserves and bark beetle attack. The results suggest that pine mortality can be attributed to an intense drought stress level that caused xylem cavitation. The results also indicate that hydraulic failure and carbon starvation are likely interrelated, which makes separating both mechanisms very difficult. Finally, the recorded bark beetles attack did not seem to be directly involved in mortality, at least not in the forests with less intense drought conditions." .

However, few studies have investigated the impacts of pathogens on regeneration in temperate forests. To determine whether losses to fungi of seeds of Betula papyrifera, a light-loving species, varied between habitats that differed in their degree of openness, we applied fungicide to seeds buried in old fields, treefall gaps, and forest understory sites. We found that the application of fungicide significantly reduced losses in all habitats, relative to control values. This effect was habitat-dependent: the benefit of fungicide was greater in forest understory than in openings. This suggests that B. papyrifera is prevented from establishing in understory environments in part by its susceptibility to pathogen attack, and not solely because of a high light requirement." .

The new phloem enveloping the wound, which had developed within the 2 years following branch pruning in 5-year-old Eucalyptus globulus Labill., was morphologically distinct from healthy stem phloem. Histological examinations revealed this wound-associated phloem to be largely composed of secretory cavities similar in appearance to oil glands. Subsequent analysis of the wound-associated phloem extracts by GC-MS confirmed the presence of volatile terpenes and phenols. The total extracted oil content determined for wound-associated phloem extracts was significantly higher (>4 times) than for healthy stem phloem extracts. A comparison of the relative abundances of ten individual terpenoids from wound-associated phloem and healthy phloem revealed a number of significant differences in terpene composition. Implications of the role of terpenes as inducible secondary metabolites in tree wound responses are discussed." .

With that purpose, we designed a cross-sectional study to examine the effects of topographic position, gravel surface cover and accompanying vegetation cover on holm oak plantations density, growth (height and basal diameter) and health status. We surveyed three technically identical and multi-patched holm oak plantations dating from 1995, 1998 and 2003, aged 15, 12 and 7 respectively, covering an homogeneous climate and soil area of about 500 ha located in Central-Western Spain. Six hundred and seventy-two pruned and unpruned trees were sampled in 107 systematically sampled plots covering a wide range of site conditions in the studied area. At the tree level, two linear mixed effect models were adjusted for each year under study to explore the influence of pruning and microsite factors on height and diameter. Also at a tree level, a linear mixed effect model was fitted in order to analyze the influence of microsite factors and pruning on the health status of trees. At plot level, we performed a Multifactor Analysis of variance model to explore the influence of the microsite predictor variables and of the age of plantations on stocking. The results revealed that both basal diameter and height were increased by early pruning in all plantations under study. The effects on height and basal diameter of the three microsite parameters analysed varied with the age of plantations. The oldest plantations (15 years old), were affected by the surface gravel cover, while vegetation cover was significant in 12 years old plantations. Slope position was near relevant (p < 0.1) only in the youngest plantations. When significant, a high surface gravel cover was directly related to higher trees and larger basal diameters. Plantations density was significantly affected by the topographic position and, in all the plantations studied, pruned trees were associated with a better health status. Overall, our results show that early pruning and microsite conditions significantly influence the growth of holm oak seedlings. These results suggest that the management and growth modelling of holm oak should take into consideration the spatial distribution of the different microsites represented. Moreover, early- pruning should be considered as a positive practice affecting not only final tree form but also the growth and health status of trees. Finally, our results should lead to for further studies and help for improving future projects in areas with similar conditions." .

The NJPB are dominated by pine (Pinus spp.) and oak (Quercus spp.) stands that are fragmented and subject to frequent disturbance and forest management. Over long time periods (>50 years), the balance between oak and pine dominance is determined by fire frequency. As a consequence, the ability of the NJPB to sequester carbon may be contingent upon management activities as well as patterns of historic land use. We simulated 100 years of carbon change using three scenarios: (1) contemporary management as reflected in the recent (1991–2006) fire records, (2) an increase in the fire ignitions within the wildland urban interface areas of the NJPB reflecting increased prescribed fires, and (3) a longer response time to wildfires, reflecting a more liberal burning policy by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. We used the LANDIS-II model coupled with CENTURY and the Dynamic Fire and Dynamic Biomass Fuels extensions to estimate forest carbon sequestration based on these three scenarios. Calibration and validation via comparison to monthly flux tower data indicated that the model reasonably captured the timing and magnitude of net ecosystem exchange in the absence of Gypsy moth defoliation (r 2 = 0.89). Under all scenarios, our simulations suggest that forests of the NJPB will continue to accumulate carbon over the next 100 years under current climatic conditions. Although aboveground net primary productivity, live carbon, and detrital carbon were roughly constant or increased only modestly, soil organic carbon continued to increase through time for all forest types except the highly xeric pine plains. Our simulated changes in management reflected only minor alterations to the fire regime and thus management may have only minor effects on total forest carbon budgets in the immediate future particularly when compared to recovery from historic disturbance patterns." .

One estimator of A1 is based on the common assumption of a constant ratio between A1 and sapwood cross-sectional area at breast height (As). The second estimator of A1 accounts for tree-to-tree variation in the relation between A1 and As. The apparent relationship between stand growth and leaf-area index is strongly dependent on the way leaf area is estimated. When L is derived from a constant A1∶As ratio, stand growth appears to be strongly correlated with L. However, when L is based on estmates of A1 that account for tree-to-tree variation in the A1 — As relation, stand growth is seen to be only weakly related to L. Stand structure, quantified as percent live-crown, accounts for a great deal of the observed variation in leaf-area efficiency. These contrasting relationships illustrate the importance of unbiased estimates of L in interpreting the link between stand-level processes and leaf area." .

Standardized samples were taken by unit-time hand collecting (day and night times), sweeping, beating, baiting and by Winkler sacks.

Species lists are presented and the ant community composition and species richness are compared between the three forests. By considering the nesting and foraging habits of the various species, the differences in overall community composition are related to the forest type and susceptibility to inundation of the three forests which were surveyed. The data confirm the view that tropical rain forests support an extremely diverse ant fauna and comparisons with other forested areas suggest that ant species richness declines in subtropical and temperate rain forests. Although alpha diversity is high, species turnover between forests is lower than expected, suggesting that ant species richness in this forested region is not as great as is implied in some published estimates of global arthropod diversity." .

The primary aim of this study was to learn about which plant species and in what numbers diaspores are dispersed by the two wild ungulate species. In particular, the significance of zoochory for species composition and biodiversity of forests was evaluated. Fresh faecal pellets were collected from April–November 2001 in the forests of the two study areas. In addition, the coats and hooves of shot roe deer and wild boar were brushed out. The number of viable seeds was determined by greenhouse germination (seedling emergence method). The samples were spread in trays over sterilized soil from the study forests and were kept under controlled conditions in the greenhouse for 12 months. A total of 2,473 individuals from 77 vascular plant species were recorded. While roe deer exceeded wild boar concerning seed contents in the faeces, the significance of roe deer for epizoochorous dispersal was relatively low compared with wild boar. An analysis of the habitat preference of the vascular plant species dispersed by the two ungulate species revealed a high proportion of species growing in forests as well as in the open landscape, and also of non-forest species, while woody plants and herbaceous species closely tied to forest habitats were severely underrepresented. We also discuss consequences for forest ecology and nature conservation." .

The effects of P-fertilizer on seedling growth and nodulation were compared to that of seedlings grown in unfertilized soil or in control at different harvesting intervals. The study revealed that, seedling growth was enhanced significantly with the application of P-fertilizer. The growth was found more pronounced in cases of A. saman and P. pinnata, whereas it was not noticeable and showed depressed growth in case of A. chinensis. The study also suggests that nodulation in terms of nodule number and size was also increased significantly with P-fertilization except in case of P. pinnata, where higher harvesting intervals lowered the nodulation performance of that species" .

Spruce had 60% lower rates of net photosynthesis per dry weight than beech. But, beech had a 30% shorter growing season and a 84% smaller biomass than spruce. The annual CO2 gain was 40% lower in beech than it was in spruce. An analysis shows the following conclusions for this habitat. (1)The effect of a prolonged growing season is small. The annual CO2 gain of spruce would be reduced only by 9% if the growing season was the same length as for beech.(2)The annual CO2 gain would increase 14% if all needles in spruce were deciduous, because the current year needles have a higher average rate of CO2 uptake than 3-year old and older needles, but a lower average rate than 1- and 2-year old ones. However, the carbon balance of the tree shows that spruce could not afford to produce the existing needle biomass (14 t ha-1) each year.(3)If spruce were to produce the same deciduous foliage biomass during the same growing season as beech then total production by spruce would be reduced 67%.(4)The annual CO2 uptake by evergreen spruce was higher than deciduous beech not because of a long growing season, but because of the longevity of its needles, which during their total life time (an average of 5 years) have a two to three times greater CO2 uptake than a deciduous leaf in one summer season. The relatively small investment in current year needles produces an annually low, but long lasting assimilation of CO2." .

We established a solid scatterer model to explain the widened durations found in analyzing the relationship between laser pulses and forest canopies, and obtained the corresponding rule between laser pulse duration and scatterer depth. Based on returned waveform characteristics, scatterers were classified into three types: simple, solid and complex. We developed single-peak derivative and multiple-peak derivative analysis methods to retrieve waveform features and discriminate between scatterer types. Solid scatterer simulations showed that the returned waveforms were widened as scatterer depth increased, and as space between sub-scatterers increased the returned waveforms developed two peaks which subsequently developed into two separate sub-waveforms. There were slight differences between the durations of simulated and measured waveforms. LIDAR waveform data are able to describe the backscatter characteristics of forest canopies, and have potential to improve the estimation accuracy of forest parameters." .

Based on detailed destructive measurements of eight selected model trees, allometric relations of tree height, crown projected area, woody and leaf dry mass and leaf area on tree diameter at breast height (DBH) were derived. The scaling-up procedure from the tree to the stand level was done using the frequency distribution of DBH obtained at the selected experimental plot. The vertical and radial distributions of the tree foliage were estimated by the “cloud” technique. The vertical profile of leaf area showed a bimodal distribution pattern with maxima at heights of 4 and 6 m above the ground. The leaf area index (LAI) of the understorey Prunus serotina as estimated by the described up-scaling procedure (5.1) was significantly higher than the LAI (2.6) as measured by a plant canopy analyser and was also significantly higher than the LAI of the overstorey species Scots pine (1.5–3.0). The LAI of a neighbouring Rhododendron understorey reached only 1.25. This study emphasises the importance of an exotic understorey species in the total leaf area of mixed coniferous forests which might have important implications for the energy and mass exchanges of the entire forest." .

Drought periods leading to plant stress occur not only in dry forests, but also in moist and even wet forests. We quantified experimentally the effect of drought on survival of first year seedlings of 28 co-occurring tropical woody plant species in the understory of a tropical moist forest. The seedlings were transplanted to plots and subjected to a drought and an irrigation treatment for 22 weeks during the dry season. Drought effects on mortality and wilting behavior varied greatly among species, so that relative survival in the dry treatment ranged from 0% to about 100% of that in the irrigated treatment. Drought stress was the main factor in mortality, causing about 90% (median) of the total mortality observed in the dry treatment. In almost half of the species, the difference in survival between treatments was not significant even after 22 weeks, implying that many of the species are well adapted to drought in this forest. Relative drought survival was significantly higher in species associated with dry habitats than in those associated with wet habitats, and in species with higher abundance on the dry side of the Isthmus of Panama, than in those more abundant on the wet side. These data show that differential species survival in response to drought, combined with variation in soil moisture availability, may be important for species distribution at the local and regional scale in many tropical forests." .

Several competition indices, a model of overstorey fine root density, relative photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) values, and soil water values were used in these approaches. In the factorial experiment relative PAR and soil water content were measured and used for the prediction of seedlings height growth. In the field experiment this was done by using relative PAR and estimated fine root biomass as a surrogate for below ground resource availability. The latter approach was compared with a model where we used various competition indices representing the impact of overstorey trees on beech seedlings. Our results suggested that (1) models which combine resource based growth functions are suitable for the prediction of individual height growth of beech seedlings. Resource based models offer the opportunity to investigate on the independent multiplicative effect of irradiance and water supply and their interactions on tree seedlings. It was (2) shown that a combined model could be used not only to predict individual height growth of beech seedlings in a controlled experiment but also in the field. The model parameters of a pure light response function for the controlled factorial experiment are comparable to those obtained in the field study. The results showed (3) that the precision of predicting beech seedlings height growth is comparable between the model types tested within this study. Approximately half of the observed variation in seedlings relative height growth rate could be explained. However, the simple competition index approach provides no information on the environmental factors constraining tree seedlings growth; whereas the multiplicative combined models can be used to get a better understanding of growth dynamics in the field." .

Of the remaining sites suitable for afforestation in China, 52 % are considered harsh and only 13 % considered good, which indicates that successfully establishing a plantation in the future will become more and more difficult. Seedling quality in terms of morphology, physiology, and viability is a critical aspect for successful plantation establishment. Due to a large area in need of afforestation, and because of its diverse harsh sites, many studies have focused on nursery techniques of promoting seedling stress resistance, including inoculating ectomycorrhizal fungi, applying plant growth regulators, use of fall fertilization, induced water stresses, or a combined use of these methods. Most of relevant results of this research have been published in Chinese, and are unknown to researchers from other countries. Moreover, no comprehensive review of stress resistance research in forest tree seedlings in China has been completed. Therefore, this review intends to provide a concise synthesis of literature related to plant manipulation techniques that offer seedling stress resistance in Chinese nurseries, discuss potential shortcomings of these studies, and define priorities for future seedling stress resistance research. With this paper we hope to enhance communication about nursery and plantation seedling culture among researchers from China and other countries." .

AbstractWhether the plasticity of foliage within the crown is driven by light or height is still not well known, especially for small trees. The present study was conducted in two loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands growing on two sites, during the third year after planting. The following traits were investigated in the lower and upper crowns of the same individuals twice per season (spring, summer, and autumn): photosynthesis (A sat), stomatal conductance (g s), intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEint), nitrogen concentration ***(N), specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE), fascicle diameter, and needles per fascicle. The trees were open-grown at the beginning of the study; thus, any vertical gradient of the traits was not assumed to be driven by light. Overall, A sat, g s, PNUE, and SLA tended to be higher in the lower than in the upper crown, whereas N, fascicle diameter, and needles per fascicle were higher in the upper than in the lower crown. However, although all traits were affected by crown position, the magnitude of this effect differed by season. The fact that crown position affected most of the traits in spring and summer, but not in autumn, suggest that height might be the main driver of foliage acclimation. However, considering that crown position affected SLA in autumn but not the photosynthetic rate or N concentration, it is possible that foliar acclimation of these traits was mainly driven by light in this season." .

Using discriminant function analysis, a 100% floristic and a 78% vegetation structural discrimination were obtained between the three forest types. However, the bird communities of these different forest types were very similar in species composition, and had much lower densities than those normally encountered in other, superficially similar forests. Although an 81% discrimination between forest types was attained through analysis of ground surface invertebrates, measures of litter and aerial invertebrate abundance were also of limited use as discriminators. Historical and biogeographic factors, as well as the low nutritional levels in the soil and vegetation may be the causes of low bird and invertebrate density and diversity. It is concluded that floristics and vegetation structure have, at best, a minor influence on bird community structure, and possibly also on invertebrate community structure in the Knysna Forest." .

Sixteen tress were used and the damage was distributed throughout the canopy in two ways. It was either randomly dispersed on the tree, or restricted to a localised region of the canopy. Up to 250 leaves/tree were damaged and the position of control leaves was marked as appropriate. At the end of the summer the experimental and control leaves were collected for analysis. Subsequent patterns of grazing by naturally-occurring herbivores were affected by the previous damage to the foliage. Fewer artificially-damaged leaves received subsequent insect grazing damage. The frequecy distribution of insect damage to previously-damaged leaves was significantly different from that of the control leaves, and less leaf tissue was removed from those experimental leaves which did receive subsequent insect attack. The evidence presented suggests that wound-induced changes in leaf palatability do occur in B. pubescens and B. pendula in the field and that a major role is to disperse the damage throughout the canopy." .

Forest trees in particular are renewable sources of food, fodder, fuel wood, timber and other valuable non-timber products. Due to the rapid growth of population and the human desire to progress, there has been a tremendous reduction in forest cover from the earth’s surface. To maintain and sustain forest vegetation, conventional approaches have been exploited in the past for propagation and improvement. However, such efforts are confronted with several inherent bottlenecks. Biotechnological interventions for in vitro regeneration, mass micropropagation and gene transfer methods in forest tree species have been practised with success, especially in the last decade. Against the background of the limitations of long juvenile phases and life span, development of plant regeneration protocols and genetic engineering of tree species are gaining importance. Genetic engineering assumes additional significance, because of the possibility of introducing a desired gene in a single step for precision breeding of forest trees. There are no comprehensive and detailed reviews available combining research developments with major emphases on tissue culture and basic genetic transformation in tree species. The present communication attempts to overview the progress in tissue culture, genetic transformation and biotechnological applications in the last decade and future implications." .

In a field study, we examined the effects of a tree invader, Acer platanoides (Norway maple, NM), on canopy structure and seedling growth in the understory of a North American deciduous forest. The experimental site contains a monospecific patch of A. platanoides and a mixed patch of A. platanoides with its native congener, A. rubrum (red maple, RM). In the study, we examined canopy characteristics of three types of trees in the forests, i.e., RM trees in the mixed forest, NM trees in the mixed forest, and NM trees in its monospecific patch. Height growth and biomass production of RM and NM seedlings under intact canopies and newly created gaps of the three types of trees were followed for two growing seasons. We found that removal of half of the canopy from focal trees increased canopy openness and light transmission to the forest floor, but to a greater extent under NM trees than under RM trees. Seedlings of these two Acer species varied greatly in biomass production under canopies of the same type of trees and in their responses to canopy opening. For example, seedlings of the exotic NM grown under the native RM trees in the mixed forests increased biomass production by 102.4% compared to NM seedlings grown under conspecific trees. The native RM seedlings grown under NM trees, however, reduced biomass production by 23.5% compared to those grown under conspecific trees. It was also observed that RM was much more responsive in biomass production to canopy opening than NM. For instance, total seedling biomass increased by 632.2% in RM, but by only 134.6% in NM in response to the newly created gaps. In addition, we found that NM seedlings allocated a greater portion of biomass below-ground as canopy openness increased, whereas the same trend was not observed in RM seedlings. Our results thus demonstrated that invasion of NM significantly altered canopy structure and community dynamics in the hardwood forest. Because the exotic NM seedlings are able to grow well under the native RM trees, but not vice versa, NM will likely expand its distribution in the forests and make it an ever increasingly serious tree invader in its non-native habitats, including North America." .

Species-specific vulnerability to drought mortality may alter patterns of species diversity and affect future forest composition. We have explored the consequences of the extreme drought of 2005, which caused high sapling mortality (approx. 50 %) among 10-year-old saplings of two coexisting pine species in the Mediterranean mountains of Sierra Nevada (Spain): boreo-alpine Pinus sylvestris and Mediterranean P. nigra. Sapling height growth, leaf δ13C and δ18O, and foliar nitrogen concentration in the four most recent leaf cohorts were measured in dead and surviving saplings. The foliar isotopic composition of dead saplings (which reflects time-integrated leaf gas-exchange until mortality) displayed sharp increases in both δ13C and δ18O during the extreme drought of 2005, suggesting an important role of stomatal conductance (gs) reduction and diffusional limitations to photosynthesis in mortality. While P. nigra showed decreased growth in 2005 compared to the previous wetter year, P. sylvestris maintained similar growth levels in both years. Decreased growth, coupled with a sharper increase in foliar δ18O during extreme drought in dead saplings, indicate a more conservative water use strategy for P. nigra. The different physiological behavior of the two pine species in response to drought (further supported by data from surviving saplings) may have influenced 2005 mortality rates, which contributed to 2.4-fold greater survival for P. nigra over the lifespan of the saplings. This species-specific vulnerability to extreme drought could lead to changes in dominance and distribution of pine species in Mediterranean mountain forests." .

Control experiments in which possible changes in adenylate pools during sample acquisition were investigated did not reveal significant differences between needles taken from branches in situ or within a 30-min period after cutting off a branch. In addition, pool sizes of ADP and ATP were not affected by changes in light intensity (between 60 and 1500 μE*-m-2*s-1), which inevitably occur when samples have to be taken from the upper region of older trees. Levels of ATP and ADP showed considerable seasonal changes (May through October) with the highest ratios of ATP/ADP in developing needles. In general, there was a tendency towards increased ratios of ATP/ADP with increasing needle age. This observation was corroborated by analyses of needles from spruce trees of different age and growing under different conditions. Needles from declining trees or from trees specifically fumigated with low concentrations of ozone and sulphur dioxide had significantly increased ratios of ATP/ADP compared to controls.

A small group of genera comprises a high proportion of the species richness for native Douglas-fir (i.e., Cortinarius, Inocybe, and Russula), whereas in native ponderosa pine, the species richness is more evenly distributed among several genera. The comparison between ectomycorrhizal species richness associated with both trees in native forests and in Patagonia (Argentina) shows far fewer species in the latter, with 18 taxa for the ponderosa pine and 15 for the Douglas-fir. Epigeous species richness is clearly dominant in native Douglas-fir, whereas a more balanced relation epigeous/hypogeous richness is observed for native ponderosa pine; a similar trend was observed for Patagonian plantations. Most fungi in Patagonian Douglas-fir plantations have not been recorded in plantations elsewhere, except Suillus lakei and Thelephora terrestris, and only 56% of the fungal taxa recorded in Douglas-fir plantations around the world are known from native forests, the other taxa being new associations for this host, suggesting that new tree + ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa associations are favored in artificial situations as plantations." .

To determine intrinsic population differences in productivity, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was measured in 16-year-old Scots pine from 19 geographically distinct populations grown in a common garden experiment in central Poland (52°N). The populations originated from the northern (>55°N), central (54–47°N), and southern (<45°N) European range of Scots pine. We calculated ANPP from aboveground growth components, using diameter-based allometric equations developed for this site. Average foliage, aboveground woody and total ANPP differed significantly among populations and were greater for central European populations than for the southern and northern ones. Stocking and total ANPP per tree were positively correlated to stand aboveground biomass (r 2≥0.71). The relationship between the latitude of seed origin and ANPP was curvilinear and maximum for populations originating near the planting site (52°N). ANPP declined in populations with increasing longitude eastward from the Atlantic Ocean towards the center of the continent. This study underscores the potentially large genetic control of ANPP and biomass accumulation among diverse Scots pine populations." .

The NDVI signal has been extracted from homogeneous vegetation patches and has been found to be distinct for deciduous and evergreen forest types, although the mixed-deciduous signal was close to the deciduous ones. To examine the decadal response of the satellite-measured vegetation phenology to climate variability, seven different NDVI metrics were calculated using the 11-year NDVI data. Results suggested strong spatial variability in forest NDVI metrics. Among the forest types studied, wet evergreen forests of north-east India had highest mean NDVI (0.692) followed by evergreen forests of the Western Ghats (0.529), mixed deciduous forests (0.519) and finally dry deciduous forests (0.421). The sum of NDVI (SNDVI) and the time-integrated NDVI followed a similar pattern, although the values for mixed deciduous forests were closer to those for evergreen forests of the Western Ghats. Dry deciduous forests had higher values of inter-annual range (RNDVI) and low mean NDVI, also coinciding with a high SD and thus a high coefficient of variation (CV) in NDVI (CVNDVI). SNDVI has been found to be high for wet evergreen forests of north-east India, followed by evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, mixed deciduous forests and dry deciduous forests. Further, the maximum NDVI values of wet evergreen forests of north-east India (0.624) coincided with relatively high annual total precipitation (2,238.9 mm). The time lags had a strong influence in the correlation coefficients between annual total rainfall and NDVI. The correlation coefficients were found to be comparatively high (R2=0.635) for dry deciduous forests than for evergreen forests and mixed deciduous forests, when the precipitation data with a lag of 30 days was correlated against NDVI. Using multiple regression approach models were developed for individual forest types using 16 different climatic indices. A high proportion of the temporal variance (>90%) has been accounted for by three of the precipitation parameters (maximum precipitation, precipitation of the wettest quarter and driest quarter) and two of the temperature parameters (annual mean temperature and temperature of the coldest quarter) for mixed deciduous forests. Similarly, in the case of deciduous forests, four precipitation parameters and three temperature parameters explained nearly 83.6% of the variance. These results suggest differences in the relationship between NDVI and climatic variables based upon the time of growing season, time interval and climatic indices over which they were summed. These results have implications for forest cover mapping and monitoring in tropical regions of India." .

The relationships showed two phases: leaf increasing and stationary phases. In the leaf-increasing phase, the height growth allowed these species to expand the canopy by increasing the number of leaves. In the stationary phase, the number of leaves was relatively constant number irrespective of tree height from 160 to 400 cm. The number of leaves in the stationary phase represents the maximum number of leaves that can be supported by trees under shady conditions. From the analyses of vertical distributions of leaves in six species, mono- and multi-layer foliage distributions were detected. Two evergreen species, Eurya japonica and Cleyera japonica, showed multi-layer foliage distributions, whereas three deciduous species, Lyonia ovalifolia, Rhododendron reticulatum and Vaccinium hirtum, and one evergreen species, Pieris japonica, showed mono-layer foliage distributions. The relationships between the weights of non-photosynthetic and photosynthetic organs of the six species were examined. The proportion of non-photosynthetic organs increased with tree height. The understory species attained the stationary phase and were maintained by minimizing their investment in non-photosynthetic organs, i.e. their height growth was arrested by the shady conditions under the crown trees." .

An understanding of the relationship between forest carbon (C) stock, and environmental conditions and forest structure enable prediction of the impacts of climate change on C stocks and help to define management strategies that maximize the value of forests for C mitigation. Based on the national forest inventory of Spain (1997–2008 with 70,912 plots), we estimated the forest C stock and spatial variability in Peninsular Spain and, we determined the extent to which the observed patterns of stand C stock can be explained by structural and species richness, climate and disturbances. Spain has an average stand C stock of 45.1 Mg C/ha. Total C stock in living biomass is 621 Tg C (7.8% of the C stock of European forests). The statistical models show that structural richness, which is driven by past land use and life forest history including age, development stage, management activities, and disturbance regime, is the main predictor of stand tree C stock with larger C stocks in structurally richer stands. Richness of broadleaf species has a positive effect on both conifer and broadleaf forests, whereas richness of conifer species shows no significant or even a negative effect on C stock. Climate variables have mainly an indirect effect through structural richness but a smaller direct predictive ability when all predictors are considered. To achieve a greater standing C stock, our results suggest promoting high structural richness by managing for uneven-aged stands and favoring broadleaf over conifer species." .

The trees chosen were morphologically very similar: Caesalpinia echinata Lam. and Caesalpinia ferrea Mart. ex. Tul., both 10–20 m of height, of the sub-family Caesalpinioideae, and the somewhat smaller, 2–4 m tall, Machaerium obovatum Kuhlm. & Hoehne of the sub-family Faboideae. Despite their similarities with respect to their geographic distribution restricted to Brazilian dry forests, their comparable abundance in the study site and their phylogenetic proximity, the three species display distinctly different ecophysiological behaviour. Compared to the other two species, C. ferrea had the highest photosynthetic capacity (maximum apparent photosynthetic electron transport rate, ETRmax) and higher saturation light-intensity, was less subject to photoinhibition as indicated by potential quantum yield of photosystem II (F v/F m) and had the lowest bulk N content of which soluble non-protein N compounds were only 1.5%. It showed stronger sun plant characteristics. C. echinata had lower photosynthetic capacity, was under chronic photoinhibition and had high bulk N content of which 6.1% were soluble N compounds with high concentrations of proline. In addition to proline, high concentrations of sugars may serve as osmoprotectants. M. obovatum also showed lower photosynthetic capacity and was under chronic photoinhibition. Here, arginine may have a function as osmoprotectant. The ecophysiological differences between the three species are not related to local abundance. However, the observations presented highlight a contrasting behaviour of the otherwise very similar compatriot species." .

Field studies were done to examine the relative importance of several of these factors in the establishment and early survival of Ceriops tagal, a species common in mid-to high-shore regions of mangrove forests in northern Australia. The fate of marked and tethered propagules was followed to estimate the range of dispersal and the intensity of predation. Propagules were artificially planted under different thicknesses of shade cloth (none, 30%, 80%) and in different habitats (clearing, forest, clearing-forest fringe) to examine the effects of light and soil conditions on survival and growth. Results suggested that dispersal was very limited: only 9% of marked propagules were ever found more than 3 m from the parent tree. Losses to predators were great, with 83% of tethered propagules being damaged or consumed within 3 months. On average, 56% of planted propagules survived for at least 6 weeks and 76% of these initiated growth. Survival in clearings was lower than in other habitats, with 29% fewer surviving six weeks and 48% fewer surviving 15 months. The growth of seedlings was correlated with soil temperature, but the effects of treatments were complex. Overall, results indicated that poor dispersal and establishment were the main factors likely to limit the colonisation and population growth of this species." .

Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change. In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range, isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area declined by 66%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements. Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline, although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence." .

Two groups of seeds were collected: control seeds collected from plastic net hanging 2 m above the ground and forest floor seeds collected on the forest floor. Before planting, 15 seeds from each group were observed for basidiospores attached to the seed. Ten of the 3-week-old S. leprosula seedlings of each group were individually grown in 1.5 kg of sterile zeolite for 8 months in a greenhouse. Pots were fertilized with MMN solution containing half the strength of phosphate. Fungal identity, ectomycorrhizal root tip colonization and anatomy, plant growth, and phosphate uptake were measured. The control seeds did not have basidiospores attached, whereas the forest floor seeds had 2 × 105 basidiospores of Tomentella. Bioassay test results indicate that the seedlings from the control seeds did not form ectomycorrhiza, whereas those seedlings from the forest floor seeds formed 3 morphotypes of ectomycorrhizae. Based on ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 rDNA region analyses, the 3 morphotypes belonged to Tomentella sp. HBT2, Tomentella sp. HBT4, and Scleroderma sp. HBS3. Root colonization percentage was above 70% for all three morphotypes. Root colonization in general increased plant growth and phosphate uptake. This is the first report of Tomentella basidiospores attached on the seed surface as a functional inoculum and of Tomentella ectomycorrhiza from dipterocarps lowland tropical forest." .

In contrast, satellite estimates of LAI have shown promise for large-scale and long-term studies, but their performance has been equivocal and the biases are not well known. We measured total, overstory, and understory LAI of an Amazon-savanna transitional forest (ASTF) over 3 years and a seasonal flooded forest (SFF) during 4 years using a light extinction method and two remote sensing methods (LAI MODIS product and the Landsat-METRIC method), with the objectives of (1) evaluating the performance of the remote sensing methods, and (2) understanding how total, overstory and understory LAI interact with micrometeorological variables. Total, overstory and understory LAI differed between both sites, with ASTF having higher LAI values than SFF, but neither site exhibited year-to-year variation in LAI despite large differences in meteorological variables. LAI values at the two sites have different patterns of correlation with micrometeorological variables. ASTF exhibited smaller seasonal variations in LAI than SFF. In contrast, SFF exhibited small changes in total LAI; however, dry season declines in overstory LAI were counteracted by understory increases in LAI. MODIS LAI correlated weakly to total LAI for SFF but not for ASTF, while METRIC LAI had no correlation to total LAI. However, MODIS LAI correlated strongly with overstory LAI for both sites, but had no correlation with understory LAI. Furthermore, LAI estimates based on canopy light extinction were correlated positively with seasonal variations in rainfall and soil water content and negatively with vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation; however, in some cases satellite-derived estimates of LAI exhibited no correlation with climate variables (METRIC LAI or MODIS LAI for ASTF). These data indicate that the satellite-derived estimates of LAI are insensitive to the understory variations in LAI that occur in many seasonal tropical forests and the micrometeorological variables that control seasonal variations in leaf phenology. While more ground-based measurements are needed to adequately quantify the performance of these satellite-based LAI products, our data indicate that their output must be interpreted with caution in seasonal tropical forests." .

This shift in land-use has released large areas that are now dominated by early-successional forests with limited mid- and late-successional species regeneration. Enrichment underplanting, with the partial preservation of the existing vegetation to serve as a shelterwood, has been proposed to restore the production of valuable timber. The present study reports mid-term (8–12 year) results from an enrichment planting experiment located at two sites in the St-Lawrence River Valley, eastern Canada. The objective was to identify the required frequency of low-intensity thinnings necessary to secure an optimal density of promising stems of black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) and red oak (Quercus rubra L.). Partial thinning treatments were applied during the 3rd and 7th growing seasons and compared to a single thinning applied at the 7th year. Each thinning treatment increased available light to 20–30 % in the understory (measured the following year at 2 m from ground level). The height of red oaks released twice was almost double that of red oaks thinned only once. The effect on black cherry was less dramatic and significant only at one of the two sites. A higher intensity or an earlier application of thinning regimes may be required for black cherry. The early thinning allowed a larger number of planted trees to react positively to the second thinning. The practice of double thinning over a period of 12 years allowed for the production of a significant number of competitively successful trees for the landowner." .

Endl., Croton macrostachys Hochst. ex. Del.] and two exotic tree species (Eucalyptus globulus Labille., Cupressus lusitanica Miller) growing in the same location in the montane Munessa State Forest, southern Ethiopia. Stem flow was measured with Granier type thermal dissipation probes. Sap flux, normalized per unit sapwood area, and the total sapwood areas of the particular trees were used to estimate daily transpiration. Maximum daily transpiration values (60 kg water) were recorded for Croton when at full foliage. After shedding most of its leaves in the dry season transpiration was reduced to 8 kg per day. Eucalyptus had the next highest transpiration (55 kg), in this case at the peak of the dry season. It transpired 4–5 times more than Podocarpus and Cupressus trees of similar size. Maximum stem flux density was tree-size dependent only in Croton. Diurnal patterns of stem flux indicated that Croton, Eucalyptus and Podocarpus, in contrast to Cupressus, responded more directly to light than to atmospheric water pressure deficit. At high VPD (>1.0 kPa) stem flux reached a plateau in Croton and Podocarpus indicating stomatal limitation. Per unit leaf area Croton had the highest and Podocarpus and Cupressus the lowest daily transpiration rates. In summary, the pioneer tree Croton had the lowest and Podocarpus the highest water use efficiency. The contribution of the study to the understanding of the role of each tree species in the hydrology of the natural forest and the plantations is discussed." .

Tree displacement at TW was measured during periods of consistent wind direction with three mean wind speeds (1.9, 4.6, and 5.4 m/s) and for two mean wind speeds at CH (5.0 and 7.9 m/s). Spectral analysis of sway displacement data showed a decrease in the frequency with wind speed for trees at TW, but remained unchanged for trees at CH. Significant correlations between tree sway frequency and amplitude during high winds at TW indicate a loss of sway energy concomitant with the occurrence of high collision intensity. These observations support the hypothesis that inter-crown collisions have an important influence on the sway frequency of trees and should be incorporated into efforts to model their sway dynamics. We also present a theoretical collision-damped sway model which supports our empirical findings." .

AbstractClimate warming increasingly limits the productivity of boreal forests via increased drought stress, especially at the southern fringe of the biome. The southernmost boreal forests are exposed to more intensive human disturbance than most forests at more northern latitudes. We asked the question of how forest use through logging and moderate forest grazing interferes with the climate response of the annual radial stem increment. We conducted a case study in Larix sibirica stands of the Mongolian forest–steppe involving two neighboring forest regions (20 km distance) differing in logging and grazing intensity. One site was subjected to heavy logging until 25 years ago and low intensity of livestock grazing; another site was exposed to moderate selective logging and higher, but still moderate livestock numbers. While the differences in grazing had no detectable effect, former heavy logging led to younger and more even-aged forest stands. Forests at both sites showed recent increases in missing-ring frequency, which probably indicated increased drought vulnerability. Climate-response analysis indicated that heavy logging 25 years ago was associated with high sensitivity of stemwood formation to high summer (especially June) temperatures. These findings suggest that: (1) recent logging under the conditions of climate warming has increased the sensitivity of tree growth to temperature in these southern boreal forests; (2) high replication at the stand level is needed to avoid bias in dendrochronological analyses in regions exposed to spatially heterogeneous logging intensities." .

The LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyser was used to measure the stem area index of growing willow and relate it to harvestable biomass at four locations within Saskatchewan, Canada over a 3-year period. Given the highly significant relationship (R 2 = 0.95; P < 0.0001) between measured stem area index and harvestable willow biomass, independent of variety, age, or location, this simple mensurative technique is a promising alternative for estimating above ground biomass in short-rotation willow plantations." .

AbstractTo increase the understanding of forest management to control water cycles, we examined the effect of 50% strip thinning on evapotranspiration (ET) and its partitioning into canopy interception (E i), tree transpiration (E t), and forest floor evaporation (E f) in a Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl.) plantation. Intensive measurements were employed to monitor each component of ET during the pre- and post-thinning periods. The results showed the annual E t was the dominant component of ET followed by E i, whereas E f was the smallest component in both periods. Thinning has significant impact on the process of ET partitioning. In such that it decreased from 42.3 to 33.7% in E i/ET and from 45.0 to 34.9% in E t/ET, and increased from 12.7 to 31.4% in E f/ET on an annual scale. The relative contributions of each ET component to the whole ET became more or less the same after thinning. Additionally, the monthly E i/P g had relative stable values in both pre- and post-thinning periods, contributing significantly to the ET/P g during heavy rainfall conditions. After thinning, ET decreased by 21.4% from 629.3 to 494.8 mm during the growing season and by 20.4% from 979.8 to 780.1 mm at the annual scale, demonstrating that thinning results in an increase in water availability in the forested watershed. This study can improve the understanding of forest water budget in response to thinning and aid in development of appropriate forest management practices accordingly." .

In lower montane forests in western Panama, the EM tree species Oreomunnea mexicana (Juglandaceae) forms locally dense populations in forest otherwise characterized by trees that form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations. The objective of this study was to compare the composition of EM fungal communities associated with Oreomunnea adults, saplings, and seedlings across sites differing in soil fertility and the amount and seasonality of rainfall. Analysis of fungal nrITS DNA (nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers) revealed 115 EM fungi taxa from 234 EM root tips collected from adults, saplings, and seedlings in four sites. EM fungal communities were equally species-rich and diverse across Oreomunnea developmental stages and sites, regardless of soil conditions or rainfall patterns. However, ordination analysis revealed high compositional turnover between low and high fertility/rainfall sites located ca. 6 km apart. The EM fungal community was dominated by Russula (ca. 36 taxa). Cortinarius, represented by 14 species and previously reported to extract nitrogen from organic sources under low nitrogen availability, was found only in low fertility/high rainfall sites. Phylogenetic diversity analyses of Russula revealed greater evolutionary distance among taxa found on sites with contrasting fertility and rainfall than was expected by chance, suggesting that environmental differences among sites may be important in structuring EM fungal communities. More research is needed to evaluate whether EM fungal taxa associated with Oreomunnea form mycorrhizal networks that might account for local dominance of this tree species in otherwise diverse forest communities." .

Planting of beech in old Scots pine plantations could facilitate the extension of adjoining small natural populations of beech in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. To be successful the survival and growth of seedlings after outplanting must be compatible with microclimatic conditions within thinned pine woods. The present paper deals with water relations in beech seedlings following the variation of available radiation and water as a result of thinning. The seedlings were established under an old Scots pine plantation. After pine felling, four situations were generated in terms of radiation. Hemispherical photographs were taken, and global relative irradiance was calculated for every treatment. During two growing seasons predawn water potential (Ψpd) was measured and leaf water parameters were derived from P–V curves. The Ψpd diminished through the season in all four situations, and the highest values were found when pine density was lowest. Osmotic potential at turgor lost (Ψπo) was higher in early summer. A negative relationship was found between osmotic potential at full turgor (Ψπ full) and symplast solute content on a dry weight basis (Ns). Under the lowest irradiance (unthinned pine trees), Ψπ full and Ψπ o were the highest and the bulk modulus of elasticity (εmax) the lowest; εmax decreased in response to the lowest Ψpd measured at the end of summer 1998. It was followed by a reduction in the symplastic relative water content and Ns, irrespective of the irradiance. Osmotic adjustment, as a drought tolerance mechanism, was limited under shade conditions (unthinned pine trees), restricting the acclimation of beech seedlings to drought. Therefore, the presence of overstory, necessary for a successful implantation, should not be extended for too many years because of the risk of negative effects on growth and survival, particularly after frequent dry summers." .

Quantum sensors were placed throughout the crowns of saplings up to 2.5 m tall and quantum fluxes were recorded with microloggers for seven-day periods. The shade-intolerant species had total quantum flux densities 35% larger than those of the shade-tolerant species, but totals for both species were less than 2% of full sun. More than 90% of the quantum flux densities measured within the crowns of both species were less than 25 μmol m-2s-1. Lateral light was an important component of daily quantum flux totals; for saplings of both species, the half-hour with the maximum average irradiance for the day frequently occurred in mid-morning or midafternoon. Despite dissimilar crown and leaf display, there was no difference in the overall variability of irradiance within the crowns of the two species. However, quantum fluxes received within the crowns differed substantially in both species. Within-crown locations differed significantly from day to day because of variation in weather conditions.

We present a technique to measure the simultaneous sway of a group of trees and reconstruct the frequency of crown collisions and sway dynamics of individual or groups of trees. We placed a biaxial clinometer (tiltmeter) at the live crown base in each of ten neighboring 15-m-tall lodgepole pine trees in Alberta, Canada. Tree bole rotation at tiltmeter mount height was recorded during windy conditions at a rate of 10 times/s for the cluster of trees. Rotation angles were used in a bole curve calculation to estimate tree displacement in 2-dimensional (x, y) space. Collision reconstruction was done in Arc/Info by assigning asymmetrical crown area dimensions (polygons) to calculated bole displacement for each tree. Reconstruction of each time step measured any overlaps between crown polygon areas. Crown polygon overlaps estimated in this manner allowed assessment of collision frequencies, area of crown overlap during collisions, and identification of the tree(s) that a subject tree contacted. Collision statistics are only given for trees interior to the sensored cluster (n=3). For 15.0 min of data with an average wind speed of 4.5 m/s and a maximum of 10.0 m/s there was an average of 65 collisions/min for each tree, and an average collision overlap area of 24%. This frequency and depth of collisions supports the notion that wind-induced crown interaction inhibits lateral shoot extension and is an important mechanism for the development of crown asymmetry and crown shyness. Insight into dynamic tree sway behavior and crown interactions will allow estimation and cultivation of a forest stand structure that is more resistant to damage from wind. The techniques of recording multiple simultaneous bole sway and their reconstruction are applicable to a broad range of wind-forest interaction research." .

Such extreme environments constitute potentially valuable monitoring sites of the effects of climate warming on high-elevation forests. Here, we analyze a network of 21 Smith fir forests situated in the Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, using tree-ring width (TRW) and basal area increment (BAI) chronologies. Sampled sites encompassed a wide elevation gradient, from 3600 to 4400 m, including some treeline sites and diverse aspects and tree ages. In comparison with TRW series, BAI series better capture the long-term warming signal. Previous November and current April and summer temperatures are the dominant climatic factors controlling Smith fir radial growth. The mean inter-series correlations of TRW increased upwards, but the forest limit presented the highest potential to reconstruct past temperature variability. Moreover, the growth responses of young trees were less stable than those of trees older than 100 years. Climate warming is accelerating radial growth of Smith fir forest subjected to mesic conditions. Collectively, these findings confirm that the effects of site elevation and tree age should be considered when quantifying climate-growth relationships. The type of tree-ring data (BAI vs. TRW) is also relevant since BAI indices seem to be a better climatic proxy of low-frequency temperature signals than TRW indices. Therefore, site (e.g., elevation) and tree (e.g., age) features should be considered to properly evaluate the effects of climate warming on growth of high-elevation forests." .

Here, we investigate how a forest–grassland mosaic changed over the past 10,000 years at the southernmost limit of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We used soil organic matter carbon isotopes (δ13C and 14C) to quantify and date changes in vegetation, examining soil properties and leaf traits of tree species (nutrient content, δ13C, δ15N, and specific leaf area—SLA) to describe potential mechanisms of expansion. Our results show that after several millennia of stability, forests have been expanding over grasslands through continuous, but very slow, border dynamics and patch formation (<100 m since ~4,000 YBP). This process of expansion coincided with past changes in climate, but biotic feedback mechanisms also appear to be important for the long-term persistence and expansion of forests. Soil fertility and microbial biomass match current rather than past vegetation distribution, increasing progressively across the gradient: grasslands < isolated trees < forest patches < forests. Foliar δ15N values of trees that are able to colonize the grassland are consistently lower across this vegetation gradient, suggesting an increasingly greater reliance on symbiotic nutrient uptake from grasslands to forests. No significant relationships were found between soil and leaf nutrients, but SLA explained variation in leaf N, P, and K (positive relationships) and in leaf δ13C (negative relationship). These findings suggest that a tradeoff between tree growth and water use efficiency is an important regulator of forest–grassland dynamics in the study region." .

Responses to these changes will be expressed most strongly in seedlings near current species range boundaries. In northern temperate forest ecosystems, where changes are already being observed, ectomycorrhizal fungi contribute significantly to successful tree establishment. We hypothesised that communities of fungal symbionts might therefore play a role in facilitating, or limiting, host seedling range expansion. To test this hypothesis, ectomycorrhizal communities of interior Douglas-fir and interior lodgepole pine seedlings were analysed in a common greenhouse environment following growth in five soils collected along an ecosystem gradient. Currently, Douglas-fir’s natural distribution encompasses three of the five soils, whereas lodgepole pine’s extends much further north. Host filtering was evident amongst the 29 fungal species encountered: 7 were shared, 9 exclusive to Douglas-fir and 13 exclusive to lodgepole pine. Seedlings of both host species formed symbioses with each soil fungal community, thus Douglas-fir did so even where those soils came from outside its current distribution. However, these latter communities displayed significant taxonomic and functional differences to those found within the host distribution, indicative of habitat filtering. In contrast, lodgepole pine fungal communities displayed high functional similarity across the soil gradient. Taxonomic and/or functional shifts in Douglas-fir fungal communities may prove ecologically significant during the predicted northward migration of this species; especially in combination with changes in climate and management operations, such as seed transfer across geographical regions for forestry purposes." .

When beech trees are young and stem density is low, the level of radiation inside the ecosystem reaching the soil surface is high; consequently, air and soil temperatures rise and the soil water content may decrease. These microclimatic parameters presumably will affect the anatomy, photosynthesis, and carbon metabolism of beech leaves. We studied the morphology and physiology of sun and shade leaves of beech trees differing in age and growing within clear-cut areas with distinct microclimate. Results were compared with those of adult trees in an unmanaged forest. We selected a stand clear-cut in 2001 (14,000 trees ha−1), another clear-cut in 1996 (44,000 trees ha−1) and an unmanaged forest (1,000 trees ha−1). Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on sun leaves, air temperature, soil moisture, and soil temperature within the forests affected water status and carbohydrate storage in all trees. As trees became older, PPFD also influenced pigment composition and Rubisco activity in sun leaves. On the other hand, shade leaves from the oldest trees were the most sensitive to PPFD, air temperature, and soil moisture and temperature inside the forest. Contrariwise, microclimatic parameters slightly affected the physiology of shade leaves of the beech in the stand with the highest light attenuation. Air and soil temperatures were the parameters that most affected the photosynthetic pigments and carbohydrate storage in shade leaves of the youngest trees." .

Forestry and wood industry lack suitable means for maximising the yield of light timber, since the intra-tree extent of red heartwood varies considerably. The present study characterised in detail the intra-tree shape of red heartwood and its relationships to tree-external traits (dead branches, branch scars), considered as possible initiation points of red heartwood formation. An experimental method based on log scanning and image analysis was developed and applied. Using its output for three-dimensional visualisation and data analyses, external traits being linked to the local red heartwood shape were identified.

Two disturbed sites, a single tree fall gap (400 m2) and an 0.5 hectare clearing, were compared for periods up to two years after disturbance. Two locations in primary forest, the canopy and understory, were also monitored. Temperatures were highest in the clearing, intermediate in the canopy and gap which were similar, and lowest in the understory. Vapor pressure deficits (VPD) were highest in the clearing, followed by the canopy, the gap and the understory. With regrowth of the vegetation in the gap and clearing sites, the temperatures and vapor pressure deficits significantly decreased. After 1 year, the microclimate at seedling height in the clearing resembled that of the gap, and after two years the microclimate of the gap was very similar to that of the understory. Seasonal differences in temperature and VPD were small compared to differences caused by changes in the stature of the vegetation." .

The phenology of the boreal forests is mainly driven by temperature, affecting the timing of the start of the growing season and thereby its duration, and the level of frost hardiness and thereby the reduction of foliage area and photosynthetic capacity by severe frost events. The phenology of temperate-zone forests is also mainly driven by temperature. Since temperate-zone forests are mostly mixed-species deciduous forests, differences in phenological response may affect competition between tree species. The phenology of Mediterranean coniferous forests is mainly driven by water availability, affecting the development of leaf area, rather than the timing of phenological events. These phenological models were subsequently coupled to the process-based forest model FORGRO to evaluate the effect of different climate change scenarios on growth. The results indicate that the phenology of each of the forest types significantly affects the growth response to a given climate change scenario. The absolute responses presented in this study should, however, be used with caution as there are still uncertainties in the phenological models, the growth models, the parameter values obtained and the climate change scenarios used. Future research should attempt to reduce these uncertainties. It is recommended that phenological models that describe the mechanisms by which seasonality in climatic drivers affects the phenological aspects of trees should be developed and carefully tested. Only by using such models may we make an assessment of the impact of climate change on the functioning and productivity of different forest ecosystems." .

The forest inventory is very important because it allows the trading of medium- and long-term timber to be extracted. On completion , the inventory is necessary to measure different diameters and total height to calculate their volumes. However, due to the high number of trees and their heights, these measurements are an extremely time consuming and expensive. In this work, a new approach to predict recursively diameters of eucalyptus trees by means of Multilayer Perceptron artificial neural networks is presented. By taking only three diameter measures at the base of the tree, diameters are predicted recursively until they reach the value of 4 cm, with no previous knowledge of total tree height. The training was conducted with only 10% of the total trees planted site, and the remaining 90% of total trees were used for testing. The Smalian method was used with the predicted diameters to calculate merchantable tree volumes. To check the performance of the model, all experiments were compared with the least square polynomial approximator and the diameters and volumes estimates with both methods were compared with the actual values measured. The performance of the proposed model was satisfactory when predicted diameters and volumes are compared to actual ones." .

Karst. stand produced as much foliage and branches as a healthy stand but less stemwood at a similar leaf area index and climate. Nutrient analyses revealed that most biomass components at the declining site had lower concentrations of calcium and magnesium, but similar nitrogen and potassium (except for lower potassium in younger needles) and higher phosphorus, manganese and aluminum than the respective components at the healthy site. Comparison of these data with the results from studies on the nutrition and growth of P. abies seedlings (Ingestad 1959) led to the conclusion that the healthy stand is in a balanced nutritional state, while trees at the declining stand have only 56% of the foliar magnesium concentration required to permit growth at a rate which could be achieved at their nitrogen status. It appears that acidic deposition, which involves an input of nitrogen and a leaching of cations from the soil, causes an imbalance in the availability of nitrogen and magnesium. Growth is eventually reduced as magnesium becomes limiting." .

Here we summarize what we know about the maximum rooting depth of species belonging to the major terrestrial biomes. We found 290 observations of maximum rooting depth in the literature which covered 253 woody and herbaceous species. Maximum rooting depth ranged from 0.3 m for some tundra species to 68 m for Boscia albitrunca in the central Kalahari; 194 species had roots at least 2 m deep, 50 species had roots at a depth of 5 m or more, and 22 species had roots as deep as 10 m or more. The average for the globe was 4.6±0.5 m. Maximum rooting depth by biome was 2.0±0.3 m for boreal forest. 2.1±0.2 m for cropland, 9.5±2.4 m for desert, 5.2±0.8 m for sclerophyllous shrubland and forest, 3.9±0.4 m for temperate coniferous forest, 2.9±0.2 m for temperate deciduous forest, 2.6±0.2 m for temperate grassland, 3.7±0.5 m for tropical deciduous forest, 7.3±2.8 m for tropical evergreen forest, 15.0±5.4 m for tropical grassland/savanna, and 0.5±0.1 m for tundra. Grouping all the species across biomes (except croplands) by three basic functional groups: trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, the maximum rooting depth was 7.0±1.2 m for trees, 5.1±0.8 m for shrubs, and 2.6±0.1 m for herbaceous plants. These data show that deep root habits are quite common in woody and herbaceous species across most of the terrestrial biomes, far deeper than the traditional view has held up to now. This finding has important implications for a better understanding of ecosystem function and its application in developing ecosystem models." .

Data from long-term vegetation plots (1990–1997) and aerial photographs (1998) indicated that this 1996 storm caused patchy disturbance of intermediate severity (10–50% tree mortality; Woods, J Ecol 92:464–476, 2004). The area in large disturbance patches (>0.1 ha) increased from <1% to approximately 4% of the forested landscape. Of the forty-two 0.1-ha plots that were studied, 23 were damaged by the storm and lost 1–66% of their original live basal area. Although the remaining 19 plots gained basal area (1–15% increase), across all 42 stands basal area decreased by 17% because of storm impacts. Overall mortality of trees >10 cm dbh was 18%. The basal area of standing dead trees after the storm was 0.9 m2/ha, which was not substantially different from the original value of 0.7 m2/ha. In contrast, the volume and mass of fallen dead trees after the storm (129 m3/ha; 55 Mg/ha) were 6.1 and 7.9 times greater than the original levels (21 m3/ha; 7 Mg/ha), respectively. Uprooting was the most frequent type of damage, and it increased with tree size. However, two other forms of injury, severe canopy breakage and toppling by other trees, decreased with increasing tree size. Two dominant oak species of intermediate shade-tolerance suffered the largest losses in basal area (30–41% lost). Before the storm they comprised almost half of the total basal area in a forest of 13% shade-tolerant, 69% intermediate, and 18% shade-intolerant trees. Recovery is expected to differ with respect to vegetation (e.g., species composition and diversity) and ecosystem properties (e.g., biomass, detritus mass, and carbon balance). Vegetation may not revert to its former composition; however, reversion of biomass, detritus mass, and carbon balance to pre-storm conditions is projected to occur within a few decades. For example, the net change in ecosystem carbon balance may initially be negative from losses to decomposition, but it is expected to be positive within a decade after the storm. Repeated intermediate-disturbance events of this nature would likely have cumulative effects, particularly on vegetation properties." .

In this study, we tested generalized empirical equations in a widely applied partitioning concept based on compartment-specific biomass allometries. For an 88-year chronosequence of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Austria, we used the individual-based hybrid forest model PICUS v1.4 to compare simulations employing foliage biomass functions at different levels of generalization against runs with site-specific parameterization and observations. Sensitivities of the individual tree model were generally in line with the original stand-level partitioning concept and ecological process understanding. While stand-level leaf area increased with increasing allocation to foliage, net primary productivity showed no significant response due to saturated radiation interception in the dense chronosequence stands. Strong sensitivities were revealed at the individual tree level, where favoring allocation to the foliage compartment resulted in increasing asymmetry of competition and height–diameter relationships. Applying a generalized parameterization based on data from the full range of continental species distribution resulted in a significant overestimation of mean tree height and subsequently standing volume stock at the chronosequence. At a lower hierarchical level of generality, however, simulations with a representative regional parameterization performed satisfactorily compared to model runs using the site-specific allometry. In relation to common accuracy demands, e.g., in forest management decision support, the study suggests the rejection of a generic parameterization while corroborating the use of regional generalizations in ecosystem models." .

Four different management scenarios were used: business as usual and three adaptive management scenarios characterized by an intensification of interventions: more intense thinnings and shorter rotations. The total biomass at the end of the simulation differed greatly according to the climate scenario but was comparatively much less influenced by the management scenarios. Forest biomass was projected to increase markedly under the model which forecast the lowest climate change (CCSM3), remained approximately constant in the intermediate climate model (ECHAM5) but decreased severely in the hypothesis of the largest climate changes (HadCM3). Our results showed that developments in species composition differed much more between climate change scenarios than between management scenarios. Under moderate and intermediate climate scenarios, changes in species composition occurred principally in harvested stands, while stands not harvested did not display species replacements. Under extreme climate change (HadCM3) on the other hand, the species change occurred even before harvest. The model projections highlight the inadequacy of some species for the new growing and regeneration conditions that accompany the extreme climate scenario. Harvesting can be seen as a chance to undergo active adaptation with respect to species composition." .

The quantitative assessment of mountain forest ES for management planning and decision support is a particular challenge, due to manifold involved spatial scales from tree to slope and landscape level. We present an assessment framework to analyze and communicate the effect of management and climate change on the provision of selected ES in mountain forests. Core element is the spatially explicit hybrid forest ecosystem model PICUS. Remote sensing data and inventories are combined to generate realistic fine-grained forest landscapes with single tree resolution as input to PICUS. Landscape-level planning of silvicultural prescriptions employs geographic information systems functionalities (locate skyline corridors and treatment areas, prescribe silvicultural operations based on tree-level attributes) and produces management maps, which are interpreted by PICUS and executed in course of simulation runs. Model output is imported into a spatially explicit landscape assessment tool to assess the protective effect of vegetation. In a 250 ha case study in the Eastern Alps in Austria, the assessment framework is demonstrated to evaluate effects of climate change and management on timber production and protection against landslides and snow avalanche release. Climate change had, depending on climate and management scenario both, positive and negative impacts on desired ES. Key factor for ES provisioning in the case study was the interaction of bark beetle disturbances, legacies of past land-use practices and forest management." .

Exotic fast growing trees (i.e., Australian Acacia species) have subsequently been introduced for soil improvement and fuelwood production purposes. Additionally, rhizobial or mycorrhizal symbioses have sometimes been favored by means of controlled inoculations to increase the performance of these exotic trees in such arid and semiarid zones. Large-scale anthropogenic introduction of exotic plants could also threaten the native biodiversity and ecosystem resilience. We carried out an experimental reforestation in Burkina Faso in order to study the effects of Acacia holosericea mycorrhizal inoculation on the soil nutrient content, microbial soil functionalities and mycorrhizal soil potential. Treatments consisted of uninoculated A. holosericea, preplanting fertilizer application and arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation with Glomus intraradices. Our results showed that (i) arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation and prefertilizer application significantly improved A. holosericea growth after 4 years of plantation and (ii) the introduction of A. holosericea trees significantly modified soil microbial functions. The results clearly showed that the use of exotic tree legume species should be directly responsible for important changes in soil microbiota with great disturbances in essential functions driven by microbial communities (e.g., catabolic diversity and C cycling, phosphatase activity and P availability). They also highlighted the importance of AM symbiosis in the functioning of soils and forest plantation performances. The AM effect on soil functions was significantly correlated with the enhanced mycorrhizal soil potential recorded in the AM inoculation treatment." .

Biomass, 15N uptake and partitioning and total N concentrations of beech seedlings were determined. Site and thinning produced clear differences, particularly at the end of the growing season. Biomass and cumulative 15N uptake of beech seedlings then increased due to thinning on the NE site and decreased on the SW site. Total N concentrations in leaves, roots and stems of beech seedlings responded similarly. Therefore, growth and N status of beech seedlings are found to be favoured by thinning under cool-moist conditions.

AbstractThe aim of this study was to examine if temperature conditions potentially causing frost damage have an effect on radial growth in Norway spruce and Scots pine in Finland. We hypothesized that frost damage occurs and reduces radial growth after (1) extreme cold winter temperatures, (2) frost hardiness levels insufficient to minimum temperatures, and (3) the lack of insulating snow cover during freezing temperatures, resulting in increased frost and decreased temperatures in soil. Meteorological records were used to define variables describing the conditions of each hypothesis and a dynamic frost hardiness model was used to find events of insufficient frost hardiness levels. As frost damage is likely to occur only under exceptional conditions, we used generalized extreme value distributions to describe the frost variables. Our results did not show strong connections between radial growth and the frost damage events. However, significant growth reductions were found at some Norway spruce sites after events insufficient frost hardiness levels, and alternatively, after winters with high frost sum of snowless days. Scots pine did not show significant growth reductions associated with any of the studied variables. Thus, radial growth in Norway spruce may be more sensitive to future changes in winter conditions. Our results demonstrate that considering only temperature is unlikely to be sufficient in studying winter temperature effects on tree growth. Instead, understanding the effects of changing temperature and snow conditions in relation to tree physiology and phenology is needed." .

However, spatial patterns in leaf trait diversity are rarely investigated and poorly resolved. We used a hierarchical approach to evaluate vertical variability in leaf morphology (i.e., leaf trait diversity) in 16 common tree and shrub species inhabiting a New Zealand forest. Height-related heterogeneity in leaf area, specific leaf area, circularity and length to width ratio was analyzed at three scales: (1) among leaves within plants, (2) among plants within species and (3) among species within functional groups (i.e., trees vs. shrubs). Results were scale dependent. Among-leaf morphological diversity was unrelated to plant height. Among-individual morphological diversity increased with the average height of each species, indicating that taller plant species express a greater range of leaf traits than shorter species. Among-species morphological diversity was higher in shrubs than in trees. We hypothesize that scale-dependent patterns in leaf trait diversity result from scale-dependent adaptations to forest environmental conditions. As trees grow from the forest floor into the canopy, they are exposed to a range of environmental conditions, which may select for a range of leaf traits through ontogeny. Conversely, shrubs never reach the forest canopy and may instead be differentially adapted to suites of environmental conditions associated with different stages of forest recovery from tree-fall disturbances. Overall results indicate that vertical patterns in leaf trait diversity exist. However, their strength and directionality are strongly scale-dependent, suggesting that different processes govern leaf shape diversity at different levels of ecological organization." .

With global change, it has become increasingly important to understand how anthropogenic and natural factors interact to determine diversity. Anthropogenic increases in fire frequency are among the global change variables affecting forest diversity and functioning, and seasonally dry forest of the southern Amazon is among the ecosystems most affected by such pressures. Studying how fire will impact forests in this region is therefore important for understanding ecosystem functioning and for designing effective conservation action. We report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated fire, nutrient availability, and herbivory. We measured the effects of these interacting factors on the regenerative capacity of the ecotone between humid Amazon forest and Brazilian savanna. Regeneration density, diversity, and community composition were severely altered by fire. Additions of P and N + P reduced losses of density and richness in the first year post-fire. Herbivory was most important just after germination. Diversity was positively correlated with herbivory in unburned forest, likely because fire reduced the number of reproductive individuals. This contrasts with earlier results from the same study system in which herbivory was related to increased diversity after fire. We documented a significant effect of fire frequency; diversity in triennially burned forest was more similar to that in unburned than in annually burned forest, and the community composition of triennially burned forest was intermediate between unburned and annually burned areas. Preventing frequent fires will therefore help reduce losses in diversity in the southern Amazon’s matrix of human-altered landscapes." .

A critical first step is the selection of the plot variables which can be related to light detection and ranging (LiDAR) statistics. A universal approach was previously proposed which combines local and regional estimates of basal area (BA) and wood density with LiDAR-derived canopy height to map carbon at a regional scale (Asner et al. in Oecologia 168:1147–1160, 2012). Here we explore the contribution of stem diameter distribution, specific wood density and height-diameter (H–D) allometry to forest stand AGB and propose an alternative model. By applying the new model to a large tropical forest data set we show that an appropriate choice of input variables is essential to minimize prediction error of stand AGB which will propagate at larger scale. Stem number (N) and average stem cross-sectional area should be used instead of BA when scaling from tree to plot. Stand quadratic mean diameter above the census threshold diameter size should be preferred over stand mean diameter as it reduces the prediction error of stand AGB by a factor of ten. Wood density should be weighted by stem volume per species instead of BA. LiDAR-derived statistics should prove useful for estimating local H-D allometries as well as mapping N and the mean quadratic diameter above 10 cm at the landscape level. Prior stratification into forest types is likely to improve both estimation procedures significantly and is considered the foremost current challenge." .

Here, we investigate how precipitation, temperature, solar radiation and dry- and wet-season lengths are related to annual tree growth, flower production, and fruit production in three moist tropical forest tree species using long-term datasets from tree rings and litter traps in central Panama. We also evaluated how growth, flower, and fruit production were interrelated. We found that growth was positively correlated with wet-season precipitation in all three species: Jacaranda copaia (r = 0.63), Tetragastris panamensis (r = 0.39) and Trichilia tuberculata (r = 0.39). Flowering and fruiting in Jacaranda were negatively related to current-year dry-season rainfall and positively related to prior-year dry-season rainfall. Flowering in Tetragastris was negatively related to current-year annual mean temperature while Trichilia showed no significant relationships of reproduction with climate. Growth was significantly related to reproduction only in Tetragastris, where it was positively related to previous year fruiting. Our results suggest that tree growth in moist tropical forest tree species is generally reduced by drought events such as those associated with strong El Niño events. In contrast, interannual variation in reproduction is not generally associated with growth and has distinct and species-specific climate responses, with positive effects of El Niño events in some species. Understanding these contrasting climate effects on tree growth and reproduction is critical to predicting changes in tropical forest dynamics and species composition under climate change." .

However, the precise characteristics of such effects depend, to a large extent, upon the way in which gaps modify microclimate and soil water content. Hence, the aim of this study was to understand the effects of gap creation and variations in gap size on forest microclimate and soil water content. The study site, in North West England, was a mixed temperate broadleaved deciduous forest dominated by mature sessile oak (Quercus petraea), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) with some representatives of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). Solar radiation (I), air temperature (T A), soil temperature (T S), relative humidity (h), wind speed (v) and soil water content (Ψ) were measured at four natural treefall gaps created after a severe storm in 2006 and adjacent sub-canopy sites. I, T A, T S, and Ψ increased significantly with gap size; h was consistently lower in gaps than the sub-canopy but did not vary with gap size, while the variability of v could not be explained by the presence or size of gaps. There were systematic diurnal patterns in all microclimate variables in response to gaps, but no such patterns existed for Ψ. These results further our understanding of the abiotic and consequent biotic responses to gaps in broadleaved deciduous forests created by natural treefalls, and provide a useful basis for evaluating the implications of forest management practices." .

Variations in pith eccentricity and ring width between trees on plots were very highly significant (at 0.1% probability level). Pith eccentricity and ring width varied along tree boles: the effect of height above the ground was very highly significant in each case. On average, pith eccentricity was highest at the base and top of the merchantable bole. The magnitudes of variations in both pith eccentricity and ring width along the bole differed between the plots: plotsx levels interaction effect was very highly significant in each case. A decrease in ring width corresponded with an increase in the age of the vascular cambium. Only small proportions of the variation in pith eccentricity could be estimated from concomitant variations in radial growth rate (ring width), bole form factor and crown depth; the values ofr 2 were 11%, 10% and 11% respectively." .

Trees of the deciduous Bombacopsis quinata (bombacaceae, a.k.a. Pachira quinata) and the brevi-deciduous Astronium graveolens (anacardiaceae) were manually defoliated for three times during the rainy season. All trees started to produce a new crown of leaves 2 weeks after defoliation, and continued expanding leaves throughout the rainy season. At the transition to the dry season, the experimental groups consisted of trees with known differences in maximum leaf age. Defoliations resulted in declines in stem growth but did not affect the mineral content or water relations of the leaves subsequently produced. There was no effect of leaf age on the timing of leaf abscission in B. quinata. In A. graveolens, the initiation of leaf shedding followed in rank order, the maximum leaf age of the four treatments, but there was substantial coherence among treatments in the major period of leaf abscission such that trees completed leaf shedding at the same time. In the two species, leaf water potential (ΨL) and stomatal conducantce (g S) declined with the onset of the dry season, reaching minimum values of –0.9 MPa in P. quinata and <–2.0 MPa in A. graveolens. Within each species, leaves of different age exhibited similar ΨL and g S at the onset of drought, and then decreased at a similar rate as the dry season progressed. Overall, our study suggests that the environmental factors were more important than leaf age in controlling the timing of leaf shedding." .

The Scots pine seeds originated from five stands from Latvia (P1), Lithuania (P2 and P3), Belarus (P4), and Poland (P5). Based on molecular identification, seven ECM fungal taxa were identified: Suillus luteus and Suillus variegatus (within the Suilloid type), Wilcoxina mikolae, Tuber sp., Thelephora terrestris, Cenococcum geophilum, and Russuloid type. The fungal species richness varied between five and seven morphotypes, depending on seed origin. The average species richness and relative abundance of most ECM morphotypes differed significantly depending on pine origin. The most essential finding of our study is the shift in dominance from an ascomycetous fungus like W. mikolae in P2 and P4 seedlings to basidiomycetous Suilloid species like S. luteus and S. variegatus in P1 and P5 seedlings. Significant differences between Scots pine origin were also found in seedling height, root dry weight, survival, and concentration of C, K, Ca, and Mg in the needles. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient revealed that survival and nutritional status of pine seedlings were positively correlated with abundance of Suilloid mycorrhizas and negatively linked with W. mikolae abundance. However, stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that only survival and magnesium content in pine needles were significantly correlated with abundance of ECM fungi, and Suilloid mycorrhizas were a main significant predictor. Our results may have implications for understanding the physiological and genetic relationship between the host tree and fungi and should be considered in management decisions in forestry and ECM fungus inoculation programs." .

A study of stemwood physical and mechanical properties in 70–80-year-old Scots pines growing in three zones of different air pollution levels showed serious deviations in comparison with a relatively healthy forest in an unpolluted area. Specimens from polluted trees evidenced smaller sapwood annual ring widths than those from the control trees. At the same time, the number of growth rings in sapwood at breast height increased under pollution. In the polluted areas, percentage of latewood in the annual ring widths was higher than in the unpolluted area. Small amounts of cement dust, which contains elements essential for the mineral nutrition of the trees, might have acted as fertilizer. Pine wood in the polluted stands exhibited increased density, bending strength across the grain, compression strength along the grain and, in some instances, hardness along the grain." .

Trees in wetlands along Four Mile Creek began to show localized stress and mortality in the late 1970s. Extreme winter temperatures and high rainfall were ruled out as potential causal factors of tree stress. Drought was shown to affect trees in both contaminated and uncontaminated zones, but trees in uncontaminated areas exhibited better recovery after drought than trees in contaminated areas. Pollution-mediated alteration of soil acidity and aluminum, sodium, and heavy metal concentrations likely acted to predispose trees to decline, with severe drought acting as the trigger for decline initiation and tree death. Thus, a moderate pollution loading, not sufficient to cause visible damage of itself, may create conditions in which sudden, severe decline could result from natural stresses. This mechanism of forest decline may be common, and should be considered in evaluations of the impact of pollution on wetland forest systems." .

Significant differences of rooting capacity were found between the two 22-year-old half sibling genotypes 147 and 149 according to the concentration of BA added to the media and also to light intensity. The contrast was even more salient with the 1-year-old clone S, which displayed the poorest rooting ability despite being full sibling with clone 147 and much younger. The various criteria observed, i.e. rooting rate, number of roots produced, root length, microshoot height and shoot tip necrosis varied greatly and differently for the three origins according to the successive time replicates of the same rooting protocols, with rooting rates of more than 80% for clone 147 at certain dates. These results were discussed, suggesting the influence of endogenous rhythms as the most rationale cause of the time-related fluctuations of responses observed in steady in vitro environment, notwithstanding possible interferences of non-optimal tissue culture conditions. Such unexpected variations of rootability between closely related genotypes, and the notable interactions pointed out between the time spent in culture and the rooting conditions deserve to be taken into consideration before stating definitive judgment on the rooting capacities of a given genotype for arborescent species." .

However, recent studies suggest that both the occurrence of AMF on rain forest plants and the dependence of rain forest plants on AMF can be highly variable. We examined the occurrence and levels of AMF colonization of some common seedling species in a tropical and a subtropical rain forest site in Queensland, Australia. We also used a long-term database to compare the growth and mortality rates of seedling species that rarely formed AMF with those that regularly formed AMF. In both forests, more than one-third of the seedling species rarely formed AMF associations, while 40% of species consistently formed AMF in the tropical site compared to 27% in the subtropical site. Consistent patterns of AMF occurrence were observed among plant families at the two sites. Variation among seedling species in AMF occurrence or colonization was not associated with differences in seed mass among species, variation in seedling size and putative age within a species, or lack of AMF inoculum in the soil. Comparisons of four seedling species growing both in the shaded understory and in small canopy gaps revealed an increase in AMF colonization in two of the four species in gaps, suggesting that light limitation partially explains the low occurrence of AMF. Seedling survival was significantly positively associated with seed biomass but not with AMF colonization. Furthermore, seedling species that regularly formed AMF and those that did not had similar rates of growth and survival, suggesting that mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal strategies were equivalent in these forests. Furthermore, the high numbers of seedlings that lacked AMF and the overall low rate of seedling growth (the average seedling required 6 years to double its height) suggest that most seedlings did not receive significant indirect benefits from AMF through connection to canopy trees via a common mycorrhizal network." .

We explored the utility of aboveground EMF communities in this regard by surveying sporocarps over a 3-year period from contrasting plant associations of southern old-growth boreal forests of British Columbia (Canada). Cumulative richness ranged from 39 to 89 EMF species per plot (0.15 ha) and followed a skewed parabolic correlation with foliar N concentrations and soil N availability. EMF species composition was consistently distinct in ordinations and strongly correlated to the increasing rates of N mineralization aligned with soil productivity. Approximately 40 EMF species were specialists, as they collectively indicated oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic nutrient regimes, while the remaining species were categorized as broadly tolerant (distributed over 100% of the N gradient), partially intolerant (approximately 70%), or satellites (rare). The functional organization of EMF communities reflected by distribution classes could help define the ecological integrity of forests, which was characterized in this boreal landscape by an average allotment of 20 broadly tolerant, 25 partially intolerant, 15 specialist, and ten satellite species per plot. Epigeous fruiting bodies provided a disparate yet complementary view to the belowground assessment of EMF communities that was valuable in identifying indicators for ecosystem monitoring." .

Measurements were carried out on a plot which had similar stem circumference and basal area per ground area as the stand. Plot sap flux density agreed with tree canopy transpiration rate determined by the difference between above-canopy eddy correlation and forest floor lysimeter evaporation measurements. Daily sap flux varied by an order of magnitude among trees (2 to 87 kg day−1 tree−1). Over 50% of plot sap flux density originated from 3 of 14 trees which emerged 2 to 5 m above the canopy. Maximum tree transpiration rate was significantly correlated with tree height, stem sapwood area, and stem circumference. Use of water stored in the trees was minimal. It is estimated that during growth and crown development, Nothofagus allocates about 0.06 m of circumference of main tree trunk or 0.01 m2 of sapwood per kg of water transpired over one hour. Maximum total conductance for water vapour transfer (including canopy and aerodynamic conductance) of emergent trees, calculated from sap flux density and humidity measurements, was 9.5 mm s−1 that is equivalent to 112 mmol m−2 s−1 at the scale of the leaf. Artificially illuminated shoots measured in the stand with gas exchange chambers had maximum stomatal conductances of 280 mmol m−2 s−1 at the top and 150 mmol m−2 s−1 at the bottom of the canopy. The difference between canopy and leaf-level measurements is discussed with respect to effects of transpiration on humidity within the canopy. Maximum total conductance was significantly correlated with leaf nitrogen content. Mean carbon isotope ratio was −27.76±0.27‰ (average ±s.e.) indicating a moist environment. The effects of interactions between the canopy and the atmosphere on forest water use dynamics are shown by a fourfold variation in coupling of the tree canopy air saturation deficit to that of the overhead atmosphere on a typical fine day due to changes in stomatal conductance." .

The use of fungal spores as inoculum is a viable proposition for low technology nurseries currently producing eucalypts for outplanting in developing countries. Forty-three collections of ectomycorrhizal fungi from southwestern Australia and two from China, representing 18 genera, were tested for their effectiveness as spore inoculum on Eucalyptus globulus Labill. seedlings. Seven-day-old seedlings were inoculated with 25 mg air-dry spores in a water suspension. Ectomycorrhizal development was assessed in soil cores 65 and 110 days after inoculation. By day 65, about 50% of the treatments had formed ectomycorrhizas. By day 110, inoculated seedlings were generally ectomycorrhizal, but in many cases the percentage of roots colonized was low (<10%). Species of Laccaria, Hydnangium, Descolea, Descomyces, Scleroderma and Pisolithus formed more ectomycorrhizas than the other fungi. Species of Russula, Boletus, Lactarius and Hysterangium did not form ectomycorrhizas. The dry weights of inoculated seedlings ranged from 90% to 225% of the uninoculated seedlings by day 110. Although plants with extensively colonized roots generally had increased seedling growth, the overall mycorrhizal colonization levels were poorly correlated to seedling growth. Species of Laccaria, Descolea, Scleroderma and Pisolithus are proposed as potential candidate fungi for nursery inoculation programs for eucalypts." .

This study aimed to describe forest species community under the crown of Bowdichia virgilioides (Fabaceae) in cerrado sensu stricto, testing two hypotheses: (a) distance: more distant nuclei will have fewer numbers of colonizing species and individuals; (b) crown area: nuclei with larger crown will have more individuals and species. We selected six B. virgilioides nuclei at Estação Ecológica do Panga (EEP) in which we traced two transects (D1 and D2) and calculated crown area by ellipse formula. In the under-crown area, we identified all individuals (regardless of size) of tree forest species and also measured their height and diameter at stem base. We performed a Pearson correlation between crown area and the number of individuals and species, and between distance from nucleus to closest forest edge and density. In the six nuclei, we found 517 individuals of 24 species, distributed in 14 families, with a total density of 2.48 individuals per square meter. Correlation between crown area and the number of individuals was statistically significant (r = 0.80; n = 6; p = 0.05). There was no correlation statistically significant between crown area and number of species (r = 0.29; n = 6; p > 0.05). There was a negative correlation between density of individuals and the distance from nucleus to forest edge (r = −0.79; n = 6; p = 0.05). This study shows that some forest species were capable to colonize the area under the crown of B. vigilioides in cerrado, facilitated by this nucletor specie. This colonization process was influenced by the environmental changes promoted by B virgilioides, nuclei crown size, distance of nuclei from propagule source, and the capability of some forest species to survive in an environment different from forest." .

We expected tree species richness to be: (1) positively related to vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity; (2) negatively related to mean soil nutrient availability; and (3) more influenced by nutrient availability in the upper than lower soil horizons. Using a data set from 60, 20 × 40-m plots in a moist forest, and 126 plots in miombo woodlands in Tanzania, we regressed tree species richness against vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity, both depth-specific (0–15, 15–30, and 30–60 cm) and mean soil nutrient availability, and soil physical properties, with elevation and measures of anthropogenic disturbance as co-variables. Overall, vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity was the best predictor of tree species richness in miombo but, contrary to our prediction, the relationships between tree species richness and soil nutrient heterogeneity were negative. In the moist forest, mean soil nutrient availability explained considerable variations in tree species richness, and in line with our expectations, these relationships were mainly negative. Soil nutrient availability in the top soil layer explained more of the variation in tree species richness than that in the middle and lower layers in both vegetation types. Our study shows that vertical soil nutrient heterogeneity and mean availability can influence tree species richness at different magnitudes in intensively utilized tropical vegetation types." .

Among NWFPs, mushrooms are valued due to their medicinal, commercial, high nutritional and recreational importance. Commercial mushroom harvesting also provides important income to local dwellers and contributes to the economic value of regional forests. Sustainable management of these products at the regional scale requires information on their locations in diverse forest settings and the ability to predict and map their spatial distributions over the landscape. This study focuses on modeling the spatial distribution of commercially harvested Lactarius deliciosus and L. salmonicolor mushrooms in the Kızılcasu Forest Planning Unit, Turkey. The best models were developed based on topographic, climatic and stand characteristics, separately through logistic regression analysis using SPSS™. The best topographic model provided better classification success (69.3 %) than the best climatic (65.4 %) and stand (65 %) models. However, the overall best model, with 73 % overall classification success, used a mix of several variables. The best models were integrated into an Arc/Info GIS program to create spatial distribution maps of L. deliciosus and L. salmonicolor in the planning area.

Species from the driest environments, the ‘mallee’ types, had the smallest leaf sizes and the highest leaf specific weights; and forest species, from moist coastal sites, had the largest and thinnest leaves. Photosynthetic rates on a dry weight basis were highly correlated with leaf nitrogen content in all species. Leaf nitrogen content on a dry weight basis varied little between species in nature; however, there were increasing amounts of nitrogen per unit leaf area as the habitat became drier because of the changes in specific leaf weight. This resulted in a greater light-saturated photosynthetic rate per leaf area of arid habitat species, which were presumably more efficient in water use as a consequence. A simple simulation model showed that changes in the allocation ratio to leaf weight reduces total leaf area in the expected direction without affecting total dry matter accumulation." .

Genetically modified trees obtained in different research groups worldwide are particularly confronted with increased concerns regarding biosafety issues. In the light of current biosafety research worldwide, various threats facing forests and natural tree populations are evaluated in this review: biological invasions, horizontal gene transfer, vertical gene transfer and effects on other organisms. Results available from groups working in biosafety research and risk avoidance using forest trees, with emphasis on transgenic trees, are reviewed. Independent biosafety research as well as the establishment of biosafety research programs for forest trees financed by national and international authorities is now more important than ever before. Biosafety problems detected in the past clearly show the importance of a prior case-by-case evaluation of non-native species, new taxa and also genetically modified trees according to the precautionary principle before their release to avoid risks to the environment and human health." .

Different ordination methods (DCA, GNMDS, LNMDS, and HMDS) were used together with the TWINSPAN classification method. The aim was to construct a basis for classifying forests with respect to the biodiversity of the forest vegetation. Fertility and stand age showed the strongest correlation with the variation in ground vegetation. Other important factors were basal area, tree species composition, and crown cover. These variables were important in the division of the sample plots into different classes. According to the diversity indices, species diversity was at its highest in young stands on fertile forest sites. As a result, twenty-one different classes were formed based on the relative abundance of understorey species. The variables with the highest correlation were used to describe the stand structure in these classes." .

My objectives were to test (1) whether drought had a significant effect on tree mortality and understorey light conditions, (2) whether this effect was greater in logged than in undisturbed forest, (3) if the expected change in tree mortality and light conditions had an effect on Macaranga pioneer seedling and sapling densities, and (4) which (a)biotic factors influenced tree mortality during the drought. The 1997/1998 drought led to an additional tree mortality of 11.2, 18.1, and 22.7% in undisturbed, old logged and recently logged forest, respectively. Mortality was highest in logged forests, due to extremely high mortality of pioneer Macaranga trees (65.4%). Canopy openness was significantly higher during the drought than during the non-drought year (6.0, 8.6 and 10.4 vs 3.7, 3.8 and 3.7 in undisturbed, old logged and recently logged forest, respectively) and was positively correlated with the number of dead standing trees. The increase in light in the understorey was accompanied by a 30 to 300-fold increase in pioneer Macaranga seedling densities. Factors affecting tree mortality during drought were (1) tree species successional status, (2) tree size, and (3) tree location with respect to soil moisture. Tree density and basal area per surface unit had no influence on tree mortality during drought. The results of this study show that extreme droughts, such as those associated with El Niño events, can affect the tree species composition and diversity of tropical forests in two ways: (1) by disproportionate mortality of certain tree species groups and tree size classes, and (2) by changing the light environment in the forest understorey, thereby affecting the recruitment and growth conditions of small and immature trees." .

HV increased basipetally within a crown and decreased with increasing branch order, but exhibited no significant radial trend along a primary branch. HV was primarily determined by branch position in a crown and branch diameter at the sampling point, being independent of the size of the tree and branch. Greater HV in the lower-crown branches is considered a means to mitigate differences in hydraulic transport capacity between the branches located in different canopy layers. Beside branch position and sampling location on a branch, SLA depended significantly on several other variables characterising tree and branch size. SLA increased basipetally within a crown and along a primary branch, but exhibited no significant trend with branch orders. Because height caused leaf area (AL) to diminish more rapidly than leaf dry weight, AL primarily determined the vertical variation in SLA." .

The pipe model theory postulates a static relationship between foliage mass/area and the cross-sectional area of active pipes in branches and stems. If a regular relationship exists, the theory can be used for modelling growth allocation within crowns, provided that the turnover of active pipes and foliage is understood. The objective of this study was to assess to what extent the assumptions of the pipe model hold true within the crowns of 24 Scots pine sample trees of different age and social position. The results suggest that Scots pine crowns are very regular, but some important modifications to the pipe model assumptions are required. The relative vertical foliage density distribution peaked at about 50% down the live crown regardless of age or social position. The ratio of foliage mass to branch cross-sectional area in the top half of the crown increased from the top downwards. The ratio of cumulative branch cross-sectional area to stem cross-sectional area in the top half seemed to increase with tree vigour or growth rate. The ratio of foliage mass to branch cross-sectional area decreased fast in the lower half of the crown, and this decrease was faster than could be predicted from heartwood formation in the branches. This result may be taken as (1) evidence against the pipe model, or as (2) an indication that active pipes cannot always be identified with sapwood. The latter proposition should be studied further." .

The angle between the longitudinal direction of the tracheids in the outermost year ring compared to the longitudinal direction of the stem was measured by scribing lines which followed the direction of the tracheids. The crown asymmetry was measured by taking photographs of the trees followed by a simple picture analysis of the tree. Wind data for the growing seasons of 1997 and 1998 were obtained from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The results showed a significant correlation between the angle of the tracheids compared to the stem longitudinal direction going from a left-handed angle if the trees had a crown projected to the north towards a right-handed angle the more the crown projects to the south." .

Nitrogen deposition is predicted to change this towards co-limitation/limitation by other nutrients (e.g., phosphorus), although evidence of such stoichiometric effects is scarce. We utilized two forest fertilization experiments in southern Sweden to analyze single and combined effects of nitrogen and phosphorus on the productivity, composition, and diversity of the ground vegetation. Our results indicate that the productivity of forest ground vegetation in southern Sweden is co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, the combined effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the productivity was larger than when applied solely. No effects on species richness of any of these two nutrients were observed when applied separately, while applied in combination, they increased species richness and changed species composition, mainly by promoting more mesotrophic species. All these effects, however, occurred only for the vascular plants and not for bryophytes. The tree layer in a forest has a profound impact on the productivity and diversity of the ground vegetation by competing for both light and nutrients. This was confirmed in our study where a combination of nitrogen and high tree basal area reduced cover of the ground vegetation compared to all the other treatments where basal area was lower after stand thinning. During the past decades, nitrogen deposition may have further increased this competition from the trees for phosphorus and gradually reduced ground vegetation diversity. Phosphorus limitation induced by nitrogen deposition may, thus, contribute to ongoing changes in forest ground vegetation." .

The study of large-fire controls remains incipient in comparison with other components of the fire regime. Improved understanding of large-fire size drivers can disclose fire–landscape relationships and inform more sustainable and effective fire management. We used boosted regression tree modeling to identify the variables influent on large-fire size (100–23,219 ha, n = 609) in Portugal (1998–2008) and quantify their relative importance, globally and across the fire-size range. Potential explanatory variables included metrics pertaining to fire weather and antecedent rainfall, burned area composition, fuel connectivity, pyrodiversity (from fire recurrence patterns), topography, and land development. Large fires seldom occurred in the absence of severe fire weather. The fire-size model accounted for 70% of the deviance and included 12 independent variables, of which six absorbed 91% of the explanation. Bottom-up influences on fire size, essentially fuel-related, largely outweighed climate–weather influences, with respective importance of 85 and 15%. Fire size was essentially indifferent to land-cover composition, including forest type, and increased with high fuel connectivity and low pyrodiversity. Relevant synergies between variables were found, either positive or negative, for example, high pyrodiversity buffered the effects of extreme weather on fire size. The relative role of fire-size drivers did not vary substantially with fire size, but fires larger than 500 ha were increasingly controlled by fuel-related variables. The extent of an individual large fire is mainly a function of factors that land-use planning and forest and fuel management can tackle." .

By contrast, vessel lumen area series contain common climatic signal of previous summer temperature. AbstractDrought events and the overuse of groundwater for water supply can cause significant declines of groundwater levels in naturally poorly drained forest stands. However, the documented growth reactions of trees to declines in groundwater level vary a lot and range from positive because of increased soil aeration to strongly negative because of drought stress. We analysed changes in tree-ring width and earlywood average vessel lumen area of Quercus robur from sites above an artesian aquifer, whose groundwater level declined in the late 1980s by about 5 m due to water pumping. Because we expected different responses of individual trees due to local microtopography and fine root distribution, we performed both site-level and tree-level analyses. Our results show that the site-level response of tree growth to groundwater-level pumping was not uniform. Individual trees were clustered into groups of drought-limited and water abundance-limited individuals. The response of trees to groundwater pumping differed between clusters—drought-sensitive trees responded negatively, whereas the growth of trees limited by water abundance remained stable or slightly increased. Inter-series correlation of drought-limited trees significantly increased in the period with the lowest groundwater level. In contrast to tree-ring widths, earlywood vessel lumen area series contained common temperature signal, with no imprint of groundwater-level alteration. Our results indicate that poorly drained forest ecosystems are characterized by a significantly individualistic response of radial growth to groundwater-level alteration. These individualistic responses could be, however, overshadowed in stand-level average tree-ring width chronologies." .

After forest fire, photosynthetically active solar radiation was reduced due to accumulation of ash and dust particles in atmosphere. Post-fire impacts on Quercus leucotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum and Lyonia ovalifolia in a broadleaf forest were analysed after a wild fire. Bark depth damage was greatest for L. ovalifolia and least for Q. leucotrichophora. Regeneration of saplings was observed for all the tree species through sprouting. Epicormic recovery was observed for the trees of all the species. Young trees of Q. leucotrichophora (<40 cm circumference at breast height) were susceptible to fire as evident by the lack of sprouting. Under-canopy tree species have a high potential for recovery as evident by greater length and diameter of shoots and numbers of buds and leaves per shoot than canopy species. Leaf area, leaf moisture and specific leaf area were greater in the deciduous species, with few exceptions, than in evergreen species." .

Our analysis combines results from continuous measurements of forest meteorological variables significant to the forest water balance, stand transpiration (ST) estimates from sap flow measurements, and model simulations of microclimate and water fluxes. Two different forest hydrological models (DNDC and BROOK90) were tested for their suitability to represent the particular sites. The investigation covers the years 2001–2007. Central aims were (1) to evaluate meteorological simulations of variables below the forest canopy, (2) to evaluate ST, (3) to quantify annual water fluxes for both beech stands using the evaluated hydrological models, and (4) to analyse the model simulations with regard to assumptions inherent in the respective model. Overall, both models were very well able to reproduce the observed dynamics of the soil water content in the uppermost 30 cm. However, the degree of fit depended on the year and season. The comparison of experimentally determined ST within the beech stand on the NE-slope during the growing season of 2007 with simulated transpiration did not yield a reliable statistical relationship. The simulation of water fluxes for the beech stand on the NE- and SW-slopes showed similar results for vegetation-related fluxes with both models, but different with respect to runoff and percolation flows. Overall, the higher evaporation demand on the warmer SW-slope did not lead to a significantly increased drought stress for the vegetation but was reflected mainly in decreased water loss from the system. This finding is discussed with regard to potential climate change and its impact on beech growth." .

Currently, this ecosystem has very high deforestation rates; and its conversion to cattle pasture may result in losses of soil organic matter, decreases in soil fertility, and increases in CO2 flux to the atmosphere. The soil organic matter turnover rate in a TDF after pasture conversion was estimated in Mexico by determining natural abundances of13C. Changes in these values would be induced by vegetation changes from the C3 (forest) to the C4 (pasture) photosynthetic pathway. The rate of loss of remnant forest-soil organic matter (fSOM) was 2.9 t ha−1 year−1 in 7-year-old pasture and decreased to 0.66 t ha−1 year−1 by year 11. For up to 3 years, net fSOM level increased in pastures; this increment can be attributed to decomposition of remnant forest roots. The sand-associated SOM fraction was the most and the silt-associated fraction the least depleted. TDF conversion to pasture results in extremely high rates of loss of remnant fSOM that are higher than any reported for any tropical forest." .

While most research shows that soil inorganic N pools and fluxes return to pre-fire levels within a few years, we wondered if vegetation conversion (ponderosa pine to bunchgrass) following stand-replacing fires might be accompanied by a long-term shift in N cycling processes. Using a 34-year stand-replacing wildfire chronosequence with paired, adjacent unburned patches, we examined the long-term dynamics of net and gross nitrogen (N) transformations. We hypothesized that N availability in burned patches would become more similar to those in unburned patches over time after fire as these areas become re-vegetated. Burned patches had higher net and gross nitrification rates than unburned patches (P < 0.01 for both), and nitrification accounted for a greater proportion of N mineralization in burned patches for both net (P < 0.01) and gross (P < 0.04) N transformation measurements. However, trends with time-after-fire were not observed for any other variables. Our findings contrast with previous work, which suggested that high nitrification rates are a short-term response to disturbance. Furthermore, high nitrification rates at our site were not simply correlated with the presence of herbaceous vegetation. Instead, we suggest that stand-replacing wildfire triggers a shift in N cycling that is maintained for at least three decades by various factors, including a shift from a woody to an herbaceous ecosystem and the presence of fire-deposited charcoal." .

FSC prohibits certain chemicals and active ingredients in certified forest plantations. A company seeking certification must discontinue use of products so listed and many face problems to comply with these constraints. The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of certification on pest management from the perspective of Brazilian private forestry sector. Ninety-three percent of Brazilian FSC-certified forest companies rated leaf-cutting ants as “very important” pests. Chemical control was the most important management technique used and considered very important by 82 % of respondents. The main chemical used to control leaf-cutting ants, sulfluramid, is in the derogation process and was classified as very important by 96.5 % of the certified companies. Certified companies were generally satisfied in relation to FSC certification and the integrated management of forest pests, but 27.6 % agreed that the prohibitions of pesticides for leaf-cutting ant and termite control could be considered as a non-tariff barrier on high-productivity Brazilian forest plantations. FSC forest certification has encouraged the implementation of more sustainable techniques and decisions in pest management in forest plantations in Brazil. The prohibition on pesticides like sulfluramid and the use of alternatives without the same efficiency will result in pest mismanagement, production losses, and higher costs. This work has shown that the application of global rules for sustainable forest management needs to adapt to each local reality." .

Larval weight and survival were not significantly different on trees that had experienced different levels of defoliation in 1986. The nitrogen and tannin content of current and previous years' pine needles was not significantly affected by defoliation (although both were slightly greater in the foliage of defoliated trees). Phosphorus content of young pine foliage was lower (but not significantly lower except on one occasion) on heavily defoliated trees. On all sampling occasions, however, the nitrogen: phosphorus ratio was significantly higher on heavily defoliated trees. There were large differences in monoterpene composition of the previous year's shoots associated with defoliation intensity, but these differences had largely disappeared in the new growth. The results are discussed in relation to other studies on the effects of insect damage on plant chemistry and insect performance and in relation to the abundance of P. flammea in Scotland." .

First, it must be said that, according to information in the literature, no tree species can survive violent storms (with mean wind speeds over a period of 10 min higher than 30 m/s) without any damage. This threshold value for wind speed is related to the height near the top of a forest stand. Taking the results of the spectral method as a basis for the reduction of storm risk of vital conifers, necessary silvicultural action must be: (1) to influence the amount and frequency distribution of the wind force in such a way that its shere of action becomes more and more unsuitable for tree sways, and (2) to raise the characteristic frequencies of the trees' primary sways because then effective wind force takes on lower and lower values due to narrow-band energy transfer. Numerous silvicultural methods for achieving these objectives, such as cutting off the tops of crowns or chaining trees together, are described in detail by Rottman (1986)." .

With the objective of finding long-term sustainable supply of growing media, compost was produced from shredded branches of three fast growing species (Acacia cyanophylla (AA), Acacia cyclops (AS) and Eucalyptus gomphocephala (EG). The composting process covered three different periods over the course of a year. Pile temperatures were monitored daily and the composts were routinely sampled and analyzed for 19 chemical variables. Although composting is feasible year-round in arid climates, compost produced in the humid cool conditions of autumn, winter and early spring reaches the maturation phase more quickly than compost produced under hot, dry summer conditions. It also requires less turning and water. The evolution of the composting process and quality of the final product can be assessed using three chemical variables (C/N, pH, EC). Seed germination rates in the three types of compost were similar to that in a peat:vermiculite substrate and vigorous high quality seedlings were produced in the two acacia composts. However, compost-grown seedlings had significantly smaller shoots and root systems than those produced in peat substrate. Principal components analyses showed that the quality of a compost-based substrate is reproducible and that its final chemical composition can be predicted from its raw organic materials. The EG composts had higher pH than the acacia composts, whereas the AA and EG composts were higher in mineral salts than the AS." .

Nesting preferences discovered for the nest tree and its surroundings, included height and diameter of trees, age of the forest stand, distance to the nearest open area or forest road and occurrence of open areas in the vicinity of the nest. In the diverse habitat of oak-hornbeam wood, more similar to natural woods, nest site selection operated on several levels, possibly starting at the most extensive end of the scale before narrowing to the selection of a particular nest tree. In the more homogeneous habitat of commercially exploited coniferous forest, the surrounding of the nest were found to be insignificant, and the nesting decisions were likely to be based principally on individual characteristics of a tree i.e. its shape and size, being suitable for nesting." .

At first, the meaning of the Faustmann model in economic sciences is the explanation of allocation and distribution by prices. The rotation age determination plays a secondary role only. Secondly, “a forestry of prices” as an application of the “free to choose” way of thinking is explained. The concept allows us to understand how individuals of anonymous groups achieve forest sustainability and provide forest environmental goods. Thirdly, the relation between the Faustmann model and “a forestry of prices” is discussed. For this purpose, the Faustmann model is described as a scientific laboratory. It helps us to observe how equilibrium arises as a non-intended result of individual welfare maximization in anonymous interactions. And conversely with the help of “a forestry of prices”, we understand also that the individual maximization approach of the Faustmann model re-enacts the unintended interaction situations in anonymous group.

The time lag in productive ecophysiologically active periods between deciduous overstory and evergreen understory trees in a common temperate forest was clearly related to the amount of overstory foliage. AbstractIn temperate forests, where deciduous canopy trees and evergreen understory trees coexist, understory trees experience great variation in incident radiation corresponding to canopy dynamics represented by leaf-fall and leaf-out. It is generally thought that changes in the light environment affect understory plants’ ecophysiological traits. Thus, to project and estimate annual energy, water, and carbon exchange between forests and the atmosphere, it is necessary to investigate seasonal variation in the ecophysiological activities of both evergreen trees in the understory and deciduous trees that make up the canopy/overstory. We conducted leaf-scale gas-exchange measurements and nitrogen content analyses for six tree species along their heights throughout a complete year. Photosynthetic capacity as represented by the maximum carboxylation rate (V cmax25) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) of deciduous canopy trees peaked immediately after leaf-out in late May, declined and stabilised during the mid-growing season, and drastically decreased just before leaf-fall. On the other hand, the timing of lowest V cmax25 and PNUE for evergreen understory trees coincided with that of the highest values for canopy trees. Furthermore, understory trees’ highest values appeared just before canopy tree leaf-out, when incident radiation in the understory was highest. This implies that failing to consider seasonal variation in leaf ecophysiological traits for both canopy and understory trees could lead to serious errors in estimating ecosystem productivity and energy balance for temperate forests." .

The aim is to develop trees that will grow in relatively dry and/or saline environments and provide commercial wood products. Previous studies indicate that the hybrids exhibit faster growth than either of their pure species parents, and that there are significant differences in growth rates between them. We undertook a comparative study of the partitioning of above-ground biomass (AGB) to examine biomass and chloride (Cl) allocation of trees growing on two saline-irrigated sites in south-eastern Australia. Eucalyptus camaldulensis × globulus had a higher proportion of AGB in leaves (20–29% cf. 15–16%), and lower proportion in live branches (3–10% cf. 6–14%) than E. camaldulensis × grandis. The concentration of Cl was highest in the stembark (4.2–9.6 g kg−1) and lowest in the stemwood (0.6–2.0 g kg−1), suggesting that trees can export Cl through bark shedding. Total Cl content was strongly related to volume under bark (R2 = 0.99), and differences in partitioning of Cl into tree components differed between the hybrids in the same way as AGB. Preferential partitioning of Cl to live branches rather than foliage in E. camaldulensis × grandis suggests that this hybrid may be compartmentalising Cl to reduce the risk of Cl toxicity in the leaves." .

Labeling of canopy air was achieved by continuous release of CO2 with a δ13C of −46.9‰. To this end, micro-porous tubes were suspended at c. 1 m distance vertically through the canopy, minimizing CO2 gradients from the exterior to the interior and allowing for C labeling exposure during periods of low wind speed. Target for CO2 concentration ([CO2]) increase was ambient +100 μmol mol−1. Canopy [CO2] stayed within 10% of the target during more than 57% of the time and resulted in a drop of δ13C in canopy air by 7.8‰. After 19 labeling days about 50% of C in phloem sugars and stem CO2 efflux were turned over and 20–30% in coarse root CO2 efflux and soil CO2.

The frequency and duration of such reductions in almost 10000 trees in forest stands of Central Europe, in particular Switzerland, and in the Front Range, Colorado, USA, is related to species, climate and weather, and geographical unit. The growth reductions in the populations investigated are concentrated in certain periods and, in all species examined, essentially related to periods of drought in the spring and summer months. During the years covered by the study (1850–1985), periods of growth reduction occur in Central Europe, the Front Range, Colorado, and also in the Hudson Valley, New York, at irregular intervals of 6–34 years, and on average every 13–14 years. The growth reduction periods normally do not show synchronism between the three areas investigated. Regionally valid growth periodicities can only be definitely determined through the examination of a very large amount of material comprising a number of species growing in different forest stands and on different sites within a major phytosociological unit. Findings from studies on trees in different climatic areas or on few samples scarcely allow reliable comparisons." .

The primary species in these mixtures were very shade tolerant silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and midtolerant Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Seedlings/saplings of these species were selected for measurements in different stands from two different geographical locations. Various morphological traits (specific leaf area, live crown ratio, crown width to length ratio, terminal to lateral ratio, number of internodal shoots, number of shoots in terminal whorl, stem symmetry, stem orientation, stem forking) for each regenerating tree were measured during summers of 2001 and 2002. Percentage of above canopy light and stand basal area measures were used to assess the available growing space for each seedling/sapling. Regression relationships were developed for the different morphological indicators as a function of these two variables. All species adapted their morphology along the gradient in light and basal area. Spruce seemed to be less adapted to low light conditions than both fir and beech. However, no significant differences in terms of shade tolerance were detected using the above indicators. In really dense stand conditions (less than 20% above canopy light and stand basal area above 36 m2 ha−1), probability for stem forking in beech increased. In open, all three species adapted their morphology for vigorous growth. Under such conditions, spruce was better adapted than fir." .

A phenology model for estimating the timings of bud burst – one of the most influential phenological phases for the simulation of tree growth – is presented in this study. The model calculates the timings of the leafing of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and oak (Quercus robur L.) and the May shoot of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on the basis of the daily maximum temperature. The data for parameterisation and validation of the model have been taken from 40 climate and 120 phenological stations in southern Germany with time series for temperature and bud burst of up to 30 years. The validation of the phenology module by means of an independent data set showed correlation coefficients for comparisons between observed and simulated values of 54% (beech), 55% (oak), 59% (spruce) and 56% (pine) with mean absolute errors varying from 4.4 days (spruce) to 5.0 days (pine). These results correspond well with the results of other – often more complex – phenology models. After the phenology module had been implemented in the tree-growth model BALANCE, the growth of a mixed forest stand with the former static and the new dynamic timings for the bud burst was simulated. The results of the two simulation runs showed that phenology has to be taken into account when simulating forest growth, particularly in mixed stands." .

Soil core samples showed that root biomass was not significantly reduced until two years after trees were girdled. Litterfall during the fall of 1977 from trees girdled in Semptember 1975 and allowed to develop stump sprouts (plot no. 1) was 72% of the control plot. Litterfall during the same time from trees girdled in May 1976 but with stump sprouts removed (plot no. 2) was 82% of the control. Diameter growth during the growing season of 1977 was 53% of control in plot no. 1 and 68% of control in plot no. 2. No significant differences (P>0.05) in forest floor CO2 efflux rates were observed between plots in the field. However, respiration rates were found to be higher in the girdled plot soil than in the control soil when roots and litter were removed by sieving and CO2 efflux from just the mineral soil and associated detritus was measured. Increased leaching rates of nutrients revealed the effects of girdling on biogeochemical cycles of the forest. The most pronounced effect was increased concentrations of NO3 ions in the soil water of the girdled plots, resulting in losses of NO3 ions below the root zone (>60 cm) during the second year. These losses amounted to 25.4 kg ha-1 in plot no. 2 and 9.0 kg ha-1 in plot no. 1 as compared to 0.15 kg/ha-1 from the control plot. Calcium losses below the root zone during the second year were ≃10 kg ha-1 greater in plot no. 2 than the control plot, while losses from plot no. 1 were about equal to the control. Calcium and nitrogen uptake by the sprouts in plot no. 1 offset the slightly reduced uptake by the girdled trees and in fact uptake in plot no. 1 may have exceeded the control during the first year. Differences in uptake could account for only a portion of the differences in NO3 ion concentrations based on litterfall and diameter growth in girdled plots." .

Since there was a geographical correlation between SDR and sighting per unit effort (SPUE), which is an index of the relative density of sika deer, it appeared that decline of shrub-layer vegetation in a stand can be accurately evaluated by SDR. There were correlations between SDR and several variables that indicate the status of components in forests (presence of saplings of tall trees, occurrence of bark stripping of tall trees, proportion of bark-stripped stems of Clethra barvinervis, decline of subtree-layer vegetation by bark stripping, cover of litter on the ground, and area of soil surface erosion). These results indicate that the status of these components changes with decline of shrub-layer vegetation by sika deer grazing. It is thought that such synchronizations are caused by sika deer grazing or a direct or indirect effect by decline of shrub-layer vegetation due to sika deer. Therefore, it is reasonable to assess decline in physical structure due to sika deer for stands of deciduous hardwood forests according to SDR." .

The results showed that for the control, the cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from WBF soil during the 15-day incubation ranged from 5.44 to 5.82 g CO2-C m−2, which was significantly larger than that from BKPF soil (2.86 to 3.36 g CO2-C m−2). With increasing wetting intensity, the cumulative CO2 flux from the control was decreased for the WBF soil, whereas an increase in the CO2 flux was observed in the BKPF soil (P < 0.05). The addition of NH4Cl or KNO3 alone significantly reduced the cumulative CO2 fluxes by 9.2%–21.6 % from the two soils, especially from WBF soil at low wetting intensity. The addition of glucose alone significantly increased soil heterotrophic respiration, microbial biomass C (MBC), and microbial metabolic quotient. The glucose-induced cumulative CO2 fluxes and soil MBC during the incubation ranged from 8.7 to 11.7 g CO2-C m−2 and from 7.4 to 23.9 g C m−2, which are larger than the dose of added C. Hence, the addition of external carbon can increase the decomposition of soil native organic C. The glucose-induced average and maximum rates of CO2 fluxes during the incubation were significantly influenced by wetting intensity (WI) and vegetation type (VT), and by WI×VT, NH4Cl×VT and WI×VT×NH4Cl (P<0.05). The addition of NH4Cl, instead of KNO3, significantly decreased the glucose-induced MBC of WBF soil (P<0.05), whereas adding NH4Cl and KNO3 both significantly increased the glucose-induced MBC of BKPF soil at high moisture (P<0.05). According to the differences in soil labile C pools, MBC and CO2 fluxes in the presence and absence of glucose, it can be concluded that the stimulating effects of glucose on soil heterotrophic respiration and MBC under temperate forests were dependent on vegetation type, soil moisture, and amount and type of the N added." .

Here we review the evidence of ground cover interactions with planted tree seedlings on coal surface mines of the eastern US, discuss recent research into these interactions, and draw conclusions concerning ground cover management when restoring forests on reclaimed coal mines. Reclaimed mine sites have a high potential to support productive forests, however forest establishment is inhibited by reclamation practices that included soil compaction, and the seeding of competitive ground covers. In the first few years after tree planting, a dense ground cover of grass and legume species commonly seeded on mine sites often affect growth and survival negatively. Herbaceous vegetation providing less extensive and competitive ground coverage may either facilitate or inhibit tree establishment, depending on site conditions. The use of quality planting stock promotes the competitive ability of seedlings by improving nutrient status and the ability to capture available resources. Herbaceous species have contrasting functional characteristics, and thus compete differently with trees for available resources. Negative interactions with trees are more frequently reported for non-native cool-season grasses than for native warm-season grasses, while the effects of legumes change over time. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of tree/ground cover interactions. The development of seeding mixes that can control erosion, facilitate survival and growth of planted trees, and allow establishment by unplanted native species would aid forest restoration on eastern US, coal mines." .

Increment cores were taken from mature eastern white pines (Pinus strobus L.) in 144 sample points in 12 partially harvested and 6 unharvested control stands in Ontario, Canada, to determine how these trees responded to a 'structural retention harvest' that had occurred 9 years previously. Prior to harvest, increment growth was slightly lower in control stands, but not significantly so. Strong correlation in diameter increments among stands indicates external climatic forcing or internal synchronicity, e.g. reproductive allocation. Three years after harvest, growth in harvested stands overtook that in control stands, and increased to 63±8% SE above expected levels by 8 years after harvest. The study demonstrates the ability of old trees to respond markedly to reduced competition, questioning the concept of an age-related decline in forest productivity. In addition to increased timber production, growth responses of old trees have important implications for stand regeneration, wind firmness, and maintenance of wildlife habitat elements following partial stand harvests. Comparison of disturbed stands with undisturbed stands allows better estimation of tree responses than methods in which disturbance is inferred from diameter increment variation within individual trees." .

In this study, we address how functional processes (primary production and nutrient uptake) in stream ecosystems respond to changes in forest canopy structure. We focus on differences in incoming irradiance, nutrient uptake (NO3, NH4, and PO4) and open-channel metabolism seasonally in 13 forested streams that drain forests with different canopy structures (10 to >300 years old) in the northeastern United States. Light irradiance was related to forest age in a U-shaped pattern, with light being the greatest in both young open forests (<50 years old) and older growth forests (>245 years old), whereas the darkest conditions were found in the secondary growth middle-aged forests (80–158 years old). Streams that had adjacent open or old-growth riparian forest had similar conditions with greater standing stock biofilm biomass (chl a), and elevated ER in October compared to streams with middle-aged riparian forests. Compared to all sites, streams with old-growth riparian forest had the greatest in-stream primary production rates (GPP) and elevated background nutrient concentrations, and to a lesser degree, increased nutrient retention and uptake (V f). Streams draining older forests tended to be more productive and retentive than middle-aged forests, likely due to increased light availability and the age and structure of surrounding forest canopies. Middle-aged forests had the least variation in response variables compared to streams in young and old-growth riparian forests, likely a result of uniform canopy conditions. As the structure of widespread middle-aged forests in NE US is altered by loss of specific tree species, climate change, and/or human activity, it will impact in-stream production and nutrient dynamics and may ultimately alter nutrient loading in downstream catchments." .

An expression has been derived, according to which the assimilated fraction of CO2 from the soil at a particular height of a tree is given by the δ13C-value of the corresponding leaves, δ13C of atmospheric CO2, δ13C of soil respired CO2 and the physiological state of the leaves expressed as the ratio of total respiration over gross photosynthesis and internal over external CO2-concentration. In the particular case investigated, a δ13C-difference of 5‰ has been determined from bottom to top of a beech tree which results in a CO2 contribution from the soil of about 22% for the lower forest strata, while the total contribution of soil respired CO2 accounts for about 5% of the overall assimilation." .

Leaf net photosynthesis, conductance, internal CO2 concentration (ci), water use efficiency (WUE; photosynthesis/conductance), dark respiration and the ratio of net photosynthesis/respiration did not vary among or within the three taxa. Significant differences in volume production, crown length, total crown leaf surface area and the silhouette area of shade shoots among the taxa were observed. The loblolly-South Carolina source had greater volume and crown surface area than the pitch pine, and the hybrid taxa were intermediate between the two. Although the silhouette area ratio of shade foliage varied among taxa, it was not related to volume. A strong relationship between total leaf surface area and volume was observed. Leaf conductance, ci, WUE and leaf water potential were the physiological parameters significantly and positively correlated with volume. This study suggests that the amount of needle surface in the canopy is more important in early stand volume growth than the leaf carbon exchange rate and the degree of needle self-shading in the lower canopy." .

Input data are the number of forest fires in the region during two preceding days (d−2 andd−1) and the type of day (real and evaluated from radiosonde ford−2,d−1,d and predicted from meteorological medium-range forecasts, i.e. of European Centre, ford+1,d+2,d+3,d+4 andd+5.

The highest quality forecast is obtained for the region immediately surrounding the RS, and diminishes with increasing distance from it, this being due to the data obtained from the RS not being representative of the atmospheric column over the region.

However, the relationship between the degree of damage and tree age, i.e., whether seedlings, young trees, or adult trees are most vulnerable, remains unclear and is rarely reported. We investigated the effect of tree age on the degrees of vegetation damage and subsequent recovery in three subtropical forest types-coniferous, mixed, and broad-leaved—in the Tianjing Mountains, South China, after a series of rare icy rain and freezing snow events in 2008. The results showed that damage and recovery rates were both dependent on tree age, with the proportion of damaged vegetation increasing with age (estimated by diameter at breast height, DBH) in all three forest types and gradually plateauing. Significant variation occurred among forest types. Young trees in the coniferous forest were more vulnerable than those in the broad-leaved forest. The type of damage also varied with tree age in different ways in the three forest types. The proportion of young seedlings that were uprooted (the most severe type of damage) was highest in the coniferous forest. In the mixed forest, young trees were significantly more likely to be uprooted than seedlings and adult trees, while in the broad-leaved forest, the proportion of uprooted adult trees was significantly higher than that of seedlings and young trees. There were also differences among forest types in how tree age affected damage recovery. In the coniferous forest, the recovery rate of trees with broken trunks or crowns (DBH > 2.5 cm) increased with tree age. However, in the mixed and broad-leaved forests, no obvious correlation between the recovery rate of trees with broken trunks or crowns and tree age was observed. Trees with severe root damage did not recover; they were uprooted and died. In these forests, vegetation damage and recovery showed tree age dependencies, which varied with tree shape, forest type, and damage type. Understanding this dependency will guide restoration after freezing rain and snow disturbances." .

The beech caterpillar (Quadricalcarifera punctatella) was used in a bioassay to determine insect performance. Survival and body size were low on foliage from defoliated trees. Reduced foliar nitrogen and increased tannin content were probably the main causes of the low insect performance. Leaves were less tough on defoliated trees than in controls. Two sucessive years of manual defoliation caused stronger induced resistance than one year defoliation. The quality, as well as the quality of the foliage, decreased the year following manual defoliation; total weight of leaves on a tree was less than one half of that before treatment. Severe defoliation may cause a decrease of leaves the following year and starvation may limit populations. Delayed induced resistance of beech trees is proposed as a possible cause of the cyclical population dynamics ofQ. punctatella. The delayed induced response also affected folivorous insects other thanQ. punctatella." .

The accumulation patterns of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in gingko foliage were similar; the amounts of HCHs, DDTs and HCB increased with foliage growth in spring and decreased thereafter. This accumulation pattern is likely related to the growing process of the gingko foliage, which was observed for the first time in our work, giving a piece of evidence for the “bud burst effect” in plants. Compared with those in pine needles in 1980’s, the residual levels of HCHs and DDTs have declined obviously in Beijing, indicating that the ban on the production and use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in our country is effective; however, the amount of HCB has increased, indicating great progress of chemical industry in Beijing. The analysis for the source of OCPs in the gingko foliage showed that the technical HCHs and DDTs were used largely in history, but were not used in recent years. A little lidane has been used and there was a new input of o,p′-DDT in recent years; dicofol usage may be the main source of o,p′-DDT. Concentrations of HCHs, DDTs and HCB in gingko foliages were similar to those in pine needles in the corresponding period and there is a strong positive correlation between the OCPs concentration data obtained from these two kinds of trees. It presents no difference in the accumulation style between these two kinds of trees. The level of OCPs in the gingko foliage reflects the pollution status of OCP in air. The result of this work shows that the gingko foliage can be used as a bio-monitor of OCPs in air." .

Recent field studies indicate that B deficiency may cause irreversible damage in emerging leader buds leading to bushy growth, and changes in developing needles in mature Norway spruce trees. We experimentally studied if timing of B application affects needles and buds of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings with low initial B levels. The treatments were: no B (B0); B supply from the beginning of the simulated summer (B1); starting soon after bud burst (B2) and starting at the occurrence of first needle primordia in new spruce buds (B3). At the end of the experiment, B concentration in B1 was 23 mg kg−1 (pine) or 17 mg kg−1 (spruce) and lower in the later applications. In B0 it was at deficiency limit. In B0, B2 and B3, there were fewer sclerenchyma cells, and cavities occurred in vascular cylinders in pine needles, and in spruce buds there were more tanniferous cells in the primordial shoots compared to B1. Furthermore, in all but B1 there was cell collapse in the bud apex of some spruce seedlings. The experimentally induced changes were the same as earlier reported in B deficient conifers in the field, and indicate, similarly as in the field that adequate B is necessary throughout the growing season for healthy growth, particularly for spruce. The differences between spruce and pines are due, at least partly, to the differences in time frame of needle development and in the differences in development of conducting tissues in the buds." .

Therefore, further information concerning this parameter of wood quality is necessary; however, traditional testing methods are difficult and time-consuming to carry out. We tested the possibility of using colorimetry to determine durability in heartwood samples taken from a wide range of trees. Twelve hundred samples from 31 trees were exposed to four fungi: Pycnoporus sanguineus, Antrodia sp., Gloephylum trabeum, and Coriolus versicolor. Wood samples were grouped into three classes (inner, intermediate and outer heartwood). The colour parameters of each sample were then determined using the CIELAB (L*, a*, b*) system and results correlated with the %mass loss of wood after fungal attack. Tests showed that Antrodia sp. and C. versicolor resulted in <20% mass loss, whereas all samples were rated as durable or highly durable with regard to P. sanguineus and G. trabeum. Inner heartwood was found to be the most resistant to pathogen attack and outer heartwood the least. Measurements of colour showed that heartwood was lightest nearest the pith and darkness and redness increased towards the outer heartwood. Regressions of lightness with %mass loss in the durability tests were always highly significant, whereas a* and b* were not always significantly regressed with %mass loss. Therefore, the use of colorimetry as a tool to estimate short-term natural durability both rapidly and cheaply could be considered in the case of plantation grown teak wood." .

Comparative ecophysiological studies by measurements of photosystem II chlorophyll a fluorescence, porometry and stable isotope analyses were performed on regrowth of trees in a plantation of Eucalyptus saligna in Ethiopia. In the Shashemene-Munessa State Forest of the eastern escarpment of the Great Rift Valley, young plants of E. saligna and the native tree Podocarpus falcatus were compared under the canopy of an established E. saligna plantation, and the native tree Bersama abyssinica was also included. For further comparison fully sun-exposed plants of Eucalyptus globulus in a young newly established plantation, and trees of P. falcatus and the native pioneer tree Croton macrostachys in a remnant natural forest were examined. Photosynthetic yield measurements and light response curves suggested a gradation of sun-adapted to shade-adapted behaviour of E. globulus (exposed) >C. macrostachys >>E. saligna (understorey) ≥ P. falcatus ~ B. abyssinica. As indicated by carbon isotope discrimination, long-term water-use efficiency (WUE) tended to be higher in P. falcatus than in E. saligna in the understorey of the plantation. Transpiration measurements showed that Eucalyptus spp had the highest and P. falcatus the lowest instant leaf conductance for water vapour. Thus, P. falcatus competes well photosynthetically and by a more favourable WUE. These measurements support the expectation that the E. saligna plantation has a nurse effect for regrowth of native trees. With the management practice of regularly coppicing E. saligna in a 7-year rhythm a native P. falcatus forest may regenerate." .

Measurements of g s were carried out on upper canopy foliage before noon, over four growing seasons, including an exceptionally dry summer (2003). Across all species reductions in stomatal conductance were smaller than 25% most likely around 10%, with much variation among species and trees. Given the large heterogeneity in light conditions within a tree crown, this signal was not statistically significant, but the responses within species were surprisingly consistent throughout the study period. Except during a severe drought, stomatal conductance was always lower in trees of Carpinus betulus exposed to elevated CO2 compared to Carpinus trees in ambient air, but the difference was only statistically significant on 2 out of 15 days. In contrast, stomatal responses in Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea varied around zero with no consistent trend in relation to CO2 treatment. During the 2003 drought in the third treatment year, the CO2 effect became reversed in Carpinus, resulting in higher g s in trees exposed to elevated CO2 compared to control trees, most likely due to better water supply because of the previous soil water savings. This was supported by less negative predawn leaf water potential in CO2 enriched Carpinus trees, indicating an improved water status. These findings illustrate (1) smaller than expected CO2-effects on stomata of mature deciduous forest trees, and (2) the possibility of soil moisture feedback on canopy water relations under elevated CO2." .

Physical, chemical, and biological variables were measured monthly in each stream over a 1-year period. The concentrations of nitrates + nitrites, total suspended solids (TSS), and silica in the streams were found to differ during the dry and rainy seasons. Coffee-plantation streams showed the highest levels of suspended solids, nitrates + nitrites, and sulfates. Based on chlorophyll a concentration, the forest and coffee-plantation streams are oligo-mesotrophic, while pasture streams are meso-eutrophic. Forest streams displayed the lowest levels of richness and algal diversity, followed by coffee-plantation streams, whereas pasture streams were the most diverse. Chlorophyll a concentration and species richness depended on land use and season. Forest coverage was positively correlated with acidophilous and oligo-eutraphentic diatom species. Coffee coverage displayed a significant positive correlation with motile species and a significant negative correlation with pollution-sensitive diatom taxa. The results show that diatom assemblages responded to micro-watershed conditions and can be used to monitor the effects of land use on streams in tropical regions." .

At the level of tree populations (e.g. forests), on an arbitrary date, the mean caterpillar intensity per tree (expressed in numbers of larvae or their biomass per 100 shoots) was predicted from the mean frass production per tree (expressed in mg frass per m2 forest floor per day). At the level of the single tree, the frass production on an arbitrary date was related to the population intensity, but, due to the large sampling error, did not provide an accurate prediction. Summing the frass produced over the whole season reduced this error and predicted the seasonal abundance of larvae in single trees, estimated as their maximum intensity or their density (numbers of larvae or their biomass per m2 forest floor). The maximum population intensity was not related to the population density. The sampling techniques suffer from large errors unrelated to larval abundance. The main sources of error (i.e. weather or predation of the larvae) usually cause an underestimation of population size. Labour, the main cause of high costs, was low in the basin technique and high in the frass production technique. Possible ways of reducing errors and applications of the three techniques are discussed." .

Invasive earthworms have the potential to alter soil C dynamics, though mechanisms and effects remain poorly understood. To investigate potential effects of invasive earthworms on forest C, the forest floor, mineral soil, fine root biomass, litterfall and microbial litter decay rates, and total soil respiration (TSR) over a full year were measured at an invaded and uninvaded deciduous forest site in southern Ontario. The uninvaded site was approximately 300 m from the invaded site and a distinct invasion front between sites was present. Along the invasion front, the biomass of the forest floor was negatively correlated with earthworm abundance and biomass. There was no significant difference between litterfall, microbial litter decay, and TSR between the invaded and uninvaded sites, but fine root biomass was approximately 30% lower at the invaded site. There was no significant difference in total soil C pools (0–30 cm) between the invaded and uninvaded sites. Despite profound impacts on forest floor soil C pools, earthworm invasion does not significantly increase TSR, most likely because increased heterotrophic respiration associated with earthworms is largely offset by a decrease in autotrophic respiration caused by lower fine root biomass." .

The use of 13C depleted CO2 (δ13C = −30‰) in a free air CO2 enrichment experiment in a mature deciduous forest permitted us to trace the carbon transfer from tree crowns to the rhizosphere of 100–120 years old trees. During the first season of CO2 enrichment the CO2 released from soil originated substantially from concurrent assimilation. The small contribution of recent carbon in fine roots suggests a much slower fine root turnover than is often assumed.13C abundance in soil air correlated best with temperature data taken from 4 to 10 days before air sampling time and is thus rapidly available for root and rhizosphere respiration. The spatial variability of δ13C in soil air showed relationships to above ground tree types such as conifers versus broad-leaved trees. Considering the complexity and strong overlap of roots from different individuals in a forest, this finding opens an exciting new possibility of associating respiration with different species. What might be seen as signal noise does in fact contain valuable information on the spatial heterogeneity of tree-soil interaction." .

The purpose of this study was to assess the independent and interactive effects of CO2, O3, and plant genotype on the foliar quality of a deciduous tree and the performance of a herbivorous insect. Two trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) genotypes differing in response to CO2 and O3 were grown at the Aspen FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) site located in northern Wisconsin, USA. Trees were exposed to one of four atmospheric treatments: ambient air (control), elevated carbon dioxide (+CO2; 560 µl/l), elevated ozone (+O3; ambient ×1.5), and elevated CO2+O3. We measured the effects of CO2 and O3 on aspen phytochemistry and on performance of forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hübner) larvae. CO2 and O3 treatments influenced foliar quality for both genotypes, with the most notable effects being that elevated CO2 reduced nitrogen and increased tremulacin levels, whereas elevated O3 increased early season nitrogen and reduced tremulacin levels, relative to controls. With respect to insects, the +CO2 treatment had little or no effect on larval performance. Larval performance improved in the +O3 treatment, but this response was negated by the addition of elevated CO2 (i.e., +CO2+O3 treatment). We conclude that tent caterpillars will have the greatest impact on aspen under current CO2 and high O3 levels, due to increases in insect performance and decreases in tree growth, whereas tent caterpillars will have the least impact on aspen under high CO2 and low O3 levels, due to moderate changes in insect performance and increases in tree growth." .

AbstractThe effect of frost events on natural regeneration of Mediterranean mixed forests under a scenario of climate change is not well known. The expected increase in mean annual temperature and the greater inter- and intra-annual variability in frosts occurrence can significantly damage natural regeneration leading to death, with a decisive effect on species composition and forest dynamics. We investigated seasonal variations in frost tolerance of three Mediterranean species (Pinus pinea, Quercus ilex and Juniperus oxycedrus) co-occurring in inland locations in Spain. Our aim was to assess seasonal inter-specific differences in frost sensitivity or tolerance. First, we applied the relative electrolyte leakage method (REL) to estimate the frost tolerance of these species every 3–4 weeks during the 9-month period in which frost events can occur in a year. Second, we explored the REL relationship with environmental variables impacting frost acclimation/deacclimation, i.e., absolute minimum and maximum temperatures and photoperiod. Third, we built a REL model to predict seasonal variations in REL performance of young trees. We simulated REL through a 2-year period, thus defining seasonal bottlenecks in which the dynamics of regeneration can be affected by frost events. Our results showed contrasting behaviors between species, highlighting a greater sensitivity to cold of P. pinea compared to the other two species. The three species are most vulnerable in autumn; however, the different strategies to cope with unfavorable conditions adopted by Q. ilex and J. oxycedrus (e.g., stress tolerance and/or resprouting ability) give these species a competitive advantage over P. pinea." .

Exploitation of remaining forests has led to low abundances of native, valuable timber species. Enrichment planting of selected native tree species into forest gaps is a strategy that may increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity. However, the development of successful planting strategies requires knowledge of environmental demands on, and ecological requirements of, native species during their establishment. This knowledge is currently lacking for mid- and late-successional species in Central American forests. Two deciduous, mid-successional (Cedrela montana, Tabebuia chrysantha) and two evergreen, late-successional native tree species (Nectandra membranacea, Podocarpus sprucei) were planted into felling gaps. Photosynthetic performance and growth in height of these species were assessed along light gradients during seedling establishment to test whether species-specific light responses were related to plant successional traits. Both mid-successional species benefited from higher light levels in gaps up to 30% canopy openness60°. In larger gaps, C. montana exhibited a significant decline in growth. As expected, growth of the late-successional species was only marginally increased at higher light levels. Nevertheless, the photosynthetic apparatus of N. membranacea displayed rapid acclimation to higher light conditions in gaps. Plant response to felling gaps may not always be predicted based on successional status. Our results suggest that the four investigated species may coexist in the same gap by occupying different niches along light gradients. This arrangement may offer an ecological basis to increase the abundance of valuable timber species through enrichment planting in Ecuador mountain rainforests." .

For seven species in a mature mesic forest in southeast Texas, we estimated species-specific parameters representing radial growth in high light and low light for tree saplings. Shade-intolerant species had higher asymptotic growth rates and lower low-light growth than tolerant species. Inspection of species positions on graphs of low-light growth versus high-light growth suggested that there was a trade-off between these two processes across species. By linking functions of growth versus light and mortality versus growth, we also found that shade-intolerant species had higher mortality risk at low light and stronger sensitivity of mortality to light than shade-tolerant species. Moreover, we found that low-light survival and high-light growth were negatively correlated across species. In contrast to northern hardwood forests, where sapling survival in low light may be achieved at the expense of growth, our results suggested that shade-tolerant species in this southern mixed forest can grow faster as well as survive better than shade-intolerant species in low light. We conclude that both sapling growth and survival are important components of shade tolerance and their relationships may be system-specific." .

Root cores were collected during both the wet and dry seasons of 1998 and 1999 from three sites subjected to different forest management treatments in 1990 and assessed for total fine-root biomass and ectomycorrhizal-root biomass. Additionally, a bioassay experiment with P. oaxacana seedlings was conducted to assess the ectomycorrhizal inoculum potential of the soil for each of the three stands. Results indicated that biomasses of both fine roots and ectomycorrhizal roots were reduced by almost 60% in the drought year compared to the nondrought year. There were no significant differences in ectomycorrhizal and fine-root biomass between the wet and dry seasons. Further, the proportion of total root biomass consisting of ectomycorrhizal roots did not vary between years or seasons. These results suggest that both total fine-root biomass and ectomycorrhizal-root biomass are strongly affected by severe drought in these high-elevation tropical pine forests, and that these responses outweigh seasonal effects. Forest management practices in these tropical pine forests should consider the effects of drought on the capacity of P. oaxacana to maintain sufficient levels of ectomycorrhizae especially when there is a potential for synergistic interactions between multiple disturbances that may lead to more severe stress in the host plant and subsequent reductions in ectomycorrhizal colonization." .

Twenty-nine trees were measured in three stands (young, middle-aged, and mature), with three thinning treatments (unthinned, normal, and intensive) in the two older stands. There was a strong linear relationship between the total cross-sectional area of branches and that of stem at crown base. Foliage mass was linearly related with stem basal area at crown base. Also an allometric relationship was found between foliage mass and crown length. The mean length (weighted by basal area) of branches obeyed an exponential function of crown length. The parameters of most of these relationships were independent of slenderness (tree height/breast height diameter) and tree age However, total branch cross-sectional area per stem cross-sectional area in the young trees was greater than in the older trees. The young trees also had slightly shorter branches than predicted by the mean branch length equation. This was probably caused by branch senescence which had not yet started in the young stand. The older trees had a relatively long lower crown segment which was growing slowly and senescing. It was proposed that a segmented crown structure is characteristic of shade tolerant tree species, and that the structural model could be further developed by making the two segments explicit." .

Although carbon (C) stock change in degradation and devegetation by remote sensing are becoming increasingly powerful, the drivers of degradation, wood collection and harvest dynamics, cannot be understood without “on the ground” sampling. A methodological tool for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of forest degradation is proposed as developed based on a research on the stump history in the black locust degrading stands sampled in southwest Romania. Based on the survey of stumps, the cutting regime and wood extraction is determined over a past period of some 15 years. Stump age classification comprises multiple qualitative criteria (i.e. bark features; adherence of sprouts; cut edge features; etc.). The method allows for a quantitative assessment of wood removal over time, and is suitable for the development of a dynamic baseline and monitoring of degradation avoidance activities." .

Carabids and wood ants were sampled by pitfall trapping throughout the forest stand from March to September 1998. The abundance of individual carabid species were modelled using vegetation type (grass or bracken), litter depth and wood ant density as independent explanatory variables. Models were fitted using a maximum-likelihood method (GLIM v.3.77; Baker 1985) with the assumption of a Poisson distribution, using a log-link function. Areas of high wood ant density were characterised by low abundance and species richness of carabids and high percentage dominance by the most commonly sampled species, Abax parallelepipedus. The extent and type of vegetation cover was found to influence the distribution and abundance of certain carabid species but only in areas where the density of wood ants was low. Large-bodied species occurred more frequently in bracken-dominated patches where the litter layer was deeper and the density of potential prey items was higher. Wood ant density was found to be the most important determinant of carabid species abundance in the study site." .

We reviewed data obtained for seven tree species, belonging to the legume family and the genus Clusia of the Clusiaceae. These groups were chosen because legumes are the most abundant tree species in the Atlantic forest complex (except in the open restingas), and the genus Clusia is reportedly of utmost ecological importance as nurse plants in several habitats of the complex. These species were surveyed along one or more of several forest and open habitats at the margin of the Atlantic rain forest (open restingas, restinga dry forest, inselberg, semideciduous dry forest) and indicated the following general patterns: (1) at the intraspecific level, ecophysiological performance often (but not always) varied largely in both time and space; (2) at the interspecific level, ecophysiological performance was often (but not always) related positively to species dominance in the community; and (3) at both levels, ecophysiological performance was not related to the geographic distribution patterns, i.e., generalists and specialists did not form groups of similarly behaving plants in regard to ecophysiology.

Karst.] trees at 12 sites from S. W. Germany to N. Scotland. At sites in Germany, where trees were showing symptoms of ‘decline’, samples were taken from trees with ‘good’ crown condition and ‘poor’ crown conditon. The distinction between ‘good’ and ‘poor’ was made on the basis of international protocols for defining crown density and foliar discoloration. There was a wide range in nutrient content (percent dry weight) in apparently healthy trees. Current year foliage had ranges of mean values per site: S(0.07–0.13%), N(0.9–1.4%), K(0.5–0.9%), Ca(0.2–0.7%), and Mg (0.05–0.1%). Ranges were greater for 2-year-old foliage: S(0.09–0.18%), N(1.0–1.8%), K(0.4–0.7%), Ca(0.2–1.4%), and Mg(0.03–0.09%). At sites with trees having ‘poor’ crown condition, there were significantly smaller concentrations of Mg and Ca, and larger concentrations of K in 2-year-old foliage from ‘poor’ trees, compared with adjacent ‘good’ trees. Ratios of nutrient content were more significantly related to crown condition within sites than individual nutrients, especially in older needles. ‘Poor’ crowns were associated with larger ratios of N∶Mg, K∶Mg, S∶Mg, K∶Ca and smaller ratios of S∶K and N∶K. A ‘risk index’ is defined for trees showing no visible ‘decline’ symptoms, based upon nutrient content and nutrient ratios, which may be useful in identifying sites liable to experience deterioration in crown condition. With the exception of one German site, where few ‘poor’ trees were observed, the index increases from Scottish sites to English sites to Dutch sites to German sites. The index is empirical, and not necessarily related to potential effects of air pollution. The time dependence of foliar nutrient content may also be useful in diagnosis. At sites with trees having ‘poor’ crown condition, even apparently healthy trees showed a lack of increase in calcium content with needle age, decreases in nitrogen content and very large decreases in magnesium content with needle age. The results show the importance of sampling several year classes of foliage from Norway spruce trees in determining the nutrient status of the tree." .

Spiral grain angle in Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) seedlings was investigated in relation to growth rate, endogenous and applied ethylene. Trees from stands of Norway spruce, which were irrigated and fertilised in order to enhance growth, and trees having different growth rates in non-treated stands were studied. Stem growth rate at the stand level (m3 ha–1 year–1) was measured annually, or by means of microscopy on stem sections as the number and size of tracheids produced. Enhanced growth increased ethylene evolution and maintained a high level of left-handed spiral grain angle in comparison to slower-growing trees. An increased number of earlywood tracheids in fast growing trees was correlated to a more left-handed spiral grain angle. Ethrel, applied to stems of balsam fir seedlings, increased the internal ethylene levels in parallel with increased left-handed spiral grain angle. The results indicate that ethylene regulates the extent of spiral grain angle." .

The characteristics of soils under the two contrasting agricultural modes were compared with those of soils under rain forest, in order to infer the differential effects. Relative to the forest levels, the soil organic matter and nutrient levels were not substantially reduced in soils under plantations of cocoa. This is largely because cocoa plantations replicate forest conditions. In contrast, organic matter and nutrient levels were much lower in shifting cultivation farmlands. This is attributable to the fact that the crops of cassava and maize have a low ground cover, they generate relatively small amounts of litter and so do not replicate forest conditions. Measures which might be adopted to conserve soil organic matter and nutrient status during shifting cultivation methods are discussed." .

Studies on old-growth forests have multiplied in the last three decades. Most of these studies have focussed on defining the structural features of old-growth forests of non-Mediterranean forest ecosystems or of specific forest types. In Italy, forest structure since Roman times has been greatly influenced by man. For this reason, the concept of old-growth forest in these ecosystems seems more controversial than at the global level. Nonetheless, in the Mediterranean region, there are persistent forest formations that present a certain level of oldgrowthness. These types of forests have been identified mostly in National Parks. The description of forest structure requires a vast amount of information about several biometric attributes. Consequently, the classification of forests as old growth is very time- and resource-consuming. This research aims to describe and test a proposed methodology to classify and determine the relative oldgrowthness of a series of forest inventory plots. Data from 77 beech forest plots located all across Italy were collected and compared with a virtual reference plot. To compare the forest plots, a set of similarity/dissimilarity indexes were tested. The results obtained show that it is possible to accurately rank the oldgrowthness of forest plots and to screen them to exclude non-old-growth forests. The method described was applied for the first time on a set of plots located in the Italian National Parks to determine a priority list of beech forests where further studies need to be conducted." .

First, the distribution of annual mass growth in the stem is determined as a function of the total annual growth in stem mass, current stem mass and the distribution of the latter along the stem. Second, the distribution of diameter growth is obtained by converting the fraction of annual growth in the stem mass at a given height in the stem into the thickness of the annual ring at the same height. Application of the model to Scots pine data sets including both young and mature trees not used in parameter estimation showed that the model was capable of reconstructing the distribution of diameter growth from the stem butt to the apex and from the pith to the stem surface at any height in the stem in both young and mature trees. The resulting empirical model was also linked to a physiological, process-based model in order to study its performance in a simulated stand. Simulations representing trees grown in unthinned and thinned Scots pine stands with trees of different status (from dominant to suppressed) showed that the response in tree growth to thinning in terms of the distribution of diameter growth along the stem was quite realistic relative to measured data." .

Lianas invest less in structural support but more in leaves compared to trees of similar biomass. These physiological and morphological differences suggest that lianas may interact with neighboring plants in ways that are different from similarly sized trees. However, the vast majority of past liana competition studies have failed to identify the unique competitive effects of lianas by controlling for the amount of biomass removed. We assessed liana competition in the forest understory over the course of 3 years by removing liana biomass and an equal amount of tree biomass in 40 plots at 10 sites in a secondary tropical moist forest in central Panama. We found that growth of understory trees and lianas, as well as planted seedlings, was limited due to competitive effects from both lianas and trees, though the competitive impacts varied by species, season, and size of neighbors. The removal of trees resulted in greater survival of planted seedlings compared to the removal of lianas, apparently related to a greater release from competition for light. In contrast, lianas had a species-specific negative effect on drought-tolerant Dipteryx oleifera seedlings during the dry season, potentially due to competition for water. We conclude that, at local scales, lianas and trees have unique and differential effects on understory dynamics, with lianas potentially competing more strongly during the dry season, and trees competing more strongly for light." .

However, it occurs only in second growth on the larger neighbor island of Trinidad and on the neotropical mainland. Habitat niche expansion into Tobago forest has been facilitated by several behavioral traits which set the antshrike apart from other foliage-gleaners of forest and second growth on Tobago. The antshrike captures a higher diversity of foliage, branch & trunk, and terrestrial arthropods. It forages over a wider range of heights and under a wider variety of crown cover situations than any of its closest ecological counterparts on Tobago. The antshrike also takes a wider range of prey sizes and regularly uses additional food sources, including fruit and ants, not taken by other guild members. The broad foraging niche of the antshrike enables it to breed during many times of the year when other narrower-niched foliage-gleaners do not. On Trinidad, although the most common foliagegleaner in second growth, the antshrike was not observed in adjacent closed rain forest. Several facts suggest that diffuse competition may be excluding antshrikes from Trinidad forest: 1) a general pattern of rarity or absence in other parts of its range where there are more guild members; 2) more species and individuals of foliagegleaners with an overall higher biomass in Trinidad forest than in Tobago forest; 3) foliage arthropod resources are significantly (1.7x) lower in Trinidad forest than Tobago forest, suggesting that Trinidad forest guild members may be depressing the quantity of important resources for antshrikes; and 4) Trinidad forest species with the highest foraging similarity to antshrikes have a greater precentage of prey captures comprised of relatively specialized attack behaviors than do Tobago forest antshrikes. Foraging generalists like the Barred Antshrike appear to expand or contract their habitat niches depending upon the number of ecologically similar species in a given habitat. They may occur in high densities in habitats typically foreign to them provided competitors are few and there is sufficient food to supply their catholic requirements." .

However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the fine root branching system have hampered the assessment and prediction of C and N dynamics at ecosystem scales. We examined how root morphology, biomass, and chemistry differed with root branch orders (1–5 with root tips classified as first order roots) and how different root orders responded to increased C sink strength (via N fertilization) and reduced carbon source strength (via canopy scorching) in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris L.) ecosystem. With increasing root order, the diameter and length of individual roots increased, whereas the specific root length decreased. Total root biomass on an areal basis was similar among the first four orders but increased for the fifth order roots. Consequently, total root length and total root surface area decreased systematically with increasing root order. Fine root N and lignin concentrations decreased, while total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) and cellulose concentrations increased with increasing root order. N addition and canopy disturbance did not alter root morphology, but they did influence root chemistry. N fertilization increased fine root N concentration and content per unit area in all five orders, while canopy scorching decreased root N concentration. Moreover, TNC concentration and content in fifth order roots were also reduced by canopy scorching. Our results indicate that the small, fragile, and more easily overlooked first and second order roots may be disproportionately important in ecosystem scale C and N fluxes due to their large proportions of fine root biomass, high N concentrations, relatively short lifespans, and potentially high decomposition rates." .

This represents one of the oldest known examples of this forest type and it is located on one of the most extreme sites in the northeastern United States. P. rigida represented 88% of all sampled trees, which typically grew on individual soil islands with soil depths of 8–35 cm surrounded by exposed bedrock. The forest was uneven-aged and P. rigida exhibited continuous recruitment into the tree size classes since the late 1600s, suggesting that it represents a physiographic climax for this species. However, a limited amount of Nyssa sylvatica and Quercus prinus recruitment started after 1830. Peak recruitment of P. rigida trees in 1720–1760 and 1860–1890 coincided with parabolic-shaped releases in their radial growth, possibly in response to disturbances. Tree ring growth was typically <0.4 mm/year since the 1850s and <0.3 mm/year during a prolonged and severe drought in the 1960s. However, large increases in precipitation and temperature from 1970 to 1993 were correlated with a dramatic post-drought growth response producing the highest ring width index values throughout the life of 260 to 280-year-old trees. Thus, we attribute certain moderate growth releases (>50%) lasting 10–15 years to climate, rather than disturbance. Tree growth and recruitment at the study site were influenced by a complex interaction of climate, soil and disturbance factors. Coupling of species recruitment, tree ring and climatic data in this study provided an improved technique for understanding forest growth and dynamics." .

It was found that actual sap flow rate per wood area increases in stems from the pith towards the cambium. The outermost part of the stem is the most important part of the tree for conducting water. Maximum actually measured transpiration (sap flow rate) for the stand was practically identical to the theoretical rate calculated based on petiole anatomy, but it was about 45 times lower than that calculated based on stem anatomy. This illustrates the safety features of stem wood, which due to its high vessel density, is capable of transporting all the water required even when only a small area of its vessels is working. In the petioles, xylem is more efficiently used, but almost all vessels must work in order to supply water to leaves and any disturbance may cause leaf loss." .

The modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of 45 × 90 mm specimens of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) plantation dimension lumber were analyzed by average growth ring width and average density of each group. The results showed that the average growth ring width was in inverse proportion to density, MOE, and MOR of the dimension lumber. Furthermore, average density was in direct proportion to MOE and MOR of the dimension lumber. The coefficient of determination (R 2) for all the regression equations ranged from 0.7340 to 0.9207 at a significance level of 0.001. However, without such group classification, there was poor relationship between growth ring width, density, MOE, and MOR with a determination coefficient of 0.0901–0.1855. This finding suggested that it was feasible to predict the flexural properties of Chinese fir plantation dimension lumber by average growth ring width after specimen group classification." .

It is based on the theory of conventional optical LAI determinations, but refined for the inclusion of 3D depth information from the laser scanner. For each objective tree, we first used a single scan to measure local gap fractions beyond determined crown depths and combined this scan with other scans to delineate the geometrical dimensions of the crown. Then, through integrating the information from both aspects, the local leaf area density and the corresponding volume were derived. Finally, the total leaf area was obtained as the scalar product of these two variables. As most procedures were implemented on segmented 2D range images, the method possesses high efficiency. Additionally, through using gap fraction beyond determined crown depths, it solved the zero gap fraction problem encountered in segmented hemispherical photograph analysis. The method was tested on 11 trees in a 39 years old Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) stand located in southern Bavaria, Germany. Through correlation of the results with the estimates obtained with allometric equations, the accuracy was validated. The influence of the crown depth, for measuring gap fraction, and the segment size on estimation were also analyzed." .

The transmission of solar radiation into the forest was affected not only by a high level of horizontal and vertical heterogeneity of the forest canopy, but also by low angles of the sun’s path. The below-canopy direct solar radiation appeared to be variable in space and time. On average, the highest amount of transmitted direct solar radiation was estimated below the undisturbed canopy at the southeast of the gap centre. The transmitted diffuse and global solar radiation above the forest floor exhibited lower variability and, on average, both were higher at the centre of the canopy gaps. Canopy structure and stand parameters were also measured to explain the variation in the below-canopy solar radiation in the forest. The model that best fit the transmitted below-canopy direct solar radiation was a growth model, using plant area index with an ellipsoidal angle distribution as the independent variable (R 2 = 0.263). Both diffuse and global solar radiation were very sensitive to canopy openness, and for both cases a quadratic model provided the best fit for these data (R 2 = 0.963 and 0.833, respectively). As much as 75% and 73% of the variation in the diffuse and global solar radiation, respectively, were explained by a combination of stand parameters, namely basal area, crown projection, crown volume, stem volume, and average equivalent crown radius." .

However, understorey light availability is not easy for forest managers or scientists to measure. Therefore, different models have been developed to predict light transmission in forest stands according to tree or stand structure. However, these models are generally too complex to be used operationally. This paper reports the assessment of light transmission according to stand parameters commonly measured by foresters in inventories. We measured transmittance in 29 even-aged oak stands in France for various wavebands, total solar radiation (TSR, 300–3000 nm), PAR (400–700 nm), red (R, 660 nm) and far-red (FR, 730 nm), and demonstrated that transmittance in a given waveband can be predicted from the measurement of another waveband. The R:FR ratio can be predicted according to TSR or PAR transmittance, but the opposite is also true; PAR or TSR transmittance can be predicted from the R:FR ratio. Transmittance variability was characterised, and the variation coefficient ranged from 5 to 45% with a trend to increase with tree density. By analogy to Beer–Lambert's law, we established that mean daily transmittance for the different wavebands can be assessed according to stand basal area and stand age with good accuracy (R 2>0.74). Results are discussed in comparison with other models based on the principle of parsimony." .

Originating in 18th century Europe with the aim of avoiding social and economic disruptions associated with timber shortages, sustained-yield forest management evolved to a highly technical process of modeling growth, mortality, and risk in order to set timber removals at a level that theoretically could be maintained in perpetuity. Changing scientific understanding of the ecological functioning of forest ecosystems has challenged the notion that a sustained yield of timber is equivalent to sustaining all the components and natural processes necessary to maintain the long-term health and productivity of these ecosystems. Continuing uncertainty over what is socially and economically acceptable, as well as ecologically sustainable, will make optimality in forest management a much more difficult objective than in the past." .

Don trees were grown in the presence and absence of the woody weed broom (Cytisus scoparius L.) on a dryland site for 2 years to determine the effects of competition from weeds on wood properties in juvenile trees. Wood property measurements made on cross-sections from the bark to the pith were scaled to convert results from distance to a time basis using sigmoidal equations fitted to monthly measurements of tree diameter. When averaged across the 2 years, the presence of the weeds significantly increased wood density (+11%), wall thickness (+6%) and modulus of elasticity (MOESS, +93%), and significantly reduced microfibril angle (MFA, −21%) and radial diameter (−8%). Radial growth rate was significantly correlated to wood density, and this relationship held across both treatment and age. At the seasonal scale, there was close correspondence between changes in MFA and growth rate. Ring width was significantly related to both MFA and MOESS at the annual scale. Although both of these relationships held across treatments, year significantly influenced the value of coefficients in the relationships. The results highlight the direct effects of the presence of weeds on wood properties and the need to consider silvicultural treatments appropriate for balancing gains in productivity with losses in wood quality for timber production." .

Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are important for promoting the mineral nutrition, growth and survival of plants used to rehabilitate degraded areas. Clusia pusilla is an evergreen shrub which is tolerant of high irradiance, germinates readily and can be easily reproduced by cuttings. All these characteristics make this species useful in the recovery of deforested areas. The aim of this work was to explore the response of C. pusilla to AM in the field, in two types of soil: the shrubland soil in which the species naturally grows and in a soil of a riparian forest. Eight treatments were performed in each type of soil. The treatments consisted of a non-mycorrhizal control and mycorrhizal plants colonized by one of the three AM inocula tested in the presence or absence of triple superphosphate (150 kg ha–1). After 11 months of growth in the shrubland soil, C. pusilla seedlings showed an increase in height and dry weight in response to the fertilizer but not to mycorrhizas. In contrast, in the forest soil the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) effect was equivalent to the fertilizer effect, and the two effects interacted positively. The lack of response to AM in shrubland soil was caused by its high sand content, which hinders the retention of the inocula. Due to a higher clay content, the forest soil binds inocula more tightly than shrubland soil. In conclusion, C. pusilla appears to benefit greatly from the addition of AMF in forest soil, though it requires an additional P source for such benefits in shrubland soil. This P source must be organic so that phosphorus is not lost by leaching. Although the growth rate of this species is very low, its survival can be guaranteed with the application of AMF inocula together with P-fertilizer applied at a low rate." .

AbstractDespite the importance of respiration in the overall carbon balance of plants, recovery after defoliation and debudding has been largely related to changes in carbon uptake; the significance of respiration has received much less attention. Growth, biomass and leaf-level carbon balance (both photosynthesis and dark respiration at night) responses of young Eucalyptus globulus potted-saplings to debudding (B), partial defoliation (D) and combined B&D treatments were assessed over a 12-week recovery period. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates (A 1500) were asynchronous with night respiration rates (R dark) throughout the course of the experiment; 5 weeks after defoliation, significant increases in A 1500 were accompanied by concomitant increases in R dark in the B&D and B and D treatments. By week 8, while A 1500 returned to control values, R dark had increased, particularly in the B&D treatment. Saplings in the B and D treatments showed full recovery with growth, biomass and leaf area being similar to control saplings by week 12. In contrast, saplings in the B&D treatment appeared unable to compensate for the combined removal of all buds and 35 % leaf area as evidenced by slowed height increments and reductions in total biomass of >30 %. Simple modelling of whole-plant net CO2 uptake showed that saplings in the B&D treatment fixed 20 % less CO2 than the other treatments at week 12, suggesting that recovery following this treatment and the D treatment was dependent on changes in total leaf area development and whole-tree assimilation rather than differences in assimilation or respiration per unit foliage area. Increased biomass allocation to bud in weeks 5 and 8 suggested that the pattern of refoliation after defoliation and debudding was related to changes in tree architecture from the release of latent buds." .

Despite their importance, there is little information relating above-ground form and function to below-ground form and function. In this paper, we present allometric relationships between above- and below-ground components for young (<2 years old) Eucalyptus globulus, a globally important plantation tree species, in southern Tasmania, Australia. In particular, we examined relationships that exist between leaf area, above-ground biomass, fine root surface area and fine root biomass using destructive harvesting techniques. Fine roots (<5 mm) were sampled spatially and temporally using sequential coring and scaled to estimate total fine root biomass and total fine root surface area using a weighting technique. There were strong relationships between leaf area and above-ground biomass with below-ground fine root surface area and biomass. These results are discussed in relation to the functional balance hypothesis for water transport in plants." .

Trees studied grew in an uneven-aged forest (80 years old on average, main canopy surface at a height of 18m) forming the former IBP forest research site at Báb, SW Slovakia (Czechoslovakia). The average photosynthetic rate of oak foliage was higher than that of hornbeam. Net photosynthetic rate at saturating photon flux rate (PNmax) of hornbeam amounted to only 60% of that of oak for the leaves of the upper canopy layer (UCL) and to 67% for the leaves of the lower canopy layer (LCL). In the summer months the main photosynthetic activity of this deciduous stand was focused upon the UCL leaves and oak species. The relationship between PN and photon flux rate, as well as the diurnal course of PN and stomatal conductance (gs), was calculated using a mathematical model. The diurnal course of PN and gs were similar for both tree species and both types of leaf. Maximal gs values were observed at noon. The lower values of compensation photon flux rate (Γ1) and photosynthetic efficiency (α) but higher values of the maintenance respiration rate (RM), confirmed the higher shade tolerance of the hornbeam. The dark respiration rate (RD) of the UCL leaves was higher than that (RD) of the LCL leaves. Various photosynthetic features and production capacity of the above-mentioned types of leaf expressed the adaptation pressures to radiation conditions. In the stand studied, the primary production of the greater part of the crown depended on the vertical foliage distribution and on light penetration during the midday hours." .

On low fluvial terraces of the Caquetá River, Araracuara region, Colombia, tree root systems were examined with regard to their structure, underground stratification and biomass distribution. Excavations of skeleton roots and microscopic observation of terminal fine roots included ten species belonging to the Cecropia, Vismia, Miconia, Goupia, Clathrotropis and Brosimum genera. Roots of particular species varied in the external features of their periderm and structure of freshly cut slash. Coarse skeleton roots differed in the shape and position of the plagiotropic branches and positively geotropic taproots or sinkers. None of the observed species could be identified as a shallow-rooted tree, in spite of the general fine root concentration in the upper soil horizon. In the two seasons of study, the terminal roots displayed prevailingly secondary anatomical structure and did not maintain much primary anatomical tissue in their apices. Neither ectomycorrhizas nor endomycorrhizas were detected in the samples. In a set of regeneration stages the amount of tree roots linearly increased with the age of growth. However, fine roots below 2 mm in diameter shared 80–90% of all roots in the upper 20 cm layer of all sample plots. In an old-growth forest, the total tree root biomass amounted to 39 ton/ha, thus being comparable to the underground biomass observed in similar tropical forests." .

Fifty-two sample trees from seven sites in different regions of the Czech Republic were used for destructive measurements. The observed aboveground biomass (B AB) and its individual components were examined by different types of non-linear regression models using one to five independent variables including stem diameter (D), tree height (H), tree age (A), crown length (C) and altitude (Z). The best single-equation approximation of B AB was a three-parameter model using D, H and Z, which was also best suited for bark. Including altitude into classical multiplicative exponential function with three independent variables (DHZ) and four parameters yielded the best model for stem over or under bark. Age was important for assessment of dead branches within DHA model, whereas living branches were best approximated using four variables including C (DHAC model). The most complex model (DHACZ) worked best for needle biomass. The comparison of B AB assessment by single regression equation and from sum of individual components showed a negligible difference for full-grown trees, whereas the additive assessment yielded considerably higher B AB for small or young trees. This corresponds to the assessed confidence intervals for individual trees that were larger for smaller trees. The paper also discusses the issue of commonly used linearization of biomass equations and application of linear regression, and provides comparative examples with nonlinear approach used here. The paper presents the parameter sets for the tested equations for B AB and individual biomass components." .

Quantifying the magnitude of variation in leaf-level photosynthesis in a forest canopy will improve our understanding of and ability to model forest carbon cycling. This information requires extensive sampling of photosynthesis in the canopy. We used a 22-m-tall, four-wheel-drive aerial lift to reach five to ten leaves from the tops of numerous individuals of several species of temperate deciduous trees in central Massachusetts. The goals of this study were to measure light-saturated photosynthesis in co-occurring canopy tree species under field conditions, and to identify sampling schemes appropriate for canopy tree studies with challenging logistics. Photosynthesis differed significantly among species. Even though all leaves measured were canopy-top, sun-acclimated foliage, the more shade-tolerant species tended to have lower light-saturated photosynthetic rates (P max) than the shade-intolerant species. Likewise, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content (N) varied significantly between species. With only one exception, the shade-tolerant species tended to have lower nitrogen content on an area basis than the intolerant species, although the LMA did not differ systematically between these ecological types. Light-saturated P max rates and nitrogen content, both calculated on either an area or a mass basis, and the leaf mass to area ratio, significantly differed not only among species, but also among individuals within species (P<0.0001 for both). Differences among species accounted for a greater proportion of variance in the P max rates and the nitrogen content than the differences among individuals within a species (58.5–78.8% of the total variance for the measured parameters was attributed to species-level differences versus 5.5–17.4% of the variance was attributed to differences between individual trees of a given species). Furthermore, more variation is accounted for by differences among leaves in a single individual tree, than by differences among individual trees of a given species (10.7–30.4% versus 5.5–17.4%). This result allows us to compare species-level photosynthesis, even if the sample size of the number of trees is low. This is important because studies of canopy-level photosynthesis are often limited by the difficulty of canopy access. As an alternative to direct canopy access measurements of photosynthesis, it would be useful to find an ”easy-to-measure” proxy for light-saturated photosynthetic rates to facilitate modeling forest carbon cycling. Across all species in this study, the strongest correlation was between nitrogen content expressed on an area basis (mmol m–2, N area) and light-saturated P max rate (μmol m–2 s–1, P maxarea) (r 2=0.511). However, within a given species, leaf nitrogen was not tightly correlated with photosynthesis. Our sampling design minimized intra-specific leaf-level variation (i.e., leaves were taken only from the top of the canopy and at only one point in the season). This implies that easy-to-measure trends in nitrogen content of leaves may be used to predict the species-specific light-saturated P max rates." .

We compare aboveground biomass dynamics of dry and wet Neotropical forests, based on monitoring data gathered over 3–16 years in forests covering the first 25 years of succession. We estimated standing biomass, annual biomass change, and contributions of tree growth, recruitment, and mortality. We also evaluated tree species’ contributions to biomass dynamics. Absolute rates of biomass change were lower in dry forests, 2.3 and 1.9 Mg ha−1 y−1, after 5–15 and 15–25 years after abandonment, respectively, than in wet forests, with 4.7 and 6.1 Mg ha−1 y−1, in the same age classes. Biomass change was largely driven by tree growth, accounting for at least 48% of biomass change across forest types and age classes. Mortality also contributed strongly to biomass change in wet forests of 5–15 years, whereas its contribution became important later in succession in dry forests. Biomass dynamics tended to be dominated by fewer species in early-successional dry than wet forests, but dominance was strong in both forest types. Overall, our results indicate that biomass dynamics during succession are faster in Neotropical wet than dry forests, with high tree mortality earlier in succession in the wet forests. Long-term monitoring of second-growth tropical forest plots is crucial for improving estimates of annual biomass change, and for enhancing understanding of the underlying mechanisms and demographic drivers." .

AbstractThe intensity of silvicultural interventions and the composition of tree species are important forest management decisions. Both determine tree shape and thus influence the value of a tree, be it in terms of economy (trunk form, branchiness), or in terms of ecology (microhabitats). However, our knowledge on the distinct changes in tree architecture due to silvicultural management intensity or different neighborhood diversities is still limited, especially if the focus is on single tree attributes, e.g., branching patterns or crown shapes. We used terrestrial laser scanner data to calculate 25 structural measures for 55 European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees that grew either in pure stands along a gradient of management intensity or in intra or interspecific neighborhoods in unmanaged stands. We found a lower height of maximal horizontal crown extension, a higher crown surface area, and straighter trunks with increasing management intensity. Moreover, our study revealed that beech trees surrounded by valuable hardwoods showed a lower height of maximal horizontal crown extension, a lower height–diameter ratio, and longer branches with flatter branch angles than beech trees surrounded by conspecific neighbors. Our findings provide evidence of phenotypic plasticity of European beech to diverse environmental conditions. The differences in tree structure indicate an increasing crown competition with decreasing management intensity and stronger competitive pressure for beech surrounded by conspecific neighbors in comparison to alien neighbors." .

We hypothesized that the observed increase in carbon (C) sequestration associated with afforestation of semi-arid sparse shrubland must also be associated with an increase in N input. We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing the ecosystem N budget of two ecosystems, a semi-arid shrubland and a nearby planted pine forest, using measurements augmented with literature-based estimates. Our findings demonstrate that, contrary to our hypothesis, massive C sequestration by the pine forest could be accounted for without a change in the net N budget (i.e., neither elevated N inputs nor reduced N losses). However, in comparison to the shrubland, the forest showed an almost tripling in aboveground N use efficiency (NUE; 235 vs. 83 kg dry mass kg−1 N) and a doubling in ecosystem level C/N ratio (16 vs. 8, for the forest and shrubland, respectively). Nitrogen cycling slowed in the forest compared to the shrubland: net N mineralization rates in soils decreased by approximately 50%, decomposition rates decreased by approximately 20%, and NOx loss decreased by approximately 64%. These adjustments in N cycling provide a possible basis for increased NUE and subsequent C sequestration without net change in the overall N budget, which should be addressed in future investigations." .

In a study of radial trends in specific gravity of ~100 individuals of six mixed-northern-hardwood-forest tree species, three species (Acer rubrum, Pinus strobus, and Betula papyrifera) showed radial increases and three species (Quercus rubrum, Tsuga canadensis, and Fagus grandifolia) radial decreases. Analysis of these data, together with a larger data set including both temperate and tropical tree species, focuses on relationship of radial trends to successional status, variation in inside versus outside wood, and factors affecting degree and direction of radial trend. We propose a model for radial trends in which (1) radial increases associated with low values of specific gravity are an early-successional characteristic and radial decreases associated with high values of specific gravity late successional, (2) the differences in specific gravity and its radial trends reflect growth strategy and biomechanical considerations, and (3) the convergence in values seen in older trees is due to constraints relating to support." .

We investigated the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal community characteristics of declining temperate eucalypt forests in Tasmania. Within this context, we explored the diversity of EcM fungi of two forest types in the northern highlands in the east and west of the island. We hypothesised that EcM fungal community richness and composition would differ between forest type but that the Cortinariaceae would be the dominant family irrespective of forest type. We proposed that EcM richness would be greater in the wet sclerophyll forest than the dry sclerophyll forest type. Using both sporocarps and EcM fungi from root tips amplified by PCR and sequenced in the rDNA ITS region, 175 EcM operational taxonomic units were identified of which 97 belonged to the Cortinariaceae. The Cortinariaceae were the most diverse family, in both the above and below ground communities. Three distinct fungal assemblages occurred within the wet and dry sclerophyll forest types and two geographic regions that were studied, although this pattern did not remain when only the root tip data were analysed. EcM sporocarp richness was unusually higher than root tip richness and EcM richness did not significantly differ among forest types. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of the Cortinariaceae and the drivers of EcM fungal community composition within these forests." .

Forest management decisions (with or without anticipation of climate change) are made by each forest owner individually. Within a forest landscape, anticipation of climate change will thus reflect the different attitudes of the different owners. Many forest-based ecosystem services integrate the effect of the management strategies of different owners at a landscape scale. Some ecosystem services are enjoyed privately by the forest owners; others are enjoyed publicly without clear feedback to the individual owners. Here we use a spatially explicit simulation of a forest landscape in the Netherlands. This landscape is managed by a patchwork of different forest owners with different objectives: from strict nature reserve to more timber production oriented. We simulate the development of the forest landscape under different climatic scenarios and with different management scenarios to adapt the forest to anticipated climate change. We evaluate the impact of these scenarios using indicators for six ecosystem services. Both climate change and anticipation of climate change can severely affect the provisioning of ecosystem services by the forest landscape. Precautionary management, designed to minimise damage from climate change, was able to balance, at the landscape level, the effect of changes in ecosystem services and avoids landscape shifts between privately and publicly enjoyed ecosystem services. On the other hand, a scenario mainly consisting of management schemes that tried to extract extra (private) benefits from anticipated climate change would greatly reduce the supply of the other (publicly enjoyed) ecosystem services at the landscape level." .

European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were compared. Seven forest stands of each species were chosen to cover their natural distribution in Slovakia. Species-specific BCEF are presented, generally showing a steep decrease in all species in the smallest trees, with the only exception in the case of branch BCEF in beech which grows with increasing tree size. The values of BCEF for all tree compartments stabilise in all species once trees reach about 60–70-mm diameter at base. As they grow larger, all species increase their allocation to stem and branches, while decreasing the relative growth of roots and foliage. There are, however, clear differences between species and also between broadleaves and conifers in biomass allocation. This research shows that species-specific coefficients must be used if we are to reduce uncertainties in estimates of carbon stock changes by afforestation and reforestation activities." .

Branch development of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) was studied in a planting-design experiment in central Finland. Data was collected from 18 trees growing in stand densities of 400, 1,600 and 5,000 stems ha–1. Annual radial increments were measured from branches systematically sampled between the stem apex and crown base. Sawn specimens that included the thickest branch or knot were taken from the stem below the living crown, and the years of suppression, death, and occlusion of the branches were determined. After initial years of irregular radial increment, branch increment declined gradually with increasing branch age. In the lowest part of the crown, the branches remained alive for 3–4 years without forming annual rings. Wider spacing of trees delayed the reduction in branch increment and increased branch longevity. Branches were occluded 7–10 years after their death. The number of years from branch initiation to occlusion was 20 on plot 400. This period decreased to 13 years on plot 5,000. When the width of annual rings in the stem formed during each development period of branches was examined, the differences between the stand densities were more apparent due to the rapid stem diameter increment on sparse plots. A model was developed for predicting branch increment at different heights in the crown. The best independent variables for predicting branch increment were branch age and stem radial increment." .

AbstractScots pine is one of the most widely distributed tree species in Europe. It occurs in the boreal forest but also occupies vast areas on dry sites of the Mediterranean region and on continental sites in Central and Eastern Europe. Improved understanding of the influence of climatic factors, forest management and tree interactions on the relationship between tree height and stem diameter is necessary for sustainable forest management. The main objective of the present study was to study the changes in the stem allometry of Scots pine and to classify them using the periodic allometric coefficient of the height–diameter relationship. Periodic (annual) height and diameter increment data of 114 trees with observation periods from 40 to 115 years from three European countries including Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic was used. Periodic allometric coefficients were calculated for the whole trees’s observation period to identify the effect of different environmental conditions and management. To classify trajectories of the allometric coefficient, eight clustering algorithms were qualified and internal validation of algorithms was carried out by three indices. The performance of a superior algorithm was compared according to five different distance measures and seven clustering methods. Study results indicated a variable allometric relationship between tree height and diameter which did not follow elasticity or geometric scaling rules across sites. Also, significant differences in allometric coefficients were found between the sites. In regard to the latitudinal difference one similar allometric coefficient trajectory for Estonia and one for Poland and the Czech Republic were found." .

Cell walls in the frost ring, that formed in the earlywood due to an abrupt drop in the temperature one night in the Spring, were poorly developed, lacking in the proper thickness and the proportion of wall constituents. In majority of the cases, the cell walls were highly convoluted and the secondary walls developed poorly and incompletely. Judging by irregular deposition of lignin, it appears that the control mechanism ensuring an orderly deposition of monolignols failed to function properly. The highly porous texture of some secondary walls indicated that cellulosic and hemicellulosic framework was affected, which would explain irregular lignification of cell walls. Thus the frost ring constitutes a serious defect in the timber, being a zone of weakness along which the wood is likely to split during processing, such as drying." .

The tree density in dbh classes, the mean growth rate of dbh and the variance of dbh growth rate in closed stands and gaps were expressed as functions of dbh. The change in dbh frequency calculated from these functions and the observed tree mortality clarified the fact that the dbh distribution in the closed stands is rather stable but becomes more positively skewed with time. Attention was also paid to the change in stand basal area (BA) in 20m×20m plots. The log-normal distribution expressed the frequency distribution of BA in the forest as a whole. The growth rate of BA in plots without new gap formation was formulated as a function of BA. Gap formation rate observed in 0.8 ha closed stands in recent four years was 1.3% per year. This rate agreed with the result of calculations based on the assumption that the frequency distribution of BA is stationary with time." .

The taxonomic community structures of the ectomycorrhizal assemblages in top soil were influenced by stand density and forest type, by biogeographic environmental factors (soil physical properties, temperature, and precipitation), and by nitrogen forms (amino acids, ammonium, and nitrate). While α-diversity did not differ between forest types, β-diversity increased, leading to higher γ-diversity on the landscape level when both forest types were present. The highest taxonomic diversity of EM was found in forests in cool, moist climate on clay and silty soils and the lowest in the forests in warm, dry climate on sandy soils. In the region with higher taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic clustering was found, but not trait clustering. In the warm region, trait clustering occurred despite neutral phylogenetic effects. These results suggest that different forest types and favorable environmental conditions in forests promote high EM species richness in top soil presumably with both high functional diversity and phylogenetic redundancy, while stressful environmental conditions lead to lower species richness and functional redundancy." .

G. biloba showed conservative water use under drought. AbstractLeaf photosynthesis is highly sensitive to soil water stress via stomatal and/or biochemical responses, which markedly suppress the growth of landscape trees. Effective irrigation management to maintain leaf photosynthesis and information on species-specific photosynthetic responses to soil water stress are essential for the sustainable management of landscape trees in Japan, in which summer drought often occurs. In order to investigate effective irrigation management, we used plants with moderate soil water stress as controls, and examined the effects of daily irrigation and pruning mulch on leaf photosynthesis in container-grown Ginkgo biloba and Prunus yedoensis, which are the first and second main tall roadside trees in Japan. Stomatal conductance was significantly increased by pruning mulch and daily irrigation, with similar increases in leaf photosynthesis being observed in P. yedoensis and G. biloba. In order to obtain information on species-specific photosynthetic responses to soil water stress, we compared the responses of leaf photosynthesis and leaf water status to reductions in soil water content (SWC) between the two species. G. biloba maintained a constant leaf water potential, leaf water content, maximum carboxylation rate, and electron transport rate with reductions in SWC, whereas reductions were observed in P. yedoensis. We concluded that pruning mulch and irrigation effectively offset the negative impact of moderate water stress on leaf photosynthesis in summer in P. yedoensis and G. biloba via stomatal regulation, and also that G. biloba maintained its photosynthetic biochemistry and leaf water status better than P. yedoensis under severe water stress." .

To test this hypotheses and evaluate the impact of pine plantations on hydric resources in Patagonia Argentina, we measured over two seasons (1999–2000 and 2000–2001) and at two densities of ponderosa pine plantations (350 and 500 trees ha−1) the following variables: soil water content, leaf water potential (ψ), individual tree growth, individual sap flow, and response of sap flow density (u) to vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Stand transpiration (T) and whole-plant liquid-phase hydraulic conductance (L) were also estimated. Pre-dawn ψ varied from about –0.5 to –1.0 MPa. No differences were found in midday maximum u (1100–1800 hours) on clear days between the 2 measurement years, throughout each season, or between different densities of plantation. Sapflow density was also not correlated with soil water storage up to 1.4 m soil depth. Sapflow increased until VPD of about 2.3 kPa, and decreased at VPD >4 kPa, describing a hysteresis in the afternoon. Values of L in Patagonian trees were similar to those recalculated from published data for pines of the same height in the USA. Average stand transpiration increased with increased density (2.07 and 3.08 mm day-1 for 350 and 500 pines ha-1, respectively) and size of the trees. We conclude that ponderosa pines in Patagonia Argentina use more water, in a magnitude depending on the density of the trees, than native grasslands. Accordingly, ponderosa pines use deep water to maintain high water potential and transpiration rates even during the dry season." .

Wildfires contain many patches of residual vegetation of various size, shape, and composition; understanding their characteristics provides insights for improved emulation criteria. We studied the occurrence of residual vegetation within eleven boreal wildfire events in a natural setting; fires ignited by lightning, no suppression efforts, and no prior anthropogenic disturbances. Relative importance of the measurable geo-environmental factors and their marginal effects on residual presence are studied using Random Forests. These factors included distance from natural firebreaks (wetland, bedrock and non-vegetated areas, and water), land cover, and topographic variables (elevation, slope, and ruggedness index). We present results at spatial resolutions ranging from four to 64 m while emphasizing four and 32 m since they mimic IKONOS- and Landsat-type images. Natural firebreak features, especially the proximity to wetlands, are among the most important variables that explain the likelihood residual occurrence. The majority of residual vegetation areas are concentrated within 100 m of wetlands. Topographic variables, typically important in rugged terrain, are less important in explaining the presence of residuals within our study fires." .

To overcome constraints to monitoring in urban environments, programs must be personally relevant, socially desirable, scientifically credible, and economically feasible. A three-tiered monitoring approach is presented. Canopy cover analysis documents net gains and losses in regional urban forest cover.

It is generally thought that carbon-limited conifers with low priority stem growth investment will suffer significantly reduced wood formation following defoliation by insects, as long as resource sinks (apical buds and young needles) are unaffected compared to sources (mature needles). We examined the long-term consequences of periodic defoliation by a moth (Bupalus piniaria L.) on the growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), by retrospectively determining annual rates of needle retention using the needle trace method, and comparing these rates with patterns of radial growth obtained by tree-ring analysis. Cumulative moth densities in the current and previous year had the strongest negative influence on subsequent tree growth. Radial and volume increments were reduced substantially (by up to 50%) for 2–3 years after peaks in the moth population. In turn, tree growth was positively correlated with needle retention, with better growth promoting better retention in the following two seasons. This dominant relationship masked the more subtle impact of B. piniaria on needle retention. However, when each needle cohort was examined separately, it was possible to detect the immediate effects of B. piniaria on the loss of the youngest (0 to 1-year-old) needle cohort. Needle budgeting differed for trees in two study compartments, where the rate of tree growth was evidently different. In the compartment where trees grew more slowly they retained a greater number of needle sets over time by shedding fewer of the older needles, but they responded more quickly to the negative effects of the defoliator by losing needles more rapidly in years when the defoliator was abundant." .

After 4 years, basal area of pine trees was 9.2% larger in elevated than in ambient CO2 plots. During the first 3 years the growth rate of pine was stimulated by ~26%. In the fourth year this stimulation declined to 23%. The average net ecosystem production (NEP) in the ambient plots was 428 gC m–2 year–1, indicating that the forest was a net sink for atmospheric CO2. Elevated atmospheric CO2 stimulated NEP by 41%. This increase was primarily an increase in plant biomass increment (57%), and secondarily increased accumulation of carbon in the forest floor (35%) and fine root increment (8%). Net primary production (NPP) was stimulated by 27%, driven primarily by increases in the growth rate of the pines. Total heterotrophic respiration (R h) increased by 165%, but total autotrophic respiration (R a) was unaffected. Gross primary production was increased by 18%. The largest uncertainties in the carbon budget remain in separating belowground heterotrophic (soil microbes) and autotrophic (root) respiration. If applied to temperate forests globally, the increase in NEP that we measured would fix less than 10% of the anthropogenic CO2 projected to be released into the atmosphere in the year 2050. This may represent an upper limit because rising global temperatures, land disturbance, and heterotrophic decomposition of woody tissues will ultimately cause an increased flux of carbon back to the atmosphere." .

In Mediterranean-type ecosystems, salvage logging is considered a measure to reduce future reforestation costs, but this assumption remains largely untested. We made a cost analysis of different management schemes, addressing the immediate post-fire burnt-wood management as well as the costs and success of subsequent reforestation efforts. Two experimental 25-ha plots were established in a burnt pine reforestation of SE Spain, in which three replicates of three post-fire treatments were applied: non-intervention (NI), partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and lopping off the branches from most of the trees, leaving all biomass in situ), and salvage logging (SL). After 4 years, a mechanised reforestation was undertaken, and seedling mortality was monitored for 2 years. The cost of all management operations was recorded in situ, and the cost of re-planting the dead seedlings was estimated according to the expenses of previous reforestation. Initial cost of wood management was greatest in SL and zero in NI. Reforestation cost was highest in NI and lowest in SL, and seedling-mortality rates proved lowest in PCL (43 % vs. 51 % and 52 % in SL and NI, respectively). Considering all the post-fire management operations, salvage logging did not provide particular economic advantages for forest restoration, and had an overall cost of 3,436 ± 340 €/ha. By contrast, NI and PCL reduced total restoration costs by 50 and 35 %, respectively, and PCL indeed promoted restoration success. We suggest that the full cost of management operations needs to be considered when evaluating the economic implications of post-fire salvage logging." .

Uptake of 32P and 86Rb in a root bioassay was used to estimate the demand for P and K by seedlings grown in the different soils. Utilisation of P from apatite was tested in a laboratory system where uptake by the ectomycorrhizal mycelium was separated from uptake by roots. The demand for P and K in the seedlings was similar regardless of the ash treatment. Variation in EM levels, estimated as fungal biomass (ergosterol) in roots, was large in the different soils, but not related to ash addition. Uptake of P from apatite was, on average, 23% of total seedling P and was not related to EM levels. It was concluded that the improved P uptake from apatite by EM fungi found in earlier studies is probably not a general phenomenon among EM fungi. The small effect of ash addition on EM levels and P uptake suggests that addition of granulated wood ash is a forest management treatment that will have only minor influence on ectomycorrhizal symbiosis." .

Pure species stands that were considered the most dense for a given mean tree size were measured to establish the empirical self-thinning relationships. The value of the self-thinning exponent was estimated as –1.42 with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (−1.47, −1.36) for Pinus banksiana, and –1.29 with 95% CI (−1.45, −1.14) for Populus tremuloides. For each species the box dimension of spatial leaf distribution was estimated from unit cylinders described by sequentially lowering in forest canopies, horizontal “flaps” of one of various diameters attached to the top of a height-measuring pole. The box dimension appeared as 1.95 (1.84, 2.06) for Pinus banksiana, and 2.24 (2.05, 2.43) for Populus tremuloides. By assuming that the box dimension is equivalent to the fractal dimension at the inter-population level, the self-thinning exponent was predicted to be –1.53 (−1.62, −1.45) for Pinus banksiana, and –1.33 (−1.45, −1.23) for Populus tremuloides. The empirical exponent was equivalent to that predicted from the box fractal dimension, as judged by the 95% CI of the dimensions. We conclude that spatial patterns of leaf distribution in forest canopies, as being characterized by the box fractal dimension, are closely related to the value of the self-thinning exponent in the dense monocultures of the species we examined." .

There was no relationship (r 2<0.01) between Amax [g leaf]-1 and foliar N [g leaf]-1 for the pooled data set, but there was a significant (P<0.001), but weak (r 2=0.20) positive relationship between Amax [g leaf]-1 and foliar P [g leaf]-1 across all soils. However, within two of the five soils leaf N concentration was a significant (P<0.05) determinant of photosynthetic capacity. Due to differences in soil nutrient availabilities a large range in foliar P:N ratio (0.02–0.15) was observed, and the proportion of leaf P:N appeared to control Amax [g leaf N]-1. Whole plant nitrogen (NUE) and phosphorus (PUE) use efficiencies were well correlated with whole plant P:N ratio. In addition, NUE was well correlated with Amax [g leaf N]-1 and PUE was well correlated with Amax [g leaf P]-1. However, NUE was not well correlated with PUE, and Amax [g leaf N]-1 was not well correlated with Amax [g leaf P]-1. These results indicated that P and/or N limitations were important components of photosynthetic nutrient relations in white pine grown in these five soils and suggest that both P and N and their proportions should be considered in analyses of photosynthesis-nutrient relations." .

The seedlings were subjected to four treatments before planting: non-hardened (NH) E. globulus and E. nitens, cold-hardened (CH) E. nitens, and nutrient-starved (NS) E. nitens. Seedlings were planted alongside established 1-year-old E. nitens saplings. The experimental site was at 350 m above sea level, which is considered marginal for the establishment of E. globulus plantations due to low mean minimum temperatures. Cold and sunny conditions after frost increased photoinhibition in the order: NH E. globulus > NH and CH E. nitens > NS and established E. nitens. As a result there was 20% mortality of NH E. globulus seedlings. NS E. nitens seedlings were severely photoinhibited and had high anthocyanin levels at planting; levels of photoinhibition decreased after planting, anthocyanin levels remained high and there was no mortality. Carotenoid levels were low in E. globulus compared to E. nitens treatments. It was concluded that cold-induced photoinhibition is a factor determining the range of environments where E. globulus can be successfully planted, and not frost tolerance alone. Anthocyanin was synthesised in response to increased photoinhibition. Anthocyanin levels were correlated to the severity of the photoinhibition. Thus, E. nitens seedlings nutrient starved in the nursery are pre-conditioned to photoinhibitory conditions experienced soon after planting. This treatment is a useful risk-management tool where cold-induced photoinhibition is likely to occur during seedling establishment." .

The Solan Forest Division on the whole, has potential to sequester 17 times more carbon over standing carbon of 1.67 Mt, if forest species are extended to their corresponding altitudinal limits in the “land area available for planting” i.e., Uncultrable land area in the forest division however, to have an accurate estimate of the carbon sequestration potential of the area, other attributes that decides the establishment of plantation of different species such as slope, aspect, soil, climate, etc. need to be taken into consideration beside altitude." .

The lines for A. mangium were inferred with this method using data in two areas of unthinned plantations in South Sumatra, Indonesia. Slopes of the lines were deduced as −1.63 and −1.67 within the range of 10–21 cm of quadratic mean dbh. The intensity of self-thinning was examined as a rate of reduction of density in relation to dbh increment. The rates were found to be higher than the slopes in the range close to the maximum line; hence the lines inferred in this study were likely existent. Maximum basal area deduced from the size-density line was 28–30 m2/ha at 12cm of dbh and then it increased up to 34–37 m2/ha at 20 cm of dbh." .

Communities grew from 20 cm to approximately 2 m in height in 6 months. No enhancements in plant biomass accumulation occurred under elevated CO2 either in the whole communities or in growth of individual species. Reductions in leaf area index under elevated CO2 were observed, as were decreases in leaf nitrogen concentrations and increases in the C:N ratio of leaf tissue. Species tended to respond individualistically to elevated CO2, but some generalizations of how successional groupings responded could be made. Early and mid-successional species generally showed greater responses to elevated CO2 than late-successional species, particularly with respect to increases in photosynthetic rates and leaf starch concentrations, and reductions in leaf area ratio. Late-successional species showed greater increases in C:N ratios in response to elevated CO2 than did other species. Our results indicate that there may not be an increase in the growth of regenerating tropical forest under elevated CO2, but that there could be changes in soil nutrient availability because of reductions in leaf tissue quality, particularly in late-successional species." .

To stratify the individuals of a forest stand into elementary subpopulations by using tree height records, a graphical method was empirically proposed employing a derivative of Pearson's type VII distribution as a basis. Arranging all of the individual trees in a stand in the descending order of their height (x), and introducing the rank (N) of any individual in the ordered ranking ofx, finite difference (n) ofN and three values ofx, i.e.,x(N), x(N−n), andx(N+n) labelled byN, N−n, andN+n, respectively, the proposed method used the linear relation betweenx(N) and [x(N−n)+x(N+n)]. On thex(N) vs.[x(N−n)+x(N+n)] diagram, the relation between both the variables could be approximated by a few segmental linear relations and used for stratifying the individuals of a forest stand into subpopulations. The method was applied for analyzing the vertical stratification in forest stands of different forest formations in Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.

The simulation experiment was conducted on a Norway spruce, a mixed and a Douglas-fir stand. We applied a business-as-usual scheme (BAU), further a storm adapted management (SAM) and an early reduction in the tree density (BFB6). Further, we investigated the effects of two different climates, a current and a climate change scenario based on the A1B emissions with a HeadCM3 model chain. Simulations were run by the core functions of a single-tree growth simulator, with an empirical storm risk model, enabling to predict single-tree probabilities of being damaged. Further growing conditions were changed by modelling site index as a function of climate. The simulations were run over a period from 2010 to 2500, and we investigated standing and harvested volume and net present value (NPV). Results show that storm frequency has a major impact on all output variables, followed by treatment. For the Douglas-fir stand, treatment is even more important for mean harvested volume, while it does not play a major role in the mixed stand. Compared with storm frequency and treatment, change in precipitation and temperature is less influential. There is a clear negative climate change effect on harvest levels for the spruce and mixed stand, while Douglas fir shows a distinct positive reaction. BFB6 shows the highest harvested and standing volume for both coniferous stands, but lower NPVs due to cutting of premature timber. BAU displays the best performance for NPV, while SAM yields the worst results for harvested and mean standing timber as well as for NPV. Assumptions and limitations of the study are discussed mainly referring to the long simulation period, and it is concluded that before implementing extreme strategies—like SAM—with effects similar to those of the disturbances, a forward-looking adaptive management should be considered." .

No photoinhibitory stress was observed. AbstractDrought represents an important source of disturbance in Mediterranean ecosystems. For long-term forest management, knowledge of tree responses to climate is essential. To investigate the seasonal functioning of Pinus laricio and its tolerance to summer drought in a Mediterranean climate, we carried out a field study in a natural mountainous pine forest over a 2-year period. For the first time for this species, sap flow, chlorophyll fluorescence, and gas exchange were used as indicators of tree vitality. Mild winter did not alter photosynthetic performance while sap flow declined. In spring, increase of sap flow was observed, revealing the end of tree dormancy and the beginning of the growth season. In response to summer drought, stomatal closure caused a reduction of gas exchange and sap flow. At the same time, pines increased their water use efficiency and reduced the limitation of mesophyll conductance. The reduction in CO2 assimilation was associated with photochemical stability, which might cause an imbalance between light energy input and energy used in photochemistry. The stability of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicated the absence of photoinhibitory stress, probably because of the use of photorespiration. The reduction of sap flow and stomatal conductance during drought confirmed the water-saver status of P. laricio species." .

However, some technical advances need to be made to use SE in clonal forestry with Pinus radiata. For example, the conversion of embryonal mass (EM) into plants is at present a major bottleneck. For this reason, maturation experiments were carried out to determine the effect of the initial amount of EM, activated charcoal (AC) and the best combination of abscisic acid (ABA), sucrose and amino acid concentration in the maturation medium. Germination was evaluated on different media formulations with and without AC. When 100 mg of EM were suspended in liquid medium without AC, cotyledonary somatic embryos were obtained in all the maturation media tested. Maturation medium supplemented with 60 μM ABA, 6% sucrose, and embryo development medium amino acid mixture produced the highest number of cotyledonary somatic embryos, between 10 and 1,550 embryos per gram of EM fresh weight. Approximately half of the tested 25 lines produced more than 600 embryos per gFW. Embryo development was the best when somatic embryos were germinated in half strength modified Quoirin and Lepoivre medium supplemented with 2 g L−1 AC. This protocol simplified and improved SE maturation and germination due to the elimination of subcultures, the large number of somatic embryos obtained from a very low amount of EM, and the elimination of pre-germination treatments, resulting in a significant saving of cost and labor." .

The long-term responses of forests to atmospheric CO2 enrichment have been difficult to determine experimentally given the large scale and complex structure of their canopy. We have developed a CO2 exposure system that uses the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) approach but was designed for tall canopy trees. The system consists of a CO2-release system installed within the crown of adult trees using a 45-m tower crane, a CO2 monitoring system and an automated regulation system. Pure CO2 gas is released from a network of small tubes woven into the forest canopy (web-FACE), and CO2 is emitted from small laser-punched holes. The set point CO2 concentration ([CO2]) of 500 µmol mol–1 is controlled by a pulse-width modulation routine that adjusts the rate of CO2 injection as a function of measured [CO2] in the canopy. CO2 consumption for the enrichment of 14 tall canopy trees was about 2 tons per day over the whole growing season. The seasonal daytime mean CO2 concentration was 520 µmol mol–1. One-minute averages of CO2 measurements conducted at canopy height in the center of the CO2-enriched zone were within ±20% and ±10% of the target concentration for 76% and 47% of the exposure time, respectively. Despite the size of the canopy and the windy site conditions, performance values correspond to about 75% of that reported for conventional forest FACE with the added advantage of a much simpler and less intrusive infrastructure. Stable carbon isotope signals captured by 80 Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) seedlings distributed within the canopy of treated and control tree districts showed a clearly delineated area, with some nearby individuals having been exposed to a gradient of [CO2], which is seen as added value. Time-integrated values of [CO2] derived from the C isotope composition of C. dactylon leaves indicated a mean (±SD) concentration of 513±63 µmol mol–1 in the web-FACE canopy area. In view of the size of the forest and the rough natural canopy, web-FACE is a most promising avenue towards natural forest experiments, which are greatly needed." .

Ring-width samples from 228 trees were collected and PCA used to identify common growth patterns. Chronologies were developed and redundancy analysis and simple correlation coefficients calculated to detect twentieth century temperature, precipitation, and drought fingerprints in the tree-ring data. Summer drought is the dominant driver of forest productivity, but regional and species-specific differences indicate more complex influences upon tree growth. F. sylvatica reveals the highest climate sensitivity, whereas Q. petraea is most drought tolerant. Drier growth conditions in KEL result in climate sensitivity of all species, and Q. petraea shifted from non-significant to significant drought sensitivity during recent decades at EIF. Drought sensitivity dynamics of all species vary over time. An increase of drought sensitivity in tree growth was found in the wetter forest area EIF, whereas a decrease occurred in the middle of the last century for all species in the drier KEL region. Species-specific and regional differences in long-term climate sensitivities, as evidenced by temporal variability in drought sensitivity, are potential indicators for a changing climate that effects Central-West German forest growth, but meanwhile hampers a general assessment of these effects." .

Typically, this has involved the application of allometric equations utilising diameter and height, but for accurate results, these equations are often specific to species, site, and silvicultural treatment. In this study, we assessed the value of incorporating a third piece of information: the height of diameter measurement. We derived a more general volume equation, based on the conical approximation, using a diameter projected to the base of the tree. Common equations were developed which allowed an accurate estimate of stem volume, dry weight and nutrient content across two key plantation grown eucalypt species, Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden and Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.). The conical model was developed with plantation-grown E. grandis trees ranging from 0.28 to 15.85 m in height (1.05 g to 80.3 kg stem wood dry weight), and E. globulus trees ranging from 0.10 to 34.4 m in height (stem wood dry weight from 0.48 g to 652 kg), grown under a range of contrasting cultural treatments, including spacing (E. grandis), site (E. globulus) and fertilization (nitrogen and phosphorus) for both species. With log transformed data the conical function (Vcon) was closely related to stem sectional volume over bark and stem weight (R2 = 0.996 and 0.990, respectively) for both E. grandis and E. globulus, and the same regressions can be applied to both species. Back transformed data compared with the original data yielded modelling efficiencies of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Relationships between Vcon and bark dry weight differed for the two species, reflecting differing bark characteristics. Young trees with juvenile foliage had a different form of relationship to older trees with intermediate or adult foliage, the change of slope corresponding to heights about 1.5 m for E. grandis and age 1 year for E. globulus. The Vcon model proved to be robust, and unlike conventional models, does not need additional parameters for estimating biomass under different cultural treatments. More than 99% of the statistical variance of the logarithm of biomass was accounted for in the model. Vcon captures most of the change in stem taper associated with cultural treatments and some of the change in stem form that occurs after the crown base has lifted appreciably. Fertilization increased N and P concentrations in stem wood and bark, and regressions to estimate N and P contents (the products of biomass and concentration) were dependent on treatment. For instance, there was a large growth response to N fertilization in E. globulus corresponding with a change (P < 0.05) in the intercept of the regression to estimate N content." .

In this study, we combined field data of dispersal behavior of birds and GIS information of patch attributes to estimate how frugivorous birds could affect the effective dispersal pattern of Chinese yew (Taxus chinensis) in a fragmented and disturbed forest. Nine bird species were observed to visit T. chinensis trees, with Urocissa erythrorhyncha, Zoothera dauma and Picus canus being the most common dispersers. After foraging, six disperser species exhibited different perching patterns. Three specialist species, P. canus, Turdus hortulorum, and Z. dauma stayed in the source patch, while three generalist species, U. erythrorhyncha, Hypsipetes mcclellandii, and H. castanonotus, could perch in bamboo patches and varied in movement ability due to body size. As a consequence of perching, dispersers significantly contributed to the seed bank, but indirectly affected seedling recruitment. Moreover, the recruitment of T. chinensis was also affected by patch attributes in a fragmented forest (distances to source patch, patch type, size). Our results highlighted the ability of unique source population regeneration of T. chinensis in a fragmented forest, with high dependence on both frugivorous birds and patch attributes, which should be considered in future planning for forest management and conservation." .

AbstractWildfires are a natural and ubiquitous component of many forests. Fire-induced damages can lead to immediate tree mortality or a prolonged state of decline. However, physiological mechanisms behind the phenomenon are not well understood. We investigated physiological properties of conifers that survived wildfire 2 year post-fire in central Idaho, USA. In 2005, we set up a burned plot at each of three sites, where the independent wildfires damaged dominant conifers in 2003, paired with a comparable adjacent control plot without any fire damage. At each burned plot, we assessed physical damages in the burned conifers. At each plot in a given site, we repeatedly measured physiological characteristics in five trees of a dominant conifer species (Pseudotsuga menziesii or Pinus contorta) to compare burned and control plots across the three sites during the 2005 growing season. Growth of the burned conifers was significantly reduced post-fire. Leaf area of burned conifers was significantly reduced due to scorching, which, in theory, should have led to increased stomatal conductance (g s) and leaf specific conductance (K L). However, we did not find significant differences in K L between burned and control conifers, and g s was sometimes even lower in burned than control conifers. These results indicate the wildfires reduced capacity of hydraulic apparatus in the surviving conifers, partly due to reduced sapwood area associated with the decreased stem growth post-fire. This was supported by our finding that integrated water use efficiency, assessed via δ13C of woody materials and foliage, was not significantly affected by the wildfires." .

Key production issues included: (1) will Eucalyptus nitens Maiden seedlings produced in nurseries on relatively mild sites be susceptible to transplant shock and browsing on cold out-planting sites and can this be managed? And; (2) what specifications should be required of nursery producers for Eucalyptus globulus Labill seedlings for out-planting on mild ex-pasture sites? This review outlines the research conducted in order to address these key questions. Nitrogen deprivation in the nursery induced accumulation of foliar anthocyanin which conferred hardiness to low temperature. Target specifications of 8–10 g/kg foliar nitrogen are recommended. Height of >120 mm, root collar diameter >2.8 mm, seedling container volume of ≥85 cm3, depth of ≥73 mm, density of ≥549 cells/m2 and foliar nitrogen concentration of 15–20 g/kg were found to be key specifications for optimal E. globulus growth following planting onto mild ex-pasture sites. Exponential nutrient loading was a useful technique for attaining target foliar N concentrations. Seedling size was found not to affect growth of E. globulus post-planting on mild ex-pasture sites. However, large seedlings were preferentially browsed on high vertebrate-browse-pressure sites in Tasmania (poisons are banned and shooting is not effective on some sites) that did not affect subsequent growth rate but did increase the incidence of double-leaders. The ‘target seedling concept’ is applicable to eucalypts for Australian planting sites: specifications attained in the nursery should be matched to the factors limiting growth on the planting sites." .

We examined host location by the insect and subsequent host mortality in experimentally stressed trees. A. bilineatus adults were able to rapidly and specifically locate stressed oak trees. Up to 160 beetles per week were captured on sticky band traps on the trunks of stressed trees, while beetles rarely landed on unstressed control trees. This suggests that adult borers have an acute perception of host tree “quality”, and that this perception is from a distance. One mechanism of host location may be detection of volatile compounds produced by stressed trees. The condition of the host tree appears to regulate both beetle attraction and successful colonization. Mortally wounded (xylem-girdled) trees attracted beetles only until the cambium died. Xylem-girdled trees were attacked early in the beetle flight season, but larvae did not survive to emerge as adults from these trees. In contrast, phloemgirdled trees continued to attract beetles throughout the flight period. Phloem-girdled trees which were heavily attacked by A. bilineatus died late in the season in which they were attacked. Lightly attacked trees survived until the following growing season, and were then heavily attacked and killed. In one stand, phloem-girdled trees were not attacked, healed over the girdling wounds and were still alive three years after girdling. These results indicate that oak trees are only attractive to A. bilineatus within a narrow range of physiological conditions following stress but prior to mortality. A. bilineatus appears to be a proximate agent of mortality in stressed oaks in eastern North America." .

This variation depends on altitude and soil nitrogen availability. AbstractTo elucidate the biotic and abiotic factors affecting the variation in fine-root biomass (FRB, <2 mm diameter) of trees growing under nutrient-poor environments in Sabah, North Borneo, we investigated FRB in different forests with varying soil nitrogen (N) availability. We selected two study sites at different altitudes: the Maliau Basin (ca. 1000 m asl) and Nabawan (ca. 500 m asl). Both sites included tropical heath (kerangas) forest, on infertile soils (podzols) with a surface organic horizon overlying a bleached (eluviated) mineral horizon, and taller forests on more fertile non-podzolic soils. FRB was obtained from each plot by soil coring (to a depth of 15 cm). FRB increased with decreasing soil inorganic N content (NH4–N and NO3–N), tree height, and aboveground biomass. Thus, higher proportions of carbon resources were allocated to fine-roots in stands with lower N availability. FRB was significantly greater at the Maliau Basin than at Nabawan, reflecting lower soil N availability at higher altitude. Our results demonstrate high variation in FRB among the heath forests, and suggest that fine-root development is more prominent under a cooler climate where N availability limits tree growth owing to slower decomposition. The variation in N availability under the same climate (i.e., at the same altitude) appears to be related to the extent of soil podzolization." .

Samples disks at breast height were randomly collected from trees in a 10-year-old plantation in Cox’s Bazar Forest Division, Bangladesh. The basic density showed a near-constant value up to 30 mm from the pith and then rapidly increased up to 60 mm from the pith. The fiber length and vessel element length gradually increased from the pith to bark. When radial variation of wood properties was determined according to relative distance from the pith, similar radial patterns were observed among the sample trees, indicating that the wood properties in C. equisetifolia may be related to the growth rate. The compression strength parallel to the grain (CS) increased from the pith to bark. A significant positive correlation was found between the air-dried density and the CS. The results obtained indicated that wood around the pith has a relatively low density, and wood outside the pith area has a relatively high density, suggesting that it could be used as structural lumber." .

This was done by comparing estimates of the Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) as assessed by two different methods. The inventory based carbon budgeting method estimated the average NEE for 1997 – 2001 at 202 g C m−2 yr−1 (a sink) with a confidence interval of 138 – 271 g C m−2 yr−1. The estimate obtained by the eddy covariance method was 295 g C m−2 yr−1 on average for the same period, with a confidence interval of 224 – 366 g C m−2 yr−1. Uncertainties in the eddy covariance method were mostly related to gap filling of the data. Main uncertainties in the inventory-based method are related to the soil and the root compartment. The difference in NEE as obtained by two independent methods indicates that it is not straightforward to design a sound National System for monitoring and reporting of the total land area and for accounting of changes in forest area under the Kyoto Protocol, and that more effort is required in this field." .

Respiration of roots and mycorrhiza is another major source of carbon dioxide in soil CO2 efflux. The partitioning of these two fluxes is essential for understanding the carbon balance of forest ecosystems and for modelling the carbon cycle within these ecosystems. In this study, we determined the carbon balance of three common tree species in boreal forest zone, Scots pine, Norway spruce, and Silver birch with gas exchange measurements conducted in laboratory in controlled temperature and light conditions. We also studied the allocation pattern of assimilated carbon with 14C pulse labelling experiment. The photosynthetic light responses of the tree species were substantially different. The maximum photosynthetic capacity (P max) was 2.21 μg CO2 s−1 g−1 in Scots pine, 1.22 μg CO2 s−1 g−1 in Norway spruce and 3.01 μg CO2 s−1 g−1 in Silver birch seedlings. According to the pulse labelling experiments, 43–75% of the assimilated carbon remained in the aboveground parts of the seedlings. The amount of carbon allocated to root and rhizosphere respiration was about 9–26%, and the amount of carbon allocated to root and ectomycorrhizal biomass about 13–21% of the total assimilated CO2. The 14CO2 pulse reached the root system within few hours after the labelling and most of the pulse had passed the root system after 48 h. The transport rate of carbon from shoot to roots was fastest in Silver birch seedlings." .

However, we spanned the entire array of estimates of frass fall available from eucalypt communities, and we demonstrated allelopathic effects at even the lowest levels suggested by Ohmart. We suggest that average values of frass fall per hectare are irrelevant because they ignore both large scale variation among sites in time and space, and small scale variation in patchiness of frass accumulation. At the ecological scales relevant to germinating seeds, frass concentrations in local pockets may be considerably higher than the averages calculated for the entire ground surface." .

A random sampling design was performed by stand age class according to the forest management plan: 0–15, 16–30, 31–50, 51–70 and over 71-years-old. Eighteen 150 m plots were established and sampled weekly every year from September to December. One hundred and nineteen taxa belonging to 51 genera were collected, 40 of which were edible and represented 74% of the total biomass. Boletus edulis, Lactarius deliciosus, Cantharellus cibarius and Tricholoma portentosum sporocarps, which are considered to be of high commercial value, represented 34% of the total production. B. edulis and L. deliciosus were the most remarkable and abundant species, and both were collected in more than 60% of the samplings. B. edulis fructified every year of the experiment; its mean production was 40 kg/ha and year and its maximum productivity was more than 94 kg/ha in 1998. The age class with the largest production of this taxa was the fourth (51–70 years), with 70 kg/ha. L. deliciosus only failed to fructify one autumn (2000); its mean production was almost 10 kg/ha and its maximum productivity close to 30 kg/ha in 1997. The maximum productivity of this species was found in the second (16–30 years) and fifth (71–90 years) stand age classes, with 18 and 16 kg/ha, respectively. Advances in this field can certainly offer new insights into factors affecting sporocarp production." .

Different degrees of defoliation were attained experimentally by a controlled release of the oligophagous beetle Agelastica alni on arbitrarily selected trees from a homogenous population of young alders. The reduction in leaf area per tree significantly influenced the density of leaf trichomes, assessed 10–30 days later, on newly sprouting leaves only. Cross-correlations between leaf area reduction and trichome density were strongest for leaves which completed unfolding 14–21 days after damage. Dualchoice assays suggested a negative influence of trichomes on oviposition rate of A. alni. Removal of trichomes by shaving demonstrated the highly significant effect of trichomes on feeding behavior of adults and larvae in dual-choice assays. The role of the induced increase in trichome density as a possible short-term defense reaction against herbivorous insects is discussed." .

Karst.) and ten European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) thinning experiments in Germany, for which both residual and removed stock had been registered first during 1870, I scrutinize how moderate and heavy thinning from below (B-, C-grade) affects the production of merchantable volume compared with light thinning (A-grade). In relation to A-grade, cumulative merchantable volume (CV) of B- and C-grade amounts in average to 103–107% in juvenile and to 97–102% in mature Norway spruce stands. The corresponding findings for European beech are 101–106% and 94–102%. CV of individual stands varies between 89% and 130% for Norway spruce and 73% and 155% for European beech (CV of A-grade = 100%). These findings are substantiated by the relation between stand density (SDI) and periodic annual increment (PAI). On the B- and C-grade plots of spruce and beech, respectively, SDI was reduced down to 41–91% and 31–83% of the A-grade. When SDI is reduced in young stands, PAI follows a unimodal curve. Norway spruce’s PAI culminates in 109% if SDI is reduced to 59%; European beech’s PAI culminates in 123% when density is reduced to 50%. Whereas Norway spruce’s growth reacts most positively on thinning under poor site conditions and with increment reduction on favourable sites, European beech behaves oppositely. With stand development the culmination point of the unimodal relation moves towards maximum density, so that in older stands PAI follows the increasing pattern, which is the left portion of a unimodal curve. A model is presented which apparently unifies contradictory patterns of stand density–growth reactions by integrating relative stand density, average tree size and site fertility effects, and makes the findings operable for forest management." .

Patterns of climatic changes between neighbouring phytoclimatic classes are described. Two indexes of the influence of climate on vegetation are proposed based on discriminant analysis." .

Leaf N, P, and Ca concentrations as well the leaf N isotope ratios (δ15N) from a large set of legume and non-legume tree species were measured. Legumes had higher foliar N/Ca ratios than non-legumes, consistent with the high energetic costs in plant growth associated with higher foliar P/Ca ratios found in legumes than in non-legumes. At the regional level, foliar δ15N decreased with increasing rainfall. At the landscape level, N availability was higher in the forests on clayey soils on the plateau than in forests on sandier soils. The isotope as well as the non-isotope data relationships here documented, explain to a large extent the variation in δ15N signatures across gradients of rainfall and soil. Although at the regional level, the precipitation regime is a major determinant of differences in N availability, at the landscape level, under the same precipitation regime, soil type seems to be a major factor influencing the availability of N in the Brazilian Amazon forest." .

Endl.] plantation were felled and subjected to the stratified clip technique. Crown profile of foliage area fitted well with the Weibull distribution. The crown profile tended to be more skewed toward the top of crowns in smaller trees than in larger trees. This tendency was reflected in the value of the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution. The shape parameter ranged from 1.73 to 3.23 and gradually increased up to an asymptotic value with an increase of stem diameter at breast height. The scale parameter of the distribution ranged from 1.0 to 4.2 and tended to increase in proportion to stem diameter at breast height. Foliage area of a tree correlated well with stem diameter at breast height through an ordinary allometric equation. Tree height could be approximated fairly well by a generalized allometric equation as a function of stem diameter at breast height. On the basis of the census of stem diameter at breast height, canopy profile could be constructed synthesizing crown profiles of foliage area for individual trees in the stand. Leaf area index was estimated to be 6.6 ha ha−1." .

The comparison is focused on the normal range of nutrition of major elements. We could show that the new critical foliar nutrient concentrations and ratios do not have the imponderabilities of the established reference systems, like restricted calibration range or data gaps for species in general or some major nutrients in particular. Ranges from the new critical foliar nutrient concentrations are generally smaller, except for broadleaves foliar Ca and Mg values, where another reference provides the narrowest ranges. The practicability of the different systems has been exemplary tested on a foliage data set of Norway spruce from the Bavarian soil survey. This application illustrates that an evaluation based on the new nutrient thresholds is in the majority of cases more cautious than the other reference systems. Moreover, evaluations based on the new concentrations and ratios are quite consistent. Comparisons with nutrient ratios related to the susceptibility to parasite attacks show that the thresholds are close to a general optimum range, indicating health and intact resistance mechanisms of these tree species. Uncertainties of the new threshold values as well as the need to further evaluate and develop reference systems for nutrient status of forest trees are discussed." .

There had been fewer studies in subtropical regions than in other climate zones. Prior research showed that the canopy epiphyte could fix nitrogen combined with microorganism in tropical forest. The epiphytic plants enwrapping trees in canopy layer are very abundant in the subtropical mountainous cloud forest of Ailao Mountain (central and southern Yunnan Province, SW China). This forest lacks widespread nitrogen-fixing plants, and the nitrogen origin is elusive. Maybe there also exist such nitrogen-fixing systems in epiphyte community. Nitrogen-fixing potentials of canopy epiphytes increased greatly from dry season to wet season. There occurred an obvious difference on the epiphytic nitrogen fixation abilities between upper canopy layer and sub-canopy layer in alternant period between wet season and dry season. Epiphytic nitrogen-fixing potentials for the subtropical moist forest in Ailao Mountains ranged between 0.027 and 2.24 kg ha−1 year−1. Our results indicate that the canopy epiphytes in the subtropical moist forest of Ailao Mountains can fix a significant amount of atmospheric nitrogen. This finding suggests a new nitrogen source for the subtropical forest ecosystem, thus can have profound impact on the studies of nitrogen cycling." .

Biomass collapse and its associated microclimatic stresses within recently isolated rain forest fragments may negatively affect species diversity of most resident taxa. However, for some decomposer organisms, increased resource availability via accompanying tree die-off may effect positive responses, at least for a time, with implications for rates of nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas release. This study investigates the early effects of forest fragmentation on a Neotropical termite assemblage. Numbers of encounters (surrogate for relative abundance) and species richness of wood and leaf-litter feeders, soil feeders, and the whole assemblage, were studied across true forest islands and mainland sites at a hydroelectric reservoir in French Guiana. Results showed no overall effect of fragmentation on either total termite encounters or species richness. However, numbers of encounters and species richness of wood and leaf-litter feeders showed positive responses to forest fragmentation. By contrast, soil feeders showed a negative response for numbers of encounters and no significant effect for species richness. Environmental data suggest that increased tree die-off, and other edge effects associated with biomass collapse, were underway at the time of sampling. Resulting increase in resource availability may therefore explain the positive influence on wood and leaf-litter feeders. A possible decrease in predation pressure from ants with decrease in island size was not tested for, but was a likely effect of the flooded matrix habitat. Fragmentation effects on soil feeder encounters may be due to the energetic and microclimatic constraints of feeding lower down the humification gradient of termite food substrates, but were not sufficient to affect species richness. The patterns revealed suggest that rates of wood decomposition following tree die-off, and of soil nutrient cycling, under different rain forest fragmentation scenarios, merit further study." .

Against this prospect, it is important not only to protect, but also to restore forest ecosystems. The paper analyzes the current and future role of the restoration of forests and degraded lands starting with the definition of various techniques, scales and objectives of forest restoration. Three key motivations for and targets of forest restoration are then discussed: forest biodiversity protection, biomass production, climate change mitigation and adaptation. The paper also briefly discusses three tools of increasing relevance for supporting forest restoration policies: the development of forest nursery techniques and the improvement of quality of forest reproductive material, the use of standard and certification tools, and financing of restoration investments, including projects aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. We conclude by making some final remarks on the future challenges of forest restoration policies." .

Epidemiological and genetic evidence supports the hypothesis that introduction was the result of long-distance dispersal (LDD) by atmospheric transport from California. This study applies a method to identify the atmospheric conditions favorable for rust transport and infection. An upper level synoptic classification (ULSC) identifies patterns of upper-level flow favorable for the transport of rust spores from a source to a target. Transport data are coupled with data for surface conditions favorable for infection at a designated target. A resulting calendar lists likelihood classes for establishment by four-times-daily observations during a dispersal season from April through July in the years 1965 to 1974. The single most-favorable period for transport and infection at the New Mexico site was identified as 1–15 June 1969. Five additional sites in the western United States with susceptible white pine populations and known infestation status were then evaluated to verify the model. Only the infested sites exhibit an establishment likelihood of “high” or “very high.” This suggests that the methodology correctly identifies locations with elevated establishment likelihood. Finally, likelihoods at nine additional points in the southwestern United States are determined and used to map regional patterns of transport, infection and establishment. The ULSC combined with appropriate surface meteorological data could be used to further investigate transport and infection, identify other areas at risk, assess the potential for gene flow of WPBR and evaluate long-distance dispersal of other pathogens." .

The burned pine plantation had the highest estimated termite density, 13×106·ha-1 unburned pine plantation and lowland hardwood had estimated densities of 2.6×106·ha-1 and 2.2×106·ha-1, respectively, and the turkey oak woodland had an estimated densities of 61.9×103·ha-1. There were varying percentages of Reticulitermes flavipes and R. virginicus in the various habitats. There was nearly linear increase in percentage of pine blocks attacked by termites in the pine and hardwood forests and by the end of the growing season, nearly all had been channelized by termites. In the turkey oak habitat 70% of the pine blocks were channelized. Termites removed between 3% and 12% of the original mass of over one-fourth of the pine blocks during the growing season. Wood litter in fall was highest in the lowland hardwood forest: 2869 kg·ha-1·yr-1.

Wood cores were taken from dominant beech trees in three stands in Germany and Italy. We used densitometry to obtain density profiles of tree rings and laser-ablation-combustion-GC-IRMS to estimate carbon isotope composition (δ 13C) of wood. The sensitivity of ring width, wood density and δ 13C to climatic variables differed; with tree-ring width responding to environmental conditions (temperature or precipitation) during the first half of a growing season and maximum density correlated with temperatures in the second part of a growing season (July–September). δ 13C variations indicate re-allocation and storage processes and effects of drought during the main growing season. About 20% of inter-annual variation of tree-ring width was explained by the tree-ring width of the previous year. This was confirmed by δ 13C of wood which showed a contribution of stored carbohydrates to growth in spring and a storage effect that competes with growth in autumn. Only mid-season δ 13C of wood was related to concurrent assimilation and climate. The comparison of seasonal changes in tree-ring maximum wood density and isotope composition revealed that an increasing seasonal water deficit changes the relationship between density and 13C composition from a negative relation in years with optimal moisture to a positive relationship in years with strong water deficit. The climate signal, however, is over-ridden by effects of stand density and crown structure (e.g., by forest management). There was an unexpected high variability in mid season δ 13C values of wood between individual trees (−31 to −24‰) which was attributed to competition between dominant trees as indicated by crown area, and microclimatological variations within the canopy. Maximum wood density showed less variation (930–990 g cm−3). The relationship between seasonal changes in tree-ring structure and 13C composition can be used to study carbon storage and re-allocation, which is important for improving models of tree-ring growth and carbon isotope fractionation. About 20–30% of the tree-ring is affected by storage processes. The effects of storage on tree-ring width and the effects of forest structure put an additional uncertainty on using tree rings of broad leaved trees for climate reconstruction." .

We used two approaches that provide different information about drought response: the ratio of standardized radial growth in wet years to dry years (W:D) for the period between years 1950 and 2000 as a measure of growth response to drought, and δ13C in leaves formed in non-drought (2001) and drought (2002) years as a measure of change in water use efficiency (WUE) in response to drought. W:D and leaf δ13C response to drought for Pinus edulis and P. ponderosa did not differ for trees growing on coarse-texture soils derived from cinders compared with finer textured soils derived from flow basalts or sedimentary rocks. P. ponderosa growing near its low elevation range limit at the pinyon-juniper woodland/ponderosa pine ecotone had a greater growth response to drought (higher W:D) and a larger increase in WUE in response to drought than co-occurring P. edulis growing near its high elevation range limit. P. flexilis and Pseudotsuga menziesii growing near their low elevation range limit at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone had a larger growth response to drought than co-occurring P. ponderosa growing near its high elevation range limit. Increases in WUE in response to drought were similar for all species at the ponderosa pine/mixed conifer ecotone. Low elevation populations of P. ponderosa had greater growth response to drought than high-elevation populations, whereas populations had a similar increase in WUE in response to drought. Our findings of different responses to drought among co-occurring tree species and between low- and high-elevation populations are interpreted in the context of drought impacts on montane coniferous forests of the southwestern USA." .

In one site, sapwood seemed to be more resistant to wood decay after forest fertilization whereas the susceptibility of heartwood increased. Significant changes in the sapwood chemistry were found between treatment and sites, however, no relationship between wood chemistry and wood decay was observed in the factor analysis.

To evaluate the effects on canopy structure we measured specific leaf weight (mg/cm2), average leaf weight (mg), average twig height and average twig length. These variables were selected as they are the most likely to manifest changes over short time periods following changes in environmental conditions. The values of these parameters before initial treatments (autumn 1988) and after treatments (summer 1990) were analyzed. The results obtained show that water and nitrogen have a greater effect than phosphorus on tree canopy structure, at least during initial development." .

Fiber length did not differ between clones or between sites. The microfibril angle of the S2 layer did not significantly differ between clones but significantly differed between sites. Clone and site significantly affected specific gravity. The significant effects of genetic × environmental interactions on wood properties indicated the difference in the response of clones to different growing conditions. The trends of changes in fiber length, microfibril angle, and specific gravity from the vicinity of the pith to near the bark were similar for all clones at each site; however, variations in fiber length, microfibril angle, and specific gravity were more visible in northern Vietnam than in southern Vietnam, with a significant effect of genetic factors. This difference may be attributable to winter, which is experienced in northern Vietnam but not in southern Vietnam. For clone selection for plantation in the northern region, combining growth rate with wood properties was recommended. On the other hand, for plantation in the southern region, clone selection depends mainly on the growth rate, taking into consideration the specific gravity." .

The arboreal ant fauna was investigated in Budongo Forest, a seasonal rain forest in Uganda, using the insecticidal fogging technique. Ants were collected from 61 trees, between 7 and 33 m in height, belonging to four tree species. Trees were growing in adjacent plots of forests characterized by different use and structure: an old primary forest, a primary swamp forest along a small river, and a secondary forest where selective logging was carried out for 30 years. A total number of 37,065 ants, belonging to 161 species in 30 genera were collected. Considering the high number of species found only once, the completeness of the canopy ant fauna was relatively high and of relatively similar magnitude as samples from the Neotropics or the Oriental region. Up to 37 ant species on a single tree, with an average of 18.2 species per tree, were found. Forty-four ant species (28.1%) were found only once, less than ten individuals were found for each of 88 species (54.7%), but 64.0% of all individuals belonged to one of five species. Considering the high numerical dominance of a few ant species like a Pheidole sp., Tetramorium aculeatum (Mayr) and a Crematogaster sp., there is some evidence for an ant mosaic in the lower canopy of the Budongo Forest. Individual numbers of ants were strongly correlated with nests in the fogged tree, though the ants were not homogeneously distributed in the tree crowns. Diversity measures that strongly depend on individual numbers such as the Morisita-Horn index or rarefaction methods were calculated, but results were not concordant with those of incidence-based estimates such as jack-knife calculations. Differences in ant species richness and faunal composition between tree species were low, but more significant between forest types. The ant fauna in the secondary forest was less diverse with 12.6% fewer species compared to the primary forest sites. The average number of ant species per tree was significantly lower in the secondary forest (<20% of the species; F=8.03, df=59, P<0.01) than in the undisturbed forest types. Cataulacus, Leptothorax, Tetraponera, and Polyrhachis, which are typical canopy-dwelling ant genera, had a significantly higher diversity and frequency in the two primary forest types (F=4.17, df=53, P<0.05). Secondary forest trees are often younger, lacking dead branches and epiphytes which are important requisites for ant colonization on trees." .

Hypotheses in the recent literature variously predict that drought will have a stronger, weaker or equal impact on seedling relative growth rate (RGR) in deep shade relative to that in moderate shade. Experimental irradiance levels were selected in the typical range for temperate deciduous forest seedlings in either understorey or clearings: 3–4% daylight (low red: far-red shade), 3–4% daylight (neutral shade), and 30–40% daylight (neutral shade). Watering was 'frequent' (every 3–4 days) or 'infrequent' (five times during the 8-week experiment), producing soil matric potentials as low as –0.03 MPa, and –2 MPa. To prevent the interaction of irradiance and watering treatments, each seedling was grown in a 'shade tower' that was surrounded by an uncovered sward of grass (Festuca rubra), which depleted pot water at the same rate regardless of the species of seedling, or its irradiance treatment. Shading affected all species: seedlings in 3.5% daylight grew at 56–73% of their dry-mass RGR in 35% daylight. Low red: far-red shade reduced the RGR of Hedera to 68% of its value in neutral shade. Infrequent watering significantly reduced the RGR of only V. lantana and V. opulus, by approximately the same proportion across irradiance treatments. Infrequent watering did not significantly alter any species' biomass allocation across irradiance treatments. Such orthogonal impacts of deep shade and drought on seedling growth and biomass allocation indicate a large potential for niche differentiation at combinations of irradiance and water supply for species of forest seedlings, and suggest a multiplicative-effects approach for modelling seedling performance in microsites with different combinations of irradiance and water supply." .

In four provinces in south China, 155 plantations were sampled for sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and mycorrhizas over 2 years. This study revealed a low above-ground diversity of ECM fungi consisting of 15 taxa fruiting beneath Eucalyptus plantations. The most common ECM genera were Scleroderma and Pisolithus, but they were infrequent. A total of 21 AM fungi, mostly Glomus species, were recognized from spores collected from eucalypt plantations. Four Glomus species were frequently present in soils, but spore density and relative abundance of AM fungi were generally low. Eucalypt roots from all plantation sites were poorly colonized by either ECM fungi or AM fungi. A bioassay with E. urophylla as a bait host, using soils collected from 11 eucalypt plantations, confirmed low levels of inoculum of both ECM and AM fungi in field soil. This is the first integrated study on the mycorrhizal status of eucalypt plantations in China. Findings from this research can be used to encourage adoption of mycorrhizal technology by eucalypt nurseries in the region. The potential of using spores of compatible ECM fungi or collections for forest nurseries is discussed." .

Seedling growth dynamics of Quercus macrocarpa Michx. and Quercus muhlenbergii Engelm. were compared over a 3-month period under optimal growth conditions. These two species are the dominant trees at the western limit of the eastern deciduous forest, and are typically confined to gallery forests along stream beds in tallgrass prairie. Since tallgrass prairie is characterized by a highly variable climate and is prone to periodic drought, we hypothesized that these oaks would have rapid root growth and produce deep taproots as seedlings, enabling them to avoid drought stress and persist in this region. These traits may also facilitate forest expansion into the more xeric tallgrass prairie if fires are suppressed. Taproots of Q. macrocarpa and Q. muhlenbergii grew to approximately 140 cm and 100 cm in length, respectively, after 104 days. In both species, 65% or more of seedling biomass was allocated below ground, and root/total biomass was significantly greater in Q. muhlenbergii at 0–20 and 21–40 days after germination. The seedling taproot elongation rates reported here are much greater than rates reported in other eastern deciduous forest trees. Long-term precipitation data and soil moisture patterns from tallgrass prairie, when combined with rapid taproot elongation rates, suggest that soil moisture may not limit oak establishment or growth in tallgrass prairie in most years, although water uptake by roots was not measured in this study. Other factors, such as fire, herbivory, and seed predation and dispersal may be equally important in constraining the distribution of these species to gallery forests." .

This paper presents an approach for delineating individual trees and estimating tree heights using LiDAR in coniferous (Pinus koraiensis, Larix leptolepis) and deciduous (Quercus spp.) forests in South Korea. To detect tree tops, the extended maxima transformation of morphological image-analysis methods was applied to the digital canopy model (DCM). In order to monitor spurious local maxima in the DCM, which cause false tree tops, different h values in the extended maxima transformation were explored. For delineation of individual trees, watershed segmentation was applied to the distance-transformed image from the detected tree tops. The tree heights were extracted using the maximum value within the segmented crown boundary. Thereafter, individual tree data estimated by LiDAR were compared to the field measurement data under five categories (correct delineation, satisfied delineation, merged tree, split tree, and not found). In our study, P. koraiensis, L. leptolepis, and Quercus spp. had the best detection accuracies of 68.1% at h = 0.18, 86.7% at h = 0.12, and 67.4% at h = 0.02, respectively. The coefficients of determination for tree height estimation were 0.77, 0.80, and 0.74 for P. koraiensis, L. leptolepis, and Quercus spp., respectively." .

Two significant allometric patterns were detected: a negative correlation between the height at the onset of branching and the slope of the species-specific Cr (crown width)-D (stem diameter) allometric relationship for juveniles (D<10 cm), and a negative correlation between H max (observed maximum height) and the Cr-D slope. The slope of the Cr-D allometric relationship of branched trees was significantly steeper than that of monoaxial (unbranched) trees in most species. These results suggest that the branching growth habit is better adapted than the monoaxial growth habit to crown expansion, and that the morphology of short species is better adapted to crown expansion than that of tall species. We did not detected significant correlations between the height at the onset of branching and the slope of the H (height)-D allometric relationship for juvenile trees, and between H max and the H-D slope. In addition, the monoaxial and branched juvenile of most species did not differ significantly in the allometric slopes of the H-D relationship. Therefore, the study does not support the hypotheses that a monoaxial growth habit favors rapid height growth and that tall species have allometries better adapted to height growth." .

A better understanding of variations in the dynamics and structure of tropical forests is necessary for predicting the potential for these ecosystems to lose or store carbon, and for understanding how they recover from disturbance. Amazonian tropical forests occur over a vast area that encompasses differences in topography, climate, and geologic substrate. We observed large differences in forest structure, biomass, and tree growth rates in permanent plots situated in the eastern (near Santarém, Pará), central (near Manaus, Amazonas) and southwestern (near Rio Branco, Acre) Amazon, which differed in dry season length, as well as other factors. Forests at the two sites experiencing longer dry seasons, near Rio Branco and Santarém, had lower stem frequencies (460 and 466 ha−1 respectively), less biodiversity (Shannon–Wiener diversity index), and smaller aboveground C stocks (140.6 and 122.1 Mg C ha−1) than the Manaus site (626 trees ha−1, 180.1 Mg C ha−1), which had less seasonal variation in rainfall. The forests experiencing longer dry seasons also stored a greater proportion of the total biomass in trees with >50 cm diameter (41–45 vs 30% in Manaus). Rates of annual addition of C to living trees calculated from monthly dendrometer band measurements were 1.9 (Manaus), 2.8 (Santarém), and 2.6 (Rio Branco) Mg C ha−1 year−1. At all sites, trees in the 10–30 cm diameter class accounted for the highest proportion of annual growth (38, 55 and 56% in Manaus, Rio Branco and Santarém, respectively). Growth showed marked seasonality, with largest stem diameter increment in the wet season and smallest in the dry season, though this may be confounded by seasonal variation in wood water content. Year-to-year variations in C allocated to stem growth ranged from nearly zero in Rio Branco, to 0.8 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in Manaus (40% of annual mean) and 0.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1 (33% of annual mean) in Santarém, though this variability showed no significant relation with precipitation among years. Initial estimates of the C balance of live wood including recruitment and mortality as well as growth suggests that live wood biomass is at near steady-state in Manaus, but accumulating at about 1.5 Mg C ha−1 at the other two sites. The causes of C imbalance in living wood pools in Santarém and Rio Branco sites are unknown, but may be related to previous disturbance at these sites. Based on size distribution and growth rate differences in the three sites, we predict that trees in the Manaus forest have greater mean age (~240 years) than those of the other two forests (~140 years)." .

A 10-year study of the deciduous trees Cochlospermum vitifolium (Willd.) Spreng. (Cochlospermaceae) and Cnidoscolus spinosus Lundell (Euphorbiaceae) in southwestern México showed radial growth to be highly correlated (both r>0.85) only with precipitation during an interval of <2 months in the mid-wet season. Growth was not affected by total annual precipitation or by an early starting or late ending of the wet season, or by heavy rainfall in the dry season. Annual mean girth increments ranged from 0.03 to 3.31 cm and −0.1 to 2.01 cm, respectively. The best model for growth (r 2>0.85) was a linear combination of mid-summer precipitation (positive coefficient) and total precipitation over the previous 2 years (negative coefficient). Comparison with other species showed heterogeneous responses of wood production to climate variation, and suggests that the range of functional types of dry forest trees is still unknown." .

The ECHAM5/CCLM models had been used to produce a reference climate and a climate change scenario for the A1B emission scenario. Using the FinnFor model we estimated the effect of the climate change scenario on the site index for three common commercial tree species for the period 2001–2100. The adjusted site index was applied in projections of the forest using the Forest Time Machine model. The WINDA-GALES model was used to calculate the probability of wind damage in simulated future states of the forest. Effects of increasing forest owner motivation to take measures to adapt to climate change were simulated by comparing the effects of introducing adaptive measures in years 2001 and 2051, respectively. These adaptive measures had been identified in consultation with stakeholders. In the simulations, adaptive regimes resulted in generally increased yield, increased hunting potential and a higher number of forest management operations to be carried out, although other aspects of recreation services were reduced. The net return remained unaffected by most of the adaptive forest management regimes. The simulations were made without accounting for effects of predicted wind damage on the states of the forest. Forest owners perceiving increased risk of wind damage but also risk to their life-style would have to balance adaptive measures between these risks. We conclude that adapting forest management to reduce the risk of wind damage may impact on life-style services. Hence, this may affect the process of adaptation to an increasing risk of wind damage in southern Sweden." .

To identify factors affecting the ripening homogeneity, structural, biochemical and molecular parameters were investigated. Fruits were sampled from trees trained with three different systems, spindle, V-shaped and bi-axis, and were further grouped on the basis of canopy position (top or bottom) and branch type (short-old-spurs, 3-year-old or older branches, 2-year-old branches and twigs). This study confirmed that the position in the canopy plays a crucial role in fruit ripening in V-shaped and bi-axis training systems. Fruit on the spindle training system was unaffected by the position of the canopy, albeit showing a large variability within the fruit of each part of the canopy. Such variability is much lower in the bi-axis and V-shaped systems. The spindle training system had no similarity in homogeneity indices between the molecular and physiological measurements. Partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) showed differences in training system, branch type and canopy position separated by the different physiological and molecular parameters. Short-old-spurs and twigs had the highest homogeneity and least variability in all training systems and branch types. In addition, partial least square path modelling (PLS-PM) was able to identify a high correlation between physiological measurements and ripening compared to that of molecular data." .

This proposition has been used to develop allometric relationships relating diameter at breast height or height of individual trees growing in even-aged monoculture to their above-ground fresh biomass. These models have practical application as estimators of tree diameters or heights from tree biomass as extensions of mechanistically based models of forest tree growth which predict tree biomasses. The present work applied these models to Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell, E. delegatensis R. Baker, E. nitens (Deane: Maiden) Maiden and E. grandis Hill ex Maiden trees, growing in plantation or regrowth stands, aged between 1.5 and 20 years, at eight geographically diverse sites extending from temperate to sub-tropical regions of Australia. While the models held for the various species at the various sites, their parameter values differed significantly between sites and/or species. This suggested there may be some inadequacy in the models. However, the differences were small and it was found reasonable to fit single models across all species and sites for practical use in estimating diameter or height. The errors about predicted values of height and diameter from these models were quantified. The models were also found to estimate diameter or height with little loss of precision when dry biomass was used in place of fresh biomass." .

Under conditions of N limitation in Sweden, there was an increase in δ15N of soil total N of up to 9% from the uppermost horizon of the organic mor layer down to the upper 0–5 cm of the mineral soil. The δ15N of roots was only slightly lower than that of soil total N in the upper organic horizon, but further down roots were up to 5% depleted under such conditions. In experimentally N-enriched forest in Sweden, i.e. in plots which have received an average of c. 100 kg N ha−1 year−1 for 20 years and which retain less than 50% of this added N in the stand and the soil down to 20 cm depth, and in some forests in central Europe, the increase in δ15N with depth in soil total N was smaller. An increase in δ15N of the surface soil was even observed on experimentally N-enriched plots, although other data suggest that the N fertilizer added was depleted in15N. In such cases roots could be enriched in15N relative to soil total N, suggesting that labelling of the surface soil is via the pathway: — available pools of N-plant N-litter N. Under N-limiting conditions roots of different species sampled from the same soil horizon showed similar δ15N. By contrast, in experimentally N-enriched forest δ15N of roots increased in the sequence: ericaceous dwarf shrubs<Scots pine<grass, suggesting increasing use of inorganic N along the sequence. Complementary studies at the major transect sites had shown that 90–99% of fine tree roots had ectomycorrhizas (ECMs). ECMs were 2% more enriched than corresponding non-mycorrhizal fine roots. Fungal sheaths stripped off ECMs were 2.4–6.4 enriched relative to the remaining root core. It is suggested that a flux of N through ECMs to aboveground parts in N-limited forests would leave 15N enriched compounds in fungal material, which could contribute to explain the observed δ15N profiles if fungal material is enriched, because it is a precursor of stable organic matter and recalcitrant N. This could act in addition to the previous explanation of the isotopically lighter soil surface in forests: plant uptake of 15N-depleted N and its redeposition onto the soil surface by litter-fall." .

An estimated 64 t ha–1 of leaf, bark and branch material less than 3 cm in diameter was deposited on the forest floor during harvesting. Leaves contributed about one-third of the residue dry weight but accounted for almost three-quarters of residue-N stores (299 of 428 kg N ha–1) and 36% to 52% of P, K, Ca, and Mg stores. Stores of nutrients in slash were significant in comparison to amounts in surface soil (0–20 cm). Residue-N amounted to 11% of total surface soil N and cations stored in residues were equivalent to 23–114% of surface soil exchangeable cations. Decomposition of the leaf fraction of slash was rapid with more than 90% of dry weight released during the 105-week study. Bark and branch fractions of diameters 0.5, 1 and 2 cm lost 39%, 37%, 32% and 29% of dry weight, respectively, during the same period. Single and double exponential decay models fitted to the data indicated half lives ranging from 20 weeks for leaves and from 3 to 4 years for bark and the branch fractions. During decomposition, K was leached rapidly from all residue fractions, Mg and P were released at similar rates to dry weight, and Ca and N were released more slowly than dry weight. In the 105-week study period, 250 kg ha–1 of N, 20 kg ha–1 of P, 213 kg ha–1 of Ca, 298 kg ha–1 of K, and 63 kg ha–1 of Mg were returned to the soil from decomposing harvest slash. The leaf fraction was the major contributor to nutrient cycling, accounting for almost all of the N and Ca release and from half to three-quarters of the K, Mg and P released. Amounts of nutrients released from residues in the year following logging greatly exceeded quantities likely to be taken up by the newly established tree crop." .

This study aims to evaluate the temporal and spatial impact of bark harvesting on wood anatomy and to determine the extent to which a tree’s ability to close the wound after bark harvesting is affected by anatomical changes in the wood. We harvested bark from ten medicinal tree species located in an Isoberlinia doka woodland in Central Benin. Two years after debarking, the wound closure was measured and one tree per species was cut at the wound level to collect a stem disc. On the cross section of each disc, vessel features (area, density and specific conductive area) were measured in the radial direction (before and after wounding) and on three locations around the disc surface. We found that during early wound healing, all species produced vessels with a smaller area than in unaffected wood and this significantly decreased the specific conductive area in eight of the investigated species. However, after 2 years, only six trees had restored their specific conductive area. In addition, a significant positive correlation (r = 0.64, P < 0.005) confirmed the relationship between the specific conductive area and tissue production to close the wound and delineated the study group into two groups of trees. Therefore, we concluded that vessels appeared to be very good anatomical indicators of the tree’s reactions to debarking." .

AbstractTracheids fulfil most wood functions in conifers (mechanical support and water transport) and earlywood tracheids account for most hydraulic conductivity within the annual tree ring. Dry conditions during the early growing season, when earlywood is formed, could lead to the formation of narrow tracheid lumens and a dense earlywood. Here, we assessed if there is a negative association between minimum wood density and early growing-season (spring) precipitation. Using dendrochronology, we studied growth and density data at nine forest stands of three Pinaceae species (Larix sibirica, Pinus nigra, and Pinus sylvestris) widely distributed in three cool–dry Eurasian regions from the forest-steppe (Russia, Mongolia) and Mediterranean (Spain) biomes. We measured for each annual tree ring and the common 1950–2002 period the following variables: earlywood and latewood width, and minimum and maximum wood density. As expected, dry early growing season (spring) conditions were associated with low earlywood production but, most importantly, to high minimum density in the three conifer species. The associations between minimum density and spring precipitation were stronger (r = −0.65) than those observed with earlywood width (r = 0.57). We interpret the relationship between spring water availability and high minimum density as a drought-induced reduction in lumen diameter, hydraulic conductivity, and growth. Consequently, forecasted growing-season drier conditions would translate into increased minimum wood density and reflect a reduction in hydraulic conductivity, radial growth, and wood formation. Given the case-study-like nature of this work, more research on other cold–dry sites with additional conifer species is needed to test if minimum wood density is a robust proxy of early season water availability." .

Understanding how climate regulates tree growth in stressful environments is essential for predicting climate change impacts on trees. The aim of this study was to build a tree-ring chronology of Hymenaea courbaril growing in a karst dry forest and evaluate how local climate and teleconnections modulate its growth. To accomplish this, increment cores of 19 individuals were sampled in Terra Ronca State Park located in Goiás State, Central Brazil. After surface polishing, tree rings were identified, measured, dated, and a tree-ring chronology was built with 17 individuals. The chronology was correlated with local and regional climate data (temperature, precipitation, air humidity). We also tested teleconnections with sea surface temperature (SST) of the Equatorial Pacific and South Atlantic. Results show that air humidity, precipitation amount, and its distribution during the transition period between dry and wet seasons positively regulate this species growth. On the other hand, growth is negatively correlated with temperature during the middle of the previous year’s dry season. Additionally, growth is negatively correlated with SST of the Southern Atlantic, but not with Equatorial Pacific. These relationships between climate and growth indicate that predicted increases in regional temperature and decreases in water availability may limit the growth of H. courbaril in karst dry forests." .

Unlike the abrupt biogeochemical changes typical after wildfire and timber harvesting, the outcomes of insect outbreaks are poorly understood. The mountain pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) began to attack lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) at the Fraser Experimental Forest in 2002 and spread throughout the research area by 2007. We compared streamwater nitrogen (N) from 2003 through 2012 with data from the previous two decades in four watersheds with distinct forest management histories, stand structures, and responses to the beetle outbreak. Watersheds dominated by old-growth had larger trees and lost 85% of overstory pine and 44% of total basal area to bark beetles. In contrast, managed watersheds containing a mixture of second-growth (30–60 year old) and old-growth (250- to 350-year old) had higher density of subcanopy trees, smaller mean tree diameter, and lower bark beetle-induced mortality (~26% of total basal area). Streamwater nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in old-growth watersheds during the outbreak than pre-outbreak levels during snowmelt and base flow seasons. In mixed-age stands, streamwater nitrate concentrations were unaffected by the outbreak. Beetle outbreak elevated inorganic N export 43 and 74% in two old-growth watersheds though the amounts of N released in streamwater were low (0.04 and 0.15 kg N ha−1) relative to atmospheric inputs (<2% of annual N deposition). Increased height, diameter, and foliar N of measured in residual live trees augmented demand for N, far in excess of the change in N export during the outbreak. Reallocation of soil resources released after pine mortality to overstory and understory vegetation helps explain high nutrient retention in watersheds affected by bark beetle outbreaks." .

This study investigated the use of small-footprint discrete-return lidar for estimating stand volume in broad-leaved forest at plot level. Field measurements were conducted at 20 sample plots in the study area in western Japan, composed of temperate broad-leaved trees. Five height variables and two density variables were derived from the lidar data: 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles, and mean of laser canopy heights as height variables (h 25, h 50, h 75, h 100, h mean); and ground fraction and only-and-vegetation fraction (d GF, d OVF) as density variables, defined respectively as the proportion of laser returns that reached the ground, and the proportion of only echoes (i.e., single pulse returns for which the first and last pulses returned from the same point) within vegetation points. In addition, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is often used as an estimator for leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass, was derived from multispectral digital imagery as an alternative density variable (d NDVI). Nonlinear least-square regression with cross-validation analysis was performed with single variables and combinations; a total of 23 models were studied. The best prediction was found when h 75 and d OVF were used as independent variables, resulting in adjusted R 2 of 0.755 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 41.90 m3 ha−1, corresponding to 16.4% of the mean stand volume, better than or comparable to the prediction models of previous studies." .

We quantify the microsite fitness benefits of dispersal by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) for mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), a shade-tolerant perennial herb, in deciduous forests of southeastern Ohio, USA. Micro-environmental variables were recorded at dung-deposition microsites, at rooting points of mayapple shoots, and at random (control) points in the forest. Fitness was assessed as the degree of overlap in ordinations of microsites by environmental variables. Mayapple occupied a broad sector (56%) of environment space corresponding to low and mid-slope positions, ravines, and proximity to trees. Deer and raccoon defecation placed dung in 71–74 and 86–95% of environment space, respectively, reaching mayapple microsites in 57–60 and 53–54% of cases. Deer placed dung in mayapple environment space 7–9% more often than predicted by random distribution, and raccoons placed dung in mayapple space 0–5% more often, consistent with only a modest degree of directed dispersal. Thus, the precision hypothesis is only weakly supported. The greatest fitness benefit of vertebrate dispersal appears to be the broad distribution of seeds, thereby increasing the probability of randomly reaching a suitable microsite. Imprecise dispersal suggests that secondary mechanisms of seed movement need to be explored in deciduous forest communities." .

It is a widely held view that plantations of exotic tree species in the tropics are harmful to the environment.

The larvae were reared in clusters of 10 individuals (on average 3.5 ♂♂ and 6.5 ♀♀), fed one-year-old needles. The average values of (C), (F) and (A) were 2,950, 2,530 and 414 mg dw per cluster, respectively, implying a dry matter assimilation efficiency of only 14.0%. The mean production of tissue (P) per cluster amounted to 250 mg dw. The concentration of bioelements in faeces (in order as above) was 51.2, 0.80, 0.08, 0.36, 0.41, 0.11, 0.10 and 0.02% of dw, and in larval tissue 57.5, 7.60, 0.64, 0.85, 0.24, 0.22, 0.24 and 0.06% of dw, respectively. The concentration of N and P in larval tissue was 5.8 and 4.9 times higher than in food, that of K, Mg, S and Na about twice, that of C and Ca about equal or less. The assimilation efficiency of the bioelements was estimated at 14.5, 59.3, 47.4, 20.9, 4.6, 12.5, 13.8 and 44.4%, and the energetics (C), (F), (A), (P) and (R=A-P) at 61,900, 53,600, 8,320, 6,710 and 1,610 J per cluster, respectively. It is argued that in N. sertifer the high consumption rate, low efficiency of dry matter assimilation and low nitrogen accumulation, in all attained at a low maintenance cost, are adaptations to a food low in nitrogen content (1.3% of dw). The study is part of an investigation on the interaction between insect consumption and pine growth, performed within the Swedish Coniferous Forest Project." .

Understanding the nature of these responses is crucial to understanding their cumulative effect on the wood quality characteristics of a forest stand. This paper reports on a study conducted over a period of 3½ years in continuously irrigated, alternately irrigated and non-irrigated Eucalyptus globulus, in which changes in wood density occurring in response to short-term growth responses were examined. The study showed that continuous irrigation led to the production of wood with significantly more homogenous density than was the case in situations, where trees experienced large fluctuations in temporal water availability. Although the trees which were not irrigated had the highest wood density overall, trees in which growth was relatively continuous tended to produce the largest volumes of wood with relatively high density, compared to trees in which periodic growth responses were caused by intermittent irrigation, in which wood density was actually reduced. This was largely due to more growth days in summer under the conditions of higher radiation, and a reduction in the number of growth events leading to the production of disproportionately large amounts of low density wood. Soil water deficits contributed to density variation in all treatments, but the effect of energy limitations became more important in continuously irrigated trees." .

Branch transpiration was scaled to canopy level on the basis of a branch conductance model, using vertical needle-area distributions obtained by destructive sampling. Comparison with total tree water uptake scaled to canopy level showed agreement within 10%, for periods when the canopy was not affected by climatically induced stress. Comparison of scaled fluxes on individual trees showed that measurements of transpiration at branch level provide information on the direct response of transpiration to variations in weather, and furthermore that the time-lag between transpiration and tree water uptake was as much as 3 h. The vertical needle-area distribution of Scots pine was similar to that found by other authors. Needle-area distribution on Norway spruce, which has not been described before, showed that it has its largest needle area at the top of the crown. Specific needle area varied considerably both within trees and between trees. For spruce, mean specific needle area (±SD) varied from 2.4±0.5 mm2 mg–1 at the top of the crown to 7.1±1.9 mm2 mg–1 at the base. Corresponding figures for Scots pine were 3.4±2.0 and 9.1±2.1." .

Invited speakers from the industry, academia, and government challenged scientists and students to employ robust technologies for developing and deploying improved trees for the emerging biomass markets as well as for the existing forest products markets. Opportunities for integrating genomics into breeding and selection programs and somatic embryogenesis into deployment practices look promising for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda); the main industrial forest tree in the southeastern USA. Advances in enabling technologies such as DNA sequencing and genotyping open new opportunities for accelerating and achieving tree improvement in all forest tree species.

Two alternative clipping strategies for greenery were applied during 8 years. Subsequently, destructive crown analyses were carried out on the trees sampled from these and traditionally cut plots. Regeneration occurred from stubs or bases of cut primary branches. In cases when stubs were removed, proliferation took place around the scar; these branches compensated in numbers but not in biomass for the absence of stub branches. More severe cutting regimes resulted in an overall biomass reduction, most notably with shorter and lighter whorl branches. Interwhorl branches and branches issued from the base of primary branches were able to extend progressively in response to severe cutting. Base branches were apparently recruited along most of the trunk, the latency of growth points thus being up to at least 10 years. Competition among interwhorl branches, as well as more complicated interactions between whorl branches and secondary branches arising from their base, are indicated by the data. Reiteration directly from the stem could not be provoked and the results suggest that optimum greenery yield depends on careful stub management." .

We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of elevated CO2 (560 μl l−1) and O3 (55 nl l l−1) on leaf litter decomposition in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) at the Aspen free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) site (Wisconsin, USA). Fumigation treatments consisted of replicated ambient, +CO2, +O3, and +CO2 + O3 FACE rings. We followed mass loss and litter chemistry over 23 months, using reciprocally transplanted litterbags to separate substrate quality from environment effects. Aspen decayed more slowly than birch across all treatment conditions, and changes in decomposition dynamics of both species were driven by shifts in substrate quality rather than by fumigation environment. Aspen litter produced under elevated CO2 decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO2, and this effect was exacerbated by elevated O3. Similarly, birch litter produced under elevated CO2 also decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO2. In contrast to results for aspen, however, elevated O3 accelerated birch decay under ambient CO2, but decelerated decay under enriched CO2. Changes in decomposition rates (k-values) were due to CO2- and O3-mediated shifts in litter quality, particularly levels of carbohydrates, nitrogen, and tannins. These results suggest that in early-successional forests of the future, elevated concentrations of CO2 will likely reduce leaf litter decomposition, although the magnitude of effect will vary among species and in response to interactions with tropospheric O3." .

Families were classified into groups dependent upon their previously determined susceptibility to stem deformation prevalent in plantations established on fertile ex-pasture. Nitrogen treatments significantly affected seedling form in terms of both branch production and stem slenderness. The high N treatment resulted in shorter seedlings, a proportion of which were obviously stunted. Stem strength of seedlings, physically supported throughout the experiment, was assessed as stem lean at harvest as well as the bending strength of the fresh stem at 50% stem height. These two variables were found not to be correlated. Stem lean at harvest was greatest in families known to be susceptible to stem deformation. These families produced stems that were also more slender than families of low susceptibility. Increased stem lean was associated mostly with increased stem slenderness while elasticity was more influenced by pith diameter, stem density and wood radius." .

We combine insights into detailed studies at high resolution with the actual status of the forest and a realistic estimate of the current management practices at large scale. Results show that the European forest system is very inert and that it takes a long time to influence the species distribution by replacing species after final felling. By 2070, on average about 36 % of the area expected to have decreased species suitability will have changed species following business as usual management. Alternative management, consisting of shorter rotations for those species and species planting based on expected trends, will have increased this species transition to 40 %. The simulated forward-looking alternative management leads to some reduction in increment, but does not influence the amount of wood removed from the forest. Northern Europe is projected to show the highest production increases under climate change and can also adapt faster to the new (proposed) species distribution. Southwest Europe is expected to face the greatest challenge by a combination of a predicted loss of production and a slow rate of management alteration under climate change." .

We examine the effects of spacing and layout on the growth and form of 3- to 4-year-old Eucalyptus globulus in a farm forestry context. Four planting layouts were chosen. These represented the range commonly in use in farm forestry: block plantings (2×4 m), triple rows (2×4 m) at 10-m intervals, single rows (2×10 m) and isolated trees (10×10 m). The physiological significance of key results is interpreted in terms of changes in the parameters of a simple plantation growth model. Under conditions where levels of direct light are high, for example during summer, block-planted trees intercepted only 38% of the light intercepted by isolated trees. On a stand basis, however, the combination of incident radiation and ground coverage declined with lower stand densities. While stand leaf area index declined from around 6 to 1 with increased spacing, individual tree leaf areas rose from around 50 m2 in block plantings to 150 m2 in isolated trees. The proportion of above-ground biomass found in stems declined with increasing spacing as the mass in foliage and branches increased. Stems accounted for 65% of above-ground biomass in block-planted trees but only 35% in isolated trees. The contributions of leaves and branches correspondingly rose from 19% to 35% and from 16% to 29%, respectively. Changes in biomass distribution were accompanied by increasing branch number, branch thickness, flatter branch angles and the longer retention of lower branches with greater spacing. These changes have implications for the merchantability of the timber. The efficiency of above-ground radiation conversion was constant at 0.67 g MJ–1 irrespective of spacing. We estimated that foliar maintenance respiration (R m) accounted for about 90% of above-ground R m. On a stand basis R m costs block plantings 23.90 t DM ha–1 year–1 (50% annual above-ground photosynthetic production) compared with 6.22 t DM ha–1 year–1 (40% annual above-ground photosynthetic production) in stands of isolated trees." .

When point source values of solar radiation below the canopy were compared to horizontal average values for the same hours, hourly average values were found to vary from 60% to 260%, whereas average daily values varied only as little as 2% to 11%. The amount of solar radiation which penetrated the canopy varied both diurnally and seasonally. The greatest seasonal variation (from 44% to 33%) was observed within the span of a few weeks during the leafing season, even though there were only a few deciduous trees in the area. A higher albedo was found for spruce than for pine, and diffuse to direct solar radiation was shown to vary with air mass. Net long-wave radiation was higher with Arctic air masses than with Maritime Polar or Tropical air masses. Atmospheric emissivity did not correlate well with either air temperature or vapour pressure when morning data were combined with afternoon data. A somewhat improved relationship was possible when morning and afternoon data were grouped separately. Downward long-wave radiation below the canopy was controlled primarily by lower canopy temperatures and secondarily by downward long-wave sky radiation. It was estimated that after leafing only about 15% to 20% of downward long-wave sky radiation was penetrating to below the canopy." .

Don shows further progress in the development of a mixed eucalypt-pine stand. Earlier (Chilvers and Burdon 1983) it was clear that pines invading from an adjacent commercial plantation were starting to contribute their own progeny to the mixed stand. Initially the recruitment of established pines (> 1 m high) from these seedlings was very slow. However, since 1984, increasing numbers of seedlings have survived beyond their first year, suggesting the possibility of another wave of successful establishment in the near future. The established fraction of the pine population continued to grow rapidly and incurred no mortality. Many of these plants have now emerged through the top of the eucalypt canopy. In contrast, both juvenile and adult eucalypt numbers continued to decline. Despite these demographic and visual changes, comparative analysis of the growth of established pines over two consecutive 7-year periods (1974–1981; 1981–1988) showed that competition between neighbouring plants, especially pines, is beginning to affect individual growth rates. Growth rates of pines having other pines as nearest neighbours declined 40% between 1974–1981 and 1981–1988, while that of pines with eucalypts as nearest neighbours fell by 28%. In pine-pine nearest neighbour (NN) pairs, growth rates were significantly affected by the size (diameter) of the nearest neighbour. In pine-eucalypt NN pairs growth rates of the pines were not affected by the size of the eucalypt, but these were significantly negatively correlated with the inverse of the distance to the eucalypt. More broad-based assessment of 43 pines showed a significant relationship between their growth rates and the summed competitive effect of other pines within a 5-m radius. No such relationship was found between growth rate and the summed competitive effect of eucalypts in the 5-m zone." .

Low seedling survival and growth may result in restoration failures and various mechanical site preparation techniques for treatment of soils and vegetation are important tools used to help counteract this. In this article, we synthesize the current state-of-knowledge concerning mechanical site preparation for improved tree establishment when carried out in different forest restoration situations, point out critical research gaps and provide some recommendations for future directions. Mechanical site preparation often results in improved seedling survival and growth. However, if not intensive methods with much soil disturbance are used, it is a rather ineffective tool for controlling competing vegetation. Methods such as scarification, mounding and subsoiling also lead to multiple interactions among soil physical and chemical properties that affect plant survival and growth, and it may be difficult to determine the actual cause–effect relationship of any positive seedling responses. Most research to date on mechanical site preparation and plantation performance has been conducted using a few conifer tree species. Seedling responses differ among tree species and alternative species are often used during restoration compared to production forestry indicating a need for additional research for improved understanding. Several management objectives such as soil protection and increased biodiversity are many times relevant during forest restoration, and mechanical site preparation methods should be implemented carefully because they can have large impacts on the environment." .

Accordingly, we measured soil and foliar N concentration and N isotope ratios (δ15N) throughout the campina-campinarana transect and compared to published dense terra-firme forest results. There were no differences between white-sand vegetation types in regard to soil N concentration, C:N ratio and δ15N across the transect. Both white-sand vegetation types showed very low foliar N concentrations and elevated foliar C:N ratios, and no significant difference between site types was observed. Foliar δ15N was depleted, varying from −9.6 to 1.6‰ in the white-sand vegetations. The legume Aldina heterophylla had the highest average δ15N values (−1.5‰) as well as the highest foliar N concentration (2.1%) while the non-legume species had more depleted δ15N values and the average foliar N concentrations varied from 0.9 to 1.5% among them. Despite the high variation in foliar δ15N among plants, a significant and gradual 15N-enrichment in foliar isotopic signatures throughout the campina–campinarana transect was observed. Individual plants growing in the campinarana were significantly enriched in 15N compared to those in campina.

To investigate the possibility of vegetation change at this boundary, we used the natural difference in the stable carbon isotope ratio (13C/12C, expressed as δ13C) of C3 (forest) and C4 (savanna) plants, which is preserved in the isotopic composition of soil organic carbon. Past changes in the position of the ecotone can thus be documented by 13C/12C analysis of soil organic matter (SOM). Measurements were made on soil samples taken along a transect across the forest savanna boundary. In both ecosystems, δ13C values of SOM in upper soil layers appeared to be in equilibrium with the current plant community: SOM was near-14‰ under savanna cover, and near-28‰ under forest. By contrast, δ13C values of SOM from deep layers of soil profiles under forest cover near the ecotone, were less negative than would be expected for a C3-dominated community. These results indicate that a change in ecosystem dominance occurred recently, and that forest has invaded an area occupied previously by a C4 plant community (savanna and cultivated grassland)." .

The trees in the test plot were categorized as fast, middle, or slow growing according to the mean stem diameter and standard deviation in the plot. Five trees were selected from each category to investigate the effects of the growth rate on the wood properties [basic density (BD) and compressive strength parallel to the grain in a 5-mm-diameter core sample (CS)]. No significant correlation was recognized between the stem diameter and the stress wave velocity of trees. Clearly lower values of BD and CS were found in slow-growing trees than in fast- and middle-growing trees. The BD of xylem near the pith was reduced by extraction with organic solvent. BD after extraction and CS gradually increased from pith to bark. The results obtained in this study clarified that an early selection of trees with high BD is possible by using the BD after extraction at 4 cm from the pith." .

By simultaneously considering distance from a conspecific adult, size of the nearest conspecific adult, leaf litter quantity, proximity to logs or tree trunks, and whether or not the seed was in a gap, I was able to analyze the influences of individual factors, as well as the interactions among factors. Seed survival was significantly less in treefall gaps than in the forest understory. Seed survival was also influenced by the size of the nearest adult but in a complex interaction with distance to an adult. For seeds beneath adults, survival decreased with increasing tree size, while for seeds away from adults, survival was independent of the size of the nearest conspecific adult. Distance did not directly affect seed survival, nor did the quantity of leaf litter or the proximity to a tree trunk or a log. In a separate analysis, the relationship between distance and seed survival was consistent over four years, suggesting that single cohort studies may provide accurate insights into the consequences of dispersal. In contrast, the spatial locations of surviving seeds were not consistent over the four-year period. Transects with high survival one year did not tend to have high survival in other years, and the locations of surviving seeds in any particular year could not be predicted from the knowledge of where seeds survived in other years. While survival is patchy within a year, the locations of patches shift from year to year." .

This paper reports an attempt to synthesize the available information into a unifying and testable numerical model pertinent to the analysis and projection of WD decay in field conditions. The model is rooted in an integrative theory that depicts decay as a process of substrate quality degradation along with feedback responses of microbial activity. It is parameterized through regression analysis against 112 data cases of stem and branch WD decay in North America, and then is evaluated against 132 additional data cases for stem and branch WD, and 75 data cases for root WD decay. The root mean square errors of both the fitted and the projected WD decay rates are about 14% of the means of respective data sets. Aided by peripheral algorithms, the model solves WD decay with data requirements limited to (1) tree species, and (2) air temperature and precipitation in January and July for forested sites, plus (3) latitude and elevation for deforested sites. The mathematical and physical implications of the model by its component functions and as a whole are generally supported by independent evidence from the literature where available. Those implications include: (1) the observed decay rate is lower when defined by density loss than by mass loss, when inferred from chronosequence survey than from population monitoring, or when estimated with specimens with end-coating than without coating; (2) the initial quality of WD differs between Abies/Picea and other species among conifers, or along the gradients of shade tolerance and normal stem slenderness among the deciduous trees; (3) the basic microbial growth rate (the rate at a WD quality of unity) increases with ambient temperature but decreases along the gradients of July precipitation-to-potential evapotranspiration ratio and January precipitation under forested conditions; and (4) WD decay may be accelerated or hampered after canopy removal, depending on local air humidity. The model further suggests that the lower of substrate quality and the basic microbial growth rate exerts a proportionally greater constraint on the decay rate, so the difference in WD decay by substrate and site narrows as the substrate quality degrades over time. Thus, a 2°C warming in air temperature would accelerate stem WD decay by 9–55% across the data sites for the 1st year, but only 1–14% by year 100." .

As the management and conservation of forest land uses are considered a means of reducing future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the monitoring of forest C stocks and stock change by categories of land-use change (for example, croplands converted to forest) is often a requirement of C monitoring protocols such as those espoused by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (that is, Good Practice Guidance and Guidelines). The identification of land use is often along a spectrum ranging from direct observation (for example, interpretation of owner intent via field visits) to interpretation of remotely sensed imagery (for example, land cover mapping) or some combination thereof. Given the potential for substantial differences across this spectrum of monitoring techniques, a region-wide, repeated forest inventory across the eastern U.S. was used to evaluate relationships between forest land-use change (derived from a forest inventory) and forest cover change (derived from Landsat modeling) in the context of forest C monitoring strategies. It was found that the correlation between forest land-use change and cover change was minimal (<0.08), with an increase in forest land use but a net decrease in forest cover being the most frequent observation. Cover assessments may be more sensitive to active forest management and/or conversion activities that can lead to confounded conclusions regarding the forest C sink (for example, decreasing forest cover but increasing C stocks in industrial timberlands). In contrast, the categorical nature of direct land-use field observations reduces their sensitivity to forest management activities (for example, clearcutting versus thinning) and recent disturbance events (for example, floods or wildfire) that may obscure interpretation of C dynamics over short time steps. While using direct land-use observations or cover mapping in forest C assessments, they should not be considered interchangeable as both approaches possess idiosyncratic qualities that should be considered when developing conclusions regarding forest C attributes and dynamics across large scales." .

This has driven the European Union to protect forest stands from the propagation and dispersion of this pathogen. However, the current control measures have been unsuccessful in preventing the dispersion of this organism, as it continues to be detected in wood material through commercial trade. Timber is a material treated with specific products against wood decay organisms, and is now, additionally submitted to thermo-treatment in accordance with International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM-15) to control PWN. The industrial sector is concerned whether this treatment is sufficient and the current anti-decay wood treatments are effective against this nematode. For this reason, the objective of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of the permitted wood products against B. xylophilus in blue-stained and non-stained green and dry wood in Pinus pinaster Ait, the most sensitive Pinus species. The results show that the anti-sapstain products tested are effective against PWN in green sound wood, but they do not present the same protective behavior in blue-stained wood. The results for other products employed on dry wood (stained and non-stained) show that almost all of them are effective against this nematode. In consequence, timber protected by means of commercialized wood preservatives might be a good way to control PWN in the wood industry, even being a valid alternative and in some situations preventing the application of ISPM-15." .

Results from two research sites are discussed here: one site near an antenna element and a control site located 50 km from the communication system. Growth models for individual tree diameters were developed for northern red oak (Quercus rubra), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), aspen (Populus tremuloides with a few individuals ofP. grandidentata), and red maple (Acer rubrum). A growth model for individual tree height was developed for young red pine (Pinus resinosa). Average differences between the observed and predicted growth were calculated for each growing season and then compared between the study sites and across the study periods to evaluate changes in growth patterns which could be attributed to EM field effects. For aspen and red maple, the results showed a stimulation of diameter growth at magnetic flux density levels of 1 to 7 milliGauss; height growth of red pine was increased at about the same exposure levels. There are no clear indications of an EM field effect on total annual diameter growth for either of the other two species." .

We compared tree shape, growth rate, height and age at four different sites in Haida Gwaii (British Columbia, Canada) that had trees representative of the range of deer impact on trees: (1) trees showing no sign of browsing, (2) escaped trees which were still browsed below the browse line and (3) stunted and heavily browsed trees. Repeated and intense browsing resulted in the small size, compact heavily ramified shape of stunted trees and in the short compact and ramified lower branches of escaped trees. These contrasted with the shape of non-browsed trees, a shape that was also found in escaped trees above the browse line. Before release, all browsed trees experienced stagnation in growth characterised by narrow rings (0.3 mm/year) and a small annual height increment (2.5 cm/year). At release, growth rate increased and stabilised: rings were wider (1.3 mm/year) and annual height increments were greater (10.5 cm/year). Non-browsed trees had a mean ring-width of 1.3 mm/year and an annual height increment of 22 cm/year. Delay in tree recruitment caused by deer varied from site to site. It had been about 15 years for the escaped trees and is estimated at 30–40 years for the stunted trees. Spatial variation in deer impact may reflect spatial variation of browsing pressure resulting from local differences in the availability of preferred forage or to differences in tree chemical defences/nutritional values." .

AbstractMonitoring the rhythm of tree growth associated with the growth rings can contribute substantially to understanding forest dynamics and the management of tropical forests. In this study, we monitored the girth increment rhythm and described the wood characteristics (anatomy of growth rings, wood specific gravity) in 10 tropical tree species (103 individuals) naturally occurring in a wet and weakly seasonal region of Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. We aimed to verify whether tree growth dynamics are associated with climate and woody anatomy in tropical trees with contrasting ecological characteristics. We installed permanent dendrometer bands and monthly assessed the girth increment for 22 months. We collected wood samples (non-destructive method), measured wood specific gravity and prepared permanent slides to characterize the growth ring markers. We found growth rings in all species (distinct in six species); deciduous species produced more distinguishable tree rings compared with semi-deciduous and evergreen tree species. Species varied in their accumulated girth growth (in average, from 1.83 to 62.64 mm), growth rates (1–15 %), and annual radial increment (0.16–5.44 mm). Girth increment was positively related to temperature and day length in five out of ten tree species, indicating the possible effects of these climatic variables in triggering cambial activity in these species. The growth pattern varied among species and was marginally associated to the tree deciduousness. We concluded that even in wet and less seasonal climates, there can be an association in the cambium activity and stem growth with the hotter and longer days of summer months." .

Significant correlations (P<0.001) were found between LAI and PAI for each age with different equations being generated for the two ages (LAI=1.0594(PAI)−0.892 at 2 years of age, and LAI=1.0393(PAI) at 3 years of age). The equations differed from those reported in other eucalypt studies, as the PCA in this study over-predicted LAI at 2 years, and slightly under-predicted at 3 years, of age.

We placed artificial nests containing quail eggs in forests of different sizes and at various distances from the edge to test which of these factors was most important in describing predation. Predation was greatest in small tracts surrounded completely by land. Large areas and those bordered on at least one side by a large water body had lower predation rates. This suggests that influx of predators from nearby habitats may be responsible for much of the nest predation in forest fragments." .

The biomass, soil properties, pH value of runoff and groundwater in both unthinned and thinned Chinese fir plantations were measured and compared over a 5-year period (2–6 years after thinning). The results indicated that acidic deposition in the Huitong State Ecosystem Research Station was serious, and it got worse with time. Forest thinning resulted in a huge change in biomass and soil properties. During the 5-year monitoring period, biomasses of understory and litter, plant species richness, coverage of undergrowth plant layer were significantly higher in thinned site than in unthinned site. Moreover, higher soil fertility as well as lower amounts of runoff and groundwater were found in thinned site. It was suggested that thinning could improve the structure of forest, leading to restoring the effluent (runoff and groundwater) pH to the normal value." .

This sampling system was carefully validated against heat and CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method. Although the sampling system was robust, there were large uncertainties in the measured methane fluxes because of the limited precision of the methane gas analyzer. Based on the spectral characteristics of signals from the methane analyzer and the diurnal variations in the standard deviation of the vertical wind velocity, we found the daytime and nighttime precision of half-hourly methane flux measurements to be approximately 1.2 and 0.7 μg CH4 m−2 s−1, respectively. Additional uncertainties caused by the dilution effect were estimated to affect the accuracy by as much as 0.21 μg CH4 m−2 s−1 on a half-hourly basis. Diurnal and seasonal variations were observed in the measured fluxes. The biological emission from plant leaves was not observed in our studies, and thus could be negligible at the canopy-scale exchange. The annual methane sink was 835 ± 175 mg CH4 m−2 year−1 (8.35 kg CH4 ha−1 year−1), which was comparable to the flux range of 379–2,478 mg CH4 m−2 year−1 previously measured in other Japanese forest soils. This study indicated that the REA method could be a promising technique to measure canopy scale methane fluxes over forests, but further improvement of precision of the analyzer will be required." .

AbstractGap fraction (GF) and clumping index (CI) play key roles in plant light interception, and therefore they have strong impacts on plant growth and canopy radiative transfer processes. Trees are usually assumed to be randomly distributed in natural forests in many previous studies. However, few studies have shown how trees are distributed in forest plantations and how these distribution patterns affect GF and CI in these forests. In this paper, a simple and general distance factor defined as relative allowable shortest distance between centers of two adjacent crowns divided by the mean diameter of the crowns (RASD) is proposed to describe quantitatively the degree of mutual exclusion among trees in forest plantations of various tree distribution patterns. A hypergeometric model is proposed instead of two previous stochastic tree distribution models (the Poisson model and Neyman-A model) to describe the topological relationship of trees and the influences of the exclusion distance on the GF and CI of the forest plantation canopies. The results show that: (1) the hypergeometric model is more suitable than the Poisson model and Neyman-A model for describing the topological relationship of trees in forest plantations; (2) the exclusion distance has strong impacts on GF and CI: there are significant differences between the results of the hypergeometric model and the Poisson model. Larger RASD causes lower GF and larger CI. The simulations are verified by field measurements in four forest plantation stands. Similarly, impacts of RASD on GF and CI are also found for other two crown shapes (prolate and oblate ellipsoids)." .

Paleo oaks were sampled from Northern Missouri, USA and compared to a pollen-based, high-resolution paleo temperature reconstruction from Northern Illinois, USA. Growth data were from 53 paleo bur oak log cross sections collected in Missouri. These oaks were preserved in river and stream sediments and were radiocarbon-dated to a period of rapid climate change during the last deglaciation (10.5 and 13.3 cal kyr BP). Growth data from modern bur oaks were obtained from increment core collections paired with USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data collected across the Great Plains, Midwest, and Upper Great Lakes regions. For modern oaks growing at an average [CO2] of 330 ppm, growth sensitivity to temperature (i.e., the slope of growth rate versus temperature) was about twice that of paleo oaks growing at an average [CO2] of 230 ppm. These data help to confirm that leaf-level predictions that photosynthesis and thus growth will be more sensitive to temperature at higher [CO2] in mature trees—suggesting that tree growth forest productivity will be increasingly sensitive to temperature under projected global warming and high-[CO2] conditions." .

In this study, we analyze the land cover dynamics in the Osa Peninsula region of Costa Rica between 1987 and 2009 that provides a good scenario for evaluating the effects over forest trends of the environmental policies set up in 1996. Remote sensing imagery from Landsat and SPOT 2 satellites was classified using the See5 algorithm to obtain land cover maps for 1987, 1998, 2003 and 2009. Our results show that land cover changes in Osa County are driven by grassland/forest dynamics. Forest area diminished over the 1987–1998 period, whereas it increased by 5 and 6 % during the 1998–2003 and 2003–2009 periods, respectively. Grassland abandonment was identified as the main driver of the net increase in forest cover area. Fragmentation analysis was done over the forest class of these maps disclosing secondary forest of the persistent forest of each period. Persistent forest patches decrease in number, but increase in size through time, forming areas of persistent forest established in bigger patches with lower edge density. Secondary forest patches have increased in number and size, forming larger areas of forest established in bigger patches. Nearly half of the reforested area in the period 1987–2009 remained as secondary forest in 2009, playing a key role by decreasing forest fragmentation and strengthening the natural corridor connecting the conservation areas of the region." .

This research was done on adult individuals of a very abundant palm (Astrocaryum mexicanum Liebm, Arecaceae), which is found in the understorey of the forest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Percentages of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizae were determined for individuals selected randomly from plots located both in gaps and under closed canopy. The highest percentages of total colonization, as well as those of hyphae and vesicles, were recorded for gaps. In forest with closed canopy, arbuscules had the highest percentages of colonization; on these sites the palm has been observed to grow less.

For our particular study, the differences between the mapping-based approach and the sample-based approach were minor (sampling: 24.37 ha and 16,670 t of dry wood per year with a relative standard error 11.6 % vs. area-wide mapping: 24.35 ha and 16,055 t; standard error not available). Due to a minor difference of only 3.7 % between the two approaches, we conclude that area-wide mapping serves as a sound basis for a quantification of bioenergy potentials from TOF. It also shown that only about 62 % of all TOF objects (74 % of the total annual biomass production) would be directly accessible via the existing road infrastructure (without heavy machinery). In terms of available end-use energy, the regional biomass potential translates to an annual amount of 233 TJ which, in turn, reflects only about 0.9 % of the annual end-use energy demand in the study area. This marginal contribution to the region’s energy supply is due to the fact that TOF covers only around 24 km2 (~2 %) in our study area." .

Stem anatomical and structural variables were examined to identify variables that could explain variation in bending strength. Half of the seedlings were physically supported to minimise the confounding effects of compression wood production in response to environmental stresses. Differences between seedlings and cuttings were examined. Variation in microfibril angle and lignin content was sufficient to account for 81% of the variation in bending strength. A positive correlation between both of these variables and elasticity was evident. Few differences were found to be caused by the support treatment or between seedlings and cuttings. The support treatment resulted in significantly fewer branches in the top most whorl, while cuttings had less branches in this whorl than seedlings." .

One tree of each species was girdled before radiolabeling to prevent phloem translocation to the roots, and the aboveground biomass was harvested prior to autumn leaf fall. Aboveground biomass, leaf fall, throughfall, and stemflow were sampled over a 13 to 24 week period. Sulfur-35 concentrations in tree leaves reached nearly asymptotic levels within 1 to 2 weeks after radiolabeling. Foliar leaching of 35S and leaf fall represented relatively unimportant return pathways to the forest soil. The final distribution of 35S in the nongirdled trees indicated little aboveground storage of S in biomass and appreciable (>60%) capacity to cycle S either to the belowground system by means of translocation or to the atmosphere by means of biogenic S emissions. Losses of volatile 35S were estimated from the amount of isotope missing (∼33%) in final inventories of the girdled trees. Estimated 35S emission rates from the girdled trees were ∼10-6 to ∼10-7 μCi cm-2 leaf d-1, and corresponded to an estimated gaseous S emission of approximately 0.1 to 1 μg S cm-2 leaf d-1. Translocation to roots was a significant sink for 35S in the red maple tree (40% of the injected amount). Research on forest biogeochemical S cycles should further explore biogenic S emissions from trees as a potential process of S flux from forest ecosystems." .

However, this principle may not hold in general regarding biochemical interactions between O3-impacted branches exposed inside cuvettes and neighbouring crown parts under the unchanged ambient O3 regime. After reviewing relevant cuvette studies conducted to date, we will provide evidence that cuvette-exposed branches may serve, given awareness of outlined pre-requisites and restrictions, as surrogates for examining the crown-level response of trees to elevated O3 regimes. Such a conclusion is based on the defence metabolism of branches, which seems to be autonomous to some extent from neighbouring crown sections. Cuvette studies may, therefore, be used to derive dose response functions as measures of O3 sensitivity. On such grounds, also validation and improvement of stomatal O3 uptake modelling becomes feasible. The branch-level approach, however, does not substitute whole-tree free-air O3 fumigation and related flux assessments, as branches in view of representativeness and boundary layer characteristics represent one stage in scaling O3 flux between leaf and tree level. Branch level-based flux scaling should be backed, therefore, by independent trunk sap-flow assessment techniques that offer derivation of FO3 at the whole-tree level." .

We measured responses of soil CO2 efflux (FCO2), fine root production, and root-free incubation soil respiration to experimental additions of non-nitrogenous mineral nutrients (phosphorus (P) + potassium (K) fertilizer, dolomitic lime, and P + K plus lime) over 2 years in a sugar-maple-dominated forest in central Ontario; this region receives some of the highest anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs in North America, and evidence exists for co-limitation by P, magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) of the growth of dominant trees. Soil amendments, in particular P + K fertilization, reduced FCO2, fine root production and microbial respiration, with decreases in FCO2 of 28–51% in fertilized compared to control plots. Partial regression analyses indicated that soil available P had a negative effect on FCO2, fine root production, and microbial respiration, but detected no significant effects of N, Ca, or Mg. Path analysis further suggested that available P reduced both fine root production and microbial respiration, and that these effects were largely responsible for reduced FCO2. There was also a residual direct negative relationship between available P and FCO2, which may represent reduced metabolic activity of roots. The study indicates that P is a critical nutrient dominating belowground processes in an N-saturated forest ecosystem, and suggests that additions of P may enhance C sink strength in managed forests in part through reductions in soil CO2 efflux." .

Cones take 3 years to mature, while other newer cones are growing on the tree. Currently, mechanical cone harvesting by tree vibration drives the profitability and development of this crop in forest ecosystems. However, the adaptation of vibration parameters is necessary to avoid damage to the tree and for the implementation of good harvesting practices. Direct measurements of acceleration transmissibility along fruit-bearing branches under controlled laboratory conditions showed that vibrations in the frequency range of 18.0 ± 5.3 Hz were capable of producing resonance phenomena in mature cones. Morphological changes produced in the mature cones, especially in the stalk and total weight, amplified the acceleration transmissibility, providing more favourable conditions for fruit detachment. Field tests with stone pines and a trunk shaker confirmed the potential of selective mechanical harvesting, which is conditional on the vibration parameters applied. The frequency range of the resonance of the mature cone proved to be suitable for vibration of the tree at its trunk. The quality and efficiency of the mechanical harvesting were determined to be inversely related parameters during harvesting by vibration. Trunk vibration at a frequency of 18 Hz and approximate acceleration of 65 m/s2 achieved a high harvest quality, with limited detachment of shoots and unripe cones, and a harvesting efficiency near 85%." .

We examined variation in leaf physiology, leaf area to sapwood area ratio (L/S), and annual aboveground growth across a range of tree heights in Eucalyptus regnans. Leaf photosynthetic capacity did not differ among upper crown leaves of individuals 61.1–92.4 m tall. Maximum daily and integrated diurnal stomatal conductance (g s) averaged 36 and 34 % higher, respectively, in upper crown leaves of ~60-m-tall, 80-year-old trees than in ~90-m-tall, 300-year-old trees, with larger differences observed on days with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Greater stomatal regulation in taller trees resulted in similar minimum daily leaf water potentials (Ψ L) in shorter and taller trees over a broad range of VPDs. The long-term stomatal limitation on photosynthesis, as inferred from leaf δ 13C composition, was also greater in taller trees. The δ 13C of wood indicated that the bulk of photosynthesis used to fuel wood production in the main trunk and branches occurred in the upper crown. L/S increased with tree height, especially after accounting for size-independent variation in crown structure across 27 trees up to 99.8 m tall. Despite greater stomatal limitation of leaf photosynthesis in taller trees, total L explained 95 % of the variation in annual aboveground biomass growth among 15 trees measured for annual biomass growth increment in 2006. Our results support a theoretical model proposing that, in the face of increasing hydraulic constraints with height, whole-tree growth is maximized by a resource trade-off that increases L to maximize light capture rather than by reducing L/S to sustain g s." .

These phenols do not appear to affect insect attack because a wide range of concentrations of condensed tannins and other phenols in leaves of 13 Eucalyptus sp. influenced neither feeding rates of Paropsis atomaria larvae, nor their nitrogen use efficiencies. We discuss reasons why tannins may not appreciably reduce the availability of nitrogen (N) to these insects. Performance was directly related to leaf N concentration, and growth rates, N gains, and N use efficiencies all increased as leaf N content increased, although absolute feeding rates remained constant. These relationships differ from those found in insects feeding on other plants, and we suggest that the low N contents common in Eucalyptus leaves may be responsble. We propose that the extensive damage observed in many eucalypts is in part related to the high feeding rates maintained by individual larvae." .

We investigated how spring precipitation and soil conditions interact with summer drought and affect the establishment of conifer seedlings from different climatic origin. Emergence, establishment and subsequent performance of seedlings originating from autochthonous, Central Alpine, continental Eastern European, and Mediterranean Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies populations were studied in the dry Alpine Rhine valley, Switzerland, at three sites with differing soil water holding capacities and in 3 years with contrasting weather conditions. In addition to this natural inter-annual variation, precipitation was manipulated within sites with throughfall reduction roofs. Seedling establishment and growth were principally affected by the spring weather in the year of emergence. In years with average to positive spring water balance, seedlings grown at the site with the highest water holding capacity had 2–5 times more aboveground biomass than seedlings grown at sites with less favourable soils. Effects of seed origin were marginal and only detectable at the drier sites: contrary to our expectations, seedlings from the Central Alpine Rhone valley, where the climatic spring water deficit is large, outperformed those from the Mediterranean. Consequently, plantation of non-native populations from dryer origin will mitigate the effects of increased summer drought at driest sites only, while the inter-annual variability of spring precipitation will continue to enable temperate conifers to regenerate on a wide range of forest soils independent of seed origin." .

How ecosystem functioning depends on these measures of diversity can vary from site to site and depends on successional stage. Here, we measured taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity, and examined their relationship with biomass in two successional stages of the broad-leaved Korean pine forest in northeastern China. Functional diversity was calculated from six plant traits, and aboveground biomass (AGB) and coarse woody productivity (CWP) were estimated using data from three forest censuses (10 years) in two large fully mapped forest plots (25 and 5 ha). 11 of the 12 regressions between biomass variables (AGB and CWP) and indices of diversity showed significant positive relationships, especially those with phylogenetic diversity. The mean tree diversity-biomass regressions increased from 0.11 in secondary forest to 0.31 in old-growth forest, implying a stronger biodiversity effect in more mature forest. Multi-model selection results showed that models including species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and single functional traits explained more variation in forest biomass than other candidate models. The models with a single functional trait, i.e., leaf area in secondary forest and wood density in mature forest, provided better explanations for forest biomass than models that combined all six functional traits. This finding may reflect different strategies in growth and resource acquisition in secondary and old-growth forests." .

We established one 20 × 20-m plot at each of two study sites at P. thunbergii coastal forests in Samcheok. Fifty soil blocks (5 × 5 × 15 cm) were sampled at regular intervals, and ten P. thunbergii seedlings of age 0, 1–3, 3–5, and 5–10 years were sampled in each study plot. In total of 27 ECM fungal taxa, Cenococcum geophilum was dominant, followed by Russula sp., Sebacina sp., and unidentified Cortinuris sp. in mature trees. In 0-year-old seedlings, some fungal species such as Sebacina sp., C. geophilum, and unidentified Cortinarius sp. were dominant whereas only C. geophilum was dominant after 1 year, and there were no apparent succession patterns in ECM fungal compositions beyond a host age of 1 year. Most ECM fungal taxa that had colonized seedlings of each age class were also observed in roots of mature trees in each site. These taxa accounted for 86.7–100% and 96.4–98.4% of ECM abundance in seedlings and mature trees, respectively. The results indicate that the species composition of ECM fungal taxa colonizing seedlings of different age in forests is similar to that of surrounding mature trees. Our results also showed that C. geophilum is a common and dominant ECM fungus in P. thunbergii coastal forests and might play a significant role in their regeneration." .

Leaf-level comparisons were made among 11 congeneric pairs from rainforest and eucalypt forests. Leaf-level ignitability, combustibility and sustainability were not consistently higher for taxa from frequently burnt eucalypt forests, nor were they higher for species with fire-driven recruitment. The bulk density of litter-bed fuels strongly influenced flammability, but eucalypt forest litter was not less dense than rainforest litter. Ignitability, combustibility and flame sustainability of community surface fuels (litter) were compared using fuel arrays with standardized fuel mass and moisture content. Forests previously burned at high fire severity did not have consistently higher litter flammability than those burned at lower severity or long unburned. Thus, contrary to the Mutch hypothesis, there was no evidence of higher flammability of litter fuels or leaves from frequently burnt eucalypt forests compared with infrequently burnt rainforests. We suggest the manifest pyrogenicity of eucalypt forests is not due to natural selection for more flammable foliage, but better explained by differences in crown openness and associated microclimatic differences." .

Here, we present the results of studies in two subalpine forests in the Rocky Mountains, one that experienced natural pine beetle disturbance and one that experienced simulated disturbance imposed through bole girdling. We assessed changes to soil microclimate and biogeochemical pools in plots representing different post-disturbance chronosequences. High plot tree mortality, whether due to girdling or beetle infestation, caused similar alterations in soil nutrient pools. During the first 4 years after disturbance, sharp declines were observed in the soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (45–51 %), microbial biomass carbon concentration (33–39 %), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentration (31–42 %), and inorganic phosphorus (PO4 3−) concentration (53–55 %). Five to six years after disturbance, concentrations of DOC, DON, and PO4 3− recovered to 71–140 % of those measured in undisturbed plots. Recovery was coincident with observed increases in litter depth and the sublitter, soil O-horizon. During the 4 years following disturbance, soil ammonium, but not nitrate, increased to 2–3 times the levels measured in undisturbed plots. Microbial biomass N increased in plots where increased ammonium was available. Our results show that previously observed declines in soil respiration following beetle-induced disturbance are accompanied by losses in key soil nutrients. Recovery of the soil nutrient pool occurs only after several years following disturbance, and is correlated with progressive mineralization of dead tree litter." .

Schottky was examined in trees of various sizes to clarify its variation in relation to tree size and the light environment in a stand. As indices of these parameters, we analyzed crown social position (CSP: percent of stand height) and specific leaf area (SLA). The vertical foliage distribution of trees was expressed by a Weibull function. The variation in the vertical foliage distribution of C. cuspidata could be categorized into three types using crown social position and light environment. In the first type, leaves were concentrated to the top 20% of the tree; such trees are canopy trees that can receive full sunlight. The second type had a large relative crown depth and an asymmetric distribution with the maximum foliage located near the top of the tree; such trees are suppressed trees whose crowns do not receive sufficient light. The third type had a large relative crown depth and a symmetric distribution; such trees occur in high light environments, although their crowns are in the understory layer. The differences in the vertical foliage distribution are related to the strategies used to capture light. Multiple regression analysis showed that CSP and SLA at the top layer of the tree explained successive changes in the vertical foliage distribution. These results will contribute to scaling-up the vertical foliage distribution to the community level in pure stands of C. cuspidata using an individual-based model." .

We examined how human-induced changes in the relative abundances of two dominant Mediterranean trees—Pinus halepensis and Quercus calliprinos—impact leaf litter decomposition. A reciprocal transplant experiment tested decomposition of pine, oak, and mixed leaf litter in oak woodland and pine forest ecosystems with different relative abundances of pine and oak. Using likelihood methods, we tested the importance and magnitude of the environmental effects of local species abundance, litter layer composition, and soil properties on litter mass loss. Oak litter decomposition was slower than pine, and had an antagonistic effect on mixed litter decay. These results differ from other reported pine–oak associations, and are probably associated with a higher content of tannins and phenols in oak compared to pine litter in our study sites. The environmental effects of the two species were opposite to their litter decomposition dynamics. An increased proportion of pine in the oak woodlands and a higher content of pine needles in the litter layer of pine forests reduced decay rates. The presence of more oak and broadleaf litter in the litter layer accelerated decomposition in pine forests. Our results highlight the importance of considering multidimensional species effects mediated by both chemical and physical properties, and imply that man-made changes in the composition and configuration of plant communities may result in complex unpredicted consequences to ecosystem biogeochemistry." .

Soil nutrient capital and nutrient removals in forest harvesting were estimated together with potential impacts of these removals on the nutrient capital balance. Soils were anlysed from eighty sites for phosphorus fractions, including organic phosphorus fractions, and total and exchangeable cations. Based on typical forest harvesting systems, it was found that 3–4 kg phosphorus would be removed per hectare. Due to equilibrium between the various soil phosphorus components, depletion would not be solely from the more available pools. It is expected that at least four forest rotations (320 years) would be required before any detectable change would occur, within forest communities. A similar depletion estimate was calculated for the potentially most vulnerable cation, calcium. The other nutrient cations, magnesium and potassium had considerably greater reserves." .

Soil P availability and mean foliar P concentrations were generally higher at the bottom than at the top site during the 3 years of the study. Leaf N concentrations ranged from 45.4 to 31.4 mg g−1. Leaf P varied from 2.3 to 1.8 mg g−1. Mean N and P RE varied among species, occasionally between top and bottom sites, and were higher in the dry than in the wet years of study. Senesced-leaf nutrient concentrations (i.e., a measure of resorption proficiency) varied from 13.7 to 31.2 mg g−1 (N) and 0.4 to 3.3 mg g−1 (P) among the different species and were generally indicative of incomplete nutrient resorption. Phosphorus concentrations in senesced leaves were higher at the bottom than at the top site and decreased from the wettest to the the driest year. Soil N and P availability were significantly different in the north- and south-facing slopes, but neither nutrient concentrations of mature and senesced leaves nor RE differed between aspects.

The aims of the work are to improve understanding of physiological processes (photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration) of adult trees and stand microclimate, to collect data for simulation of the canopy (stand) photosynthesis and for ecological synthesis of the functioning of the forest ecosystem. In this paper, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in and above the forest are characterized for the fully leaved season, using diurnal courses, vertical profiles and isodiagrams (isopleths). Approximately 50% of incident PAR was absorbed by the upper 4–5 m layer of leaves and only approximately 5% or less penetrated to the forest floor. Vertical gradients of AT and RH were generally low, but large differences in diurnal ranges of AT and RH were observed between vertical levels. The upper leaf canopy greatly reduced WS, and at a height of about 14 m above the ground it was close to zero. The highest diurnal [CO2] maximum and variations occurred at 1 m above the ground, and the lowest above the forest. In “good” light conditions in the forest, the entire leaf canopy (overstorey and understorey canopy) is a large sink of CO2. At night the forest stand is a source of CO2, the largest internal source being the soil and forest floor." .

Karst.] in highly SO2-polluted and heavily damaged forest sites was measured at two different locations in the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge, Krusne Hory) during early summer. The carboxylation efficiency showed a dramatic drop from current-year's needles to 1-year-old needles with only a slight further decrease with increased needle age. The light use efficiency also revealed these characteristics. For both parameters, no linear decrease with needle age could be found. In contrast, the maximum photosynthetic capacity (A2500) decreased linearly with time and revealed a good correlation with the total sulfur content of the needles. Absolute values measured for A2500 were approximately 50% lower than those of comparable trees in the nearby Fichtelgebirge. Mineral deficiencies or acute nutrient imbalances of the needles were not detected. In contrast to the situation in the forests of the Fichtelgebirge, a direct effect of gaseous SO2 on the trees in the Ore Mountains seems plausible." .

This study sought to increase our understanding of throughfall inputs under teak by analyzing the abiotic and biotic factors governing throughfall amounts and ratios in relation to three canopy phenophases (leafless, leafing, and leafed). There was no rain during the brief leaf senescence phenophase in our study. Leveraging detailed field observations, we employed boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis to identify the primary controls on throughfall amount and ratio during each canopy phenophase. Whereas throughfall amounts were always dominated by rainfall magnitude (as expected), throughfall ratios were governed by a suite of predictor variables during each phenophase. The BRT analysis demonstrated that throughfall ratio in the leafless phase was most influenced (in descending order of importance) by air temperature, rainfall amount, maximum wind speed, and rainfall intensity. Throughfall ratio in the leafed phenophase was dominated by rainfall amount. The leafing phenophase was an intermediate case where rainfall amount, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit were most important. Our results highlight the fact that throughfall ratios are differentially influenced by a suite of meteorological variables during each canopy phenophase. Abiotic variables, such as rainfall amount and air temperature, trumped leaf area index and stand density in their effect on throughfall ratio. The leafing phenophase, while transitional in nature and short in duration, has a detectable and unique impact on water inputs to teak plantations. Further work is needed to better understand the biogeochemistry of leaf emergence in teak plantations." .

Each plot had a few ectomycorrhizal hardwoods, mainly Quercus spp. First fruiting was noted under burned P. pungens 3 weeks after a general rain in mid-July and after 4 weeks under both. By the end of November, when fruiting ceased, 138 separable taxa had been collected of which 95 had been identified.

However, quantification of both the mass and nutrient content of CWD within a given environment tends to be a fairly labor-intensive proposition that requires long-term studies to be conducted for viable data to be obtained. As a result, various aspects of CWD in forest ecosystems remain somewhat poorly understood. In this review, we have compiled all available estimates of CWD mass and nutrients from both coniferous and deciduous forests in Korea. The CWD mass data varied substantially by forest type, age, location, and sampling time, ranging from 1.5 to 24.5 Mg ha−1, and for the amount (kg ha−1) of nutrients in the CWD, ranging from 3.5 to 23.6 for nitrogen (N), 0.8 to 4.7 for phosphorus (P), 3.9 to 13.3 for potassium (K), 25.9 to 30.9 for calcium (Ca), 1.4 to 4.2 for magnesium (Mg), and 0.1 to 0.6 for sodium (Na). The mass of CWD transferred from live trees to the forest floor ranged between 0.1 and 4.9 Mg ha−1 year−1, and these values were roughly equivalent to 26–42% of the annual litterfall inputs (2.5–10.8 Mg ha−1 year−1) for mixed Quercus spp. forests within the relevant region. Annual nutrients inputs (kg ha−1 year−1) through CWD decomposition were 0.7–1.6 for N, 0.04–0.3 for P, 0.3–1.0 for K, 1.7–3.1 for Ca, and 0.1–0.3 for Mg. Consequently, these results revealed that the ecological value of CWD for C and nutrient cycling was relatively insignificant. However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted on CWD in different coniferous or mixed deciduous forests in the region. As a direct result of this paucity of data, further long-term studies on CWD mass and nutrients in a variety of forest types are required in order to be able to evaluate accurately the ecological value of CWD on biodiversity and physical properties in Korean forest ecosystems." .

Many of these models are based on a light-use efficiency equation and two-component model of whole-plant growth and maintenance respiration that have been parameterized for distinct vegetation types and biomes. This study was designed to assess the robustness of these parameters for predicting interannual plant growth and carbon exchange, and more specifically to address inconsistencies that may arise during forest disturbances and the loss of canopy foliage. A model based on the MODIS MOD17 algorithm was parameterized for a mature upland hardwood forest by inverting CO2 flux tower observations during years when the canopy was not disturbed. This model was used to make predictions during a year when the canopy was 37% defoliated by forest tent caterpillars. Predictions improved after algorithms were modified to scale for the effects of diffuse radiation and loss of leaf area. Photosynthesis and respiration model parameters were found to be robust at daily and annual time scales regardless of canopy disturbance, and differences between modeled net ecosystem production and tower net ecosystem exchange were only approximately 2 g C m−2 d−1 and less than 23 g C m−2 y−1. Canopy disturbance events such as insect defoliations are common in temperate forests of North America, and failure to account for cyclical outbreaks of forest tent caterpillars in this stand could add an uncertainty of approximately 4–13% in long-term predictions of carbon sequestration." .

I present the results of a 2-year experiment comparing seed predation, seed germination, and seedling survivorship patterns of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata in forest fragments and continuous forest. These empirical results were compared with natural patterns of recruitment in permanent 5,000 m2 demographic plots adjacent to experimental areas. The number of naturally occurring seedlings established in demographic plots was 1.5–6 times greater in continuous forest than it was in 1-ha or 10-ha fragments. This result mirrors the pattern of seedling establishment in experimental transects, in which seeds in fragments were 3–7 times less likely to become established than those in continuous forest. Predation of experimentally sown seeds was extremely low at all sites, and is therefore not responsible for the observed pattern. Instead, reductions in seedling abundance in forest fragments are probably due to lower levels of seed germination. Forest fragments have higher air and soil temperatures, lower relative humidity, and increased leaf-litter accumulation, all of which can alter the cues used to initiate germination. While the growth of seedlings was similar in forest fragments and continuous forest, seedling survivorship in fragments was highly variable. These results suggest that altered environmental conditions may exacerbate reductions in plant recruitment resulting from modified plant-animal interactions. Strategies aimed at reducing the intensity of abiotic edge effects should therefore be incorporated into plant conservation efforts." .

In this study the colour of larch heartwood was studied in relation to extractives and decay resistance, with the aim to estimate durability of larch heartwood from its colour. On a total of 293 trees colour in the CIE L*a*b* space (L* lightness, a* red/green axis, b* yellow/blue axis), extractives content (acetone and hot-water extractives, amount of phenolics) and the brown-rot decay resistance were determined. For calculating the relative decay resistance ( x), mass loss after inoculation for 16 weeks with two fungi [ Coniophora puteana (Schum.ex.Fr.) Karst., Poria placenta (Fr.) Cke, European standard EN 113] of larch heartwood samples was compared to Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L) sapwood reference samples (EN 350-1). Different species [Japanese larch ( Larix kaempferi Lamb.), Hybrid larch (Larix deciduax L. kaempferi) and European larch ( L. decidua Mill.)], provenances and age classes (38-year, >150-year) were included. Japanese larch heartwood turned out to be significantly more reddish (higher a*-values) compared to the European larch provenances. Reddishness of the hybrids was intermediate. The red hue (+a*) was strongly correlated with the amount of phenols ( r =0.84) and decay resistance ( r =0.63) and therefore suitable for prediction of both parameters. The results suggest that colour measurements of larch heartwood could be of benefit in tree breeding programs and for an optimised utilization of larch timber." .

The impact of these outbreaks on the Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) and on the dynamic processes acting in subalpine forest stands are still not well known. Dendroecological methods were used in this study to reconstruct past LBM outbreaks in Susa Valley, Piedmont, Italy. The analysis was carried out on 62 cores from larch and 101 cores from stone pine. The length and severity of each outbreak was quantified for both species and for each tree by means of the programme OUTBREAK. The frequency of the outbreaks was determined using singular spectral analysis and superposed epoch analysis was used to test the significance of the associations between outbreaks and tree-ring growth. In order to verify if trees belonging to different age classes are differently affected by LBM, the reconstructed outbreaks are then classified taking into account the cambial age of the tree at the moment of the outbreak. From 1760 to 1999, 19 outbreaks were recorded in the larch chronologies, while only three outbreaks in the stone pine chronologies. The larch growth is strongly influenced by LBM and the identified outbreaks are equally distributed in all the three age classes. On the stone pine the sporadic occurrence of the identified events made difficult any interpretation of the eventual effect of LBM. Our results lead us to argue that LBM has not played an important role both in determining the stone pine growth rate and in influencing the present observed succession from the stage dominated by larch, to a stage dominated by stone pine or by a mixed stone pine-larch forest." .

We examined the response of suppressed Oregon white oak trees in western Washington, USA, to three levels of release from overtopping Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco). We treated individual oak trees with either full release from competition, partial (“half”) release from competition, or a stand-level thinning of Douglas-fir not directed toward release (control). Five years after treatment, oak trees had suffered no mortality or windthrow. Stem diameter growth was 194% greater in the full-release treatment relative to the control. Acorn production varied widely by year, but in years of higher production, acorn production was significantly greater in both release treatments than in the control. Frequency of epicormic branch formation was significantly increased for years 1 and 2 by the full release; the greatest response occurred between 2 and 6 m above ground level. The greatest number of epicormic branches formed on trees on which the majority of original limbs had died back prior to treatment. Trees with relatively less crown dieback at the time of treatment generally had greater stem growth and acorn production responses to release treatments. Our findings indicate that these released Oregon white oak trees are beginning to recover after an extended period of suppression." .

An E. camaldulensis tree situated in the nature reserve on Lake Massaciuccoli proved to be positive for C. neoformans var. neoformans. This variety was isolated from the leaves, flowers, bark and the debris at the foot of the tree, suggesting that it had colonized the entire tree and that it was capable of developing not only on its usual habitat (bird guano, soil rich with guano) but also on Eucalyptus trees. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by their genomic profiles obtained by random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with the primer (GACA)4.

The smallest occupied patch was 48 ha containing a solitary displaying cock. All patches larger than 1 km2 contained leks. Number of cocks per lek increased with increasing patch size. Number of leks per patch increased in a step-wise manner with one lek added for each 2.5–3 km2 increase in patch size. In large patches there was one lek per 3–5 km2 old forest, and density of lekking cocks was 2–2.5 per km2. In small patches density of cocks varied considerably. Density of cocks was not related to patch isolation or patch shape. However, among leks surrounded by 50–60% old forest within a 1 km radius, number of cocks increased with increasing old forest fine-graininess. We argue that when old forests cover more than 50%, a fine-grained mosaic may support higher densities of lekking cocks than a coarse-grained mosaic. Conversely, when old forests cover less than 50%, a fine-grained mosaic is unfavourable, because each old forest patch becomes too small and isolated. Finally, we present a predictive model of how old forest fragmentation influences density of leks, number of cocks per lek, and total density of cocks." .

In Australian tropical savannas, there has been recent, large-scale implementation of fire management that aims to decrease Kyoto-compliant non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions by reducing late dry season intense fires through strategic early dry season burning. However, there is no accounting for changes to soil C stocks resulting from changes to savanna fire management, although impacts on these pools may be considerable. We present a hypothesis that soil C storage is greatest under low intensity fires with an intermediate fire return interval. Simulations using the CENTURY Soil Organic Matter Model confirmed this hypothesis with greatest soil C storage under a fire regime of one low intensity fire every 5 years. Key areas of uncertainty for CENTURY model simulations include fine root dynamics, charcoal production and nitrogen (N) cycling, and better understanding of these processes could improve model predictions. Soil C stocks measured in the field after 5 years of annual, 3 year and unburned fire treatments were not significantly different (range 41–58 t ha−1), but further CENTURY modelling suggests that changes in fire management will take up to 100 years to have a detectable impact (+4 t ha−1) on soil C stocks. However, implementation of fire management that reduces fire frequency and intensity within the large area of intact savanna landscapes in northern Australia could result in emissions savings of 0.17 t CO2-e ha−1 y−1, four times greater than reductions of non-CO2 emissions." .

The aim of this study was to estimate the dispersal success of forest-dwelling plants from a stand into and along an attached woody corridor, and to explain the observed patterns from the point of view of species’ dispersal traits and corridor properties. We sampled 47 forest–corridor transects in the agricultural landscapes of southeastern Estonia. Regionally common forest-dwelling species (observed in at least 10 % of seed-source forests) were classified on the basis of their ecological response profile—forest-restricted species (F-type) and forest-dwelling generalists (G-type). Species richness and the proportion of F-type species decreased sharply from the seed-source forest core to the forest edge and to the first 10–15 m of the corridor, while G-type species richness remained constant throughout the transect. Corridor structure had a species-specific effect—F species were promoted by old (≥50 years) and wide (≥10 m) corridors, while G species were supported by young and narrow corridors with ditch-related soil disturbances. Moderate shade (canopy cover <75 %) was optimal for all forest-dwelling species. Large dispersule weight, and not seed weight, dispersal vector or Ellenberg’s indicator values, was the trait that differentiated F species from G species. We conclude that most woody corridors are only dispersal stepping-stone habitats for habitat generalist species, and not for specialists. Only century old corridors can relieve the dispersal limitation of forest-restricted species." .

Paleoecological records indicate the importance of such relationships in Minnesota’s Big Woods (BW) region, where isolated hardwood forest populations expanded to regional dominance after AD 1250. We used LANDIS-II to model the BW forest expansion, and conducted simulation experiments that isolated the important ecological factors in this regional change. In our simulations, BW forest expanded at approximately 15 m per year to achieve regional dominance within 600 years, which is comparable to empirical records. The distribution of the BW depended on the locations of scattered pre-existing tree populations that were sheltered from previous severe fire regimes by firebreaks. During the simulated spread of the tree populations, however, the presence or absence of firebreaks did not further influence vegetation pattern. When we assumed a fire rotation of 10–13 years in grasslands/woodlands and more than 400 years in BW, the feedback between fire-resistant BW fuels and fire severity caused fire severity to decline in a time frame consistent with sedimentary data. In our simulations, seed dispersal from core initial populations caused forest expansion, changed fuel loads, and thus reduced fire severity—not the other way around as has been commonly proposed. Forest expansion was slowed by fire, but species’ life history attributes, namely seed dispersal distances and maturity ages, asynchronous successional dynamics across many stands, and landscape history were at least as important in the temporal and spatial patterns of the regional response to climate change." .

The experiment was conducted at Embrapa Cerrados, Planaltina-DF, in a Red Oxisol, between February 2012 and April 2014, following the transition of crop to livestock, which began in March 2012, with the sowing of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã, intercropped with sorghum. The experimental design was a randomized block with three replications. The treatments were: cultivated area intercropped with rows of Eucalyptus, spaced 2 × 2 m between plants and 22 m between rows (ICLF); and an area cultivated without tree species (ICL), and also two adjacent reference areas: native Cerrado and continuous pasture. N2O productions were characterized by fluxes below 20 μg N m−2 h−1. The ICL system had the highest cumulative flux with 2.84 kg N ha−1, while the ICLF system obtained cumulative fluxes of 2.05 kg N ha−1. The native Cerrado showed a negative balance, with –0.05 kg N ha−1. The dry season was mostly characterized by low N2O fluxes ranging between 10 μg N m−2 h−1 and negative values, whereas higher N2O fluxes were observed after precipitation events, especially those following a long drought period. The water filled pore space was the factor that best explained N2O fluxes, but higher fluxes were observed after the application of nitrogen fertilizer. There was a positive correlation between microbial biomass carbon and N2O fluxes in the ICL and ICLF systems." .

We tested whether pioneer species feature high hydraulic conductance allowing them to use water profusely at leaf level. Conversely, forest species may have relatively low hydraulic conductance accompanied with better control over water use. This may lead in turn to pioneer species being at a relatively higher risk of shoot water potential falling below the threshold value at which cavitations occur compared to forest. Specific hydraulic conductance (K s) measured during the wet season was comparable between pioneers and forest species. During drought, K s was significantly reduced, and species of both plant groups responded to this by modifying the relationship between conducting area and leaf area (Huver value), such that leaf specific conductivity (K l) was unaffected. Thus, leaf area seemed to be adjusted to maintain constant hydraulic sufficiency during drought. Pioneer species were more efficient in conducting water to their leaves but had low control over water use compared to forest species. A trade-off between water transport and leaf water use efficiency was suggested. These ecophysiological differences may have an impact on the performance of the species occupying contrasting habitats. Nonetheless, drought-induced embolisms occurred in trees growing in both open and forest habitats. Overall, during drought, adjustment of leaf area occurred in order to maintain a homeostasis of some physiological traits (leaf-specific conductivity and carbon assimilation)." .

This study reports on the nutrient and organic matter content of the forest floor of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest during different seasons and attempts to correlate results from studies of vegetation, litter, decomposition, stemflow, throughfall, and soil. An organic matter budget is presented for an undisturbed watershed. Average weight of the forest floor on an undisturbed watershed ranged from 25,500 to 85,500 kg/ha. The weighted watershed average was 46,800 kg/ha. Although the F and H horizons did not vary significantly with time, the L horizon increased significantly during the period June to August largely as a result of a severe hail storm. The order of abundance of elements in the forest floor was Nτ;Ca≷Fe>S>P>Mn>K>Mg>Na>Zn>Cu. The concentrations of Ca, K, and Mn decreased with depth in the forest floor while N, P, S, Na, Fe, Zn, and Cu concentrations increased. N:P ratios were similar in decomposing leaf tissue, the forest floor, litterfall, and net stemflow plus throughfall suggesting a similar pattern of cycling. S was proportional to N and P in decomposing leaf tissue, the forest floor, and litterfall. Net stemflow and throughfall were affected by a relatively large input of SO4=-S from the atmosphere. Residence times for elements in the forest floor were affected by inputs other than litterfall (precipitation, stemflow, and throughfall). Calculation of residence times using all inputs caused smaller values than if litterfall alone was used. While all residence times were reduced, the major differences occurred for K, S, and Na. N and P showed relatively long residence times as a result of retranslocation and immobilization by decomposers. The slow turnover rate because of the strong demand and retention by all biota must account for the efficiency of the intrasystem cycling process for N and P. K showed the shortest residence time. A rapid and efficient uptake of K by vegetation seems to account for the efficient cycling of this element. The patterns of nutrient cycling are several depending on the chemical properties of the forest floor, and nutritional requirements of the biota." .

Climate, land use, and forest cover changes all impact stream DOM and alter biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial environments. We determined the temporal variation in DOM quantity and quality in headwater streams at a reference watershed (REF), a watershed clear-cut 30 years ago (CC), and a watershed converted to a white pine plantation 50 years ago (WP) at the US Forest Service, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, in the Nantahala Mountains of western North Carolina, USA. Average stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in CC or WP were 60 and 80% of those in REF, respectively. Stream DOM composition showed that the difference was mainly due to changes in humic-like components in chromophoric DOM. In addition, excitation–emission matrix fluorescence data with parallel factor analysis indicate that although the concentration of protein-like components did not differ significantly among watersheds, their relative abundance showed an enrichment in CC and WP compared to REF. The ratio of humic acid-type to fulvic acid-type components was highest and lowest at REF and WP, respectively. Our data suggest that forest ecosystem disturbance history affects the DOM quantity and quality in headwater streams over decades as a result of changes in watershed soil organic matter characteristics due to differences in organic matter inputs." .

We transplanted seedlings of the canopy tree species, Dipteryx panamensis, Virola koschnyii, and Brosimum alicastrum into second-growth forest and native tree plantations at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We assessed seedling survival, growth, and seedling light environments bimonthly for 14 months. Plants were harvested at the end of the study to assess leaf area, total biomass, biomass partitioning and root growth. Survivorship of all species exceeded 60% across all microsites, although both D. panamensis and B. alicastrum had lower probabilities of survival in the darkest microsites. All species showed a strong positive relationship between light availability and growth, increasing in total biomass as light increased. However, the strength of the growth response differed among species causing a change in the rank order of species growth rates as light availability increased. Although D. panamensis showed the lowest growth rates in the darkest microsites, a strong response to increasing light led to a cross-over in performance, such that D. panamensis had the highest growth rate at the highest light levels studied. These data suggest that resource gradient partitioning could occur even in low light environments (0.2–6.5%). Given the limited range of light regimes sampled (i.e., non-gap microsites), our data demonstrate that growth of tropical tree seedlings beneath closed canopies is highly sensitive to light availability and that shade-tolerant species vary in these responses. Our results show that understory light heterogeneity, in the absence of canopy gaps, can significantly affect recruitment processes for shade-tolerant tree species." .

Compound disturbances by insect herbivores can cause sharp transitions between vegetation states with implications for ecosystem productivity and climate feedbacks. By analysing vegetation plots prior to and immediately after a severe and widespread outbreak by geometrid moths in the birch forest-tundra ecotone, we document a shift in forest understorey community composition in response to the moth outbreak. Prior to the moth outbreak, the plots divided into two oligotrophic and one eutrophic plant community. The moth outbreak caused a vegetation state shift in the two oligotrophic communities, but only minor changes in the eutrophic community. In the spatially most widespread communities, oligotrophic dwarf shrub birch forest, dominance by the allelopathic dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, was effectively broken and replaced by a community dominated by the graminoid Avenella flexuosa, in a manner qualitatively similar to the effect of wild fires in E. nigrum communities in coniferous boreal forest further south. As dominance by E. nigrum is associated with retrogressive succession the observed vegetation state shift has widespread implications for ecosystem productivity on a regional scale. Our findings reveal that the impact of moth outbreaks on the northern boreal birch forest system is highly initial-state dependent, and that the widespread oligotrophic communities have a low resistance to such disturbances. This provides a case for the notion that climate impacts on arctic and northern boreal vegetation may take place most abruptly when conveyed by changed dynamics of irruptive herbivores." .

Rhus seedling density is higher under big burned pine trees and also near the burned trunks. Seedlings of Pinus, Cistus and Rhus growing under the burned canopy of big pine trees tend to be taller than seedlings under small ones or outside the burned canopy. Most annual species germinate and establish themselves outside the burned canopies, and only a few annual species are found beneath them. It is suggested that variation in the heat of the fire, in the amount of ash between burned pine trees of different sizes, and in the distance from the burned canopy are responsible for the observed pattern of seedling distribution. The possible ecological significance of the spatial pattern of seedlings distribution and their differential growth rate are discussed." .

This study analyzes spatial and temporal changes in land use and forest cover patterns in a typical mountain forest area in Rize Forest Enterprise of the Northeastern part of Turkey. The area is investigated by evaluated the temporal changes of spatial structure of forest conditions through spatial analysis of forest cover type maps from 1984 and 2007 using GIS and FRAGSTATS™. The quantative evidences presented here showed that there were drastic changes in the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use/forest cover. As an overall change between 1984 and 2007, there was a net decrease of 2.30% in total forested areas. On one hand, productive forest areas decreased 12,506 ha, on the other hand, degraded forest areas increased 14,805 ha. In examining the changes of crown closure and development stages of forest ecosystem during the study period, the forest stand area with medium crown closures increased. Regenerated area increased while the other development stages were left to grow to mature development stages in the period. These results regarding to crown closure and development stage showed that forest quality has increased but total forest areas decreased. This is partially due to out-migration of rural population in Rize and Çayeli towns. In terms of spatial configuration, analysis of the metrics revealed that landscape structure in Study area had changed substantially over the 23-year study period, resulting in fragmentation of the landscape as indicated by the large patch numbers and the smaller mean patch sizes due to heavy timber subtraction, illegal cutting, and uncontrolled stand treatments." .

The proportion of juvenile to total foliage and growth was measured at the end of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year from establishment. Between the ages of 2 and 4 years annual stem volume increment increased in proportion to the amount of juvenile foliage retained. By age 4 years, stem volume of trees of the juvenile persistent form was significantly larger than that of the early adult form. Increasing differences in height growth with age between provenances, which were highly significant across sites by age 4, contributed to these differences in performance. There was some evidence that the largest trees of the juvenile-persistent form were those which combined mature foliage above juvenile foliage for the longest period during the transition from juvenile to mature foliage. In the early-adult form the largest trees were those which completed the transition to mature foliage rapidly. There was no difference in the ratio of foliage mass to basal area between the two forms. It is suggested that the faster growth of the juvenile-persistent form is related to higher leaf area index and not to foliage type. A provenance ofE. globulus which had a higher retention of juvenile foliage at age 4 than a second provenance had a lower stem volume, thus indicating that in this species early growth rate is not determined by foliage type." .

Forest carbon (C) dynamics in these ecosystems are affected during insect outbreaks because millions of square kilometers of forest suffer growth loss and mortality. We tested the hypothesis that a spruce budworm outbreak similar to those in the past could switch a forest from a C sink to a source in the near future. We used a model of ecosystem C to integrate past spruce budworm impact sequences with current forest management data on 106,000 km2 of forest in eastern Québec. Spruce budworm-caused mortality decreased stand-level merchantable C stocks by 11–90% and decreased ecosystem C stocks by 2–10% by the end of the simulation. For the first 13 years (2011–2024), adding spruce budworm significantly reduced ecosystem C stock change for the landscape from a sink (4.6 ± 2.7 g C m−2 y−1 in 2018) to a source (−16.8 ± 3.0 g C m−2 y−1 in 2018). This result was mostly due to reduced net primary production. The ecosystem stock change was reduced on average by 2 Tg C y−1 for the entire simulated area. This study provides the first estimate that spruce budworm can significantly affect the C sink or source status of a large landscape. These results indicate that reducing spruce budworm impacts on timber may also provide an opportunity to mitigate a C source." .

Laccaria proxima tended to improve the container growth of Japanese black pine and white spruce, and significantly improved that of jack pine, mugo pine, black spruce, red spruce and Douglasfir. The growth of red pine and Japanese larch were only slightly improved with L. proxima. Pulp waste (33% by volume) had negative effects on tree seedling growth, except for Douglasfir (no significant effect). The interactions of Laccaria proxima and pulp waste varied; the hosts were significantly positive (P<0.01) in the case of jack pine and black spruce, but there was no significant effect for the rest. Negative effects were found with Japanese black pine. Use of pulp waste in seedling production of jack pine, black spruce, mugo pine, red spruce and Douglasfir inoculated with L. proxima and of Japanese black pine both with and without L. proxima is feasible, but further research is necessary to determine the optimal percentage of pulp waste that can be utilized in seedling production of tree species and the field performance of these seedlings." .

Gokurakuji (693 m a.s.l.), 30 km west of Hiroshima city, west Japan, was studied. The effects of air pollution and acid deposition on the physiological characteristics of the trees, especially those of the needles, were investigated. Ozone concentration was not correlated with the physiological status of the needles and SO2 concentration was not high in the declined area. NO2 concentration correlated negatively with needle longevity while it correlated positively with ethylene emission from 1-year-old needles. Average needle longevity was about 2.8 years in non-declined areas; however the longevity was 1.3 years in the most polluted area. The minimal fluorescence at night (F 0)of 1-year-old needles decreased with increasing NO2 concentration. The maximum stomatal conductance (gl), net photosynthesis (P n)and intercellular CO2 concentration (C i) in the declined areas were lower than in the non- declined areas (about 50%, 30% and 20% lower, respectively). The lower C isuggested that the major part of the decrease in P ncan be explained by stomatal restriction. The soil pH, N content and C/N ratio showed no significant difference between the declined and non-declined areas. The physiological disorders of needles were due to the damage by air pollutants, and important roles of NO2 are suggested. Lowering of P n and the shortening of needle longevity appear to be the main causes of the decline in pines in the forest decline area." .

The 1973 energy crisis has caused the wood industry to focus its attention on the necessity of adhesive self-sufficiency. Research in the use of bark, pulp waste liquor and foliage for adhesive application is rapidly spreading. In addition, many new adhesives have been proposed by the chemical industry as alternatives for wood bonding. Recently developed physiochemical analytical methods have been successfully applied to this adhesive research area and to durability evaluation. However, there are still enormous difficulties in developing a durable natural product adhesive of low variability as well as a unified international interpretation of bond durability. Phenolic resins have weathered the energy crisis and are gaining importance in the industry. Some examples of recent contributions from phenolic-resin research to panel board and lumber end-joint developments will be discussed in detail." .

This paper presents preliminary results that help narrow these gaps. In conjunction with leaf area index (LAI) field campaigns we undertook measurements with an array of 7 broad-band (ca 40 nm) sensors covering the range 0.40–0.94 μm, plus 1 sensor for UVB (0.297 μm peak) and 1 for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Measurements focused on inside-forest shade conditions at sites 0 to ca 15 km from the Black Sea and at altitudes up to ca 120 m above sea level. Some of the sites were also studied using a high-resolution spectroradiometer. A sequential measuring strategy was necessary. This involves potentially large uncertainties, here addressed through estimations of the variability around the sinusoidal course of daylight. Light-quality regimes were found to be in general support of earlier studies of deciduous forests. Our data from the broad-band sensors and from the spectroradiometer are mutually supportive. They indicate a stronger red-shift below Q.f. canopies than below canopies in enclaves dominated by Fagus orientalis and Pinus sylvestris. Transmission in the range 0.50–0.55 μm increases beneath the three types of canopies, most pronounced in the Q.f. case. Analysis of relationships between the inside-forest to open-field irradiance ratio and LAI supports the use of Beer’s Law. We found a fairly strong relationship between the red (0.66 μm) to far-red (0.73 μm) irradiance ratios (R/FR) and LAI for the Q.f. forest. In quantitative terms, the result is new for this Q.f. region, and suggests further research to explore whether a two-sensor approach (0.66 and 0.73 μm) might offer possibilities for further low-cost mapping of the spatio-temporal patterns of R/FR and LAI in Strandzha. Such mapping would assist in further studies of the region’s forest biogeochemistry and vitality." .

The test solutions were prepared as 20% essential oil in ethanol and positive control as 20% DEET in ethanol. Essential oil blend was prepared as 5% concentration. Nulliparous, 3–5-day-old female adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were used for repellency screening as per ICMR protocol. The study showed that the repellency of 20% essential oil of O. sanctum, M. piperita and P. amboinicus were comparable with that of the standard DEET (20%) as no mosquito landing on the test was observed up to 6 h. The E. globulus oil exhibited mosquito repellency only upto 1½ h. Considerable mosquito landing and feeding was displayed in negative control. In the case of the oil blend, no landing of mosquitoes was seen up to 6 h as that of positive control. The results showed that the essential oil blend from O. sanctum, M. piperita, E. globulus and P. amboinicus could repel Ae. aegypti mosquitoes or prevent from feeding as in the case of DEET even at a lower concentration of 5%.

A total of 30 trees were harvested to determine if these relationships were different in different crown zones and in trees growing with and without competition for light. Two methods were compared. In the first, data were accumulated from crown zones situated at the top of trees to the bottom; in the second, data were used from individual crown zones. The results indicated that the latter method is much more sensitive in detecting differences in the relationship of leaf biomass or leaf area to conductive area. The analysis also indicated that ratios such as leaf area/sapwood area are frequently size-dependent. This size-dependency can in some cases result in the differences being abscured, but more often leads to the false impression that the relationship between the variables changes. The relationship between leaf biomass and leaf area and conductive area of stems or branches was different in different crown zones and under different growth conditions. The slopes of these regressions appear to increase with decreasing transpirational demand and decrease with increasing hydraulic conductivity. The intercepts are probably related to the amount of identified sapwood actually involved in water conductance." .

D. Don, trees with crown tops affected by dieback in isolated urban forests on the low altitude plain. To clarify future growth of C. japonica in these forests, we investigated their growth, decline levels and water status. The live crown-top heights from the ground (LCTHs) per diameter at breast height (dbh) were lower in forests with C. japonica top dieback than in forests with no top dieback. Furthermore, in a forest with C. japonica top dieback, the LCTHs were similar between trees although dbh and decline levels were different. Moreover, water status near the top of the live foliage was very similar although decline levels were different, suggesting that in urban forests, where C. japonica top dieback is observed, the LCTH is subject of restriction. A sudden increase in temperatures since the 1980s may be restricting the LCTHs of C. japonica in urban forests. We conclude that LCTHs of C. japonica in urban forests are becoming lower and more equal in each forest. If temperature continues to increase, height restriction will become more severe and LCTHs of C. japonica in urban forests will become even lower." .

The trees responded toConotrachelus, which destroyed half the nut crop, by aborting inviable nuts during the summer. The seed dispersers, mostly gray squirrels, removed fallen nuts rapidly, showing the ability to distinguish viable nuts and remove them preferentially. The number of nuts removed in a week varies directly with the number available, and removal rate increases when many viable nuts are falling. The death of most seeds before dispersal, and the squirrels' efficiency at foraging on nuts and recovering them after burial, imply that successful hickory reproduction takes place only in years of heavy nut production." .

Branchwood surface area, in particular, has significant implications for many ecophysiological processes including total respiration and interception of radiation and rainfall. Branch surface area was estimated at the branch-, tree-, and stand-level for 33 Douglas-fir (Pseduotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) plantations in the Oregon Coast Range. Patterns in WAI, leaf area index (LAI; total surface area of needles per unit of land area), tree area index (TAI=WAI+LAI) and various ratios of these dimensions were then investigated. The main axes of primary branches (those attached to the main stem) comprised 82±13% of total branchwood surface area. Tree surface area (needles + woody tissue) increased with increasing tree size and crown length, and decreased with greater intensity of Swiss needle cast (SNC). At the stand-level, woody surface area increased with greater stand density and decreased with more severe SNC, but on average it constituted 29±12% of total tree surface area. Branchwood surface area and bole surface area contributed equally to WAI. The variation in WAI for a given LAI has important implications for radiation and rainfall attenuation in these stands and for accurate partitioning of intercepted radiation between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues." .

A statistical analysis of 2140 forest stands in south-eastern Tasmania indicates that the mixed-species stands of E. tenuiramis and E. obliqua occupy and environmental space intermediate to that of pure stands of either species. Detailed examination of one such mixed-species stand showed that local-scale variation in soil depth could make the environment similar to that of pure stands and that this soil depth variation was correlated with the abundance of each species in the local area. Examination of another mixed-species stand over the first 15 years of development demonstrated that local-scale variation in soil depth did not affect the probability of establishment of either species. However, within 2 or 3 years of establishment plants were large enough to explore the full soil volume and soil depth became a significant factor in species performance. Logistic regression modelling indicated that threshold values of drought stress for species changeover at the broad geographical scale, due to variation in mean annual climate, were the same as those correlated with local-scale patches of species that occurred as a result of variations in soil depth. Finally, the photosynthetic performance and leaf-area production of plants in mixed-species plantings and monoculture across artificially induced gradients of water supply were examined. Differences in species response to drought-stress provided a physiological explanation of the growth performance of each species at different levels of resource supply." .

Due to dry deposition and retention by other canopy elements, the actual uptake and assimilation by the tree canopy is often obscured in throughfall studies. In this study, 15N-labeled solutions ($$ ^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ and $$ ^{15} {\\text{NO}}_{3}^{ - } $$) were used to assess dissolved inorganic N retention by leaves/needles and twigs of European beech, pedunculate oak, silver birch, and Scots pine saplings. The effects of N form, tree species, leaf phenology, and applied $$ {\\text{NO}}_{3}^{ - } $$ to $$ {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ ratio on the N retention were assessed. Retention patterns were mainly determined by foliar uptake, except for Scots pine. In twigs, a small but significant 15N enrichment was detected for $$ {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$, which was found to be mainly due to physicochemical adsorption to the woody plant surface. The mean $$ {{^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } } \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } } {^{15} {\\text{NO}}_{3}^{ - } }}} \\right. \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace} {^{15} {\\text{NO}}_{3}^{ - } }} $$ retention ratio varied considerably among species and phenological stadia, which indicates that the use of a fixed ratio in the canopy budget model could lead to an over- or underestimation of the total N retention. In addition, throughfall water under each branch was collected and analyzed for $$ ^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$, $$ ^{15} {\\text{NO}}_{3}^{ - } $$, and all major ions. Net throughfall of $$ ^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ was, on average, 20 times higher than the actual retention of $$ ^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ by the plant material. This difference in $$ ^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ retention could not be attributed to pools and fluxes measured in this study. The retention of $$ ^{15} {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ was correlated with the net throughfall of K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and weak acids during leaf development and the fully leafed period, while no significant relationships were found for $$ ^{15} {\\text{NO}}_{3}^{ - } $$ retention. This suggests that the main driving factors for $$ {\\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ retention might be ion exchange processes during the start and middle of the growing season and passive diffusion at leaf senescence. Actual assimilation or abiotic uptake of N through leaves and twigs was small in this study, for example, 1–5% of the applied dissolved 15N, indicating that the impact of canopy N retention from wet deposition on forest productivity and carbon sequestration is likely limited." .

In addition to measures to reduce the input of atmospheric deposition, removal of the ectorganic layers by sod-cutting may contribute to the recovery of the soil ecosystem. In this study, we examined the effects of sod-cutting on the nematode fauna of a Scots pine forest, 1 and 3 years after treatment. Sod-cutting reduced the total numbers of nematodes, nematode taxa, and Maturity Index. The first taxa that colonized the newly developing organic layers after sod-cutting had low colonizer-persister (c-p) values, and appeared to have originated from the tree canopy and mineral soil. Colonization, presumably from nearby untreated plots, was observed 3 years after the sod-cutting. The initial (after 1 year) nematode community of the new organic layer comprised hyphal-, bacterial-, and algal-feeding nematodes, whereas plant-feeders, predators, and omnivores were not detected. The composition of the nematode fauna in the ectorganic layers 15 and 39 months after sod-cutting was highly similar to that of the nematode fauna of the early stages of a primary succession of Scots pine forest in a reference area in the Netherlands. In the mineral soil only insect parasites were negatively affected by sod-cutting." .

In the present study, we estimated various distributional changes of vegetation under different climate-change scenarios in the 21st century. Both hypothetical scenarios and Hedley RCM scenarios show that the transitional vegetation types, such as shrubland and grassland, have higher sensitivity to climatic change compared to vegetation under extreme climatic conditions, such as the evergreen broadleaf forest or desert, barren lands. Mainly, the sensitive areas in China lie in the Tibetan Plateau, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, northeastern plain of China and eco-zones between different vegetations. As the temperature increases, mixed forests and deciduous broadleaf forests will shift towards northern China. Grassland, shrubland and wooded grassland will extend to southeastern China.

Allometric relationships of projected needle area with different tree characteristics showed that stem diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height and crown depth were reliable predictors of projected needle area at the tree level. The allometric relationships between DBH and projected needle area at the tree level were used to predict stand-level needle area and estimate LAI.

Although simplification of communities across space is often significant at larger scales, it could also occur at the local scale by changing biotic interactions. This study aimed to elucidate local community processes driving biotic homogenization of soil faunal communities, and the possibility of biotic re-differentiation. We recorded species of oribatid mites in litter and soil layers along a gradient of forest conversion from monoculture larch plantation to primary forests in central Japan. We collected data for functional traits of the recorded species to quantify functional diversity. Then we quantified their taxonomic/functional turnover. Litter diversity was reduced in the larch-dominated stands, leading to habitat homogenization. Consequently, litter communities were biologically homogenized and differentiated in the plantations and in the natural forest, respectively. Turnover of functional traits for litter communities was lower and higher than expected by chance in the plantations and in the natural stand, respectively. This result suggests that the dominant assembly process shifts from limiting similarity to habitat filtering along the forest restoration gradient. However, support for such niche-based explanations was not observed for communities in the soil layer. In the monocultures, functional diversity expected from a given regional species pool significantly decreased for litter communities but not for those in the soil layer. Such discrepancy between communities in different layers suggests that communities more exposed to anthropogenic stresses are more vulnerable to the loss of their functional roles. Our study explains possible community processes behind the observed patterns of biological organization, which can be potentially useful in guiding approaches for restoring biodiversity." .

Forty-two sporocarp collections in five genera (Anthracobia, Morchella, Peziza, Scutellinia, Tricharina) of post-fire Pezizales produced ten restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types.

Large, replicated plots were burned at different times of the year, and flowering on each plot was measured over the twelve months following fire. While fire season had little effect on the number of species flowering during the year following fire, fires during the growing season decreased average flowering duration per species and increased synchronization of peak flowering times within species relative to fires between growing seasons. Fires during the growing season also increased the dominance of fall flowering forbs and delayed peak fall flowering. Differences in flowering resulting from variation in fire season were related to seasonal changes in the morphology of clonal forbs, especially fall-flowering composites. Community level differences in flowering phenologies indicated that timing of fire relative to environmental cues that induced flowering was important in determining flowering synchrony among species within the ground cover of longleaf pine forests. Differences in fire season produced qualitatively similar effects on flowering phenologies in both habitats, indicating plant responses to variation in the timing of fires were not habitat specific." .

We investigated if, after a high-severity fire, changes in tree-ring growth can be observed, as well as changes in the nitrogen and carbon isotope composition of tree rings of surviving trees. Two wildfires that occurred in Pinus sylvestris L. stands in Northern Italy, one at the beginning and one at the end of the vegetative season, were chosen as the focus of this study. After the fires, the surviving trees showed growth suppression with very narrow tree rings or locally absent rings. The carbon isotope ratio was more negative in tree rings formed in the 5 years following fire, indicating better water supply in a situation of less competition. The nitrogen isotope ratio followed opposite trends in the two wildfire stands. In trees cored in the stand where the fire happened at the beginning of the vegetative season, there was no change in the nitrogen isotope ratio, whereas in samples collected in the other fire site, higher nitrogen isotope ratios were observed in the tree rings formed after the fire, reflecting changes in the soil nitrogen supply. Modifications in the growth and isotope composition of the fire-stressed trees disappeared from 6 to 10 years after the fire. By studying trees before and after fire, we were able to show that fire affects not only the growth of surviving trees, but also their physiological processes." .

A large part of the forest dieback is thought to have resulted from insect defoliation and adverse climatic conditions, particularly drought, which took place in the early 1980's. However these factors alone do not seem to account for all symptoms of the current forest decline. Repeated samplings and analyses of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) foliage in the Quebec Appalachians since 1983 has revealed the occurrence of severe nutrient imbalances, particularly very low K and P concentrations on several sites. More recently, Mg deficiency was found to be associated with declining sugar maple stands in the Lower Laurentians. Appropriate fertilizer applications have restored adequate nutrition of sugar maple during the first three or four years of observation. Disturbed nutrition is discussed in the context of forest nutrient cycling." .

Besides their theoretical interest, understanding of self-thinning is important for forest practice because it produces estimates of stand density and stocking. There is a considerable diversity of views on the processes causing self-thinning, predicting variables, and analytical form of models. The most popular model was proposed by Reineke (J Agric Res 46(7):627–638, 1933) over 70 years ago. This study compares existing models of self-thinning and provides evidence that the virtually unknown model developed by Artur Nilson describes self-thinning more realistically than Reineke’s. While in the Reineke model the rate of mortality (the slope of self-thinning line) is assumed to be constant, it changes from 0 to −2 in Nilson’s model. As a result, Nilson’s model is slightly but consistently more accurate than Reineke’s. Although both models are empirical, their analysis suggests several general conclusions about self-thinning." .

Land use history is an important factor when choosing suitable habitat, and lands with non-ectomycorrhizal host species are recommended when introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in order to reduce competition from native, soil-borne ectomycorrhizal (ECM) inoculum. Nearly every year Mediterranean wildfires cause the loss of forested lands where soil and climatic characteristics are suitable for truffle cultivation. Introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings in these sites could promote reforestation with a native ECM fungus and, in addition, may provide economic incentives. We tested the viability of burnt forest lands for truffle cultivation by introducing T. melanosporum-inoculated Quercus ilex seedlings in burnt forest sites with and without resprouting forest species which act as repositories for native ECM fungi. We also evaluated the role of the ECM host plants, which resprout after a forest fire, in the maintenance and dynamic processes of the ECM fungal community. The study followed a factorial design with two levels: (1) T. melanosporum-inoculated and non-inoculated Q. ilex seedlings and (2) presence and absence of ECM host plants resprouting after the fire. We established 10 experimental plots with 360 holm oaks. After four and a half years, the truffle-inoculated holm oaks maintained 36 % of their root tips colonized with T. melanosporum, and 10 years after plantations, 26.2 % of the surviving inoculated holm oaks displayed a “truffle burn” area. A greater ECM morphotype richness was associated with seedlings planted in plots with the presence of ECM host plants, whereas the T. melanosporum mycorrhizal ratio was constant. These results suggest that reforestation with T. melanosporum-inoculated seedlings can be successful following forest fires and highlights the competitiveness of this fungus within the ECM community in these soils." .

In this study, we characterized the spatial patterns in phenological variations in eight contrasting forest types in an Indian region using coarse resolution NOAA AVHRR satellite data. The onset, offset and growing season length for different forest types has been estimated using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Further, the relationship between NDVI and climatic parameters has been assessed to determine which climatic variable (temperature or precipitation) best explain variation in NDVI. In addition, we also assessed how quickly and over what time periods does NDVI respond to different precipitation events. Our results suggested strong spatial variability in NDVI metrics for different forest types. Among the eight forest types, tropical dry deciduous forests showed lowest values for summed NDVI (SNDVI), averaged NDVI (ANDVI) and integrated NDVI (I-NDVI), while the tropical wet evergreen forests of Arunachal Pradesh had highest values. Within the different evergreen forest types, SNDVI, ANDVI and INDVI were highest for tropical wet evergreen forests, followed by tropical evergreen forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests and were least for tropical dry evergreen forests. Differences in the amplitude of NDVI were quite distinct for evergreen forests compared to deciduous ones and mixed deciduous forests. Although, all the evergreen forests studied had a similar growing season length of 270 days, the onset and offset dates were quite different. Response of vegetative greenness to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and forest types. Linear correlations between mean monthly NDVI and temperature were found to yield negative relationships in contrast to precipitation, which showed a significant positive response to vegetation greenness. The correlations improved much for different forest types when the log of cumulative rainfall was correlated against mean monthly NDVI. Of the eight forest types, the NDVI for six forest types was positively correlated with the logarithm of cumulative rainfall that was summed for 3–4 months. Overall, this study identifies precipitation as a major control for vegetation greenness in tropical forests, more so than temperature." .

Because spatial relationships among planted trees are fundamental to a Nelder wheel, a researcher needs a specific set of layout parameters to establish a Nelder plot. While Nelder (Biometrics 18:283–307, 1962) provides calculus-based equations for determining the required layout parameters, the presentation focuses on derivation of these equations and not their application to forestry research. Other authors have outlined the design of Nelder plots for forestry research, but have done so using trigonometry-based equations. Existence of two layout methodologies in the literature is a source of confusion. In this paper, we present a straightforward means to determine the design parameters critical to the establishment of Nelder plots used within tree density research. The layout equations presented are expressed in terms that allow applied forestry researchers to easily answer the following question. Given the number and range of tree densities I want to evaluate, what are the required Nelder wheel layout parameters? Finally, we provide a step-by-step example of the design and installation of a Nelder plot for a scenario familiar to tree density research and discuss analysis of Nelder wheel experiments." .

AbstractForest ecosystems accumulate large amounts of carbon in living tissues. The residence time of this carbon in the ecosystem depends largely on the turnover time of these tissues, which can be estimated as a surrogate of the ratio of biomass to net primary production (B:NPP). We used a global forest database of 310 sites containing data for biomass stocks and NPP to investigate the differences of B:NPPs among species and forest compartments and to determine B:NPPs main exogenous (mainly climate and nutrient availability) and endogenous (leaf habit and stand age) drivers. We used asymptotic exponential functions to adjust the B:NPPs of woody compartments to a theoretical stationary state to allow comparisons between forests of different ages. The B:NPPs of woody tissues (branches, stems, and coarse roots) were positively influenced by stand age, conversely to fine roots and leaves, which were weakly dependent on the age of the forest. The B:NPPs of woody tissues were positively correlated with nutrient availability, whereas fine-root B:NPPs decreased with increasing nutrient availability. The foliar B:NPP of evergreen forests was positively correlated with water deficit, and the fine-root B:NPP was correlated positively with the seasonality of precipitation and with annual thermal amplitude but negatively with water deficit. Our results support the influence of climate on the B:NPPs of non-woody compartments and identify nutrient availability as the main influence on the B:NPPs of woody tissues." .

The macroscopic indicators of Norway spruce crown status, as well as branch structure transformation, were proposed to reconstruct the retrospective stress response of a tree to stress conditions over a 30-year period. Based on crown defoliation and the proportion of secondary shoots, five categories of tree response to stress factors were introduced: resistant trees (crown defoliation ≤35%, secondary shoots ≤65%); resilient trees (crown defoliation ≤35%, secondary shoots >65%); susceptible moderately transformed trees (crown defoliation >35%, secondary shoots ≤65%); susceptible strongly transformed trees (crown defoliation >35%, 65% < secondary shoots ≤90%); and exhausted trees to the environment (crown defoliation >35%, secondary shoots >90%). These stress response categories are discussed assuming a sink/source relationship on carbohydrate allocation. The relationship between stress response categories and current regenerative processes in the crown, assessed by macroscopic markers on bud development and shoot growth, is outlined. The research has been carried out mainly in three permanent research plots of old autochthonous Norway spruce forest stands in the Krkonoše Mts. (Czech Republic) under different historical stress loads." .

AbstractA better understanding of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) dynamics in trees under drought stress is critical to elucidate the mechanisms underlying forest decline and tree mortality that result from extended periods of drought. We performed a continuous controlled drought pot experiment from May 14 to September 7, 2013 using Robinia pseudoacacia saplings under 14, 10, 8, and 6 % soil water content that represented the absence of drought (AD), moderate drought (MD), severe drought (SD), and very severe drought (VSD) stress, respectively. Growth, leaf gas exchange, and NSC concentrations in different sapling tissues were measured once a month. The results showed that net photosynthetic rates and the relative increments of basal diameter and height decreased with the intensification of drought stress. Saplings showed lower starch and NSC concentrations and higher soluble sugar concentrations and ratios of sugars to starch only under SD and VSD. The concentrations of starch and NSC were significantly decreased under SD and VSD solely in branches and stems at the end of the growing season. Our results indicated that the timescale of physiological processes plays an important role in NSC dynamics, and that only severe drought stress significantly decreases NSC concentrations, and NSC reduction occurs solely in branches and stems at the end of the growing season." .

P. tremula dominated in the overstorey and T. cordata in the lower layer of the tree canopy of the temperate deciduous forest canopy. Shoot water potential (Ψ), bulk-leaf abscisic acid concentration ([ABA]leaf), abscisic acid concentration in xylem sap ([ABA]xyl), and rate of stomatal closure following the supply of exogenous ABA (v) decreased acropetally through the whole tree canopy, and foliar water content per area (w), concentration of the leaf osmoticum (c), maximum leaf-specific hydraulic conductance of shoot (L), stomatal conductance (g s), and the threshold dose per leaf area of the exogenous ABA (d a) required to reduce stomatal conductance increased acropetally through the tree canopy (from the base of the foliage of T. cordata to the top of the foliage of P. tremula) in non-stressed trees. The threshold dose per leaf dry mass of the exogenous ABA (d w) required to reduce stomatal conductance, was similar through the tree canopy. After a drought period (3 weeks), the Ψ, w, L, g s, d a and d w had decreased, and c and v had increased in both species. Yet, the effect of the drought period was more pronounced on L, g s, d a, d w and v in T. cordata, and on Ψ, w and c in P. tremula. It was concluded that the water use of the species of the lower canopy layer—T. cordata, is more conservative than that of the species of the overstorey, P. tremula. [ABA]leaf had not been significantly changed in these trees, and [ABA]xyl had increased during the drought period only in P. tremula. The relations between [ABA]leaf, [ABA]xyl and the stomatal conductance, the osmotic adjustment and the shoot hydraulic conductance are also discussed." .

Recent aspen mortality has been linked to drought stress and elevated temperatures characteristic of conditions expected under climate change, but the role of individual aspen tree growth patterns in contributing to recent tree mortality is less well known. We used tree-ring data to investigate the relationship between an individual aspen tree’s lifetime growth patterns and mortality. Surviving aspen trees had consistently higher average growth rates for at least 100 years than dead trees. Contrary to observations from late successional species, slow initial growth rates were not associated with a longer lifespan in aspen. Aspen trees that died had slower lifetime growth and slower growth at various stages of their lives than those that survived. Differences in average diameter growth between live and dead trees were significant (α = 0.05) across all time periods tested. Our best logistical model of aspen mortality indicates that younger aspen trees with lower recent growth rates and higher frequencies of abrupt growth declines had an increased risk of mortality. Our findings highlight the need for species-specific mortality functions in forest succession models. Size-dependent mortality functions suitable for late successional species may not be appropriate for species with different life history strategies. For some early successional species, like aspen, slow growth at various stages of the tree’s life is associated with increased mortality risk." .
