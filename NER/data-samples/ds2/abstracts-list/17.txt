They also completed several questionnaires designed to assess sexual attitudes, knowledge, and guilt. As compared to the orgasmic women, the anorgasmic women reported (i) greater discomfort in communicating with a partner regarding only those sexual activities involving direct clitoral stimulation, (ii) more negative attitudes toward masturbation, (iii) greater endorsement of sex myths, and (iv) greater sex guilt. Contrary to expectations, the groups failed to differ significantly on either the frequency of use of any of the sexual activities depicted or on arousal to viewing these activities. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are explored." .

Here, we performed independent component analysis (ICA) in two fMRI datasets corresponding to two incentive delay tasks, which compared the response to reward (money and erotic pictures) and neutral cues, and yielded activations in the ventral striatum using a general linear model approach. Across both experiments, ICA revealed that both the right frontoparietal network and default mode network time courses were positively and negatively modulated by reward cues, respectively. Moreover, this dual neural response pattern was enhanced in individuals with strong reward sensitivity. Therefore, ICA may be a complementary tool to investigate the relevant role of attentional networks on reward processing, and to investigate reward sensitivity in normal and pathological populations." .

The present study examined the degree to which shame and guilt are uniquely predictive of avoidance and approach motives, respectively, for both self-caused and other-caused wrongdoings. Results revealed that shame and guilt are more highly correlated for self-caused compared to other-caused wrongdoings. This greater blending of shame and guilt in response to self-caused acts makes it somewhat more difficult to distinguish between different unique motivational correlates of these two emotions. However, in response to other-caused wrongdoings, shame uniquely predicted avoidance tendencies (distancing from the event), whereas guilt uniquely predicted approach tendencies (repairing the event). The implications for research on motivation, emotion, and social relations are discussed." .

Specifically, this study aimed to explore the impact of social and family support, the challenges and advantages of taking part in a clinical trial and the experiences of patients at the conclusion of the trial. MethodsA qualitative study was conducted at a public hospital in Melbourne in 2008. A total of 14 participants were recruited. Three focus groups and two interviews were conducted with 13 patients who had completed a cancer-related clinical trial. Comments from a letter written by a trial participant were also analysed. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded according to emerging themes. ResultsInformation obtained was grouped around four main themes; making sense of trial participation, challenges of treatment in the context of clinical trial participation, support during trial participation and coping with trial conclusion. Participants experienced a mixture of hope, uncertainty and apprehension as they considered whether to take part in a clinical trial. At different stages of the trial they made sense of their participation by thinking about the possible benefits of participation. Trial participation was also associated with a number of emotional and practical challenges. Generally, participants were very positive about the support they received from health professionals, family and friends. The end of the trial was associated with a mix of emotions, including relief, disappointment, hope of future help, uncertainty and abandonment. ConclusionsClinical trial participation is a positive experience for many patients with cancer, although there are a number of associated practical and emotional challenges. Trial participants may benefit from closer follow-up from clinical trial staff, especially the treating doctor, assessment of support needs and help in re-evaluating the meaning of their trial participation if their initial hopes and expectations are not met." .

Of the total $82.4 billion in MH/SA expenditures, 13% went to children, 72% to adults, and 15% to older adults. MH/SA treatment expenditures made up 9% of total health care expenditures on children, 11% of total health care expenditures on adults, and 3% of total health care expenditures on older adults. Across the 3 age groups, distinct differences emerged in the distribution of MH/SA expenditures by provider-type. For example, about 85% of spending for youth was for specialty MH/SA providers, compared to 76% for adults and 51% for older adults. In addition, 33% of MH/SA spending for older adults went to nursing home care, while other age groups had almost no expenditures in nursing homes. Age-specific estimates enable policymakers, providers, and researchers to design programs and studies more appropriately tailored to specific age groups." .

It is generally accepted that associative learning processes underlie vicarious learning; however, whether this association is a form of conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus (CS-US) learning or stimulus–response (CS-CR) learning remains unclear. Traditionally, these types of learning can be dissociated in a US revaluation procedure. The current study explored the effects of post-vicarious learning US revaluation on acquired fear responses. Ninety-four children (46 males and 48 females) aged 6 to 10 years first viewed either a fear vicarious learning video or a neutral vicarious learning video followed by random allocation to one of three US revaluation conditions: inflation; deflation; or control. Inflation group children were presented with still images of the adults in the video and told that the accompanying sound and image of a very fast heart rate monitor belonged to the adult. The deflation group were shown the same images but with the sound and image of a normal heart rate. The control group received no US revaluation. Results indicated that inflating how scared the models appeared to be did not result in significant increases in children’s fear beliefs, avoidance preferences, avoidance behavior or heart rate for animals above increases caused by vicarious learning. In contrast, US devaluation resulted in significant decreases in fear beliefs and avoidance preferences. Thus, the findings provide evidence that CS-US associations underpin vicarious learning and suggest that US devaluation may be a successful method for preventing children from developing fear beliefs following a traumatic vicarious learning episode with a stimulus." .

This saccade-related attention is known to be spatial in nature, and in this study we asked whether it also evokes any feature selectivity that is maintained across the saccade. After a saccade toward a colored target, participants performed a postsaccadic feature search on an array displayed at landing. The saccade target either had the same color as the search target in the postsaccadic array (congruent trials) or a different color (incongruent or neutral trials). Our results show that the color of the saccade target did not prime the subsequent feature search. This suggests that “landmark search”, the process of searching for the saccade target once the eye lands (Deubel in Visual Cognition, 11, 173–202, 2004), may not involve the attentional mechanisms that underlie feature search. We also analyzed intertrial effects and observed priming of pop-out (Maljkovic & Nakayama in Memory & Cognition, 22, 657–672, 1994) for the postsaccadic feature search: the detection of the color singleton became faster when its color was repeated on successive trials. However, search performance revealed no effect of congruency between the saccade and search targets, either within or across trials, suggesting that the priming of pop-out is specific to target repetitions within the same task and is not seen for repetitions across tasks. Our results support a dissociation between feature-based attention and the attentional mechanisms associated with eye movement programming." .

Following occlusion, the PLA reappeared, either a progression of the motion as it should be post-occlusion or temporally shifted earlier/later. Participants made judgements on whether the reappearing PLA was too early or too late to be a correct continuation (Experiments 1 and 3) or whether it was a veridical continuation or not (Experiment 2). Over three experiments we asked how action simulation is affected by motion information before, during and after occlusion. Reducing motion presented before occlusion retained the accuracy of action simulation judgements. Presenting 4 frames (67 ms) of PLA motion during the occluder duration dynamically updates or altogether regenerates the action simulation. Reducing the duration of the test motion after the occluder decreases judgement precision, which we interpret as a limitation in the process of postdictive motion judgments. Overall, this is further evidence that the action simulation process is remarkably adapted to making human motion predictions." .

This brief G-CBT-I was designed to yield results in a shorter period of time, because its strategy was intended to lower the dropout rate and enhance the cost performance. And also, it was intended to be easy to make use of CBT-I for both therapists and patients. This process consists of four components and only two sessions weekly, and a total therapy time is approximately 3 h. Thirty-three participants (including 17 women) with PPI received G-CBT-I therapy. The short-term outcome (4 weeks after G-CBT-I) was measured using sleep logs, actigraphy, the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-J), and the Japanese version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-J). The long-term outcome was evaluated by checking medical records at 6 months after G-CBT-I. At 4 weeks after G-CBT-I, subjective sleep onset latency decreased by 32.1%, and objective sleep efficiency increased to approximately 90%. The dissociation between subjective and objective evaluations of sleep decreased. The total score of the PSQI-J and the scores on the DBAS-J (“consequences of insomnia”, “control and predictability of sleep”, and “sleep-promoting practice”) were decreased. At the long-term follow-up, the amount of hypnotics needed by each participant decreased by 0.6 mg (1 being equivalent to 1 mg of flunitrazepam) (33% reduction). These findings suggested that patients with PPI could derive significant benefit from brief G-CBT-I therapy." .

Then 18 pairs of words were presented visually on slides. The subject’s task during each 10-sec interslide interval was to repeat silently the pair of words over and over again in the male voice, in the female voice, or in the subject’s own voice. A surprise recognition test for the words indicated that the words were more likely to be recognized if they were spoken in the same Voice at test as was used to repeat them during presentation. Recognition of the words repeated in the subject’s own voice was not affected by the sex of the speaker at test. In Experiment 2, different speakers were used at test than those used by the subjects to repeat the words. The interaction between the sex of voice used at encoding and at test was again significant, but recognition was generally lower than in Experiment 1. It was concluded that it is not necessary to assume that subjects have literal copies of spoken words in memory but speaker’s voice does form an integral part of the verbal memory code and its influence is specific to a given speaker as well as to a given class of speakers (male or female)." .

The contradictory and, at times, controversial findings stimulated the present randomized research whose purpose was to explore the possibility and probability of predicting which variables affect the psychological distress level of women with breast cancer 1 to 5 years after diagnosis (time period 1) and 6 to 8 months after period 1 (time period 2). Patients and methodsThe study was conducted in two large oncology centers in Graz, Austria, and Jerusalem, Israel, with a sample population comprising 424 patients. Main resultsThe only variables that significantly predicted change in the psychological distress levels (Grand Severity Index, GSI; except for the GSI level during period 1) were Fighting Spirit (Mental Adjustment to Cancer, MAC) in the Graz sample and Perceived Family Support (PFS) in the Jerusalem sample. These results are discussed in relation to other findings. ConclusionsIn light of these findings, it is highly important to preliminarily identify women with less adaptive psychological coping mechanisms and to provide them with efficacy tools for behavioral and cognitive changes within their own network of social and health resources." .

Rather, stimuli are described as sets of qualitative stimulus aspects and stimulus similarity as a function of common and non-common aspects. According to Restle's model of stimulus similarity, however, the perception of stimuli of a categorial nature can be organized along dimensions because stimulus aspects form dimensions under certain conditions. The present study supports the empirical validity of this assumption. Further it is suggested that contrary to the present opinion quantitative stimulus characteristics are probably not perceived as dimensions in the sense of the geometric models but only dimensions as described in the Restle model." .

This study was designed to examine whether chimpanzees and monkeys exhibit a global-to-local precedence in the processing of hierarchically organized compound stimuli, as has been reported for humans. Subjects were tested using a sequential matching-to-sample paradigm using stimuli that differed on the basis of their global configuration or local elements, or on both perceptual attributes. Although both species were able to discriminate stimuli on the basis of their global configuration or local elements, the chimpanzees exhibited a global-to-local processing strategy, whereas the rhesus monkeys exhibited a local-to-global processing strategy. The results suggest that perceptual and attentional mechanisms underlying information-processing strategies may account for differences in learning by primates." .

In thispaper, we propose stochastic finite-state models for these two subproblems. Stochastic finite-state models are efficiently learnablefrom data, effective for decoding and are associated with a calculusfor composing models which allows for tight integration of constraintsfrom various levels of language processing. We present a method forlearning stochastic finite-state models for lexical selection andlexical reordering that are trained automatically from pairs of sourceand target utterances. We use this method to develop models forEnglish–Japanese and English–SPANISH translation and present the performance of these models for translation on speech and text. We also evaluate the efficacy of such a translation model in the context of a call routing task of unconstrained speech utterances." .

Perceived personal risk for cancer and causal attributions for cancer were measured in four groups: women identified as carriers of mutations in breast/ovarian cancer genes BRCA1 BRCA2, habitual smokers, X-ray technicians, and an average-risk group. Despite differences in awareness of their risk status and perceived risk for cancer, the groups did not differ in health anxiety, cancer worry interference, and self-assessed health. Motivated reasoning processes were identified as potential strategies used by individuals at-risk to regulate levels of psychological distress. Evidence for biased risk perceptions and unrealistic optimism were found among smokers, and patterns indicative of self-enhancement through self-assessments and defensive discounting of cancer causal attributions were found in the genetically susceptible group. These findings highlight the role of cognitive representations in adjustment to being at-risk for cancer." .

Factor analysis was used to reduce the self-attributional data to two dimensions: one reflecting perceived skill and comfort level, and the other reflecting the assumption of a rational versus intuitive clinical approach. Students attributed lower levels of skill and comfort to themselves, as well as a more intuitive approach, when imagining themselves caring for one who uses a power-assisted wheelchair, and to a greater extent, when imagining themselves caring for one who uses a wheelchair and a communication board, than for one without an apparent disability. Correlations of student age and number of years in nursing practice with self-attributions were investigated." .

However, many functions require integrative inputs from multiple sensory systems and sensory intersection and convergence occur throughout the central nervous system. The neural processes for hearing perception undergo significant modulation by the two other major sensory systems, vision and somatosensation. This synthesis occurs at every level of the ascending auditory pathway: the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body and the auditory cortex. In this review, we explore the process of multisensory integration from (1) anatomical (inputs and connections), (2) physiological (cellular responses), (3) functional and (4) pathological aspects. We focus on the convergence between auditory and somatosensory inputs in each ascending auditory station.

The model, which was grounded in adult learning theory, encouraged a facilitative role for the teaching faculty, active decision-making on the part of the participants, collegial support, and linkages between theory and practice. A social systems approach was used to promote the idea of leaders as change agents. The effectiveness of the training model was assessed through the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results indicated that the training had a positive effect on participants' level of perceived competence, the quality of teaching practices in their classrooms, and the organizational climate of their centers.

Two experiments were conducted in which rats first received an odor (A+) paired with an emetic US, and then received odor and taste (AX+) paired with the US. In both experiments, the preconditioned odorfacilitated conditioning to the taste. In Experiment 1, a group that received two odor-illness pairings in A+ conditioning had a stronger taste aversion than a group that only had a single odor-illness pairing. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the strengthened taste aversion in the A+/AX+ condition was not due to stimulus generalization.

However, therapies for eating disorders, namely binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa, do not address weight management. Conversely, weight loss treatments for people with overweight or obesity do not address psychological aspects related to eating disorders. Thus we developed a new treatment for overweight or obesity with comorbid binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa, entitled HAPIFED (a Healthy APproach to weIght management and Food in Eating Disorders). This paper describes HAPIFED and reports a case series examining its feasibility and acceptability. MethodsEleven participants with overweight or obesity and binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa were treated with HAPIFED in two separate groups (with once or twice weekly meetings). Weight, body mass index (BMI) and eating disorder symptoms, as well as depression, anxiety and stress, were assessed at baseline and at the end of the 20-session HAPIFED intervention. ResultsEight of the 11 participants completed the intervention, with diverse results. Six of the 8 participants who completed HAPIFED reduced their weight between baseline and the end of the intervention. Median scores on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire for binge eating, restraint, and concerns about eating or weight and shape, were reduced in the group overall between baseline and the end of the intervention. One participant, who at baseline was inducing vomiting and misusing laxatives in an attempt to lose weight, reduced these behaviors by the end of the intervention. Three participants at baseline were undertaking episodes of compulsive exercise, and they reduced or stopped this behavior, but one participant commenced episodes of compulsive exercise by the end of the intervention. All participants who completed the intervention rated the suitability and success of HAPIFED as 7 or more out of 10 (0 = not at all suitable/successful; 10 = extremely suitable/successful). ConclusionThis case series supports the feasibility and acceptability of HAPIFED as a potential new treatment for overweight or obesity with comorbid binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa. Clinical trials are necessary to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of HAPIFED. Trial registrationAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Universal Trial Number): U1111–1149-7766.

Australia has welcomed a large refugee population in recent decades, including Iraqis who currently form one of the largest groups being resettled in Australia. MethodsThis study aimed to explore psychological distress in two samples of Iraqi refugees, those who recently arrived (n = 225, average length of stay = 0.55 months) and those with a longer period of resettlement (n = 225, average length of stay = 58.5 months). To assess general symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was employed. Associations between participants’ demographic characteristics and psychological distress levels were examined. ResultsA significant difference between groups, t (441) = −2.149, p = 0.0324, was found, indicating that study participants with longer periods of resettlement were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress than recent arrivals. ConclusionOur findings have implications for both for government and non-government funded organisations who should consider the provision of assistance programs beyond the initial arrival period." .

Since speech can be subdivided down to the level of single utterances, the aim of our study was to test the hypothesis of a fundamental impairment of vocal pace performance in parkinsonian patients based on a syllable repetition paradigm. Furthermore, the overall integrity of acoustical feedback mechanisms was surveyed by testing the ability to correctly identify pace and steadiness of the presented audio examples. N = 73 patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and n = 43 age-matched healthy controls were tested. Participants had to repeat the syllable/pa/at least 30 times at a “comfortable” self-chosen steady (isochronous) pace. Percent coefficient of variance (COV) of interval length and the change in interval length with successive utterances were measured for the description of pace stability throughout the performance. Then, participants had to identify irregularities of 30 played-back audio tests. The number of incorrect classification was defined as the error rate (ER). Patients with PD showed significant difficulties in steadily executing a syllable repetition task with a significant elevation of COV and showed a clear tendency to pace acceleration in the course of the performance. However, we found no differences in the correct auditory identification of rhythm irregularities between the PD group and controls. As compared to healthy controls, the PD group features disabilities in performing a steady sequence of utterances, which cannot be explained solely by impaired acoustical feedback mechanisms. The pattern of pace disturbance shows similarities with the finding of speech acceleration and rhythm irregularity in the course of reading or more complex conversational speech and therefore might share the same pathophysiology. Further studies are necessary to reveal the correlations between speech rhythm and motor performance to identify the underlying mechanisms that lead to “dysrhythmia” in PD." .

However, the involvement of subcortical regions is not well understood. Here we present simultaneous recordings of cortical and subcortical event-related potentials (ERPs) to different pure tones in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS). These patients had externalized electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the ventrolateral posterior thalamus (VLp) or the globus pallidus internus (GPi). Subcortical and cortical ERPs were analyzed upon presentation of one frequent non-target stimulus and two infrequent stimuli, either being a target or a distractor stimulus. The results revealed that amplitudes of scalp-recorded P3 and subcortical late attention-modulated responses (AMR) were largest upon presentation of target stimuli compared with distractor stimuli. This suggests that thalamic and basal ganglia regions are sensitive to behaviorally relevant auditory events. Comparison of the subcortical structures showed that responses in VLp have shorter latency than in GPi and STN. Further, the subcortical responses in VLp and STN emerged significantly prior to the cortical P3 response. Our findings point to higher-order cognitive functions already at a subcortical level. Auditory events are categorized as behaviorally relevant in subcortical loops involving basal ganglia and thalamic regions. This label is then distributed to cortical regions by ascending projections." .

All watchkeepers exhibited fragmented sleeping patterns, which indicated a lack of adaptation of the sleep/wakefulness cycle to the hours of work. There were only slight differences in total sleep length between watchkeepers and dayworkers, however, both groups did not obtain an adequate amount of sleep. Within the watchkeeping crews the 3rd Officers had by far the shortest sleep length. Concerning sleep quality, daytime sleep was generally given the lowest ratings, whereas sleep starting before midnight was on average evaluated as the best, both by watchkeepers and dayworkers. Watchkeeping personnel do not normally have any “days off” during a voyage so that missed sleep might even amount to a sleep deficit. A solution for this problem could perhaps be a new, stabilized system that allows a single uninterrupted sleep, which is required for full recuperation, to be taken each day." .

Further development of the model allows testable predictions to be made. In particular in this paper I examine certain hypotheses of chemical fuel shortage as a subgroup of the potential causes of fatigue, and their implications for maximal power and for endurance. The assumption that the limitation to sustainable power is direct proportionality to the glycogen store remaining, appears the most feasible. Based on this assumption, equations for the decline in maximum attainable power over time, the endurance at fixed workrates and the endurance at incremental tests (as a function of the increment slope) are obtained. Using published data for fit males, the maximum exertable power declines after about 6 s at 972 W to very low levels after about 2 min. For constant powers selected between 208 and 927 W, endurance declines from ad infinitum to only 6 s. Endurance at $$\\dot V_{O_2 \\max } $$ is predicted to be about 9 min. For incremental exercise tests of slope ranging from 30 W/min to 60 W/min, endurance lessens from 14 to 9 min. In these tests the anaerobic threshold is reached in times between 6 and 3 min. Although the power at termination of a test increases with incremental slope, terminal oxygen consumption is effectively constant. Almost all these model predictions are observed to correspond well with published experimental findings. These results suggest that the model can be used to represent an adequate overview of the operation of the human bioenergetic system." .

A well-known approach to monitor sleep is polysomnography. However, it is costly and intrusive, which may disturb sleep. Consequently, polysomnography is not suitable for sleep behavior analysis. Other approaches are based on actigraphy and sleep diary. Although being a good source of information for sleep quality assessment, sleep diaries can be affected by cognitive bias related to subject’s sleep perception, while actigraphy overestimates sleep periods and night-time disturbance compared to sleep diaries. Machine learning techniques can improve the objectivity and reliability of the observations. However, since signal morphology vary widely between people, conventional machine learning is complex to set up. In this regard, we present an adaptive, reliable, and innovative computational approach to provide per-night assessment of sleep behavior to the end-user. We exploit heartbeat rate and wrist acceleration data, gathered via smartwatch, in order to identify subject’s sleep behavioral pattern. More specifically, heartbeat rate and wrist motion samples are processed via computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Stigmergy associates each sample to a digital pheromone deposit (mark) defined in a mono-dimensional space and characterized by evaporation over time. As a consequence, samples close in terms of time and intensity are aggregated into functional structures called trails. The stigmergic trails allow to compute the similarity between time series on different temporal scales, to support classification or clustering processes. The overall computing schema includes a parametric optimization for adapting the structural parameters to individual sleep dynamics. The outcome is a similarity between sleep nights of the same subject, to generate clusters of nights with different quality levels. Experimental results are shown for three real-world subjects. The resulting similarity is also compared with the dynamic time warping, a popular similarity measure for time series." .

In the present research, conditioned lick suppression in rats was used to examine similar contextual modulation of Pavlovian conditioned inhibition. After Pavlovian conditioned inhibition training with a CS in one context, subjects were exposed to pairings of the CS with an unconditioned stimulus (US) either in the same or in a second context. Results indicated that, when the CS was paired with the US in the second context, the CS retained its inhibitory control over behavior, provided that testing occurred in the context used for inhibition training. However, when the CS-US pairings occurred in the inhibition training context, the CS subsequently proved to be excitatory regardless of where testing occurred.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of alexithymia among prisoners in China. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in five main jails of the district of Zhejiang province in China, and a total of 1705 adult prisoners ultimately took part in the study. Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale and several short demographic questions were applied. ResultsOver 30% of prisoners were classified as alexithymics and as high as 96.2% of prisoners suffered from at least one traumatic experience in their childhood, meanwhile, 81.5%, 53.4% and 85.8% were found to be positive for depression, anxiety and hopelessness symptoms respectively. Education, childhood trauma, negative emotional symptoms including depression, anxiety and hopelessness of the respondents, were negatively or positively associated with alexithymia among prisoners. ConclusionsThe results indicated that high prevalence of alexithymia among prisoners is linked with their level of education, experience of childhood trauma and symptoms of negative emotions. Accordingly, the findings in our study can be used for prevention and intervention of alexithymia among prisoners." .

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms during early and middle childhood are independently associated with academic achievement at age 12 years. The independent associations between inattention and hyperactivity trajectories during early and middle childhood and academic performance at age 12 years were examined in a population-based longitudinal birth cohort (n = 2120). In adjusted analyses, high early childhood inattention trajectories were associated with teacher-rated academic performance in reading, writing and mathematics and with government exam score in writing. High and moderate inattention trajectories during middle childhood predicted lower performance on both teacher-rated academic performance and government exam scores in reading, writing, and mathematics. Hyperactivity was not a consistent predictor of educational outcomes. Childhood inattention symptoms rather than hyperactivity carry risk of poor educational outcomes at age 12 years. Children with high levels of inattention can be identified during the preschool years. Prevention programs supporting the development of attentional capacities and executive functions could help reduce the negative consequences of inattention." .

Chemoreceptors on the ventrolateral surfaces of the medulla are postulated to be the initial site of stimulation in the chain of events leading to the behavioral bioregulation of inspired CO2 concentration." .

Mites were sorted to instar and kept in microcosms for 1 year (1997–1998). Juvenile winter survival was high (56–79%), but only about 50% of the adults survived the winter. Summer survival was high in all instars (60–80%). This gave a high survival to adulthood (13.3%). A synchronized moult was observed in July, but juvenile development during the rest of the exceptionally warm summer of 1998 varied both between and within stages, with immatures moulting not at all or up to two times. In a second set of cohorts, experiencing a shorter summer, most juveniles moulted once. Thus, A. lineatus has a flexible life cycle with the juvenile stages normally lasting 1 year, giving a larva-to-larva developmental time of 5 years, but with an increased developmental rate in warm summers. Development also seemed to depend on gender, with males developing faster than females. Adult longevity was studied in the laboratory, and most of the adults lived for 2–3 years." .

MethodsA total of 31 surgeons, who were all right-handed, were divided into the following two groups according to their experience as an operator in laparoscopic surgery: experienced surgeons (more than 50 laparoscopic procedures) and novice surgeons (fewer than 10 laparoscopic procedures). The subjects were tested using the eye-hand coordination task of the LAP Mentor, and performance was compared between the two groups. Assessment of the laparoscopic skills was based on parameters measured by the simulator. ResultsThe experienced surgeons completed the task significantly faster than the novice surgeons. The experienced surgeons also achieved a lower number of movements (NOM), better economy of movement (EOM) and faster average speed of the left instrument than the novice surgeons, whereas there were no significant differences between the two groups for the NOM, EOM and average speed of the right instrument. ConclusionsEye-hand coordination skill of the nondominant hand, but not the dominant hand, measured using the LAP Mentor was able to differentiate between subjects with different laparoscopic experience. This study also provides evidence of construct validity for eye-hand coordination skill on the LAP Mentor." .

The present paper reports simulations carried out to determine the size of the bias introduced by fast guesses. In absolute terms, this bias can be quite large— exceeding 175 msec in some conditions. Simulations indicate that the bias increases with the percentage of fast guesses and with the latency difference between the lower tails of guess and nonguess RT distributions. Discarding and rerunning errors reduces bias somewhat, but a more elaborate “kill-the-twin” procedure reduces it much more." .

The extent to which nonhuman animals can gain information by reading the cues of others is often tested by evaluating responses to human gestures, such as a point, and less often evaluated by examining responses to conspecific cues. We tested whether ten brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus [Sapajus] apella) were able to use cues from monkeys and a pointing cue from a human to obtain hidden rewards. A monkey could gain access to a reward hidden in one of two locations by reading a cue from a conspecific (e.g., reaching) or a human pointing. We then tested whether they could transfer this skill from monkeys to humans, from humans to monkeys, and from one conspecific to another conspecific. One group of monkeys was trained and tested using a conspecific as the cue-giver and was then tested with a human cue-giver. The second group of monkeys was trained and tested with a human cue-giver and was then tested with a monkey cue-giver. Monkeys that were successful with a conspecific cue-giver were also tested with a novel conspecific cue-giver. Monkeys learned to use a human point and conspecific cues to obtain rewards. Monkeys that had learned to use the cues of a conspecific to obtain rewards performed significantly better than expected by chance when they were transferred to the cues of a novel conspecific. Monkeys that learned to use a human point to obtain rewards performed significantly better than expected by chance when tested while observing conspecific cues. Some evidence suggested that transferring between conspecific cue-givers occurred with more facility than transferring across species. Results may be explained by simple rules of association learning and stimulus generalization; however, spontaneous flexible use of gestures across conspecifics and between different species may indicate capuchins can generalize learned social cues within and partially across species." .

The concept of child-hatred, described by Lloyd Demause and other critics, is an effective lens through which to view the hyperbolized hatred of children described in The Witches. However, Dahl’s text deals with more than just the explicit hatred of children. In fact, in its characterization of Grandmamma as an adult that truly values the state of childhood, and in Dahl’s narrative treatment of both his child protagonist and his child audience, Dahl’s text counters the notion that we have progressed to a culture that values and, at times, sacralizes the child. The Witches presents to readers the possibility that child-hatred is not some now-defunct phenomenon, but rather an extant danger in the historical present of childhood, a danger made ever more threatening by its ability to hide under a mask of benevolence. With the many instances of both child-protection and child-hatred that pervade The Witches, the text serves as an apt illustration of the ambivalence inherent in many works of children’s literature, which has been a central concern for scholars of children’s texts for decades." .

Ratios ranged from simple (1:2) to complex (7:11, 5:13), and from small (5:13 = 0.38) to large (6:7 = 0.86). Rhythm production and perception exhibited similar ratio-dependent biases: rhythms with small ratios were produced with increased ratios, and timing perturbations in these rhythms tended to be harder to detect when they locally increased the ratio than when they reduced it. The opposite held for rhythms with large ratios. This demonstrates a close relation between rhythm perception and production. Unexpectedly, however, the neutral “attractor” was not the simplest ratio (1:2 = 0.50) but a complex ratio near 4:7 (= 0.57). Phase correction in response to perturbations was generally rapid and did not show the ratio-dependent biases observed in rhythm perception and production. Thus, phase correction operates efficiently and autonomously even in synchronization with rhythms exhibiting complex interval ratios." .

In this respect our model is a generalization of the Zener model, i.e., it is a Zener fractional model with infinitely many terms. The relation between stress and strain is given in explicit form. For two specific choices of parameters the behavior of the model under suddenly applied stress (creep) and suddenly applied strain (stress relaxation) are examined." .

Material and MethodsThe experiments were performed on a computer workstation placed in controlled lighting environment where 2 discomfort glare conditions were modeled. Each participant performed for about 1 h specially designed visual tasks, including the tests with Landolt’s rings presented on the screen by a computer program. The glare evaluation method consisted of subjective evaluation of discomfort glare on the semantic glare rating scale, tests of mesopic contrast and glare sensitivity, subjective assessment of lighting quality and asthenopic symptoms. The time needed to perform the task and the number of mistakes were also recorded. The subjective evaluation of glare was compared with the Unified Glare Rating (UGR) index calculated by the DIALux simulation program. ResultsA higher percentage of the younger group subjects assessed glare after the experimental session as uncomfortable and intolerable than in the 50+ group, who more often assessed glare as acceptable. The assessment of discomfort glare in the younger group corresponded to higher UGR value compared to UGR value calculated by DIALux. In the 50+ group, such correlation was found only for lower discomfort glare (UGR = 19). The results showed that younger participants more frequently suffered from visual fatigue and assessed lighting as less comfortable. However, the mesopic glare sensitivity increased significantly after the experiments only in the 50+ group under both glare conditions. ConclusionsThe obtained results showed that discomfort glare sensation changes with age. The younger population seems to be more sensitive and demanding than the older one in relation to discomfort glare limiting, in spite of the lack of significant objective measures of fatigue. The exposure of the elderly to bigger discomfort glare could adversely affect the objective measures of fatigue like mesopic glare sensitivity and visual performance." .

Difficulty in falling asleep is the most frequently reported characteristic of the FNE. We examined the FNE on the sleep-onset period (SOP) quantitatively to investigate how the wake- and the sleep-promoting systems were related to the occurrence of the FNE. Eight healthy student volunteers participated in the study. Polysomnogram recording was made for three consecutive nights. Power spectra of electroencephalogram (EEG) activities were computed by using a Fast Fourier Transform during waking and the SOP. The data obtained was divided into seven bands and the mean amplitudes in each band were calculated. On the first night, EEG amplitudes in the alpha and gamma bands were higher during waking and the SOP compared with the second and the third nights. In contrast, theta and sigma amplitudes were lower on the first night. It was suggested that the wake-promoting system was excited and the smooth activation of the sleep-promoting system was inhibited during the SOP on the first night. This phenomenon might contribute to the cause of the sleep onset difficulty, which occurs as the FNE." .

We describe here the application of BMIs for brain communication in totally locked-in patients and argue that the thought pump may extinguish—at least partially—in those people because of extinction of instrumentally learned cognitive responses and brain responses. We show that Pavlovian semantic conditioning may allow brain communication even in the completely paralyzed who does not show response-effect contingencies. Principles of skill learning and habit acquisition as formulated by Braitenberg are the building blocks of BMIs and neuroprostheses." .

This qualitative interpretive study explored the impacts of gambling problems on partners. In-depth interviews were conducted with 18 partners and ex-partners of people with gambling problems to understand their experiences of gambling problems from their perspectives. The findings showed that partners experienced a wide range of negative effects, especially on their financial security, their emotional, mental and physical health, and on their relationships. The financial impacts of gambling problems on partners were substantial and far-reaching. Some partners were forced to take up extra employment to cover household expenses and pay off gambling-related debts. Others lost their savings, homes, belongings and established ways of life. While these impacts were extensive, partners also experienced a range of emotional impacts that were equally devastating. Their gambling partner’s lies, dishonesty and concealment of problems and gambling behaviour created considerable distress, loss of trust and a sense of betrayal. These experiences undermined these partners’ sense of self-identity, and created additional conflicts within their relationships. Along with accumulating mental and physical health impacts, these challenges lead to separation and/or divorce for many participants. These findings point to the need for greater understanding of partners’ experiences and public health initiatives that protect partners and their families from the harmful effects of gambling problems." .

Subjects are trained in the use of a strategy in which information processing is alternative-based. The correlation between the attributes of the alternatives and the mean and variance of the difference between the attributes is manipulated. The results show that the effort needed for decision making increases as the mean of the differences decreases. Yet, neither the variance of the differences nor the correlation context affect the decision making effort in this type of strategies." .

Analysing aggregate results we show that volunteers are more satisfied with training, and consider the training strategies to be very appropriate. After identifying differences between organisations we discover that in some organisations volunteers are satisfied with rewards but they have negative attitudes regarding the appropriateness of the recognition strategies. We also identify the volunteers who are the most and the least satisfied." .

Variables measured and used in this analysis were phonological processing, rapid naming, reading comprehension, isolated and nonsense word reading, and spelling. Data were collected from 65 second-to-fifth grade children referred for learning difficulties. Regression analysis was performed to determine which of the cognitive processes was the strongest predictor of the literacy skills measured. Rapid naming was found to be a stronger predictor of word reading, reading comprehension and spelling than was phonological processing. When a measure of decoding skills was included as a predictor, it was found to account for the most variance in word reading and spelling. The implications of these results for assessing and designing interventions with reading disabled children are discussed as well as the need to further investigate the double deficit hypothesis." .

Sibling distress was described in terms of emotional, socio-behavioral, academic, physical and positive reactions. Secondly, characteristics and coping resources of siblings that are related to adjustment were summarized. Thirdly, the families' functioning, parental coping resources and family events that relate to adjustment were described. Finally, relevant aspects of the illness that may influence adjustment were described. Results of the 35 studies reviewed are summarized in a table containing general descriptors, methods and results. There are salient difficulties in comparison of the findings owing to variations in design, heterogeneity of the groups of siblings, diversity in sample size, and differences in conceptualizations of adjustment and coping. The lack of longitudinal studies, the precarious definitions and confounding of coping and adaptation, and the marginal role of siblings' coping efforts were identified as the most striking deficiencies in current research." .

In three experiments, we provide novel evidence that both cooperation and competition goals enhance perceptual acuity for both angry and happy faces.

Experiment 2 revealed that both cooperative and competitive motives improve perceivers’ perceptual sensitivity to subtle differences among happy and angry facial expressions. Finally, Experiment 3 found that the motivated increase in perceptual acuity for happy and angry expressions allows perceivers to overcome the effects of visual noise, relative to unmotivated control participants.

Participants were administered a negative mood state induction using a standardized film clip procedure and subsequently completed a measure of risk-taking judgment under one of three conditions: (1) immediately following the mood induction, (2) following a 5 min no-task delay period, or (3) following performance of a cognitively demanding task. As expected, participants who made risk judgments after the performance of the cognitively demanding task showed higher level of recovery from the negative mood induction (i.e., increased positive mood and decreased negative mood) and lower levels of risk-taking judgment than participants in the delayed condition. Additional analyses showed the risk-taking judgments were explained by mood change after the interpolated task. These findings reconcile previous inconsistencies between the two perspectives. Implications for future research on the restorative role of cognitive task performance as a mood regulation strategy are discussed." .

In contrast to Lazear’s assumptions, however, self-employed individuals do not just need more basic but also more expert skills than employees.

In additional, roles of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis in stress-regulation mechanisms have been of much focus, while the contribution of central amino acid metabolism to these mechanisms has not been well appreciated. Therefore, whether depression-like states affect amino acid metabolism and their potential roles on stress-regulatory mechanisms were investigated by comparing Wistar Kyoto rats, which display depression-like behaviors and stress vulnerability, to control Wistar rats. Brain amino acid metabolism in Wistar Kyoto rats was greatly different from normal Wistar rats, with special reference to lower cystathionine and serine levels. In addition, Wistar Kyoto rats demonstrated abnormality in dopamine metabolism compared with Wistar rats. In the case of stress response, amino acid levels having a sedative and/or hypnotic effect were constant in the brain of Wistar Kyoto rats, though these amino acid levels were reduced in Wistar rats under a stressful condition. These results suggest that the abnormal amino acid metabolism may induce depression-like behaviors and stress vulnerability in Wistar Kyoto rats. Therefore, we hypothesized that abnormalities in amino acid and monoamine metabolism may induce depression, and amino acid metabolism in the brain may be related to stress vulnerability." .

This preference for a style of explanation, however, can be justified only in the case of `regular' perturbation problems in which the zeroth-order term in the perturbation expansion (characterizing the `basic' level) is the uniform limit of the exact solution as the perturbation parameter goes to zero. For the much more frequent case of `singular' perturbation problems, various techniques have been developed which all introduce a hierarchy of levels or scales into the solutions. These levels describe processes or sub-systems operating simultaneously at different time or spatial scales. No single level, no reductive explanation in the above sense will provide an adequate explanation of the system behaviour. Explanations involving multiple levels should be recognized as far more common even in supposedly reductionist disciplines like physics." .

A growing body of work, spanning numerous methodologies and species, reveals that one powerful way in which attending to an item separates the wheat from the chaff is by altering a basic response property in the brain: neuronal selectivity. Selectivity is a cornerstone response property, largely dictating our ability to represent and interact with the environment. Although it is likely that selectivity is altered throughout many brain areas, here we focus on how directing attention to an item affects selectivity in the visual system, where this response property is generally more well characterized. First, we review the neural architecture supporting selectivity, and then discuss the various changes that could occur in selectivity for an attended item. In a survey of the literature, spanning neurophysiology, neuroimaging and psychophysics, we reveal that there is general convergence regarding the manner with which selectivity is shaped by attentional feedback. In a nutshell, the literature suggests that the type of changes in selectivity that manifest appears to depend on the type of attention being deployed: whereas directing spatial attention towards an item only alters spatial selectivity, directing feature-based attention can alter the selectivity of attended features." .

The influence of stimulus parameters (e.g., frequency, spectrum, duration, location) on auditory temporal order judgment (TOJ) thresholds was tested in seven groups with a total of 192 participants received two-tone sequences of different: frequencies (3 groups); spectrum widths, via a pure tone and a Gaussian noise burst (1 group); durations (2 groups); or locations, via asynchronous presentation to each ear (1 group). No difference in the mean rankings of TOJ thresholds was found for frequency, spectrum, and location parameters. TOJ thresholds for the duration condition, however, were significantly longer than for any of the other conditions. Notably, the threshold distributions for all the parameters (frequency, spectrum, duration, location) differed in shape. These findings raise the question as to whether we can rely upon the mean or median threshold as truly representative of TOJ threshold data. Furthermore, the data suggest that temporal order judgments for the different stimulus parameters are processed differently. The differences observed when analyzing the data with central tendency measures, as compared to analyzing the threshold distributions, may explain some of the mixed results reported in the literature on the mechanisms involved in temporal processing of different parameters. Stimulus parameters influence TOJ threshold distributions and response patterns, and may provide additional cues, beyond the standard temporal cue inherent in the TOJ procedure, by which participants may judge the order of the stimuli." .

Even when asked to maintain the eyes at fixation, the oculomotor system produces small and rapid eye movements called microsaccades, at a frequency of about 1.5–2 s−1. The frequency of microsaccades changes when a stimulus is presented in the visual field, showing a stereotyped response pattern consisting of an early inhibition of microsaccades followed by a rebound, before the baseline is reached again. Although this pattern of response has generally been considered as a sort of oculomotor reflex, directional biases in microsaccades have been recently linked to the orienting of spatial attention. In the present study, we show for the first time that regardless of any spatial bias, the pattern of absolute microsaccadic frequency is different for oddball stimuli compared to that elicited by standard stimuli. In a visual-oddball task, the oddball stimuli caused an initial prolonged inhibition of microsaccades, particularly when oddballs had to be explicitly recognized and remembered. The present findings suggest that high-order cognitive processes, other than spatial attention, can influence the frequency of microsaccades. Finally, we also introduce a new method for exploring the visual system response to oddball stimuli." .

The alternative hypothesis proposed is the control hypothesis, which claims that repetition avoidance is caused by the attempts of the subjects to avoid perseveration. Three sequential response production tasks (number randomization, tone randomization, and production of a pleasing tone sequence), one randomness-judgement task, and four perseveration measures were presented to the subjects. Repetition avoidance was found in all three production tasks, including the tone productions in the ‘pleasing’ condition. Correlations of the randomness judgements with repetition avoidance were generally not found. There was only slight evidence of correlations between the perseveration measures and repetition avoidance. The results suggest that randomness concepts do not contribute to repetition avoidance to any great extent. The control hypothesis is proposed to explain the results." .

Here, we show that infants’ looming related brain activity is characterised by theta oscillations. Source analyses reveal clear localised activity in the visual cortex. Analysing the temporal dynamics of the source waveform, we provide evidence that the temporal structure of different looming stimuli is sustained during processing in the more mature infant brain, providing infants with increasingly veridical time-to-collision information about looming danger as they grow older and become more mobile." .

As most parents are unprepared for this situation, psychological support (PsySupp) is recommended. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which parents express a need for PsySupp. Three hundred twenty-nine parents of children with dsd were included; 40.4 % of the parents indicated to have a need for PsySupp, only 50 % of this group received it adequately. The diagnoses partial gonadal dysgenesis, partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (pAIS) and disorders of androgen synthesis are associated with a high need for PsySupp in parents (54, 65, and 50 %). Sex assignment surgery neither reduced nor increased the need for PsySupp. Taking a picture, radiography, laparoscopy, gonadal biopsy, gonadectomy and hormonal puberty induction are associated with a high need for PsySupp. There was no association between the need for PsySupp and the parents’ perception of the appearance of the genitalia. Conclusion: Having a child with dsd is associated with a high need for PsySupp in parents. In particular, parents of children with XY-dsd with androgen effects other than hypospadias expressed a high need of PsySupp. PsySupp for parents should be an obligatory part of interdisciplinary care to reduce fears and concerns. What is known • In parents, having a child with dsd provokes insecurities and fears. Hence, psychological support is recommended as part of the interdisciplinary care. What is new • This is the first study investigating the subjective need for psychological support in a large sample of parents of children with dsd in Germany. We present data on the subjective need for psychological support of the parents, related diagnoses and factors, which should be considered in psychological counselling." .

Separated by 1 min of rest, the athlete completed 2 rounds of 12 single, maximal effort punches (lead straight, rear straight, lead hook and rear hook) delivered to a punching integrator in a counterbalanced order over six testing days. In one round the punches were delivered in a predetermined order while in the second round the order was self-selected by the athlete. In the choice condition, the world champion punched with greater velocities (6–11 %) and impact forces (5–10 %). In Study 2, the same testing procedures were repeated with 13 amateur male kickboxers over 2 testing days. Similar to Study 1, the athletes punched with significantly greater velocities (6 %, p < 0.05) and normalised impact forces (2 %, p < 0.05) in the choice condition.

However, faces also enjoy an advantage at the early stage of basic-level detection, as demonstrated by efficient visual search for faces among nonface objects. In the present study, we asked (1) whether the face advantage in detection is a unique signature of face expertise, or whether it generalizes to other objects of expertise, and (2) whether expertise in face detection is intrinsically linked to expertise in face individuation. We compared how groups with varying degrees of object and face expertise (typical adults, developmental prosopagnosics [DP], and car experts) search for objects within and outside their domains of expertise (faces, cars, airplanes, and butterflies) among a variable set of object distractors. Across all three groups, search efficiency (indexed by reaction time slopes) was higher for faces and airplanes than for cars and butterflies. Notably, the search slope for car targets was considerably shallower in the car experts than in nonexperts. Although the mean face slope was slightly steeper among the DPs than in the other two groups, most of the DPs’ search slopes were well within the normative range. This pattern of results suggests that expertise in object detection is indeed associated with expertise at the subordinate level, that it is not specific to faces, and that the two types of expertise are distinct facilities. We discuss the potential role of experience in bridging between low-level discriminative features and high-level naturalistic categories." .

We tested bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) on a serial reversal learning task. A serial reversal task requires learning of an initial discrimination between two differentially rewarded stimuli, followed by multiple reversals of the reward contingency between stimuli. A reduction in errors with repeated reversals in a serial reversal task is an indicator of behavioural flexibility. Bees were housed in a large indoor environment and tested during foraging flights. Testing free-flying bees allowed for large numbers of trials and reversals. All bees were trained to perform a simultaneous discrimination between two colours for a nectar reward, followed by nine reversals of this discrimination. Results showed that bumblebees reduced errors and improved their performance across successive reversals. A reduction in perseverative errors was the major cause of the improvement in performance. Bees showed a slight increase in error rate in their final trials, perhaps as a consequence of increasing proactive interference, but proactive interference may also have contributed to the overall improvement in performance across reversals. Bumblebees are thus capable of behavioural flexibility comparable to that of other animals and may use proactive interference as a mechanism of behavioural flexibility in varying environments." .

This has lead to two conflicting explanations for settlement behavior, which we have integrated into one model. This model creates a range of fitness outcomes for different settlement strategies, encompassing the four combinations of positive and negative effects of the habitat selection and social interaction. It expands the ideal free distribution models (negative intra-specific interactions and positive habitat selection), to consider alternative situations where (1) beneficial social interaction increases fitness for clustered pairs in poor quality habitat, (2) neither habitat selection nor conspecific attraction can improve fitness, and (3) where both are beneficial and do not interfere with each other. The model does this by establishing an intrinsic fitness, where the effects of both habitat selection (h) and conspecific attractions (c) are neutral (h = c = 1) and do not influence settlement. Clustered distributions occur when h · c > 1 because the fitness in clusters is greater than intrinsic fitness. Dispersed distributions occur when h · c < 1 and fitness is lower than the intrinsic. The benefit of the model is that it allows conspecific attraction to be considered a positive force in fitness without rejecting the proven concept of ideal free distribution." .

Participants included 410 early adolescents (53 % female; 51 % African American; Mean age =12.84 years) who completed measures of social anxiety and depressive symptoms at three time points (Times 1–3), as well as measures of general interpersonal stressors, peer victimization, and emotional maltreatment at Time 2. Path analyses revealed that interpersonal stressors, peer victimization, and emotional maltreatment predicted both depressive and social anxiety symptoms concurrently. However, depressive symptoms significantly mediated the pathway from interpersonal stressors, peer victimization, and familial emotional maltreatment to subsequent levels of social anxiety symptoms. In contrast, social anxiety did not mediate the relationship between these stressors and subsequent depressive symptoms. There was no evidence of sex or racial differences in these mediational pathways. Findings suggest that interpersonal stressors, including the particularly detrimental stressors of peer victimization and familial emotional maltreatment, may predict both depressive and social anxiety symptoms; however, adolescents who have more immediate depressogenic reactions may be at greater risk for later development of symptoms of social anxiety." .

Early adolescents (N = 244, 123 girls, M age 12.77 years) in Surrey, England responded to self-reports of friendship styles (preoccupied, avoidant), gender identity (typicality, contentedness), and well-being (self-esteem, depression). Girls reported higher scores than boys on the preoccupied friendship style, and lower scores than boys on the avoidant friendship style. Children who reported a cross gender style (preoccupied for boys and avoidant for girls) also reported poor well-being, indicating that self-perceived cross gender typing is distressing. However, these influences were buffered for youths who reported high levels of gender typicality and gender contentedness. Results suggest that gender identity plays a self-regulatory role in discounting self-perceived gender-atypical attributes that interfere with early adolescents’ sense of well-being." .

A sample (N = 362) of adults from communities in Metro Manila were asked to answer the scale, as well as measures of optimism, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated an adequate fit between the hypothesized four-factor structure and the data, but the internal locus-of-hope scale was found to have low internal consistency. Regression analysis showed positive associations between the internal and external-family locus-of-hope subscales and the three measures of wellbeing. But external-peers locus-of-hope was negatively associated with optimism and self-esteem, and external-spiritual locus-of-hope was positively related with optimism." .

Across the Russian regions, Republic of Tyva has one of the highest rates of child and adolescent suicide and the lowest life expectancy at birth. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and associations of mental health problems in Native Tyvinian children and adolescents using internationally recognised measures and diagnoses. A two-stage, two-phase design involved selection of schools in five rural settlements in Western Tyva and two schools in the capital city followed by selection of Native Tyvinian children in grades 3–4 (ages 9–10) and 6–7 (ages 14–15). In the first phase, a screening measure of psychopathology, the Rutter Teacher Questionnaire, was obtained on 1048 children with a 97 % participation rate. In the second phase, more detailed psychiatric assessments were carried out for subgroups of screen-positive and screen-negative children. The prevalence of mental health problems was about 25 %, ranging from 40 % in adolescent boys from rural areas to 9 % in adolescent girls from the city. The patterning of disorders and risk factors were similar to those in other countries, rural areas were associated with an increased risk of psychopathology. The findings indicate that there is an urgent need for interventions to reduce risk in this population and provide effective help for Tyvinian children and adolescents with mental health problems." .

Memory for the final position of a moving object is distorted forward along its path of motion (i.e., “representational momentum,” RM). This cognitive extrapolation of visual perception might compensate for the neural delay in interacting appropriately with a moving object. The present study examined whether experienced batters cognitively extrapolate the location of a fast-moving object and whether this extrapolation is associated with coincident timing control. Nine expert and nine novice baseball players performed a prediction motion task in which a target moved from one end of a straight 400-cm track at a constant velocity. In half of the trials, vision was suddenly occluded when the target reached the 200-cm point (occlusion condition). Participants had to press a button concurrently with the target arrival at the end of the track and verbally report their subjective assessment of the first target-occluded position. Experts showed larger RM magnitude (cognitive extrapolation) than did novices in the occlusion condition. RM magnitude and timing errors were strongly correlated in the fast velocity condition in both experts and novices, whereas in the slow velocity condition, a significant correlation appeared only in experts. This suggests that experts can cognitively extrapolate the location of a moving object according to their anticipation and, as a result, potentially circumvent neural processing delays. This process might be used to control response timing when interacting with moving objects." .

In Experiment 1 subjects saw 100 ms presentations of line drawings containing objects that were either usual or unusual given the picture context. Following each exposure they were required to select from among four objects the one that had been contained in the scene. The consistency of the three distractor alternatives with the meaning of the picture was varied. Recognition accuracy was poor for unusual objects and when the distractors were consistent with the picture meaning and did not substantially differ from the performance of subjects who selected response alternatives after being provided with a theme of the picture, without actually viewing the pictures. This supports the conclusion that subjects were responding on the basis of the global information but not the local object information in the pictures. When the exposure duration was increased to 2 s (Experiment 2), processing of local information was apparent for both usual and unusual objects but effects of the global information were still evident." .

A general theory based on the variation of the relative elements, i.e. the instantaneous differences between the orbital parameters of the subsatellite and those of the station, is formulated in order to incorporate arbitrary perturbing forces acting on both satellites. The loss of precision inherent in the subtraction of almost identical quantities is avoided by the consistent use of difference variables. In the absence of perturbations exact analytical representations can be obtained for the relative state parameters. The influences of air drag and Earth's oblateness on the relative motion trajectories are investigated and illustrated graphically for a number of cases." .

Some of the controversial defining features of DMs are tested on the occurrences of three Hungarian discourse markers: (1) mondjuk (‘let’s say’), (2) ugye (‘is that so?’), and (3) amúgy (‘otherwise’) in twenty spontaneous dialogues of the HuComTech corpus. The features in question regard their contextual environment (lexical co-occurrences, presence or absence of surrounding silence), position in the utterance, prosodic features (duration, fundamental frequency, pitch movement) and nonverbal-visual markers (the presence or absence of accompanying hand movements). Consequently, the findings of multimodal corpus queries in ELAN 4.5.1 and the statistical tests performed on them in SPSS 19.0 aim to identify the machine-detectable features of the different uses of DMs and distinguish the two most salient functions of each of the three DMs analyzed: 1. (a) lexical search/approximation versus (b) contrast/concession (expressed by mondjuk); 2. (a) question as a directive act versus (b) explanation as a constative act (expressed by ugye); and 3. (a) topic change versus (b) commenting/topic elaboration (expressed by amúgy). The findings suggest that the defining features distinguishing different functions are the duration of the DM and the simultaneous performance or cessation of manual gesticulation." .

Pre- to post-intervention service use and related costs were also analysed. A total of 103 families and their children (aged 32–88 months), who previously participated in a randomised controlled trial of the IYBP, took part in a 12-month follow-up assessment. Child and parent behaviour and well-being were measured using psychometric and observational measures. An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons were subsequently conducted to determine whether treatment outcomes were sustained 1 year post-baseline assessment. Results indicate that post-intervention improvements in child conduct problems, parenting behaviour and parental mental health were maintained. Service use and associated costs continued to decline. The results indicate that parent-focused interventions, implemented in the early years, can result in improvements in child and parent behaviour and well-being 12 months later. A reduced reliance on formal services is also indicated." .

In order to evaluate whether or not exercise during early learning of dance is beneficial, we asked dance-inexperienced older adults to perform in pairs a 30-min lesson of danzón. Motion capture and ground reaction force recordings were used to determine the variability of body sway during quiet, upright standing before and immediately after the lesson. Significant reductions in variability of sway normalized by body height were found following the dance exercise. Interestingly, the taller individual who was instructed to take the “leader” role showed greater gains. Our findings indicate that learning to dance danzón at a beginner’s level may be beneficial for balance in the elderly, despite the increased cognitive load in the early stages of skill acquisition." .

Naive conspecific intruders were then introduced into each colony for a 10-min test for 5 consecutive days. Videotapes of the tests were scored for aggressive and defensive behaviors. In every colony, aggression was greatest for a single alpha male. The alpha rats were randomly given one of three treatments: wheel-turn escape training, inescapable yoked shock, or restraint without shock. The alpha rats were then returned to their colonies and an intruder test was given 26 h later. Significant decreases in aggressive responses and increases in defensive behaviors occurred in the alpha yoked group but not in the other alpha groups. The nonalpha colony partners of the alpha yoked rats showed the opposite changes following the treatment. A final intruder test 72 h later revealed that the deficits in aggression of the alpha yoked group were still present but that the behaviors of most of the other groups were beginning to return to their respective pretreatment levels. These findings were discussed in terms of the concept of learned helplessness and alternative theoretical explanations." .

Head to head studies with double-blind methods are still relatively few in number. ObjectivesTo compare the relative cognitive enhancing effects of ziprasidone and olanzapine in the treatment of acutely ill inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. ProceduresIn this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-designed trial, patients were randomized to ziprasidone or olanzapine. No patient who had ever received a complete treatment trial with either of these medications previously was entered into the study. Cognitive testing measuring attention, motor speed, memory, executive functioning, and verbal skills were performed on all patients at baseline and endpoint. ResultsTreatment with either ziprasidone or olanzapine was associated with statistically significant improvements from baseline in attention, memory, working memory, motor speed, and executive functions. Treatment with olanzapine was also associated with a statistically significant improvement in verbal fluency. No statistically significant differences between these medications were found in the magnitude of improvement from baseline on any of the cognitive measures (other than verbal fluency in an exploratory analysis). Observed changes were not associated with changes in clinical symptoms measured using the PANSS or changes in movement disorders. ConclusionsDuring 6 weeks of treatment, ziprasidone and olanzapine demonstrated substantial and comparable cognitive-enhancing effects relative to previous treatment. These effects were noted in all aspects of cognitive functioning previously proven to predict functional outcome in schizophrenia. No overall differences were detected between the medications in terms of the extent of cognitive enhancement." .

This work intends to be a preliminary answer to this problem. A questionnaire with 10 items was administered to 217 mothers aged 26/45 years, with 1 (44%) or 2 (47%) children, and from different regions of central and southern Italy. The majority of the mothers had a memory of a supporting response by her family to her experience of pain. 50% of the mothers recalled an episode of physical pain and 20% an episode of moral pain. The memory of moral pain was more widespread in the South (71% of all the mothers). The definition of pain was negative (62%): pain was experienced either as a threat to health or a limitation to one's freedom. The children, conversely, dealt with pain in 67% of the cases by looking for their parents and asking for help; 33% dealt with pain alone. 91% of the mothers who become upset when they have pain have children who, when they are ill, behave in the same manner. It is in the South that the relationships in the family remain mainly unchanged (68%) on the occasion of an illness of a child, while it is in central Italy that these improve more easily. For mothers, pain is a substantially negative experience. The study shows that a family experience of pain is passed, as far as the manner of dealing with it is concernec, from one generation to another." .

The paper clarifies what acting as a group member involves, and it analytically characterizes the ‘‘we-mode’’ (thinking and acting as a group member) and the ‘‘I-mode’’ (thinking and acting as a private person). The main task of the paper is to clarify cooperation, and this is done by dividing cooperation into I-mode and we-mode cooperation. I-mode cooperation relies on the participants’ relevantly adjusting their goals toward others’ goals and actions to the benefit of all participants. We-mode cooperation basically amounts to joint action in the we-mode. These kinds of cooperation are also connected to the respective kinds of acting as a group member. The paper also investigates the relationship between cooperation and trust and, basically, argues that a two-way connection is involved." .

Experiment II demonstrated that the RT profile generated when subjects made centre-end or first/second half judgements about month positions was similar to that obtained for cued locations on a spatial array. This evidence for a linear representation contrasted with results from a forward-backward shift task (Experiment III) which suggested a directionally asymmetric circular representation. Retrieval of month names from cued locations on horizontal, vertical, or circular spatial arrays showed an effect of congruity of the external display and the subject's professed form (Experiment IV). There was an advantage for central locations in retrieval of month-digit and digit-month equivalences (Experiment V).

Stress assignment, especially to low frequency words, has been reported to be a function of stress dominance and stress neighbourhood. Two experiments investigate stress assignment in sixth-grade, skilled and dyslexic, readers. In Experiment 1, skilled readers were not affected by stress dominance. Dyslexic children, although affected by word frequency, made more stress regularisation errors on low frequency words. In Experiment 2, stress neighbourhood affected low frequency word reading irrespective of stress dominance for both skilled and dyslexic readers. Words with many stress friends were read more accurately than words with many stress enemies. It is concluded that, in assigning stress, typically developing and developmental dyslexic Italian readers are sensitive to the distributional properties of the language." .

Fewer studies have focused on their impact in adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS). The aim of this study is to examine the relationships and the predictive value of cognition and clinical variables on real-world daily living skills in a sample of adolescents with EOS. Cognitive, clinical and real-world everyday living skills measures were administered to 45 clinically and pharmacologically stabilized adolescent outpatients with EOS and 45 healthy control subjects matched by age and sex. Multi-variant analyses to compare cognitive and real-world functioning profiles between patients and controls and regression analysis to identify predictors of real-world functioning scores in patients were used. Adolescents with EOS showed a generalized cognitive and real-world daily living skills dysfunction. Several cognitive and clinical variables significantly correlated with real-world daily living skills functioning but only the processing speed and executive functions emerged as independent predictors of everyday living skills scores, explaining 25.1% of the variance. Slowness in processing information and executive dysfunction showed a significant impact on real-world daily living skills in EOS, independently from clinical symptoms and other cognitive variables. Nevertheless, much of the variance in the daily living skills measure remained unaccounted for, suggesting that other factors were involved as well in this young population." .

The springback of archwire did not consider the movement of the stress-strain-neutral layer. To solve this problem, a springback calculation model for rectangular orthodontic archwire is proposed. A bending springback experiment is conducted using an orthodontic archwire bending springback measurement device. The springback experimental results show that the theoretical calculation results using the proposed model coincide better with the experimental testing results than when movement of the stress-strain-neutral layer was not considered. A bending experiment with rectangular orthodontic archwire is conducted using a robotic orthodontic archwire bending system. The patient expriment result show that the maximum and minimum error ratios of formed orthodontic archwire parameters are 22.46% and 10.23% without considering springback and are decreased to 11.35% and 6.13% using the proposed model.

Forty-three mother–child dyads and 38 of the children's teachers participated in this investigation. Preadolescent children reported the marital conflict they witnessed, their coping responses to marital conflict, and their feelings of depression and global self-worth, while mothers reported their marital conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and teachers reported children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the contribution of demographic, marital conflict, and child coping variables to the prediction of child adjustment. The results indicated that aggressive marital conflict was predictive of children's feelings of low self-worth, mother's reports of child externalizing behavior problems, and teacher's reports of child internalizing behavior problems. Moreover, child coping factors contributed unique variances to the prediction of child reports of child depression and teacher reports of child externalizing behavior problems after marital conflict and demographic variables were considered." .

However, this type of gearing with crossed axes has no common plane of action which results in a point contact and low tooth durability. Therefore, a geometry design approach assuming line contact is developed to analyze the tooth engagement process of crossed beveloid gears with small shaft angle for marine transmission applications. The loaded gear tooth contact behavior is simulated by applying a quasi-static analysis to study the effects of gearing parameters on mesh characteristics. Using the proposed method, a series of sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of critical gearing parameters such as shaft angle, cone angle, helix angle and profile-shift coefficient on the theoretical gear mesh is performed. The parametric analysis of pitch cone design shows that the dominant design parameters represented by the angle between the first principle directions (FPD) and normal angular factor are more sensitive to the shaft and cone angles than they are to the helix angle. The theoretical contact path is highly sensitive to the profile-shift coefficient, which is determined from the theoretical tooth contact analysis. The FPD angle is found to change the distribution of contact pattern, contact pressure and root stress as well as the translational transmission error and the variation of the mesh stiffness significantly. The contact pattern is clearly different between the drive and coast sides due to different designed FPD angles. Finally, a practical experimental setup for marine transmission is performed and tooth bearing test is conducted to demonstrate the proposed design procedure. The experimental result compared well with the simulation. Results of this study yield a better understanding of the geometry design and loaded gear mesh characteristics for crossed beveloid gears used in marine transmission." .

The paper studies four of these semantics and shows to what extent their differences for a given SD (that is the amount of ambiguity of this diagram) comes from its structural properties (linearity, local control and local causality). The fulfilment of these properties can serve as a measure of the ambiguity of a SD, and thus the attention to be paid at its validation." .

Burnout was measured as both a three-dimensional measure comprised of exhaustion, unaccomplishment and depersonalization, and as a single dimension (a composite score including all three dimensions). A sample of 322 Israeli teachers completed a self-report questionnaire. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and multiple regression analysis were used. It was found that perceived sense of self-efficacy was inversely correlated with perceived burnout: the lower the sense of self-efficacy, the higher the perceived burnout. The salience of organizational influence efficacy, and consideration efficacy (both are relations efficacies) were noted as important variables in predicting exhaustion, unaccomplishment and depersonalization. Task efficacies (e.g., instruction, discipline control, and inclusion) had no significant or meaningful weight in statistically predicting burnout beyond the relations efficacies. The importance of the organizational self-efficacy (teachers' beliefs in their ability to influence social and political forces within the organization, involvement in planning and executing important activities, as well as ability to draw upon the organization's resources to provide support and assistance) was discussed." .

It is based on an investigation of the social identities developed by and about youth learners in these circumstances. In particular we examine the creation of identity positions by youth on academic programs regarding themselves and people like them (in-group characteristics) on the one hand and for other kinds of students on the other, on vocational programs. These constructions are analyzed as a product of self-categorization theory. The investigation involved 224 students from upper-secondary school academic programs. Our results showed that the academic program students expressed strong stereotypes with extremely negative potentials in relation to future social solidarity and equity. On the basis of the findings we strongly recommend introducing mixed classes in upper-secondary school, where students from academic and vocational programs take the same courses in general subjects as a way of reducing stereotypes and prejudice." .

Data are from the first wave of the Norwegian Life Course, Ageing and Generation (NorLAG) study (n = 5,189). We separate outcomes into cognitive (life satisfaction and self-esteem) and affective (positive and negative affect, depression, loneliness) components. Parental status has a net effect on cognitive well-being among women, as childless women report significantly lower life satisfaction and self-esteem than both mothers with residential children and empty nest mothers. However, motherhood is inconsequential for affective well-being. Among men, parental status is unrelated to any of the well-being aspects. Parental status effects are not modified by age, marital status, and education. The results demonstrate the importance of investigating the effect of parental status and other objective circumstances on a range of psychological well-being outcomes. Furthermore, the results reviewed and presented indicate somewhat more positive effects of parenthood in the Nordic countries than in the US, highlighting the role of social policies in shaping the impact of parental status on well-being." .

A systematic review of studies of psychological interventions to treat depressive disorder in pre-adolescent children (aged up to 12-years-old) was carried out. The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms. Studies were found using Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge databases and selected on several criteria. Only randomised controlled trials were included. Where individual studies covered a broader age range (usually including adolescents up to age 18 years), authors of those studies were contacted and requested to provide individual patient level data for those aged 12 years and younger. 2822 abstracts were reviewed, and from these 124 full text articles were reviewed, yielding 7 studies for which we were able to access appropriate data for this review. 5 of these studies evaluated cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Combined results from these studies suggest that there is a lack of evidence that CBT is better than no treatment [standard mean difference −0.342 (95 % confidence interval −0.961, 0.278)], although the number of participants included in the trials was relatively small. The evidence for efficacy of family therapy and psychodynamic therapy is even more limited. The very limited number of participants in randomised controlled trials means that there is inconclusive evidence for the psychological treatment of depression in children aged 12 years and below. Given the prevalence and significant impact of this disorder, there is an urgent need to establish the effectiveness or otherwise of psychological intervention." .

Yet, our ability to quantify such threats to patient safety remains inadequate. Data are needed to gauge how the laparoscopic operating room work environment, where the visual and motor axes are no longer aligned, contributes to such disruptions. We used time motion analysis techniques to measure surgeon attention during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in order to characterize disruptive events imposed by the work environment of the OR. In this investigation we identify attention disruptions as they occur in terms of the operating surgeon’s gaze. We then quantify such disruptions and also seek to establish what occasioned them. MethodsTen laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures were recorded with both intra- and extracorporeal cameras. The views were synchronized to produce a video that was subsequently analyzed by a single independent observer. Each time the surgeon’s gaze was diverted from the operation’s video display, the event was recorded via time-stamp. The reason for looking away (e.g., instrument exchange), when discernable, was also recorded and categorized. Disruptions were then reviewed and analyzed by an interdisciplinary team of surgeons and human factors experts. ResultsGaze disruptions were classified into one of four causal categories: instrument exchange, extracorporeal work, equipment troubleshooting, and communication. On average, 40 breaks occurred in operating surgeon attention per 15 min of operating time. The most frequent reasons for these disruptions involved instrument exchange (38%) and downward gaze for extracorporeal work (28%). ConclusionsThis study of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performance reveals a high gaze disruption rate in the current operating room work environment. Improvements aimed at reducing such disruptions—and thus potentially surgical error—should center on better instrument design and realigning the axis between surgeon’s eye and visual display." .

MethodsOne hundred and twelve women who were taking adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) for breast cancer completed measures of physical symptoms, self-efficacy for coping with symptoms, and functional, social, and emotional well-being at the time of routine medical follow-up (women were on average 3.4 years post-surgery; range 3 months to 11 years). ResultsMultiple linear regression analyses showed that higher self-efficacy for coping with symptoms was associated with greater functional, emotional, and social well-being after controlling for physical symptoms (p < 0.05). Self-efficacy for coping with symptoms moderated the relationship between physical symptoms and functional (B = 0.05, SE = 0.02, t = 2.67, p = 0.009) and emotional well-being (B = 0.03, SE = 0.01, t = 2.45, p = 0.02). As self-efficacy increased, the relationship between greater physical symptoms and lower well-being became weaker. Among women with high levels of self-efficacy, physical symptoms were not related to functional and emotional well-being. ConclusionsSelf-efficacy for coping with symptoms may reduce the negative impact of physical symptoms and contribute to well-being in breast cancer survivors taking adjuvant endocrine therapy. Future studies could examine whether psychosocial interventions aimed at increasing self-efficacy for managing symptoms help women better cope with treatment side effects and improve quality of life." .

But even though several authors have tried to conceptualise fatigue, its mechanisms are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was twofold: (a) to explore fatigue in cancer patients inductively, and (b) to compare experiences of fatigue/tiredness of healthy individuals with those of cancer patients to identify cancer-specific fatigue/tiredness and related concepts. A qualitative research strategy was adopted using a grounded-theory approach. The prospective study took place in the oncology department of the Kantonsspital, St. Gallen, Switzerland, with samples of 20 cancer patients and 20 healthy individuals. Unstructured, tape-recorded interviews were conducted to collect data. The transcripts of the interviews were analysed using content analysis and constant comparison. Different themes emerged between the two groups although both fitted a classification system that categorised fatigue into physical, affective and cognitive expressions of fatigue/tiredness. Physical signs were more frequent than affective and cognitive signs in both groups. In the cancer patients, fatigue involved decreased physical performance, extreme, unusual tiredness, weakness and an unusual need for rest, which was distinctly different for healthy persons. Affective and cognitive distress was also more prominent in cancer patients. Interestingly, the concept of malaise was not identified by either sample and not understood as an expression of fatigue by this German-speaking population. Linguistic differences in the description of fatigue/tiredness between healthy and ill individuals revealed different perceptions of the phenomenon. A step-like theory, explaining the production of fatigue/tiredness was tentatively put forward involving nociception, perception and expression of tiredness. The emerging concepts break tiredness/fatigue into an expression of physical, affective and cognitive tiredness/fatigue. The experience is different between healthy individuals and cancer patients. Care must be taken when drawing generalised conclusions but the results of the study identify and clarify ideas that might form an important basis for further, controlled studies." .

However, among realists, there is controversy over whether it is possible to improve trials by making them realist, or whether realism and the philosophical assumptions underlying trials are incompatible. This paper contributes to the debate in Trials on this issue. The debate thus far has concentrated on the possibility of combining trial methodology with that of realist evaluation. Main bodyWe concur with the contention that it is not feasible to combine randomised controlled trial design with the realist evaluation approach. However, we argue that a different variant of realism, critical realism, provides a more appropriate theoretical grounding for realist trials.In contrast to realist evaluation, which regards social mechanisms as an amalgam of social resources and people’s reasoning, critical realism insists on their distinction. It does so on the basis of its assertion of the need to distinguish between social structures (in which resources lie) and human agency (which is at least partly guided by reasoning). From this perspective, conceiving of social mechanisms as external to participants can be seen as a valid methodological strategy for supplementing the exclusive concentration of trials on outcomes.While accepting realist evaluation’s insistence that causality in open systems involves a configuration of multiple generative mechanisms, we adopt the critical realist interpretation of the experimental method, which sees it as creating artificial closure in order to identify the effects of specific causal mechanisms. If randomised controlled trials can be regarded as epidemiological proxies that substitute probabilistic controls over extraneous factors for closed experiments, their examination of the powers of discrete mechanisms through observation of the variation of outcomes is appropriate. ConclusionWhile there are still issues to be resolved, critical realist randomised controlled trials are possible and have the potential to overcome some of the difficulties faced by traditional trial designs in accounting for the influence of social context and individual interpretation." .

A dynamic peephole interface (without visual context beyond the device display) was compared to a magic lens interface (with video see-through augmentation of external visual context). The task was to explore items on a map and look for a specific attribute. We tested different sizes of visual context as well as different numbers of items per area, i.e. different item densities. Hand motion patterns and eye movements were recorded. We found that visual context is most effective for sparsely distributed items and gets less helpful with increasing item density. User performance in the magic lens case is generally better than in the dynamic peephole case, but approaches the performance of the latter the more densely the items are spaced. In all conditions, subjective feedback indicates that participants generally prefer visual context over the lack thereof. The insights gained from this study are relevant for designers of mobile AR and dynamic peephole interfaces, involving spatially tracked personal displays or combined personal and public displays, by suggesting when to use visual context." .

Our work is based on training a number of synthesis images of each face taken at single lighting direction with frontal/posture view. This way of synthesizing images can be used to build training cases for each face under different known illumination conditions from which face recognition can be significantly improved. However, reconstructing face shape may not easily be achieved and the human face images usually form by highly complex structure which suffers from strong specular and unknown reflective conditions. In this paper, these limitations are addressed by Cho and Chow (IEEE Trans Neural Netw 12(5):1204–1214, 2002). Face surfaces are recovered by this GNR model and face images in different poses are synthesized to create a database for training. Our training algorithm assigns to recognize the face identity by similarity measure on face features extracting first by the principle component analysis (PCA) method and then further processing by the Fisher’s discrimination analysis (FDA) to acquire lower dimensional patterns. Experimental results conducted on the Yale Face Database B show that lower error rates of classification and recognition are achieved under different variations in lighting and pose and the performance significantly outperforms the recognition without using the proposed GNR model." .

The sample was drawn from the Sexual Assault Among Latinas (SALAS) Study that surveyed 2,000 self-identified adult Latino women. The random digit dial methodology employed in high-density Latino neighborhoods resulted in a cooperation rate of 53.7%. Women who experienced lifetime victimization (n = 714) reported help-seeking efforts in response to their most distressful victimization event that occurred in the US. Approximately one-third of the women reported formal help-seeking and about 70% of women reported informal help-seeking. Help-seeking responses were generally not predicted by the cultural factors measured, with some exceptions. Anglo orientation and negative religious coping increased the likelihood of formal help-seeking. Positive religious coping, masculine gender role and Anglo acculturation increased the likelihood of specific forms of informal help-seeking. Latino orientation decreased the likelihood of talking to a sibling. Overall, these findings reinforce the importance of bilingual culturally competent services as cultural factors shape the ways in which women respond to victimization either formally or within their social networks." .

Measures of mate retention historically have focused on individual mate retention—behaviors that individuals perform alone. The current research explores coalitional mate retention (CMR)—mate retention with assistance from allies. Using an act nomination procedure, we constructed the CMR Inventory (CMRI) to assess specific CMR behaviors. In study 1, participants (n = 100) provided open-ended responses in which they nominated CMR behaviors. In study 2, participants (n = 387) provided frequency reports on the 44 CMR behaviors identified in study 1. We conducted principal component analyses to guide construction of the CMRI, which assesses seven components of CMRI: manipulation (e.g., “got my partner drunk to see what my partner said”), praise (e.g., “said nice things about me when my partner and other people were around”), vigilance (e.g., “observed how my partner acted around people interested in my partner”), monopolizing time (e.g., “accompanied my partner to a party”), therapy (e.g., “told my partner how much I liked my partner”), gifts (e.g., “told me what gifts my partner wanted”), and violence (e.g., “hit someone who was flirting with my partner”).

Performative versions of constructionist accounts explain these thoughts and behaviors as part of an intentional, strategic performance that is elicited and regulated by our representations of ourselves. This paper has four aims. First, I sketch a causal model of performative social constructionist claims. Second, I articulate a puzzling feature of performative claims that makes them seem especially implausible: the puzzle of intention and ignorance. Like other constructionists, performative constructionists are especially interested in explaining thoughts and behaviors that are widely but mistakenly believed to be the unintentional consequences of membership in a natural kind. But why doesn’t the intentional performance of a category undermine this ignorance? My third aim is to resolve this puzzle. I suggest that a plausible understanding can be found in the failure to locate one’s mental states in a causal explanation of one’s thoughts and actions. Finally, I argue that this model implies that the sorts of theories we (as a community or as a culture) offer of particular behaviors can create or destroy agency and responsibility with regard to those behaviors." .

The common effects of these disorders on substance abuse need further investigation. The current study investigated the joint clusters of childhood/adolescence ADHD, CD, and ODD, and their influence on substance abuse/dependence in a population-based sample of adults. MethodsThe data were drawn from the PsyCoLaus study (n = 3,720) conducted in Lausanne, Switzerland. The population-based sample included 238 subjects meeting criteria for ADHD/ODD/CD diagnoses before the age of 15. Latent class analyses (LCA) were performed to derive comorbidity subtypes, which were subsequently characterized with respect to psychosocial correlates and substance use. ResultsThe best fit in LCAs was achieved with three latent classes: an ADHD subtype (35.7 %); an externalizing multimorbid subtype (33.6 %) involving ODD, ADHD, and CD; and a third subtype with CD (30.7 %). The CD subtype showed the highest association with substance use. Apart from this, the externalizing multimorbid subtype was also significantly linked to substance use. The ADHD subtype had only elevated frequencies for alcohol dependence in comparison with subjects that had no history of ADHD, ODD, and CD during childhood or adolescence. Finally, important interactions between subtypes and sex were observed with regard to substance use. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence showing that subtyping the externalizing disorders, ADHD, ODD and CD, along their comorbidity patterns leads to important differences regarding substance use. This could have implications for the etiology, prevention, and treatment of substance use disorders." .

Pictures, obtained from the model, were examined as to whether they were interpreted unambiguously or not. Results show that the model, simulated selective attention, can disambiguate the ambiguous figures.

Conventionally, surgical teams are formed shortly before the start of the surgery, and team skills are built during the surgery. There is a need to establish a training simulation to improve surgical team skills without jeopardizing the safety of surgery. The Legacy Inanimate System for Laparoscopic Team Training (LISETT) is a bench simulation designed to enhance surgical team skills. The reported project tested the construct validity of LISETT. The research question was whether the LISETT scores show progressive improvement correlating with the level of surgical training and laparoscopic team experience or not. MethodsWith LISETT, two surgeons are required to work closely to perform two laparoscopic tasks: peg transportation and suturing. A total of 44 surgical dyad teams were recruited, composed of medical students, residents, laparoscopic fellows, and experienced surgeons. The LISETT scores were calculated according to the speed and accuracy of the movements. ResultsThe LISETT scores were positively correlated with surgical experience, and the results can be generalized confidently to surgical teams (Pearson’s coefficient, 0.73; p = 0.001). To analyze the influences of individual skill and team dynamics on LISETT performance, team quality was rated by team members using communication and cooperation characters after each practice. The LISETT scores are positively correlated with self-rated team quality scores (Pearson’s coefficient, 0.39; p = 0.008). ConclusionsThe findings proved LISETT to be a valid system for assessing cooperative skills of a surgical team. By increasing practice time, LISETT provides an opportunity to build surgical team skills, which include effective communication and cooperation." .

In the latter case learning relates to the quality rather than to the quantity of experience. Regarding the antecedents of organizational learning especially, there are still unanswered questions remaining; for example, the questions what kind of experience has a positive effect on performance and what kind of experience is more of a hindrance than a help. This becomes obvious when looking at acquisitions as examples of strategic management decisions. Results of prior empirical studies analyzing the relationship of acquisition experience and acquisition performance have been mixed. By introducing the concept of strategic consistency, we intend to facilitate a better understanding of the kind of experience necessary for organizational learning. Therefore, we measure the concordance and frequency of change in strategic actions. Employing a sample of 379 acquisition series, we find evidence for a positive transfer effect of strategic consistency within series and, therefore, a positive relationship between strategic consistency and acquisition performance." .

In this study, we examined domain differences in beliefs about category boundaries among young children (5-year-olds). The results indicated that young children, like adults, were less likely to endorse graded category membership for animal than for artifact categories. These domain differences could not be attributed to domain differences in typicality. Implications for conceptual development and for models of domain specificity in adult cognition are discussed." .

Twenty-four subjects were assigned to one of four groups: (a) cognitive restructuring, in which individuals were trained at identifying and criticizing the negative ideas about themselves; (b) cognitive rehearsal, in which subjects underwent a program consisting of identifying and rehearsing statements about positive personal characteristics; (c) self-observation, in which subjects were given practice in self-observing thoughts associated with positive and negative feelings about themselves; and (d) delayed treatment control, which consisted of administering both cognitive strategies to subjects after the posttest. Following a 4-week treatment phase, there were no significant differences in the enhancement of self-esteem and the reduction of depressive feelings in the case of either of the cognitive strategies. No significant therapeutic advantage was observed in combining both these procedures. In comparison with the self-observation group, only the cognitive treatment groups fared significantly better than the waiting-list control group. The relationship between cognitive restructuring and cognitive rehearsal and the role of self-observation in these procedures are discussed. It is suggested that the feelings of self-worth are more strongly influenced by the quality than by the quantity of self-appraisals." .

This new paradigm not only aims to give new ways for explaining mental diseases by naturalizing them, but also to have an influence on different levels of psychiatric norms. We tried here to verify whether a biological paradigm is able to fulfill this normative goal. We analyzed three main normative assumptions that is to say the will of giving psychiatry a valid nosology, a rigorous definition of what is a mental disease, and new tools for destigmatizing mentally ill patients. Although these different kinds of normativity are very heterogeneous, we must conclude that, in all these cases, biological psychiatry is a failure, in part because of a lack of epistemological conceptualization." .

Moreover, the cholinergic system plays a key role in the early neurodevelopmental processes believed to be derailed early in life in individuals with the disorder. Yet, there is no data from human infants supporting a developmentally important role of this neurotransmitter system. Because the pupillary light reflex depends largely on cholinergic synaptic transmission, we assessed this reflex in a sample of infants at risk for autism as well as infants at low (average) risk. MethodsTen-month-old infants with an older sibling with autism (n = 29, 16 females), and thus a genetic predisposition to developing the disorder themselves, were presented with white flashes on a computer monitor, and pupillary responses were captured using eye tracking. A control group matched on age and developmental level (n = 15, seven females) was also tested. ResultsThe siblings of children with autism had a faster and stronger pupillary light reflex compared to control infants. Baseline pupil diameter was equal in the two groups, ruling out tonic autonomic imbalance as an explanation for these differences. ConclusionsThis study establishes that infant siblings of children with autism have hypersensitive pupillary light reflexes, a result which supports the view that altered sensory processing in infancy is associated with elevated autism risk. Moreover, the study indicates that individual differences in autism susceptibility are linked to differences in the cholinergic system during an early developmental period." .

All the participants learned a list of adjective-noun pairs. Then the adjectives were presented as cues for recalling half of the nouns and as cues for suppressing the other half, 0, 2, or 12 times.Aided participants were provided with substitute nouns, to use during suppression. On a final test that requested recall of all initially learned nouns, aided participants showed evidence of below-baseline forgetting of suppressed nouns.Unaided participants produced below-baseline forgetting only if their later self-reports indicated that they had complied relatively well with instructions for suppression. Independently, forgetting in the unaided condition was more successful when the participants reportedly thought about something else during suppression trials. In general, the use of selfinitiated strategiesseems to affect the degree of forgetting in the think/no-think paradigm." .

In the study, participants read sentences describing a transfer either away from (“I threw the tennis ball to my rival”) or toward themselves (“My rival threw me the tennis ball”). When the transfer verb appeared on the screen, and after a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), a visual motion cue (Experiment 1) or a static cue (Experiment 2) prompted participants to move their hand either away from or toward themselves to press a button. The results showed meaning–action interference at short SOAs and facilitation at the longest SOA for the matching conditions. These results support the hypothesis that motor processes associated with the comprehension of action-related language interfere with an overlapping motor task, whereas they facilitate a delayed motor task. These effects are discussed in terms of resonance processes in the motor cortex." .

Discussion of a test result between parent and child is both a transformative and a translational moment in the life of a family. Parents report wanting help in talking to their children. The challenge for genetic counselors and other providers is to be able to recognize which issues are at the core of parental distress and be able to offer recommendations to empower and support parents. The complexity of potential genetic findings, including variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and incidental findings have vastly increased, requiring considerable explanation and leaving less time for discussion of emotional issues. While the nature of the testing (single gene to multigene panel and genomic testing) is dramatically changing, the nature of parent concerns remains remarkably constant. Families differ in many respects, so no “recipe” suffices to answer parents’ questions about how this important task should be approached in each family. Successful consultation to parents requires true counseling, matching parents’ fears and questions with information, exploration and advice specific to their concerns, their circumstances and strengths." .

Specifically, the current study tested the incremental validity of perceived control over anxiety-related events in predicting menstrual symptom severity, controlling for the effect of anxiety sensitivity, a documented contributor to menstrual distress. It was expected that women with lower perceived control over anxiety-related events would report greater menstrual symptom severity, particularly in the premenstrual phase. A sample of 49 normally menstruating women, aged 18–47 years, each prospectively tracked their menstrual symptoms for one cycle and completed the Anxiety Control Questionnaire (Rapee, Craske, Brown, & Barlow Behav Ther 27:279–293. doi:10.1016/S0005-7894(96)80018-9, 1996) in their follicular and premenstrual phases. A mixed model analysis revealed perceived control over anxiety-related events was a more prominent predictor of menstrual symptom severity than anxiety sensitivity, regardless of the current cycle phase. This finding provides preliminary evidence that perceived control over anxiety-related events is associated with the perceived intensity of menstrual symptoms. This finding highlights the role of psychological vulnerabilities in menstrual distress. Future research should examine whether psychological interventions that target cognitive vulnerabilities to anxiety may help reduce severe menstrual distress." .

These differences were explored in terms of personal characteristics, psychological difficulties, environmental factors, and manner of internet use. MethodsA representative sample was investigated, consisting of 18,709 adolescents aged 11–16 and their parents, from 25 European countries. Excessive internet use was measured using a five item scale covering following factors: salience, conflict, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse and reinstatement. The main data analysis utilised multinomial and binary logistic regression models. ResultsThe vast majority of respondents reported no signs of excessive internet use. Moderately excessive users (4.4 %) reported higher emotional and behavioural difficulties, but also more sophisticated digital skills and a broader range of online activities. The highly excessive users (1.4 %) differed from the non-excessive and moderately excessive users in their preference for online games and in having more difficulties with self-control. ConclusionsAdolescents who struggle with attention and self-control and who are inclined toward online gaming may be especially vulnerable to the otherwise uncommon phenomenon of excessive internet use." .

An 8-week school-based MM program was provided to high school students (N = 35; 19 boys and 16 girls). Concept mapping, a mixed-method approach, was used to collect and analyze the data. This process yielded eight clusters representing the perceived benefits of meditation for students: improved stress management, enhanced self-awareness, enhanced emotional coping, enhanced ability to pay attention, improved state of mind, more time spent being calm, improved school climate, and enhanced student engagement. These clusters encompass three broad domains of perceived benefits for students including intrapersonal, psychosocial, and systemic benefits. Students rated the potential for meditation to relieve stress and to improve school climate as particularly important for them. These findings may be used when planning school-based meditation programs and may serve as a useful guide for researchers studying meditation practices for youth." .

This study evaluated whether Hewitt and Flett's perfectionism specific vulnerability model (1993) could account for persistence of depression symptoms over a 1-year period in a group of 157 outpatients with major depressive disorder. All analyses controlled for Time 1 depression symptoms. The main findings were that self-oriented perfectionism interacted with achievement related but not interpersonal life events to predict nonremission at Time 2. The interaction between self-oriented perfectionism and achievement-related life events predicted Time 2 BDI scores at a trend level only (p = .06). Socially prescribed perfectionism was strongly associated with concurrent depression symptoms at Time 1, but did not interact with interpersonal or achievement life events to predict Time 2 outcome and did not predict Time 2 outcome as a main effect. The results provide support for the role of perfectionism in the persistence of depression and for the specific role of self-oriented perfectionism in vulnerability to depression in the context of achievement life events." .

Their notion of the baptism of natural kinds- the process by which kind terms are initially introduced into the language — is of special concern here. I argue that their accounts leave some ambiguities that suggest a baptism of objects and kinds that is free of additional theoretical commitments. Both authors suggest that we name the stuff and then let the scientists tell us what properties it really has, and hence what the real meaning is. I contend that such a barren baptism, taken at face value, cannot succeed in the semantic roles it has been assigned and that softening the stance on baptism suggests a more subtle and complex relation between reference and theoretical commitment than has emerged thus far." .

Previous research found that distinct networks of regions across cortex are activated depending on the attended feature. These networks typically consist of posterior feature-preferring regions and anterior regions involved in attentional processes. In the current study, we investigated the role of white matter connections between the posterior and anterior regions within these networks for attention to features of novel colored dynamic objects. We asked participants to perform a 1-back feature-attention task while we acquired both functional and diffusion-weighted images. Using tract-based spatial statistics and probabilistic tractography, we found that the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) connected posterior and anterior object-processing regions and that voxels within the SLF correlated with response times on the task. Posterior and anterior regions that were anatomically connected also had increased functional connectivity relative to posterior and anterior regions that were not connected. Our results demonstrate that both functional and structural information has to be taken into account to understand selective attention and object perception." .

However, the nature of the association and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. A number of theoretical models have drawn inspiration from research into Artificial Neural Networks. Crick and Mitchinson's ‘unlearning’ and Robins and McCallum's ‘pseudo-rehearsal’ models suggest alternative mechanisms through which sleep could contribute to learning. In this paper we present simulations, suggesting a possible synthesis. Our simulations use a modified version of a Hopfield network to model the possible contribution of sleep to memory consolidation. Sleep is simulated by removing all sensory input to the network and by exposing it to a ‘noise’, intended as a highly abstract model of the signals generated by the Ponto-geniculate-occipital system during sleep. The results show that simulated sleep does indeed contribute to learning and that the relationship between the observed effect and the length of simulated sleep can be represented by a U-shaped curve. It is shown that while high-amplitude, low-frequency noise (reminiscent of NREM sleep) leads to a general reinforcement of memory, low-amplitude, high-frequency noise (as observed in REM sleep) leads to ‘forgetting’ of all but the strongest memory traces. This suggests that a combination of the two kinds of sleep might produce a stronger effect than either kind of sleep on its own and that effective consolidation of memory during sleep may depend not just on REM or NREM sleep but on the overall dynamics of the sleep cycle." .

Recent studies have shown that this effect, known as inhibition of return (IOR), can occur at multiple cued locations, and is enhanced when multiple cues are presented at the same spatial location. However, little is known about how the magnitude of IOR at one spatial location is influenced by a subsequent or preceding cue presented at a different spatial location. We investigated this issue by presenting single or multiple cues at varying inter-cue intervals prior to target onset. Results suggest that the magnitude of IOR at a given location is influenced by the presentation of a preceding cue, but that once IOR occurs, it is unaffected by the presentation of a subsequent cue." .

Subjects filled out a perception of swallow function form. Measures of stimulated salivary flow rate were also taken, and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing was completed. The amount of saliva produced by patients with SS was significantly less than that produced by normal age-matched controls, and these patients perceived their swallowing to be impaired. Few statistically significant differences were found between the SS group and normal age-matched controls on temporal measures of swallowing, and 96% of swallows in the SS group were judged to be functional. There was no correlation between perception of swallowing and amount of saliva produced. No strong correlations were found between temporal measures of swallowing and salivary flow rate. Results indicated that patients with SS tend to perceive their swallowing to be worse than physiologic swallowing measures indicate. The decreased saliva production in these patients does not appear to be the cause of their perceived swallowing difficulty but may affect their sensory judgment of swallow function. Future studies will focus on how quality of saliva affects swallowing in these patients." .

ABAIS provides a generic adaptive framework for integrating a variety of user assessment methods (e.g. knowledge-based, self-reports, diagnostic tasks, physiological sensing), and GUI adaptation strategies (e.g. content- and format-based). The ABAIS performance bias prediction is based on empirical findings from emotion research combined with detailed knowledge of the task context. The initial ABAIS prototype was demonstrated in the context of an Air Force combat task, used a knowledge-based approach to assess the pilot’s anxiety level, and adapted to the pilot’s anxiety and belief states by modifying selected cockpit instrument displays in response to detected changes in these states." .

Estimates of the prevalence of postnatal maternal anxiety (PMA) range from 3% to 43%, suggesting PMA may be an important risk factor for adverse outcomes in children. This review summarizes what is known about the effects of PMA exposure on children and makes recommendations for future research. A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE® and PsychINFO® through 2008 identified 18 studies that evaluated child outcomes associated with PMA exposure. Identified studies covered three domains: somatic, developmental, and psychological outcomes. The strongest evidence for an adverse effect of PMA exposure is in somatic and psychological outcomes; the evidence for an effect of PMA on child development is inconclusive. Methodological differences among the studies make comparisons difficult and there are a number of common limitations that challenge the validity of these studies." .

Based on common coding ideas, we would think that ability and perceptions of ability from watching should be well matched. We conducted two studies to answer these questions that involved repeated observation of a 2-ball juggling task. After each video observation, observers judged if they could perform the skill and gave a confidence score (0–100 %). In Experiment 1, an Observe-only group was compared to an Observe + Physical practice and No-practice group. Both observer groups showed a better physical approximation of the juggling action after practice and in retention and their confidence increased in a linear fashion. Confidence showed a small, yet significant relationship to actual success. In Experiment 2, we limited physical practice to 5 attempts (across 50 observation trials). In general, people who had high perceptions of ability following a demonstration were overconfident, whereas those with lower perceptions of ability were accurate in their assessments. Confidence generally increased across practice, particularly for trials following observation rather than physical practice. We conclude that while perceptions of ability and actual ability show congruence across trials and individuals, observational practice increases people’s confidence in their ability to perform a skill, even despite physical experiences to the contrary." .

Prior to engaging in a cognitive task, subjects focused on factors that could enhance or impair their performance. They then indicated their perceived self-efficacy on the activity and performed the task. Dwelling on factors that could impair performance diminished judgments of self-efficacy. Group differences in subsequent task persistence paralleled the differences in self-efficacy judgments. Regression analyses provided evidence that judgments of self-efficacy mediated the behavioral effects. Subjects displayed nearly identical levels of performance motivation whether or not they recorded self-efficacy judgments. The results are interpreted in terms of the availability heuristic. Self-efficacy judgments generally may reflect a small set of highly available personal and situational factors; focusing on particular aspects of an activity heightens the availability of these features, biasing efficacy judgments, which, in turn, regulate subsequent behavior." .

To assess underlying mechanisms between eye blinks and traditional creativity tasks, we investigated the relationship between creativity performance and eye blinks at rest and during tasks. Participants performed an alternative uses and remote association task while eye blinks were recorded. Results showed that the relationship between eye blinks at rest and creativity performance was compatible with those of previous research. Interestingly, we found that the generation of ideas increased as a function of eye blink number during the alternative uses task. On the other hand, during the remote association task, accuracy was independent of eye blink number during the task, but response time increased with it. Moreover, eye blink changes in participants who responded quickly during the remote association task were different depending on their resting state eye blinks; that is, participants with many eye blinks during rest showed little increasing eye blinks and achieved solutions quickly. Positive correlations between eye blinks during creative tasks and yielding ideas on the alternative uses task and response time on the remote association task suggest that eye blinks during creativity tasks relate to divergent thinking processes such as conceptual reorganization." .

No studies have compared rates of these behaviours in TSC with those in other syndrome groups matched for degree of disability or investigated risk markers for these behaviours in TSC. MethodsData from the Challenging Behaviour Questionnaire were collected for 37 children, aged 4 to 15 years, with TSC. Odds ratios were used to compare rates of self-injury and aggression in children with TSC with children with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X, Cornelia de Lange and Down syndromes. Characteristics were measured using the Mood Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire, the Activity Questionnaire, the Social Communication Questionnaire, the Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire, the Wessex Behaviour Schedule and the revised Non-communicating Children Pain Checklist. Mann-Whitney U analyses were used to compare characteristics between individuals with self-injury and aggression and those not showing these behaviours. ResultsRates of self-injury and aggression in TSC were 27% and 50%, respectively. These are high but not significantly different from rates in children with Down syndrome or other syndrome groups. Both self-injury and aggression were associated with stereotyped and pain-related behaviours, low mood, hyperactivity, impulsivity and repetitive use of language. Children who engaged in self-injury also had lower levels of interest and pleasure and showed a greater degree of ‘insistence on sameness’ than children who did not self-injure. Aggression was associated with repetitive behaviour. The majority of these associations remained significant when the association with level of adaptive functioning was controlled for.

Further research is warranted to understand the influence of such internal factors as mood, ASD symptomatology and pain on challenging behaviour in people with intellectual disability." .

Study 1 included an undergraduate sample (N = 119; 76 % female) and Study 2 included a sample of patients receiving treatment at a residential substance abuse treatment facility (N = 82; 48 % female). Subgroups were created based on the presence or absence of the following maladaptive behaviors: (a) deliberate self-harm (DSH) and disordered eating (Study 1); and (b) DSH, disordered eating, and substance misuse (Study 2). Subgroup differences in mean levels of emotion regulation difficulties (overall and six dimensions) were evaluated for each study. In Study 1, individuals who reported clinically-relevant levels of both DSH and disordered eating had more difficulties with emotion regulation (overall and three dimensions) compared to those who reported neither behavior. In Study 2, individuals who reported clinically-relevant levels of both DSH and substance misuse had more difficulties with emotion regulation (Study 2; overall and five dimensions) compared to those with only substance misuse. Overall, the results of these studies support the hypothesis that the co-occurrence of clinically-relevant maladaptive behaviors is associated with greater difficulties regulating emotions than the presence of only one maladaptive behavior (or no maladaptive behaviors). These findings suggest that clinical interventions targeting emotion regulation skills may be particularly useful for individuals who display a pattern of co-occurring maladaptive behaviors." .

Depending on the task characteristics, the spatial representation of time may be linked to different types of dimensions, including manual response codes and physical space codes. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether manual response and physical space codes are independent of each other or whether they interact when both types of information are involved in the task. The participants performed a temporal estimation task with two lateralized response buttons in four experiments. In the first experiment, the target stimuli were presented on the left side, at the center, or on the right side of the space, whereas the reference stimuli were always presented centrally. The reverse situation was presented in the second experiment. In the third experiment, both stimuli were presented in opposite spatial positions (e.g., left–right), whereas in the last experiment, both stimuli were presented in the same spatial position (e.g., left–left). In all experiments, perceptual and motor congruency effects were found, but no modulation of the congruency effects was found when both the perceptual and motor components were congruent. The results indicated that physical, spatial, and manual response codes are independent from each other for time–space associations, even when both codes are involved in the task. These results are discussed in terms of the “intermediate-coding” account." .

The pathogenesis of PTL is, among other causes, related to the stress-associated activation of the maternal–foetal stress system. In spite of these psychobiological associations, only a few research studies have investigated the potential of psychological stress-reducing interventions. The following paper will present an online anxiety and stress management self-help program for pregnant women with PTL. Structure and content of the program will be illustrated by a case-based experience report. L.B., 32 years (G3, P1), was recruited at gestational week 27 while hospitalized for PTL for 3 weeks. She worked independently through the program for 6 weeks and had regular written contact with a therapist. Processing the program had a positive impact on L.B.’s anxiety and stress levels, as well as on her experienced depressive symptoms and bonding to the foetus. As PTL and the risk of PTB are associated with distress, psychological stress-reducing interventions might be beneficial. This study examines the applicability of an online intervention for pregnant women with PTL. The case report illustrates how adequate low-threshold psychological support could be provided to these women." .

I take as my target certain eliminativist positions that argue that certain kinds of properties (or relations) do not exist because they fail to bestow unique causal powers on objects. In reply, I argue that the notion of causal powers is inextricably bound up with our notion of what an event is, and not only is there disagreement as to which theory of events is appropriate, but on the three prevailing theories, it can be shown that the eliminativists arguments do not follow." .

Contrasting distributions of statistically significant differences by frequency range coincided qualitatively with the rankings of ranges based on assessments of the effectiveness of the recognition of the type of activity using the trained classifier, except for the theta range. Comparison of general (group) and individual measures showed a more significant level of involvement of the mechanisms of semantic memory in solving verbal tasks and possible differences in the balance of internal and external attention on performance of verbal-logical and spatial-figurative activity." .

The presence of the fundamental process of visual completion was tested in a group of children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), as this requires perceptually integrating visual structure into wholes. In Experiment 1, it was investigated whether visual completion is present for simple partly occluded shapes in a group of children with PDD and a typically developing group. In Experiment 2, the presence of contextual influences in visual completion was investigated for the two groups. A total of 19 children with PDD and 28 controls who were matched for chronological age and IQ took part in two primed-matching tasks. For both groups, visual completion was present and for both groups, contextual influences were found to be dominant in this process. However, only for the group with PDD no priming effects (PEs) were found from less regular primes on congruent test pairs. The group with PDD did integrate visual information into wholes and did this in a contextually dependent way. However, for more complex shapes, visual completion is weaker for this group." .

Much recent work exploring verbal short-term memory has challenged this theory, but there does appear to be evidence for trace decay in nonverbal auditory short-term memory. Numerous discrimination studies have reported a performance decline as the interval separating two tones is increased, consistent with a decay process. However, most of this tone comparison research can be explained in other ways, without reference to decay, and these alternative accounts were tested in the present study. In Experiment 1, signals were employed toward the end of extended retention intervals to ensure that listeners were alert to the presence and frequency content of the memoranda. In Experiment 2, a mask stimulus was employed in an attempt to distinguish between a highly detailed sensory trace and a longer-lasting short-term memory, and the distinctiveness of the stimuli was varied. Despite these precautions, slow-acting trace decay was observed. It therefore appears that the mere passage of time can lead to forgetting in some forms of short-term memory." .

Here, we report evidence that d-Asp in the rat is involved in learning and memory processes. Oral administration of sodium d-aspartate (40 mM) for 12–16 days improved the rats’ cognitive capability to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze system. Two sessions per day for three consecutive days were performed in two groups of 12 rats. One group was treated with Na-d-aspartate and the other with control. A significant increase in the cognitive effect was observed in the treated group compared to controls (two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements: F(2, 105) = 57.29; P value < 0.001). Five further sessions of repeated training, involving a change in platform location, also displayed a significant treatment effect [F(2, 84) = 27.62; P value < 0.001]. In the hippocampus of treated rats, d-Asp increased by about 2.7-fold compared to controls (82.5 ± 10.0 vs. the 30.6 ± 5.4 ng/g tissue; P < 0.0001). Moreover, 20 randomly selected rats possessing relatively high endogenous concentrations of d-Asp in the hippocampus were much faster in reaching the hidden platform, an event suggesting that their enhanced cognitive capability was functionally related to the high levels of d-Asp. The correlation coefficient calculated in the 20 rats was R = −0.916 with a df of 18; P < 0.001. In conclusion, this study provides corroborating evidence that d-aspartic acid plays an important role in the modulation of learning and memory." .

Seventy-one individuals currently employed in group homes in a single state in the United States completed two surveys: a demographics survey and the Attitudes to Sexuality Questionnaire-Individuals with an Intellectual Disability. Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests due to the non-normal nature of the data. Results indicate that having an in-service training on sexuality has a positive influence on attitudes towards sexuality for individuals with an intellectual disability. In addition, personal factors (having an immediate family member with an intellectual disability, gender) also influenced attitudes towards sexuality and intellectual disability. However, data suggested no relationship between age or level of education and attitudes towards sexuality and intellectual disability. This study provides new information about factors that influence attitudes towards the sexuality of individuals with intellectual disabilities. It also provides data to support previous research on the topic." .

While it is assumed that the corresponding control set can be activated upon stimulus presentation at the respective context (e.g., upper versus lower location), the actual features that trigger control set activation are to date not described. Here, we ask whether the perceptual priming of the location context by an abrupt onset of irrelevant stimuli is sufficient in activating the context-specific attentional control set. For example, the mere onset of a stimulus might disambiguate the relevant location context and thus, serve as a low-level perceptual trigger mechanism that activates the context-specific attentional control set. In Experiment 1 and 2, the onsets of task-relevant and task-irrelevant (distracter) stimuli were manipulated at each context location to compete for triggering the activation of the appropriate control set. In Experiment 3, a prior training session enabled distracter stimuli to establish contextual control associations of their own before entering the test session. Results consistently showed that the mere onset of a task-irrelevant stimulus (with or without a context-control association) is not sufficient to activate the context-associated attentional control set by disambiguating the relevant context location. Instead, we argue that the identification of the relevant stimulus at the respective context is a precondition to trigger the activation of the context-associated attentional control set." .

Although previous studies have reported that NSS are associated with altered structure and function within fronto-parietal areas, it remains unclear whether the neuroanatomical basis of NSS may be confounded by underlying pathological processes, and by antipsychotic treatment. Morphological brain correlates of NSS in healthy subjects have seldom been investigated. This study evaluated the relationship between NSS levels and abnormalities of subcortical and cortical structures in healthy individuals. High-resolution MRI data at 3 Tesla were obtained from 68 healthy individuals. Automated segmentation of caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and brainstem was performed using both FSL-FIRST and Freesurfer. The surface-based analysis via Freesurfer enabled calculation of cortical thickness, area and folding (local gyrification index). NSS were examined on the Heidelberg Scale and related to both subcortical and cortical measurements. Using two fully automated brain segmentations methods, we found no significant association between NSS levels and morphological changes in subcortical structures. Higher NSS scores were associated with morphological changes of cortical thickness, area and folding in multiple areas comprising superior frontal, middle temporal, insular and postcentral regions. Our findings demonstrate the benefit of surface-based approaches when investigating brain correlates of NSS. The data lend further support to the hypothesis that NSS in healthy individuals involve multiple cortical rather than subcortical brain regions." .

It triggers backchannel signals according to the user’s visual and acoustic behaviour. The appropriateness of the backchannel algorithm in a user-agent situation of storytelling, has been evaluated by naïve participants, who judged the algorithm-ruled timing of backchannels more positively than a random timing. The system can generate different types of backchannels. The choice of the type and the frequency of the backchannels to be displayed is performed considering the agent’s personality traits. The personality of the agent is defined in terms of two dimensions, extroversion and neuroticism. We link agents with a higher level of extroversion to a higher tendency to perform more backchannels than introverted ones, and we link neuroticism to less mimicry production and more response and reactive signals sent. We run a perception study to test these relations in agent-user interactions, as evaluated by third parties. We find that the selection of the frequency of backchannels performed by our algorithm contributes to the correct interpretation of the agent’s behaviour in terms of personality traits." .

In Jack and Jill and Eight Cousins, Alcott presents an idealized picture of child-centered learning, building on three central principals: (1) Good teachers are sympathetic and understanding of children; (2) Every child needs to be healthy in order to learn; and (3) Children should be allowed to explore their world through self-directed, active learning. The ideal educational environment that she describes has much in common with the theories of John Dewey that would emerge some years later; using Dewey’s writings can give further insight into Alcott’s fiction. In this article, I argue that Alcott sees the world from the perspective of her young characters, and describes it in a way that simultaneously connects to her young readers and gives adults insight into the child’s world." .

They also propose that in unexpected recall, the subjects assume that the person who interprets the recall message uses a similar frame. Consequently, the recalling subject deletes from the recall report information from the frame that is highly predictable. This prediction was tested in an incidental memory task. After waiting 30 s in an office, the subjects were unexpectedly asked to recall everything in the office. They were either given standard instructions or instructions to recall so much that it would be comprehensible to a ‘Martian’. Thereafter, a recognition test was administered. In neither recall nor recognition were overall differences between the two recall conditions observed. The recognition data of both recall groups and a recognition-only group replicated previous findings, and were in agreement with the frame theories. The recall data revealed a significant interaction of recall instruction, object presence, and frame expectation. This is consistent with the proposition about frame anticipation. Recall of objects expected within the frame was higher under the ‘Martian’ condition than under standard conditions, whereas recall of unexpected objects was higher under normal recall conditions. Both the recognition and the recall data are considered as evidence in favor of frame theory." .

In particular, the role of motion in infants’ perception of visual rhythm remains unknown, despite the prevalence of motion cues in naturally occurring visual rhythms. In the present study, we examined the role of motion in 7-month-old infants’ discrimination of visual rhythms by comparing experimental conditions with apparent motion in the stimuli versus stationary rhythmic stimuli. Infants succeeded at discriminating visual rhythms only when the visual rhythm occurred with an apparent motion component. These results support the view that motion plays a role in infants’ perception of visual temporal information, consistent with the manner in which natural rhythms appear in the visual world." .

Pairs of calling males synchronized their pulses. The pulse rate (10–14 Hz) was considerably faster than the rate of synchronized signal units in other insects (0.5–3 Hz). Within each pulse cycle, males made only small adjustments to their pulse period, leading to regular switches of leader and follower roles. Large-scale timing adjustments only occurred in response to large delays. Stimulation with single pulses had no predictable effect on the timing of the male’s next pulse, resulting in a flat phase response curve. When entrained to a stimulus with a faster pulse period, males briefly interrupted calling; they resumed calling largely synchronized with the stimulus. Throughout the stimulus, males made gradual changes to their pulse period, similar to those during pair calling. After the stimulus ended, pulse periods increased over several minutes, but did not return to their pre-stimulus values. Thus social context and intrinsic state of the males influenced pulse period in Neoconocephalus ensiger. These results indicate that N. ensiger males synchronize calls by adjusting their intrinsic pulse period, instead of adjusting the timing of individual pulses, as described in other synchronizing insects." .

LGBTQ students are at risk for developing academic, social, and emotional problems due to harassment and bullying experienced at school. Although schools have an ethical and legal duty to provide a safe educational experience for all students, few schools implement policies and programs to support LGBTQ students. School psychologists, with training in adolescent development, counseling, consultation, and systems change, are in a unique position to help schools be more responsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. By adopting a public health framework that focuses on primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of prevention and intervention for LGBTQ students, school psychologists can implement strategies and make recommendations for school-wide changes to promote positive development for all students. This article highlights challenges faced by LGBTQ students and presents methods for responding to the needs of this minority group using the public health framework." .

Twenty-four Ss were presented with a continuous series of 672 letter sequences for word/nonword categorization. The sequences were divided equally between words and nonwords, and each item was presented twice in the series, either in the same or in a different modality. Repetition facilitation, the advantage resulting from a second presentation, was greatest in the intramodality conditions for both words (+re responses) and nonwords (−ve responses). Facilitation in these conditions declined from 170 msec at Lag 0 (4 sec) to approximately 40 msec at Lag 63. Facilitation was reduced in the cross-modality condition for words and was absent from the cross-modality condition for nonwords. The modality-specific component of the repetition effect found in the word/nonword categorization paradigm may be attributed to persistence in the nonlexical, as distinct from lexical, component of the word categorization process." .

In this article, we use a semisupervised classification paradigm, in which feedback is given after a prespecified percentage of trials only. In Experiment 1, feedback was given in 100%, 0%, 25%, and 50% of the trials. Previous research reported by Ashby, Queller, and Berretty (1999) indicated that in an information-integration task, perfect accuracy was obtained supervised (100%) but not unsupervised (0%). Our results show that in both the 100% and 50% conditions, participants were able to achieve maximum accuracy. However, in the 0% and the 25% conditions, participants failed to learn. To discover the influence of the no-feedback trials on the learning process, the 50% condition was replicated in Experiment 2, substituting unrelated filler trials for the no-feedback trials. The results indicated that accuracy rates were similar, suggesting no impact of the no-feedback trials on the learning process. The possibility of ever learning in a 25% setting was also researched in Experiment 2. Using twice as many trials, the results showed that all but 2 participants succeeded, suggesting that only the total number of feedback trials is important. The impact of the semisupervised learning results for ALCOVE, COVIS, and SPEED models is discussed." .

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which increases individual’s levels of psychological flexibility, may be more effective than other frameworks of psychological intervention, but good quality research is needed to inform adoption and implementation. This study explored the correlation between psychological flexibility and patient-reported outcomes to assess the viability of this intervention for cancer survivors. MethodsRecruitment was coordinated through a regional cancer centre. One hundred twenty-nine respondents completed a cross-sectional postal questionnaire. They were of mixed gender, diagnosis and cancer stage; a mean 61 years old; and a mean 207 days post-diagnosis. Self-report questionnaires assessed psychological flexibility, mood, anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life and benefit finding. ResultsPsychological flexibility was a strong and consistent correlate of outcome; effects were maintained even when potentially confounding clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were controlled. ConclusionsPsychological flexibility can be modified through ACT-based interventions. Given the strong correlational evidence found in this study, it seems that such interventions might be useful for cancer survivors. High-quality and well-designed controlled trials are now needed to establish effectiveness." .

Parents completed 14 day sleep diaries and questionnaires. Results suggested that at some stage during childhood, particularly under 8 years of age, the majority of children with autism will experience sleep problems. These problems are likely to be severe in many cases and will generally include one or more of: extreme sleep latencies; lengthy periods of night waking; shortened night sleep; and early morning waking. Such problems may have some specificity for autism as they appear to be rare in non-handicapped children and in children with mild degrees of intellectual handicap. It is likely that sleep problems in early childhood are related to the severe social difficulties present in autism and the consequent inability of these children to use social cues to synchronise their sleep/wake cycle. Continued sleep difficulties at older ages and with higher IQ may also be related to arousal and anxiety factors." .

An alternative two-parameter mathematical expression that can describe, at least in principle, psychophysical relationships at any stimulus range is presented. It is shown mathematically, and demonstrated through computer simulation, that unless the stimulus magnitude is too close to the threshold or saturation level, the resulting relationship in logarithmic coordinates is practically identical to that predicted by the power law model. It is also demonstrated that the absolute magnitude of the alternative model’s constants can be very similar to those found for the power law model." .

The transfer-of-training design enabled us to look for any training-based improvement. Long periods of training produced no statistically significant improvement in performance under any condition. There were small practice-based improvements, but the primary patterns indicated threshold fluctuation rather than improvement. We interpret the results to indicate that the neural mechanisms underlying three-point alignment and grating discrimination, like those for gap bisection (Klein & Levi, 1985), are not malleable to any significant extent." .

Six hundred and fifty students from a high school were surveyed. Contrary to expectations, results from ESEM analyses indicated that the four types of regulations do not mediate the relation between implicit theories of intelligence and students’ intentions to persist in school. Rather, results show two direct effects, where an incremental theory of intelligence is associated with greater school persistence intentions, as well as being motivated in an intrinsic manner. In addition, results reveal that academic achievement is related to persistence intentions. No gender differences were observed. This research highlights the importance of promoting students’ incremental intelligence beliefs and intrinsic motivation in order to foster school persistence intentions. Theoretical and practical implications for parents and teachers are discussed." .

We explore ageing self-perceptions as motivating factors behind smoking and drinking alcohol in older adults, and the complex reasons why individuals engage harmfully in these behaviours. MethodsCigarette and alcohol use was assessed in a large cross-sectional national sample aged 50 years and above from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) (n = 6,576). The Brief Ageing Perceptions Questionnaire (BAPQ) assessed individual’s views of their own ageing across five domains. Study hypothesis that stronger beliefs on each of the BAPQ domains would be related to drinking and smoking was examined using multinomial logit models (MNLM). Regression parameter estimates for all variables were estimated relative risk ratios (RRR). ResultsMore women were non-drinkers (30 % vs. 20 %) and men displayed significantly higher alcohol use patterns. One in five older Irish adults was a current smoker (16.8 % of women, 17 % of men), and smoking and harmful drinking were strongly associated (P < .001). Some domains of ageing perceptions were significantly associated with harmful drinking and smoking. While the risk of being be harmful drinker decreased with stronger beliefs about the positive consequences of ageing (RRR 0.89), it increased with higher scores on both emotional representation and control positive domains.Greater awareness of ageing and stronger emotional reaction to ageing increased likelihood of smoking. A greater sense of control over the outcomes of ageing was associated with increased risk of both harmful drinking (RRR control positive 1.16) and smoking (RRR control and consequences negative 1.25). This suggests optimistic bias in relation to perceived health risk from smoking and harmful drinking as a potential adverse effect of perceptions of control.Risks of concurrent smoking and harmful drinking increased with chronic awareness of ageing (RRR 1.24), and negative emotional responses to it (RRR 1.21), and decreased with stronger perceptions of the positive consequences of ageing (RRR 0.85). ConclusionsThe relationship between ageing perceptions, smoking and drinking is complex. Altering perceptions of ageing may be a useful intervention target aimed at facilitating engagement in preventative health behaviours in older people." .

Both experiments showed that noise improved ordered recall of local features but impaired recall of global shape, although the extent of the effect of noise was influenced by the size of the compound stimuli. Noise did not produce the same effects as those obtained when attention is manipulated by instructions, and it is possible that noise produced a change in the more passive aspect of attention rather than altering the active allocation of attentional resources." .

It is shown that unlike the case of usual negative energy bound states, theS-matrix does not have a pole at the positive bound state energy but becomes unity at the energy corresponding to bound states in continuum. Calculations ofS-waveS-matrix for a local potential constructed by Stillinger and Herrick and a separable nonlocal potential constructed by the present authors verify these results. Our results indicate that the bound states embedded in continuum constructedvia the von Neumann and Wigner procedure cannot be interpreted as resonances with zero width." .

It is a clinically defined condition characterized by severe and disabling new onset fatigue with at least four additional symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscle pain, multi-joint pain, new headaches, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertion malaise. Chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents is a rare condition compared to symptomatic fatigue. The estimated prevalence of adolescent CFS ranges between 0.11 and 1.29 % in Dutch, British, and US populations. Diagnosis of the chronic fatigue syndrome is established through exclusion of other medical and psychiatric causes of chronic fatiguing illness. Taking a full clinical history and a full physical examination are therefore vital. In adolescence, CFS is associated with considerable school absence with long-term detrimental effects on academic and social development. One of the most successful potential treatments for adolescents with CFS is cognitive behavioural therapy, which has been shown to be effective after 6 months in two thirds of the adolescents with CFS. This treatment effect sustains at 2–3-year follow-up. In conclusion, the diagnosis CFS should be considered in any adolescent patient with severe disabling long-lasting fatigue. Cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in 60–70 % of the patients. Prompt diagnosis favours the prognosis." .

We review past and recent embodiment research, focusing on neuroscientific work. In particular, we review a growing body of evidence supporting the notion that manipulated facial expressions, hand contractions, and changes in physical posture influence physiological activity related to approach motivation or the inclination to move toward a stimulus. Several other perspectives are also considered, such as work related to facial-feedback theories of emotion, theories of grounded or embodied cognition, and mirror neuron research. Ultimately, we conclude that bi-directionality may exist between certain bodily movements and other components of approach- or avoidance-related emotions. Avenues for new research are considered given these implications." .

We investigated individual differences in conflict-monitoring and their associations with working memory (WM) and impulsivity. A total of 150 adults completed a Simon and an Eriksen flanker task, together with measures of WM and impulsivity. On both tasks, responses were slower and less accurate on incompatible than on compatible trials (conflict effect), and the conflict effect was larger when the preceding trial was compatible than when it was incompatible (context effect). Stimulus repetition did not explain the context effect. Individual differences could be attributed to three separable factors for each task: general speeded performance, conflict effect, and context effect. Evidence for across-task generality of these factors was sparse. Associations of these factors with impulsivity were weak at best. WM was correlated with general speed, and also with some but not all factors reflecting conflict-related processes." .

Little is known regarding the impact that burn injuries have on females’ sexuality and how this in turn affects their relationships and body image. This qualitative study aims to add narratives of the lived experiences of female burn survivors to provide evidence that sexuality and body image changes are important indicators of post burn adjustment and quality of life, which should be included as important components of post burn rehabilitation. This study included a phenomenological approach incorporating semistructured interviews of five women with varying size of burn. The data collection and analysis was guided by Kvale’s seven stages of interview inquiry. Burn injuries are life changing events that result in behavioural changes that impact engagement in sexual and social participation for females. These changes result in alterations to ones internalized concept of body image and attractiveness that have the potential to impact all facets of life. Findings from the thematic analysis in this study lead to the development of the Adjustment to Sexuality and Body Image Changes Post Burn Injury Model. This model conceptualizes potential body image and sexuality changes post traumatic injury and identifies possible areas for targeted interventions that could be incorporated into rehabilitation services. Burn injuries are correlated with behavioral changes that have a potential adverse impact on sexual and social engagement for female burn survivors. Further research investigating treatment strategies for post burn adjustment is required to translate to improvements in clinical service provision." .

Twenty depressed and 20 nondepressed subjects participated in two tasks, each examining one of these aspects of memory. The results of this study suggest that whereas sensory memory is intact in depressed individuals, short-term memory processing is impaired. More specifically, the depressed subjects experienced difficulty with the retention of material, likely owing to impaired rehearsal ability.

MethodsA total of 91 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivor-spouse dyads were recruited from the University Hospital Registry in Cleveland, Ohio. Standardized questionnaires that assessed psychological distress, reframing and acquiring social support coping, and resilience characteristics were used. ResultsThe actor-partner interdependence mediation model demonstrated that the resilience of the survivors and spouses was a strong predictor of their personal psychological distress. Survivors’ and spouses’ own resilience mediated the association between their reframing coping and psychological distress. However, only the survivor model confirmed the mediating effect of resilience characteristics in the relationship between social support coping and psychological distress. In addition, spouse psychological distress was influenced by survivor resilience, indicating a spouse-partner effect in the relationship between resilience characteristics and psychological distress. ConclusionsOur findings provide insight into the relationships between coping, resilience characteristics, and psychological distress at the individual and dyadic levels. Enhancing cancer survivors’ and their spouses’ positive thoughts and available external resources can improve resilience and, in turn, reduce their psychological distress of couples coping with cancer." .

Vertical, horizontal and overshoot components of saccades show good correlation in their amplitude/velocity relationship, as seen in voluntary large saccades.

Accurate models of the psychological underpinnings of childhood UEDs are required to effectively target therapies. Cognitive biases, such as the jumping to conclusions data-gathering bias (JTC), are implicated in the development and maintenance of psychosis in adults. In this study, we aimed to establish the suitability for children of a task developed to assess JTC in adults. Eighty-six participants (aged 5–14 years) were recruited from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and community (school) settings, and completed the probabilistic reasoning (‘Beads’) task, alongside measures of intellectual functioning, general psychopathology, and UEDs. Self-reported reasoning strategy was coded as ‘probabilistic’ or ‘other’. Younger children (5–10 years) were more likely than older children (11–14 years) to JTC (OR = 2.7, 95 % CI = 1.1–6.5, p = 0.03); and to use non-probabilistic reasoning strategies (OR = 9.4, 95 % CI = 1.7–48.8, p = 0.008). Both UED presence (OR = 5.1, 95 % CI = 1.2–21.9, p = 0.03) and lower IQ (OR = 0.9, 95 % CI = 0.9–1.0, p = 0.02) were significantly and independently associated with JTC, irrespective of age and task comprehension. Findings replicate research in adults, indicating that the ‘Beads’ task can be reliably employed in children to assess cognitive biases. Psychological treatments for children with distressing unusual experiences might usefully incorporate reasoning interventions." .

Their teachers completed the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale. Multiple regression showed that performance accomplishments with feedback was a more effective determinant of efficacy and responseoutcome expectations than modeling.

Such processes of information integration often occur automatically. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the visual perception of spatial characteristics of a rotational motion (rotation direction) can induce a spatially compatible action. Four reaction time experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of perceiving task irrelevant rotational motions of simple geometric figures as well as of gymnasts on a horizontal bar while responding to color changes in these objects. The results show that the participants react faster when the directional information of a rotational motion is compatible with the spatial characteristics of an intended action. The degree of complexity of the perceived event does not play a role in this effect. The spatial features of the used biological motion were salient enough to elicit a motion based Simon effect. However, in the cognitive processing of the visual stimulus, the critical criterion is not the direction of rotation, but rather the relative direction of motion (direction of motion above or below the center of rotation). Nevertheless, this conclusion is tainted with reservations since it is only fully supported by the response behavior of female participants." .

However, this phenotype was not included in the DSM-5 because of the lack of robust neurobiological data. We aimed to assess the specific neurobiological underpinnings of individuals presenting ADHD-RI. We compared a sample of 301 subjects (101 ADHD-Combined; 50 ADHD-RI; 50 ADHD predominantly inattentive type and 100 typically developing subjects) aged 8–15 years, using a complete neuropsychological battery, molecular genetic data (DRD4 and DAT1 most studied polymorphisms) and functional MRI during a Go-No/Go task. Subjects with ADHD-RI had a significantly different neuropsychological profile compared with the other groups, including lower psychomotor speeds, longer reaction times and the worst overall performance in the global neurocognitive index. The proportion of subjects with the presence of DRD4–7 repeat allele was significantly higher in ADHD-RI. The fMRI data suggested that more attention-related posterior brain regions (especially temporo-occipital areas) are activated in ADHD-RI during both Go and No-Go cues compared to TD controls and ADHD predominantly inattentive type. ADHD-RI may represent a different phenotype than other types of ADHD. In addition, our results suggest that reducing the phenotypic heterogeneity may aid in the search for the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD." .

The first experiment attempted to replicate CPPs reported by other researchers using nicotine doses of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/kg. There was a trend for all three doses to produce aversions, but it was significant only for the 0.8 mg/kg dose. Exposures to the CS alone extinguished aversions, but a “priming” dose (0.2 mg/kg) of nicotine given after extinction produced aversions only in animals exposed to 1.2 mg/kg. Experiment 2 tested whether preexposure to morphine or nicotine would sensitize animals to nicotine's reinforcing effects. In this experiment, rats were exposed to either six nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) or morphine (1.0 mg/kg) dosings prior to preference conditioning. Neither preferences nor aversions were observed in any group following subsequent conditioning with 0.6 mg/kg nicotine. The results suggest that previous observations of preference effects may have been due to specific procedural factors or may have depended on negative reinforcement due to stress reduction." .

We assessed the psychological profile of a large sample of patients with chronic daily headache (CDH) seen in tertiary care. We used a case-control design to study 791 patients who fell into the following categories: ARH group, chronic migraine with analgesic overuse (analgesic rebound headache, ARH), n=399; CM group, chronic migraine (CM) without analgesic overuse, n=158; and new daily persistent headache (NDPH) group, n=69. These groups were compared to two control groups: 1, migraine, n=100; 2, chronic posttraumatic headache (CPTH), n=65. We assessed personality and psychopathology with the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI)-2. The number of patients with Tscores ≥65 and ≤40 were analyzed by the two-sided Fischer’s exact test. The ARH and CM groups had a higher number of subjects with T-scores ≥65, when compared to the migraine group, on the following scales: 1 (hypochondrias), 2 (depression), 8 (schizophrenia) and 0 (social introversion). No differences were observed between the NDPH and migraine groups. Considering CPTH as the control group, the pattern we found was quite the opposite of that described above: NDPH group presented a higher number of subjects with T-scores ≥65 on the following scales: 1, 2, 7 (psychasthenia) and 8. ARH and CM groups had significantly higher T-scores for scale 7 alone. NDPH showed T-scores ≤40 in scale 9 when compared to both control groups. We conclude that: (1) psychopathological factors are common in CDH patients, and appear to be a consequence of the chronification process; (2) low scores on scale 9 (hypomania) may relate to the development of NDPH; (3) psychopathological profiles differ among the subgroups of CDH and the MMPI-2 is reliable in identifying such patterns; and (4) psychological assessment is an essential step in the evaluation and treatment of patients with CDH." .

Thus, we (1) described the prevalence and severity of positive, negative, disorganization, general, and basic symptoms in adolescent patients at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR), with other non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (PC) and with early-onset psychosis (EOP); and (2) investigated BS criteria in relation to UHR criteria. Sixty-nine 12–18-year-old adolescents (15.3 ± 1.7 years, female = 58.0 %, UHR = 22, PC = 27, EOP = 20) were assessed with the structured interview for prodromal syndromes (SIPS) and the schizophrenia proneness instrument-child and youth version (SPI-CY). Despite similar current and past 12-month global functioning, both UHR and EOP had significantly higher SIPS total and subscale scores compared to PC, with moderate-large effect sizes. Expectedly, UHR had significantly lower SIPS positive symptom scores than EOP, but similar SIPS negative, disorganized, and general symptom scores. Compared to PC, both EOP and UHR had more severe basic thought and perception disturbances, and significantly more often met cognitive disturbances criteria (EOP = 50.0 %, UHR = 40.9 %, PC = 14.8 %). Compared to UHR, both EOP and PC significantly less often met cognitive-perceptive BS criteria (EOP = 35.0 %, UHR = 68.2 %, PC = 25.9 %). BS were significantly more prevalent in both EOP and UHR than PC, and UHR were similar to EOP in symptom domains. Given the uncertain outcome of adolescents at clinical high-risk of psychosis, future research is needed to determine whether the combined assessment of early subjective disturbances with observable APS can improve the accuracy of psychosis prediction." .

Responses to 10 open-ended questions from 24 women who received TAICBT for PPD were thematically analyzed. The majority of women expressed that the TAICBT program afforded flexibility, accessibility, and convenience, as well as anonymity and privacy. Some participants described the program as helping them take a step in the right direction and enhance their self-awareness and parenting skills. Participants also described having the internet therapist individualize their treatment. Challenges related to the TAICBT program were also identified by a minority of participants including managing time to log onto the program, the fast pace, completion of homework around childcare duties, and challenges of not having a face-to-face therapist. Participants also made suggestions for future programming. The large majority of participants consistently described their internet therapist favorably; however, challenges related to the internet therapy were also identified.

A number of reports now suggest that individuals with higher levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS) are less likely to engage in exercise. However, this finding has been inconsistent across sex and limited by measurement strategy. This study examined the relationship between AS and self-reported exercise in a mixed-sex sample of 233 individuals. Consistent with prediction, AS was negatively associated with engagement in vigorous-intensity exercise; however, the strength of this association when covarying for sex was dependent on the measurement strategy used (continuous vs. categorical ASI scores). Sex did not moderate the AS-vigorous exercise association. AS was not associated with moderate-intensity exercise or walking. Results suggest a role of distress intolerance in exercise behavior and confirm the importance of continued research on this topic." .

Correct lever presses were reinforced with food under the control of a fixed ratio 10 schedule. In tests of the effect of PTZ dose on level selection, rats selected the PTZ lever in a dose-dependent manner, with peak latency at the approximate ED50 dose (10 mg/kg). Rats usually pressed only the selected lever, regardless of dose, indicating that lever selection was a quantal (or bimodal) function of stimulus intensity. Lever biases observed during training sessions did not predict the performance of individual rats in tests with the ED50 dose. In three independent trials with this intermediate dosage, the rats selecting the PTZ lever varied from trial to trial, suggesting that rats detecting this dose did not form a stable subgroup. The pattern of lever selections across these three trials was not significantly different from that predicted by a model in which all subjects shared the same probability for detecting the drug stimulus. These results demonstrate that lever selection in a two-lever drugdiscrimination task can be quantal in nature, and suggest that rats trained with PTZ, 20 mg/kg, are homogeneous in sensitivity to this stimulus." .

Oncology researchers and clinicians are increasingly cognizant of the negative effects of cancer and its treatments on the brain and its mental processes and cognitive outcomes. Nevertheless, effective interventions to treat cancer and treatment-related neurocognitive dysfunction (CRND), also known as chemobrain, are still lacking. The paucity of data on effective treatments for CRND is due, at least partly, to difficulties understanding its etiology, and a lack of reliable methods for assessing its presence and severity. This paper provides an overview of the incidence, etiology, and magnitude of CRND, and discusses the plausible contributions of psychological, motor function, and linguistic and behavioral complications to CRND. Strategies for reliable neuropsychological screening and assessment, and development and testing of effective ways to mitigate CRND are also discussed." .

Apart from inducing cirrhosis, which may be viewed as a precancerous liver lesion, ethanol may act as a cocarcinogen. Most investigations on this topic have focused on two aspects: ethanol's capacity to induce the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal biotransformation system and its interference with at least one DNA repair mechanism. Ethanol exposure enhances the capacity of mixed function oxidases to activate many chemical carcinogens, such as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). On the other hand, ethanol exposure fails to influence DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis. The capacity of alcohol to inhibit DMN-demethylase activity has not been clearly demonstrated in experiments carried out with human tissue. In conclusion, both the effects of ethanol and their underlying mechanisms as regards liver carcinogenesis are open to debate. The link between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be mediated mainly by its capacity to induce cirrhosis." .

Although this target probability effect on detection times has been well-studied, one aspect of it has remained largely unexamined: How the effect develops over the span of an experiment. Here, we investigated this issue with two detection experiments that assessed different target probability ratios. Conventional block segment analysis and linear mixed-effects modeling converged on two key findings. First, we found that the magnitude of the target probability effect increases as one progresses through a block of trials. Second, we found, by examining the trajectories of the low- and high-probability targets, that this increase in effect magnitude was driven by the low-probability targets. Specifically, we found that low-probability targets were detected more slowly as a block of trials progressed. Performance to high-probability targets, on the other hand, was largely invariant across the block. The latter finding is of particular interest because it cannot be reconciled with accounts that propose that the target probability effect is driven by the high-probability targets." .

It appeared that lengthening only occurred in the case of intuitive evaluation of an interval. Autocorrelation functions revealed that the estimation process may be described as a series of compensatory actions with respect to the last trial. It was assumed that the last estimate is more or less always experienced as too long or too short. In the resulting correction process the positive corrections reach higher mean values than the negative ones since the upper limit of the interval is not defined. In view of the negative autocorrelation in the last trial it was postulated that the correction process is not random, but is related to sequential response bias, i.e. too many alternations. Subsequently, several presentation and estimation modes were compared. The possibility that lengthening might result from trace decay of the standard stored in memory was doubtful since the phenomenon was also observed in the case of pure production on the basis of verbal instructions only. Apparently, it makes no difference whether a standard is presented or not. The distribution of the time estimates under various conditions revealed that the subject becomes more uncertain in proportion as the amount of external reference given increases, so that estimation process variables seem to be of greater importance than stimulus factors (standard presentation). It was assumed that the temporal memory could be described as a register in which only one event (the last) remains available and forms the subject's frame of reference. Since lengthening appeared to be connected with several cognitive variables of a general nature it was postulated that the effect is not only inherent in time estimation, but may be considered as a phenomenon occurring in repeated estimations of various stimuli as well. This assumption appeared to be correct, as analogous effects were observed in the case of repeated line drawing. It was shown that the increase of the time estimates could be influenced significantly by introducing different risk levels, i.e. the degree of lengthening is a function of the subject's decision criterion. Furthermore, there was some correlation between the compensatory actions and sequential response bias in a randomization task. It is concluded that the lengthening effect does not only show a general character, but that it might be described and explained adequately within the framework of the cognitive theory of time experience in which memory mechanisms, decision theory, and sequential response bias play a significant role." .

Fifteen autistic and 15 normal children watched an adult model engage in a set of behaviors under specific verbal instructions. After observing this situation, the children were tested to determine what they had acquired through observation. The results showed that (1) the majority of the autistic and the youngest normal children acquired only some limited features of the observational situation and (2) chronological age was related to the amount of learning through observation in the normal children but not in the autistics. The deficit that the autistic children showed in observational learning may be related to a failure to discriminate or attend to the total stimulus input presented. Their failure in observational learning can be seen to contribute in a major way to the severely impoverished behavioral repertoires of these children." .

The process of making a decision differs from one person to another. The processes involved in making a decision are defined as decision making styles, which can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Children and adolescents’ decision making, however, often is thought to be associated with parenting. This review examines and describes previous studies examining the associations between decision making styles and parenting approaches. It suggests that maladaptive decision making styles are the most prevalent, and that they often are associated with detrimental outcomes for children and adolescents’ development. Maladaptive decision making styles also are associated with negative parenting approaches. The review reveals that western and non-western societies play an important role in shaping these associations; however, it also finds that age and gender do not play a significant role. The review highlights gaps in literature focusing on decision making and parenting, and the continents where little research has examined the associations presented. The review adds to current debates and knowledge on youth development by providing an understanding of decision making styles from an international perspective as well as from the important role that parents play." .

Results indicated that children may be grouped into three classes based on their behavioral profiles of persistence. Children who were highly persistent over the course of the task were more likely to have higher levels of IQ and mothers who were observed to be more behaviorally responsive than those who showed consistently low levels of task-related behavior. Additionally, children who demonstrated stably low levels of persistence were rated by teachers to display more externalizing behavior at 6 and 10 years than those in the other groups. Profiles of persistence did not predict concurrent levels of child externalizing behavior at the age of 3 years.

Employing a modified version of a vigilance task developed by Schlagman and Kvavilashvili (Mem Cogn 36:920–932, 2008) to elicit IAMs, we investigated the effects of varying the frequency of external cues on the number of IAMs reported. During the vigilance task, participants had to detect an occasional target stimulus (vertical lines) in a constant stream of non-target stimuli (horizontal lines). Participants had to interrupt the task whenever they became aware of any task-unrelated mental contents and to report them. In addition to line patterns, participants were exposed to verbal cues and their frequency was experimentally manipulated in three conditions (frequent cues vs. infrequent cues vs. infrequent cues plus arithmetic operations). We found that, compared to infrequent cues, both conditions with frequent cues and infrequent cues plus arithmetic operations decreased the number of IAMs reported. The comparison between the three experimental conditions suggests that this reduction was due to the greater cognitive load in conditions of frequent cues and infrequent cue plus arithmetic operations. Possible mechanisms involved in this effect and their implications for research on IAMs are discussed." .

The advantage of this concept is that all actions necessary for the swarm behavior can he derived from the purpose of each individual. Using this concept, the swarm behavior can he built into the action algorithm of the individuals. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we construct the swarm algorithm for a search and collection task. Using a computer simulation, we confirmed that the swarm successfully achieved the task with flexibility and parallelism, and also robustness in part. These results support the effectiveness of the proposed methodology." .

Autism is considered part of the behavioural phenotype in AS based on formal autism assessments (autism diagnostic interview—revised [ADI-R] and autism diagnostic observation schedule [ADOS]), which have mainly addressed the deleted AS group. We explored 23 AS patients including all genetic subtypes and made a co-morbid diagnosis of AD/ASD in 14/23 (61%), which does not include 4 cases classified within the broader autism spectrum disorder (bASD). Deletions accounted for the main fraction (35%), ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) mutation represented 13%, imprinting defects and uniparental disomy 9 and 4%, respectively. UBE3A mutations due to lack of the homologous to the E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus domain (n = 3) were associated with the ASD, while more distal mutations (n = 3) seem to escape from a co-morbid diagnosis of autism/autism spectrum. Differences in severity of autistic features were seen across subtypes of AS, with some behavioural features being unique to AS and some representing all forms of developmental disability. Autism signs (poor/lack of eye contact, showing, spontaneous initiation of joint attention, social quality of overtures [ADOS algorithm items for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—IV (DSM-IV)/International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems—10 (ICD-10) autism diagnosis belonging to the reciprocal social interaction domain]) discriminating all the co-morbid AS categories from non-autistic AS belonged to the social interaction domain. Impairments in the communication domain (gestures, pointing, use of another’s body, frequency of vocalisation towards others [ADOS algorithm items for DSM-IV/ICD-10 autism diagnosis belonging to the communication domain]) justified classification of co-morbid AD/ASD vs the classification of less affected bASD. Evaluation of the behaviour domain suggested that repetitive sensory and motor behaviours correlate with a low developmental profile rather than being specific to autism." .

Cognitive models suggest that negative cognitions, including interpretation bias, play a role in etiology and maintenance of depression. Given that cognitive development is incomplete by the teenage years and that CBT is not superior to non-cognitive treatments in the treatment of adolescent depression, it is important to test the underlying model. The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that interpretation biases are exhibited by depressed adolescents. Four groups of adolescents were recruited: clinically-referred depressed (n = 27), clinically-referred non-depressed (n = 24), community with elevated depression symptoms (n = 42) and healthy community (n = 150). Participants completed a 20 item ambiguous scenarios questionnaire. Clinically-referred depressed adolescents made significantly more negative interpretations and rated scenarios as less pleasant than all other groups. The results suggest that this element of the cognitive model of depression is applicable to adolescents. Other aspects of the model should be tested so that cognitive treatment can be modified or adapted if necessary." .

A set of second rank tensorial internal state variables corresponding to Biot's strain is introduced, and a nonlinear evolution law for these internal variables is suggested. The proposed model may be considered as an extension of the network theory of rubber elasticity to take the viscous effects into account. In order to verify the validity of the present model, uniaxial tension tests for HDPE are carried out at different strain rates. The prediction of the present model shows a good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, a discussion of the present constitutive model is given. It is found that the present constitutive model is more flexible to describe the strain rate sensitivity of polymeric materials in a wide range of strain rates." .

Alcohol-related trauma presentation to hospitals causes a major service burden, and there have been efforts to reduce such trauma load with educational programs and social support. Brief alcohol intervention (BAI) in an acute setting (emergency department or trauma centre) has been shown as an effective means to reduce future alcohol intake and the incidence of future alcohol-related injuries, especially in the period immediately following injuries. Less is known about the potential benefit of BAI when provided by the surgical team in the same clinical context.

The present study examines the effect of acquisition context&#x2014;representations used for initial instruction, and the type of judgment required during acquisition&#x2014;on judgments using causal rules. In contrast to traditional concept formation research, this paradigm examined the development of procedures for using rules, rather than rule induction. College-student subjects learned to use causal rules describing digital logic gates, receiving instruction with either verbal rules or truth tables, and practicing either predicting or verifying logic-gate outputs. After 200 trials of practice with each rule, subjects were transferred to the untrained judgment task. Transfer was strongly asymmetrical. Subjects trained to make prediction judgments were slowed substantially by transfer to the verification task, while subjects trained to make verification judgments had little difficulty with transfer to the prediction task. Truth-table representations resulted in superior performance, especially for verification judgments. Contrary to prediction, verification judgments always required more time. The results demonstrate that acquisition context may be partly responsible for judgmental asymmetries, and imply that examining conditions of acquisition is important for understanding how causal knowledge is used." .

This study examined whether affected motor timing accuracy and variability are specific for ADHD, or that comorbidity with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) contributes to these motor timing difficulties. An 80-trial motor timing task measuring accuracy (μ), variability (σ) and infrequent long response times (τ) in estimating a 1-s interval was administered to 283 children and adolescents (8–17 years) from both a clinic and population based sample. They were divided into four latent classes based on the SCQ and CPRS-R:L data. These classes were: without behavioral problems ‘Normal-class’ (n = 154), with only ADHD symptoms ‘ADHD-class’ (n = 49), and two classes with both ASD and ADHD symptoms; ADHD(+ASD)-class (n = 39) and ASD(+ADHD)-class (n = 41). The pure ADHD-class did not deviate from the Normal class on any of the motor timing measures (mean RTs 916 and 925 ms, respectively). The comorbid ADHD(+ASD) and ASD(+ADHD) classes were significantly less accurate (more time underestimations) compared to the Normal class (mean RTs 847 and 870 ms, respectively). Variability in motor timing was reduced in the younger children in the ADHD(+ASD) class, which may reflect a tendency to rush the tedious task. Only patients with more severe behavioral symptoms show motor timing deficiencies. This cannot merely be explained by high ADHD severity with ASD playing no role, as ADHD symptom severity in the pure ADHD-class and the ASD(+ADHD) class was highly similar, with the former class showing no motor timing deficits." .

The present study examined whether CU traits also moderate the aggressiveness of children’s social information processing (SIP) and responses to varying intensities of peer provocation. Sixty elementary school-age children (46 males) were grouped into those without CP or CU (controls, n = 32), those with CP but not CU (CP-only; n = 14), and those with both CP and CU (CPCU, n = 14). Participants completed a task that measured two aspects of SIP (response generation and hostile attribution bias) and a computerized reaction time task (CRTT) that measured behavior, affect, and communication before and after provocation under instrumental and hostile aggressive conditions. Children with CPCU generated more aggressive responses than controls on measures of SIP. On the CRTT, all children exhibited reactive aggression following high provocation, but only children with CPCU exhibited proactive aggression, and reactive aggression following low provocation; no differences in affect were found. In a series of exploratory analyses, CPCU children communicated antisocially, while CP-only communicated prosocially. Finally, children with CPCU did not seem to hold a grudge following the final instance of provocation, instead gradually returning to baseline like their non-CU peers. These distinct social cognitive and behavioral profiles hint at different etiologies of CP and CPCU, underscoring the variability of aggression in these populations." .

This study examines the influence of self-directedness in learning and career of low-qualified employees on their employability. In a follow-up study of 284 low-qualified employees, we find that higher levels of self-directedness in learning and career of employees corresponds with higher chance to be promoted to higher-level job positions (vertical job mobility).

Wheatstone used this freedom to determine the factors involved in the perception of size and distance, and interpreted them within a cognitive framework. He devised an adjustable stereoscope which allowed him to apply the systematic experimental procedures of physics to the phenomena of depth perception. Brewster, by contrast, tried to force the newly discovered binocular phenomena back into the mould of monocular vision, using the lever of visible direction. His interpretations of visual phenomena, be they monocular or binocular, could be reduced to the two fundamental ‘laws’ of visible direction and distinct vision. While Wheatstone's cognitive approach influenced Helmholtz, and thereby modern cognitive theorists. Brewster's interpretations, based as they were in analyses of the retinal projection, find an echo in modern direct theorists." .

The user’s state of mind analysis is based on video data and biological signals. Facial movements such as eyes blinking, yawning, head rotations, etc., are detected on video data: they are used in order to evaluate the fatigue and the attention level of the driver. The user’s electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response are recorded and analyzed in order to evaluate the stress level of the driver. A driver simulator software is modified so that the system is able to appropriately react to these critical situations of fatigue and stress: some audio and visual messages are sent to the driver, wheel vibrations are generated and the driver is supposed to react to the alert messages. A multi-threaded system is proposed to support multi-messages sent by the different modalities. Strategies for data fusion and fission are also provided. Some of these components are integrated within the first prototype of OpenInterface: the multimodal similar platform." .

However, investigations on early behavioral inhibition of children with selective mutism are lacking. Children aged 3–18 with lifetime selective mutism (n = 109), social phobia (n = 61), internalizing behavior (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 118) were assessed using the parent-rated Retrospective Infant Behavioral Inhibition (RIBI) questionnaire. Analyses showed that children with lifetime selective mutism and social phobia were more inhibited as infants and toddlers than children of the internalizing and healthy control groups, who displayed similar low levels of behavioral inhibition. Moreover, behavioral inhibition was higher in infants with lifetime selective mutism than in participants with social phobia according to the Total BI score (p = 0.012) and the Shyness subscale (p < 0.001). Infant behavioral inhibition, particularly towards social stimuli, is a temperamental feature associated with a lifetime diagnosis of selective mutism. Results yield first evidence of the recently hypothesized temperamental origin of selective mutism. Children at risk should be screened for this debilitating child psychiatric condition." .

MI can be conducted either added to conventional physiotherapy or integrated within therapy sessions. The proposed study aims to compare the efficacy of embedded MI to an added MI intervention. Evidence from pilot studies reported in the literature suggests that both approaches can improve performance of a complex motor skill involving whole body movements, however, it remains to be demonstrated, which is the more effective one. Methods/DesignA single blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a pre-post intervention design will be carried out. The study design includes two experimental groups and a control group (CG). Both experimental groups (EG1, EG2) will receive physical practice of a clinical relevant motor task ('Going down, laying on the floor, and getting up again') over a two week intervention period: EG1 with embedded MI training, EG2 with MI training added after physiotherapy. The CG will receive standard physiotherapy intervention and an additional control intervention not related to MI.The primary study outcome is the time difference to perform the task from pre to post-intervention. Secondary outcomes include level of help needed, stages of motor task completion, degree of motor impairment, balance ability, fear of falling measure, motivation score, and motor imagery ability score. Four data collection points are proposed: twice during baseline phase, once following the intervention period, and once after a two week follow up. A nested qualitative part should add an important insight into patients' experience and attitudes towards MI. Semi-structured interviews of six to ten patients, who participate in the RCT, will be conducted to investigate patients' previous experience with MI and their expectations towards the MI intervention in the study. Patients will be interviewed prior and after the intervention period. DiscussionResults will determine whether embedded MI is superior to added MI. Findings of the semi-structured interviews will help to integrate patient's expectations of MI interventions in the design of research studies to improve practical applicability using MI as an adjunct therapy technique.

Our finding has two important theoretical consequences. First, assuming that preferences depend on budget sets is illegitimate under the scientific commitments of revealed preference theory. Second, as long as consumers’ preferences are not defined over budget sets, we can assume that preferences depend on observable objects other than own consumption without compromising the logical possibility to reject the model against observation. We however point out that, despite this logical possibility, in practice it can be almost impossible to reject a model where preferences are defined over objects that depend on budget sets. As an example of this we show that if preferences are defined over consumption choices of other individuals then rationalization fails only in cases of negligible practical interest." .

Their performance was assessed by the simulators’ software and by observers blinded to the levels of subjects’ experience. Performance in experienced vs inexperienced subjects was compared. Score pairs of three parameters—time, errors, and economy of movement—were also compared. ResultsExperienced subjects performed significantly better than inexperienced subjects on both tasks in terms of time, errors, and economy of movement (p < 0.05). All three performance parameters in laparoscopy and endoscopy correlated significantly (p < 0.02). ConclusionBoth simulators can distinguish between experienced and inexperienced subjects. Observed skills in simulated laparoscopy correlate with skills in simulated flexible endoscopy. This finding may have an impact on the design of training programs involving both procedures." .

The extent to which the mechanisms of multisensory integration are subject to the influences of attention, emotion, and/or motivation is currently unknown. The “ventriloquist effect” is widely assumed to be an automatic crossmodal phenomenon, shifting the perceived location of an auditory stimulus toward a concurrently presented visual stimulus. In the present study, we examined whether audiovisual binding, as indicated by the magnitude of the ventriloquist effect, is influenced by threatening auditory stimuli presented prior to the ventriloquist experiment. Syllables spoken in a fearful voice were presented from one of eight loudspeakers, while syllables spoken in a neutral voice were presented from the other seven locations. Subsequently, participants had to localize pure tones while trying to ignore concurrent visual stimuli (both the auditory and the visual stimuli here were emotionally neutral). A reliable ventriloquist effect was observed. The emotional stimulus manipulation resulted in a reduction of the magnitude of the subsequently measured ventriloquist effect in both hemifields, as compared to a control group exposed to a similar attention-capturing, but nonemotional, manipulation. These results suggest that the emotional system is capable of influencing multisensory binding processes that have heretofore been considered automatic." .

The objective of this article is to go beyond this “stereotypical” vision of friendship by showing that social support does not always have a positive and direct effect on adolescents’ academic achievement. We sought to understand whether this relationship is mediated by the educational goals and motives that student value and pursue. If these values do not coincide with the expectations and values that the academic institution seeks to transmit, the influence of social support can become harmful, especially with regard to the students’ academic achievement. Data were collected by means of questionnaires from 676 junior high school students in 9th grade from contrasting academic institutions. We chose to observe each participant’s subjective point of view of three dimensions: social support, academic achievement, and educational goals and motives. The results showed that the relationship between social support and attention and involvement in class was negative and mediated by students’ goals. The adolescents with a high level of social support mainly pursued social goals and neglected achievement and future goals. Consequently, these students were less attentive and involved in class. The results also showed that social support was predictive of students’ investment and interest in personal work and success, but only when the students pursued achievement and future goals." .

Sociological scholarship indicates that this working class may be subject to social stigma and additional psychological stress. As new generations emerge, the migrant workers’ children are publicized to engage in higher level of delinquency and deviant behavior in large Chinese cities. However, this understanding is supported by little empirical evidence as few studies focus on the delinquent behaviors of rural migrant children compared to their urban counterparts. The current study explores this comparison using a high school student survey (N = 1,490) conducted in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. Important contributing factors to the prevalence and variety of self-report delinquency are discussed in the multi-theory framework. Findings suggest that this sample of rural migrant students are exposed to more risks but are not more delinquency-prone than non-migrant students; results show support to quite different socialization processes for the two groups: strong moral beliefs and good academic performance play key roles in the prevention of delinquency for rural migrant students while non-rural migrants are affected by school attachment and negative social activities. Peer delinquency is the strongest predictor of delinquency for both groups." .

Half of each sample experienced induced positive mood immediately before viewing slides of three similarly-valenced images, in varying central-peripheral arrays. Attentional breadth was determined by measuring the percentage viewing time to peripheral images as well as by the number of visual saccades participants made per slide. Consistent with Fredrickson’s theory, the first study showed that individuals induced into positive mood fixated more on peripheral stimuli than did control participants; however, this only held true for highly-valenced positive stimuli. Participants under induced positive mood also made more frequent saccades for slides of neutral and positive valence. A second study showed that these effects were not simply due to differences in emotional arousal between stimuli. Selective attentional broadening to positive stimuli may act both to facilitate later building of resources as well as to maintain current positive affective states." .

In contrast, the Multiple-Read-Out-Model (MROM) of Jacobs and Grainger (J Exp Psychol 20(6): 1311–1334, 1994) predicts a high level of general lexical activity (GLA) for word-stems with many completions, indicating a higher stimulus familiarity because these stems are more probable to be read. We compared word-stems with several completions against word-stems with one possible completion while measuring response times and electrophysiological recordings. Slowest response times and a distinct FN400 component, which has previously been related to the concept of familiarity (Curran in Memory Cogn 28(6):923–938, 2000), were apparent for word-stems that could only be associated with a single response.

After the repeated lifting of a small, heavy stimulus and a large, light one with both hands simultaneously, the size-weight illusion diminished. It increased after lifting a small, light stimulus and a large, heavy one. These changes in perception were explained as contrast effects caused by the sets which were fixed during the preceding lifts. The same method was applied to the weight-size illusion and the contrast effect was observed in some cases. The results of the application of the fixed-set method to the size-weight illusion and to the visual size perception were compared. All the results showed analogous patterns of conflicting states between the temporarily fixed set and the set that the subject prepares naturally for perception, such as the size-weight illusion. By way of conclusion, the size-weight illusion was assumed to be a kind of contrast effect in the light of Uznadze's theory of set." .

Depressives recalled essentially the same number of dysthymic adjectives under the self-reference instructional set with the syndrome present and during remission. Depressives also did not differ from controls in their recall of dysthymic adjectives. Of greater difference between the groups and conditions was the recall effect based on the hypomanic adjectives. Depressives showed a clear absence of recall of hypomanic adjectives during depression, followed by a significant increase in the recall of the same type of adjectives during remission. The results were interpreted as supporting the need for further study of the cognitive processes leading to inhibition and recovery of positive recall in depressives." .

We aimed to expand our understanding of the role motivation plays within communication skills training by investigating whether motivation precedes or, conversely, follows psychosocial attributes. According to goal orientations theory, motivation denotes the goals students pursue when engaging in learning tasks. We hypothesized that goal orientations would predict development of psychosocial attributes. More specifically, an adaptive goal orientation (i.e., mastery goal orientation) was expected to predict perceived psychosocial abilities, whereas the maladaptive goal orientations (i.e., performance-approach and avoidance goal orientations) were hypothesized to predict LFT (frustration intolerance). The study spanned two sequential years, in which two cohorts of first-year medical students (N = 151) completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of an annual physician-patient communication course. The questionnaires assessed goal orientations, perceived psychosocial abilities, and LFT. Cross-lagged analyses using Structural Equation Modeling indicated that goal orientations significantly predicted perceived psychosocial abilities, as hypothesized; however, LFT predicted maladaptive goal orientation, rather than the other way around. These findings provided further support for the contribution of goal orientations theory within medical education contexts. Medical schools are advised to consider motivational aspects when planning and implementing training programs." .

Construct validity, reflected by the correlation coefficient values between the International Prostate Symptom Score and the NIH-CPSI of CP/CPPS patients were 0.72, 0.49 and 0.63 (all P<0.05). The Chinese, Malay and English versions of the NIH-CPSI each proved effective in our population. Short-term TR and discriminant validity were excellent for all three versions. However, long-term TR was only moderate, which might reflect variation in patients’ perceptions of symptoms over time." .

The models are based on a leader's role of achieving cooperation among the interacting members so that they perform their tasks better and hence improve overall team performance. Three different approaches, modified from Kauffman's NK model, are proposed. Each model includes controllable parameters whose values reflect the amount of interaction among the workers as well as the skill and variance of the leader in achieving cooperation. Computer simulations are used to show how the skill level and variance of the leader affect the expected performance of the team. Managerial insights into the value of the leader—such as the fact that finding a more skillful leader can be more important to team performance than controlling the amount of interaction among the team members—are provided." .

The psychological consequences examined included changes in activation of and explicit thoughts about sexism, affective state, excuses for poor performances, and negative attitudes toward the perpetrator. Results illustrated that there are psychological consequences of failing to make an attribution to discrimination, and that the three ways to fail to make an attribution to discrimination are distinct in that each resulted in unique consequences." .

A subgroup of patients receives atypical antipsychotics concurrent with methylphenidate. Long-term safety and efficacy of combined treatment are unknown. The current study provides an initial investigation of structural brain correlates of combined methylphenidate and antipsychotic treatment in patients with ADHD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in 31 patients who had received combined methylphenidate and antipsychotic treatment, 31 matched patients who had received methylphenidate but not antipsychotics, and 31 healthy controls (M age 16.7 years). We analyzed between-group effects in total cortical and subcortical volume, and in seven frontal cortical and eight subcortical-limbic volumes of interest, each involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Patients in the combined treatment group, but not those in the methylphenidate only group, showed a reduction in total cortical volume compared to healthy controls (Cohen’s d = 0.69, p < 0.004), which was apparent in most frontal volumes of interest. Further, the combined treatment group, but not the methylphenidate group, showed volume reduction in bilateral ventral diencephalon (Left Cohen’s d = 0.48, p < 0.04; Right Cohen’s d = 0.46, p < 0.05) and the left thalamus (Cohen’s d = 0.47, p < 0.04). These findings may indicate antipsychotic treatment counteracting the normalizing effects of methylphenidate on brain structure. However, it cannot be ruled out that pre-existing clinical differences between both patient groups may have resulted in anatomical differences at the time of scanning. The absence of an untreated ADHD group hinders unequivocal interpretation and implications of our findings." .

However, most of them were limited to extrapyramidal signs and soft signs such as motor coordination and sensory integration have received much less attention. Very little is known about the relationship between neurological soft signs and neurocognitive function in healthy elder people. The current study aimed to examine the underlying relationships between neurological soft signs and neurocognition in a group of healthy elderly. MethodsOne hundred and eighty healthy elderly participated in the current study. Neurological soft signs were evaluated with the subscales of Cambridge Neurological Inventory. A set of neurocognitive tests was also administered to all the participants. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the underlying relationship between neurological soft signs and neurocognition. ResultsNo significant differences were found between the male and female elder people in neurocognitive function performances and neurological soft signs. The model fitted well in the elderly and indicated the moderate associations between neurological soft signs and neurocognition, specifically verbal memory, visual memory and working memory. ConclusionsThe neurological soft signs are more or less statistically equivalent to capture the similar information done by conventional neurocognitive function tests in the elderly. The implication of these findings may serve as a potential neurological marker for the early detection of pathological aging diseases or related mental status such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease." .

In the first model the quarks interact by a central one-gluon-exchange potential plus confinement potential. The meson-exchange contribution to then-p potential is simulated by a central GaussianN-N potential. In the second model the quarks interact by one-gluon-and one-pion-exchange potentials (central and noncentral) plus confinement potential. A small additional “σ”-exchange potential between neutron and proton binds the deuteron at the correct energy. Several off-shell variants of the two resonating group models are compared with each other by analyzing their elastic electron scattering cross sections. It is found that the standard renormalized version of the resonating group model yields potentials and wave functions that may be considered physical within the limitations of the model. Unitary off-shell transformations, which modify potentials and wave functions in any sizeable way, lead to a disagreement between the charge distribution predicted by the model via analysis of electron scattering and the charge distribution following from the microscopic quark distribution. Both of the 6-quark models support a soft repulsive core of the tripletn-p potential with a core height of around 900 MeV." .

The results showed the legitimacy of the situation for a critical response (preassessed with peer hold-out groups) significantly affected participants' motivation to criticize as well as the quality of their critical responses, notwithstanding the poor quality of all criticism responses. Anxiety related to previous global assertiveness was related to high motivation but not to quality of criticism responses. There were no gender effects.

In addition, Study 3 showed that where the accuracy motivation is dominant and biasing is the easy default, unbiased judgments will occur only in the presence (vs. absence) of resources.

This suggests that information-processing activities that occur after motor execution, but prior to receiving KR (i.e., the KR-delay interval) may underlie self-controlled KR learning advantages. The present experiment investigated whether self-controlled KR learning benefits would be eliminated if an interpolated activity was performed during the KR-delay interval. Participants practiced a waveform matching task that required two rapid elbow extension-flexion reversals in one of four groups using a factorial combination of choice (self-controlled, yoked) and KR-delay interval (empty, interpolated). The waveform had specific spatial and temporal constraints, and an overall movement time goal. The results indicated that the self-controlled + empty group had superior retention and transfer scores compared to all other groups. Moreover, the self-controlled + interpolated and yoked + interpolated groups did not differ significantly in retention and transfer; thus, the interpolated activity eliminated the typically found learning benefits of self-controlled KR. No significant differences were found between the two yoked groups. We suggest the interpolated activity interfered with information-processing activities specific to self-controlled KR conditions that occur during the KR-delay interval and that these activities are vital for reaping the associated learning benefits. These findings add to the growing evidence that challenge the motivational account of self-controlled KR learning advantages and instead highlights informational factors associated with the KR-delay interval as an important variable for motor learning under self-controlled KR schedules." .

To examine the factors that predict an Emergency resident’s interest in pursuing an academic career at the conclusion of training. This study employs the ABEM Longitudinal Survey (n = 365). A logistic regression model was estimated using an interest in an academic career in residency as the dependent variable. Independent variables include gender, under-represented minority status, survey cohort, number of dependent children, possession of an advanced degree, ongoing research, publications, and the appeal of science, independence, and clinical work in choosing EM. Logistic regression resulted in a statistically significant model (p < 0.001). Residents who chose EM due to the appeal of science, had peer-reviewed publications and ongoing research were more likely to be interested in an academic career at the end of residency (p < 0.05). An increased number of children (p < 0.05) was negatively associated with an interest in academics. Individual resident career interests, research productivity, and lifestyle can help predict an interest in pursuing an academic career. Recruitment and enrichment of residents who have similar values and behaviors should be considered in programs interested in generating more graduates who enter an academic career." .

The AB has become a well-studied phenomenon, and multiple different versions of the AB are currently in use. However, little is known about the stability of individual performance on the AB. The current study examined the reliability of two different versions of the AB task (a task-switch and no-task-switch version) within session, and over the period of 7–10 days, in order to examine performance stability. In addition to testing the reliability, we also examined the relationship between both versions of our AB tasks. Both versions of the AB were shown to be reliable within session, and over time, suggesting that performance is quite stable on this task. In addition, performance on the two different AB tasks was significantly correlated within and across sessions, suggesting that the AB phenomenon is being accurately captured by versions of the AB that include a task-switch. These findings are important given the recent interest in individual differences in performance on the AB." .

This bihemispheric network suggests a functional relevance of inter-hemispheric coordination, a notion which is supported by a series of recent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrating correlations between intelligence scores (IQ) and corpus-callosum anatomy. However, these studies also reveal an age-related dissociation: mostly positive associations are reported in adult samples, while negative associations are found in developing samples. In the present study, we re-examine the association between corpus callosum and intelligence measures in a large (734 datasets from 495 participants) developmental mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal sample (6.4–21.9 years) using raw test scores rather than deviation IQ measures to account for the ongoing cognitive development in this age period. Analyzing mid-sagittal measures of regional callosal thickness, a positive association in the splenium of the corpus callosum was found for both verbal and performance raw test scores. This association was not present when the participants’ age was considered in the analysis. Thus, we did not reveal any association that cannot be explained by a temporal co-occurrence of overall developmental trends in intellectual abilities and corpus callosum maturation in the present developing sample." .

This study examined the longitudinal directional associations between conduct problems and expressive language ability. Children enrolled in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 14, 004; 50.3 % boys) were assessed at 3 and 5 years of age. Parent reports of conduct problems and standardised assessments of expressive language were analyzed using cross-lagged modeling. Conduct problems at 3 years was associated with poorer expressive language at 5 years and poorer expressive language at 3 years was associated with increased conduct problems by 5 years. The results support reciprocal associations, rather than a specific unidirectional path, which is commonly found with samples of older children. The emergence of problems in either domain can thus negatively impact upon the other over time, albeit the effects were modest. Studies examining the effects of intervention targeting conduct problems and language acquisition prior to school entry may be warranted in testing the efficacy of prevention programmes related to conduct problems and poor language ability early in childhood." .

Examination of Maxwell’s procedures opens many issues about the role of mathematical representation in physics and the learning background required for its success. Specifically, Maxwell’s training in ‘Cambridge University’ mathematical physics emphasized the use of analogous equations across fields of physics and the repeated solving of extremely difficult problems in physics. Such training develops an array of overlearned mathematical representations supported by highly sophisticated cognitive mechanisms for the retrieval of relevant information from long term memory. For Maxwell, mathematics constituted a new form of representation in physics, enhancing the formal derivational and calculational role of mathematics and opening a cognitive means for the conduct of ‘experiments in the mind’ and for sophisticated representations of theory." .

Clinical accounts describe avoidance strategies including apparently strategic use of distraction or socially shocking behaviour, and obsessive need for control, reflected in domineering behaviour to peers and adults. Educational and management approaches effective for PDA reportedly differ from those for ‘typical’ autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and include novelty, humour and flexibility. Identification of PDA in individuals with ASD may have important implications for management (Eaton and Banting, J Learn Disabil Offending Behav 3:150–157, 2012). Despite increasing interest, no clinician-rated instrument for PDA has been developed. Here, items relevant to PDA were identified from the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorder (DISCO) (Wing et al., J Child Psychol Psychiatry 43:307–325, 2002). The most PDA-specific subset of relevant DISCO items was selected, based on low endorsement in general across a sample of 153 individuals assessed for possible ASD using the DISCO. Having selected 11 DISCO PDA items for the measure, a subset of individuals with a high number of these features was identified (N = 27). Consistent with Newson’s descriptions, this high scoring group was characterised by lack of co-operation, use of apparently manipulative behaviour, socially shocking behaviour, difficulties with other people, anxiety and sudden behavioural changes from loving to aggression. All but one case met criteria for an ASD. This study brings the field a step closer to a clinician-rated measure of PDA features and highlights the need for further elucidation of the PDA phenotype." .

Perceived collinearity of one segment (designated as the test segment) is biased by a second segment (designated as the induction segment), with the size of effect being a function of the relative angle between the two segments. The process can be described as angular induction. The strength of bias is greatest when the induction segment is centered at the tip of the test segment. Tong and Weintraub have reported that lateral displacement from the tip, i.e., at right angles to the axis of the induction segment, produces a sharp drop in the strength of effect. This decline is described as a “decay gradient” for the angular induction. One experiment replicates and provides better quantification of this “decay gradient”. Two other experiments examine the decay gradient using a pair of induction segments, one on each side of the tip of the test segment. Displacement of the segments (either in the same direction or in opposite directions) produces substantially the same gradient of effect. Therefore, previous evidence of “tandem boosting” of effect for segment pairs does not depend on collinearity among the stimulus components. Finally, a fourth experiment finds that an induction segment which is at a fixed position and orientation differentially affects the influence of a variable induction segment. At some angles the influence of the variable segment is augmented, and at others it is suppressed. These findings are discussed in a neuroreductionist context, and a simple model for angular induction is presented." .

Participants received instrumental training; either they received FI training (Experiment 1), or they were trained to emit high rates and low rates of response via exposure to a multiple VR yoked-VI schedule prior to exposure to a multiple FI FI schedule in order to alter their rates of responding learned during Experiment 2. Participants were then exposed to either a focused- (mindfulness) or an unfocused-attention induction task. All participants were finally exposed to an extinction schedule in order to determine whether a mindfulness induction task presented immediately prior to extinction training affected extinction (Experiment 1) and behavioral resurgence (Experiment 2). During the extinction phase, the rates of responding were higher in the control group than in the mindfulness group, indicating that the mindfulness group was more sensitive to the contingencies and, thus, their prior performance extinguished more readily (Experiment 1). Moreover, rates of response in the extinction components less precisely reflected previous training in the mindfulness group, suggesting less resurgence of past behaviors after the mindfulness induction (Experiment 2)." .

An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was obtained while the participants passively viewed pictures with neutral or negative affective valence. 15 male adolescents with violent behavior, ranging in age from 12 to 18 years old, and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects were enrolled in the study. While looking at neutral pictures, several brain regions were activated more intensely in the violent group than the control one. After digitally subtracting the control group, these areas included the bilateral amygdala, left orbital gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, and left visual cortex. While passively viewing negative pictures, the right inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus were less activated in the violent group than the control group. Male adolescents with violent behaviors have some dysfunctions during the processing and evaluation of information from external emotional stimulus. These individuals are inclined to interpret neutral information as threatening stimulus." .

In one experiment, subjects were cued to attend to one end of an oblong object. They then detected targets on the cued object or elsewhere. In another experiment, subjects provided judgments of the relative temporal order of two flashes after their attention had moved endogenously. In a third experiment, subjects were directed to attend to an empty spatial location and subsequently discriminated features of objects that appeared at or near the locus of attention. In each of these situations, attentional orienting was object based, in the sense that non-attended locations that were on the cued object had an advantage over nonattended locations that were not on the object. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for object-based representations and the differences between exogenous and endogenous orienting of attention." .

Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a method of communicating with an external program or device based on measured electrical signals from the brain. A particular brain signal, the P300 potential, can be measured about 300 ms after a voluntary cognitive involvement to external stimuli. By utilizing the P300 potential, we have designed a BCI- assisted exercising tool targeting attention enhancement within an immersive 3D virtual reality (VR) classroom. MethodsCombining a low-cost infrared camera with an “off-axis perspective projection” algorithm to achieve the illusion of 3D, an engaging training environment has been created. The setup also includes a single measurement electrode placed on the scalp above the parietal lobe (Pz). Two sets of experiments have been performed to elicit the P300 potential. One used a system which is a variant of Farwell and Donchin’s famous P300 speller and the other used a system where the user is required to search for a specific letter in a series of changing images. A non-linear optimized support vector machine (SVM) classifier has been used to automatically detect the P300 potential. ResultsSix subjects have participated in the preliminary experiment to test the prototype system, and an average error rate below 0.30 have been achieved, which is noteworthy considering the simplicity of the scheme. ConclusionsThis work has successfully demonstrated a non-intrusive, low-cost, and portable system targeting attention in a motivating and engaging environment." .

We propose that in a simultaneous discrimination, given what is typically relatively little experience with the consequences of responding to the S−, some of the value of the S+ transfers to the S− with which it was paired. Furthermore, the mechanisms responsible for this transfer of value appear to be the higher order Pavlovian association between the S− and the S+, as well as within-event associations between them. Although in typical simultaneous discriminations, negative value does not appear to transfer from the S− to the S+, when adequate experience is provided with the S−, contrast typically develops, reducing the value of the S− (negative contrast) and enhancing the value of the S+ (positive contrast). This model of stimulus interactions has implications not only for simple simultaneous discrimination learning, but also for research using combinations of discriminations (e.g., transitive inference in animals and humans). This model may also have implications for a number of human social psychological phenomena." .

We suggest that the discrimination of percepts according to these categories relies on proprioceptive information, which allows the perceiving subject to know that he is ‘animate’. Since other ‘objects’ in the world exhibit movements, reactions, etc. similar to those that the subject experiences himself, he can ‘project’ his knowledge onto these objects and recognize them as ‘animate’ like himself. On this basis we try to corroborate the empricist position in the debate concerning the organization of knowledge as opposed to the nativist view. Furthermore, we argue that the categorical dichotomy animate/inanimate is more basic than other analogous ones such as living/non-living, biological/non-biological and we sketch a ‘categorical stratification’ following the line ‘humans–animals–plants’ based on the hypothesis that humans detect different degrees of ‘vitality’ according to the degree of similarity they recognise between the considered instance and themselves." .

It is unclear, however, whether protective features of the school environment such as anti-bullying classroom policies and teacher’s perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations can mitigate these negative outcomes. Using a genetically informed design based on twins, this study examined the potential moderating role of classroom anti-bullying policies and teachers’ perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations in regard to the additive and interactive effects of peer victimization and genetic vulnerability on anxiety symptoms. To this end, 208 monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twins (120 girls) rated their level of anxiety and peer victimization in grade 6 (mean age = 12.1 years, SD = 2.8). Teachers rated their self-efficacy in handling bullying situations and the extent of anti-bullying classroom policies. Multilevel regressions revealed triple interactions showing that genetic disposition for anxiety predicted actual anxiety for twins who were highly victimized by their peers, but only when their teachers had low perceived self-efficacy in handling bullying situations or when anti-bullying classroom rules were absent or rarely enforced. In contrast, for victimized youth with teachers who perceive themselves as effective or in classrooms where anti-bullying classroom policies were strongly enforced, genetic disposition for anxiety was not associated with actual anxiety symptoms. Anti-bullying programs should continue to promote teachers’ involvement, as well as the enforcement of anti-bullying classroom policies, in order to diminish peer victimization and its related consequences." .

Representative population-based samples with same methods at two time-points, same age range and with 10-year period between the time points were gathered in Finland to investigate secular changes in adolescents’ emotional and behavioral problems. Seventh and ninth grade students filled in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and questions regarding alcohol use and smoking anonymously during a school lesson in 1998 (n = 1458) and 2008 (n = 1569). The self-reports of SDQ showed substantial stability in emotional and behavioral problems from 1998 to 2008. There was no increase between the two timepoints in self-reports of SDQ total, conduct, hyperactivity, emotional or peer problems when using the 90th percentile clinical cut-off points. However, there was a trend showing decreasing prosocial behavior among girls indicating that proportions of adolescent boys and girls having problems in prosocial behavior have converged, The self-reported alcohol use, drunkenness and cigarette smoking decreased within the 10-year time period. Of alcohol use, the number of non-users increased from 44 to 63 % between the years 1998 and 2008. Similarly, the proportion of non-smokers increased from 56 to 68 %.

In Experiment 1, groups given N-R transitions within S+ were more resistant to discrimination (ran fast in S−) and extinction than were groups given a partial reinforcement (PRF) schedule in S+ devoid of N-R transitions. Experiment 2 indicated that N-R transitions that occur when an N trial in S− is followed by an R trial in S+ are as effective in increasing resistance to discrimination, but not resistance to extinction, as are N-R transitions that occur within S+. The sequential effects obtained here were highly similar to those in conventional PRF and support the view that differential conditioning and PRF are highly interrelated phenomena. The results are discussed in terms of the extension of sequential theory to differential conditioning and the importance of internal reward-produced cues in discrimination learning." .

Expectations of barriers may have the same effect, but evidence is lacking. The aim of this study is to examine parents’ and adolescents’ expectations of barriers regarding psychosocial care for the child, along with associated child and family characteristics. We obtained data on an age-stratified random sample of school children/pupils aged 4–18 via questionnaires (N = 666; response rate 70.3 %). Expectations of barriers to psychosocial care were measured with the “Barriers to Treatment Participation Scale-Expectancies” questionnaire (BTPS-exp). Results showed that 64 % of the parents of children below age 12, 59 % of the parents of adolescents (age 12–18), and 84 % of the adolescents expected one or more barriers. Parents and adolescents expected barriers most frequently with respect to irrelevance of treatment. Mainly parents with low educational level and their adolescents expected barriers regarding treatment, and quite a few characteristics of parents of adolescents were associated with expecting multiple barriers regarding treatment demands and issues, for example, single parents, parents of lower educational level and of adolescent boys, and parents of adolescents with psychosocial problems. We conclude that adolescents especially, but also their parents and parents of younger children, expect major barriers to psychosocial care, which may greatly hinder appropriate care seeking. This evidence may support professionals and policymakers in their attempts to improve access to psychosocial care." .

Some illustrative cases are reported in detail. The study shows that conversion reactions in children can often be accurately diagnosed by detailed history and physical examination. When the diagnosis was made early and presented with certainty, both parental acceptance and the child's recovery were easier, and the need for expensive and unnecessary diagnostic procedures was eliminated. Immediate intervention by the paediatrician prevented perpetuation of the problem, secondary gains and continuing family stress. Most of the patients recovered after a few days without recurrence. The major role of the paediatrician is emphasized. Co-operation between the patients, parents and the paediatrician is important, as is close follow up.

Tenets of the theory, however, also suggest conditions in which selectivity could instead lead to an increase in negative emotional experiences. In particular, if the socioemotional world of the individual includes emotional distress, selective focus on emotions and close relationships may detract from rather than enhance well-being. In the current study, we examined selectivity and associated well-being in Holocaust survivors, Japanese-American internment camp survivors, and comparably-aged people who lived through World War II but did not experience major trauma. We predicted that selectivity would relate to positive mental health in all groups except the Holocaust survivors who, on average, experience elevated levels of negative affect and social networks that include other survivors also experiencing distress. Results generally supported these hypotheses, and are discussed in light of individual and group differences in socioemotional ageing, as well as the implications for the generality of social developmental theories of adaptive functioning." .

In the conventional response-terminated procedure a response during the trial stimulus immediately extinguishes the key light and initiates the intertrial interval (ITI), while in the standard fixed-trial procedure the trial stimulus terminates at the end of a fixed period of time irrespective of responding during the trial. A response during the trial stimulus in either procedure cancels the food reinforcement ordinarily available at the termination of the trial. In the present experiment, a particular key color was paired explicitly with food presentations on response-free trials. The conditioned reinforcing value of this stimulus was assessed in the fixed-trial and response-terminated procedures by presenting or withholding it at the end of trials containing a peck. The results suggest no critical role for conditioned reinforcement in the acquisition and maintenance of omission responding. For both procedures the rate of key peck acquisition, steady-state levels of responding, response latency and response rate were independent of the availability of conditioned reinforcement on food-omission trials. Moreover, the performances of subjects trained on the response-terminated procedure were no different from those of subjects exposed to the fixed-trial procedure." .

Material and methodsTwenty-two patients (mean age 51.5) having at least two pairs of non-carious cervical sclerotic erosion⁄attrition⁄abfraction lesions with incisal or occlusal margins in the enamel and gingival margins in the dentin were included in the study. The two-step self-etch adhesive was applied following either the self-etch approach (AdheSE non-etch, n = 52) or a similar application approach, including prior selective acid-etching of the enamel margins (AdheSE etch, n = 52). Composite resin Point 4 (Kerr Corp; Orange, CA, USA) was used as the restorative material for all 104 restorations. The restorations were evaluated at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 years, according to the modified USPHS criteria. Data were analyzed using McNemar’s test (p < 0.05). ResultsThe retention rates for AdheSE non-etch were 100 %, 98 %, and 91.5 %; whereas, 100 %, 100 %, and 97.9 % retention rates were recorded for AdheSE etch after 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. No significant differences were detected between the retention rates, marginal adaptation at the dentin side, secondary caries, and postoperative sensitivity (p > 0.05). A significantly higher number of restorations in AdheSE non-etch group showed clinically acceptable slight marginal discoloration (p = 0.0001) and clinically acceptable small marginal defects at the enamel side (p = 0.008) than in the AdheSE etch group. ConclusionsAfter 3 years, the two-step self-etch adhesive exhibited acceptable clinical performance with or without selective enamel etching in non-carious cervical sclerotic lesions. Clinical relevanceSelective acid-etching of the enamel margins enhanced the performance of the two-step self-etch adhesive in terms of marginal discoloration and marginal adaptation at the enamel side." .

Design, Methodology, ApproachData were gathered from published and unpublished research examining the goal orientation construct and self-regulation and/or task performance. Effect sizes from 102 research reports involving over 16,000 participants were included. FindingsIn general the mastery-approach goal orientation construct was positively related to the self-regulation and performance variables. Conversely, negative relationships were found between the performance-avoid goal orientation and those variables. Relationships between goal orientation and self-regulation tended to be higher compared to those found for goal orientation and performance. Overall, the findings support the discriminant validity of the three factors of goal orientation (mastery-approach, performance-approach, performance-avoid). Practical ImplicationsPractitioners and researchers will benefit from learning that mastery-approach goal orientation consistently relates to self-regulation and task performance. The findings indicate that a mastery-approach goal orientation could serve as a meaningful predictor in selection processes or as an explanatory variable of motivation.

Chicks show some sharply-timed behavioural changes at around 11 days of age that may be indicative of improvements in navigation ability around this age. We trained Young (<10 days, n = 7) and Old (11 days or older, n = 6) chicks to find a hidden imprinting stimulus behind one of four screens in a square arena. Once criterion was reached, the directional choices of chicks were recorded in unrewarded tests in the geomagnetic field and in an experimental field shifted by 90° clockwise. These tests were separated with rewarded training trials to avoid extinction. In the first, and the first 3 tests, no indication was found that chicks chose the correct unimodal magnetic direction. Instead, in all tests, Old chicks preferred the screens in the same magnetic axis as the training direction in tests in the geomagnetic and shifted experimental fields significantly more than Young chicks (P < 0.05). Choices of Young chicks were no different to chance in tests, whereas choices by Old chicks were significantly different from chance (P < 0.05). Our findings support the hypothesis that magnetoreception appears in the second week of life in the chicken. It is, however, unclear when a truly directional magnetic response (i.e. an unimodal, rather than axial, response in our test) develops that could be used by the chicks for accurate navigation." .

The early postoperative period is a time of high patient care needs and transition of care, with carers new to the caring role. This study aimed to explore the experiences of family caregivers of people diagnosed with upper GI cancer after surgical intervention to (1) identify their unmet supportive care needs and (2) investigate how family caregivers perceive their role during this time. MethodsFamily caregivers of newly diagnosed postsurgical upper GI cancer patients were recruited. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted at 3 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. Analysis involved a constant comparative approach. Sampling was discontinued when information redundancy was achieved. Fifteen family caregivers participated in the first interview and eight agreed to a second interview. ResultsFamily caregivers reported significant information and support needs. Family caregiver distress was exacerbated by a lack of patient care knowledge. Access to support was limited by caregivers’ lack of understanding of the health system. Family caregivers view their role as part of their family responsibility. ConclusionsThis study provides new insight into the supportive care needs of family caregivers of upper GI cancer patients and the impact of unmet need on the emotional well-being of family caregivers.

Observers used a joystick to continuously indicate the likelihood of an imminent goal. We measured correlations between manual responses and between-subjects variability in eye position. To identify the lag magnitude, we repeated these correlations over a range of possible delays between these two measures and searched for the most negative correlation coefficient. We found lags in the order of 2 sec and an effect of expertise on lag magnitude, suggesting that expertise has its effect by directing eye movements to task-relevant areas of a scene more quickly, facilitating a longer processing duration before behavioral decisions are made. This is a powerful new method for examining the eye movement behavior of multiple observers across complex moving images." .

An outwardly directed K+ gradient (intravesicular K+ concentration, Kin, 100 mM; extravesicular K+ concentration, Kout, 0.25 mM) stimulated uphill H+ influx into right-side-out vesicles and created the inside-acidic pH gradient (ΔpH). This H+ influx was pH-dependent and increased as the pH increased from 6.8 to 8.4. Addition of 100 μM quinine inhibited the H+ influx by 75%. This exchange process was electroneutral, and the H+ influx was not stimulated by the imposition of the membrane potential (interior negative). Addition of K+ at the point of maximum ΔpH caused a rapid K+-dependent H+ eflux consistent with the inward exchange of external K+ for internal H+ by a K+/H+ antiporter. Rb+ and Cs+ could replace K+ but Na+ and Li+ could not. The H+ efflux rate was a hyperbolic function of K+ and increased with increasing extravesicular pH (pHout) from 7.5 to 8.5. These findings were consistent with the presence of K+/H+ antiport activity in these membrane vesicles." .

Using prospective information collected from mothers in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), we investigated if developmental deviations in the first years of life are associated with later ADHD. In the DNBC 76,286 mothers were interviewed about their child’s development and behaviour at age 6 and 18 months. At the end of follow-up, when the children were 8–14 years of age, 2034 were registered in Danish health registers with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. The Hazard Ratio of ADHD was estimated using Cox regression model. At 6 months of age deviations in development showed associations with the child later being diagnosed with ADHD such as duration of breastfeeding, motor functioning, and incessant crying. At 18 months, many observations clearly associated with ADHD as for example the child not being able to fetch things on request [HR 3.0 (95 % CI 2.4; 3.7)], or the child being significantly more active than average [HR 2.0 (95 % CI 1.8; 2.2)]. An association to ADHD was shown, especially at 18 months, if the mother found it difficult to handle the child [HR 2.9 (95 % CI 2.4–3.5)]. However, it goes for all observations that the positive predictive values were low. Many children with ADHD showed signs of developmental deviations during the first years of their life. In general, however, ADHD cannot be identified solely on basis of the questions in DNBC." .

Changes in daily routine, added responsibilities, role changes, and the grief process are all contributors to the enormous stress and emotional strain felt by these couples. Couples where one partner is terminally ill may experience anger, depression, guilt, and anxiety. The authors propose that emotionally focused couple therapy (EFT), originally developed by Greenberg and Johnson (Emotionally focused therapy for couples, Guilford Press, New York, NY, 1988) may be effective in addressing this distress and in facilitating the grieving and support process in couples dealing with terminal illness. EFT is a systemic, experiential form of therapy that builds upon Bowlby’s (Attachment and loss: Volume I: Attachment, Basic Books, New York, NY, 1969) attachment theory. By exploring the emotional experience of both partners it may be possible to re-structure the couple’s emotional partnership and support the grief process for both partners." .

At each step along the way, the evidence suggests that a cognitive process observed at one spatiotemporal scale of analysis is inseparable from the larger subsuming cognitive process observed at the next larger spatiotemporal scale of analysis. Each incremental expansion of the spatiotemporal scale of analysis is a small enough step to seem trivial, and unlikely to serve as a categorical distinction between “the mind” and the “rest of the world”. Such expansions illustrate the necessity for attending to cognitive phenomena that span across two or more spatiotemporal scales. Our analysis suggests that a mind can be observed among the physical processes that connect together a brain, a body, and an environment, and even among the physical processes that connect a group of people together." .

Different from the prior expression cloning or image analogy approaches, we try to hallucinate the person’s plausible facial expression with the help of a large face expression database. In the first step, regularization network based nonlinear manifold learning is used to obtain a smooth estimation for unseen facial expression, which is better than the reconstruction results of PCA. In the second step, Markov network is adopted to learn the low-level local facial feature’s relationship between the residual neutral and the expressional face image’s patches in the training set, then belief propagation is employed to infer the expressional residual face image for that person. By integrating the two approaches, we obtain the final results. The experimental results show that the hallucinated facial expression is not only expressive but also close to the ground truth." .

The present study aimed to specify the mechanisms underlying joint action by considering trial-to-trial transitions. Using non-social stimuli, we assigned a Simon task to two participants. Each was responsible for only one of two possible responses. This task was performed alone (Individual go/nogo task) and in cooperation with another person who was sitting alongside (Joint go/nogo task). As a further control task, we added a Standard Simon task. Replicating previous findings (Sebanz et al. in Cognition 88:B11–B21, 2003), we found no spatial compatibility effect in the Individual go/nogo task but we did find one in the Joint go/nogo task. A more detailed analysis showed that a sequential modulation of the Simon effect was present in both the Joint and the Individual go/nogo tasks. We found reliable Simon effects in trials following Simon compatible trials not only in the Joint go/nogo task but also to a somewhat smaller extent in the Individual go/nogo task. For both these go/nogo tasks, sequential modulation effects were stronger for nogo/go transitions than for go/go transitions. This suggests that low-level feature binding and repetition mechanisms contribute to the social Simon effect related to the specific requirement not to respond on nogo trials." .

Pfungst the use of human-provided cues by animals has been well-known in the behavioural sciences (“Clever Hans effect”). It has recently been shown that rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are unable to use the direction of gazing by the experimenter as a cue for finding food, although after some training they learned to respond to pointing by hand. Direction of gaze is used by chimpanzees, however. Dogs (Canis familiaris) are believed to be sensitive to human gestural communication but their ability has never been formally tested. In three experiments we examined whether dogs can respond to cues given by humans. We found that dogs are able to utilize pointing, bowing, nodding, head-turning and glancing gestures of humans as cues for finding hidden food. Dogs were also able to generalize from one person (owner) to another familiar person (experimenter) in using the same gestures as cues. Baseline trials were run to test the possibility that odour cues alone could be responsible for the dogs’ performance. During training individual performance showed limited variability, probably because some dogs already “knew” some of the cues from their earlier experiences with humans. We suggest that the phenomenon of dogs responding to cues given by humans is better analysed as a case of interspecific communication than in terms of discrimination learning." .

A multi-faceted model of impulsivity was adopted to explore how different facets may relate differently to BD. The evidence was explored in relation to studies employing measures of trait impulsivity (in self-report format) and studies exploring impulsivity with behavioural paradigms. Behavioural paradigms were separated into studies measuring response inhibition and those measuring the ability to delay gratification. Twenty-three papers met the inclusion criteria. Most studies using self-report measures found significant differences between euthymic BD patients and healthy controls. There was little evidence of increased impulsivity as measured by behavioural paradigms. Most studies found no significant difference in response inhibition between groups, though it is possible that much of the literature in this area was underpowered to detect an effect. Only five studies explored delay of gratification, of which the two methodologically strongest studies found no group differences. In conclusion, there is evidence that euthymic patients with BD report increased impulsivity when using self-ratings. However, there is currently limited evidence of impulsivity on behavioural measures assessing response inhibition, and this might be restricted to more severe cases. More research is needed on the ability to delay gratification before drawing any conclusions. However, to establish facets of impulsivity as vulnerability markers, future studies should include at-risk individuals to evaluate whether self-rated or behavioural impulsivity precedes the onset of BD." .

Competing hypotheses either suggest the rTPJ representing a unitary region involved in separate cognitive functions or consisting of subregions subserving distinct processes. We conducted activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to test these hypotheses. A conjunction analysis across ALE meta-analyses delineating regions consistently recruited by reorienting of attention and false belief studies revealed the anterior rTPJ, suggesting an overarching role of this specific region. Moreover, the anatomical difference analysis unravelled the posterior rTPJ as higher converging in false belief compared with reorienting of attention tasks. This supports the concept of an exclusive role of the posterior rTPJ in the social domain. These results were complemented by meta-analytic connectivity mapping (MACM) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis to investigate whole-brain connectivity patterns in task-constrained and task-free brain states. This allowed for detailing the functional separation of the anterior and posterior rTPJ. The combination of MACM and RSFC mapping showed that the posterior rTPJ has connectivity patterns with typical ToM regions, whereas the anterior part of rTPJ co-activates with the attentional network. Taken together, our data suggest that rTPJ contains two functionally fractionated subregions: while posterior rTPJ seems exclusively involved in the social domain, anterior rTPJ is involved in both, attention and ToM, conceivably indicating an attentional shifting role of this region." .

First, participants’ own judgment tendency (a true vs. lie tendency) was manipulated by informing them about the resource-consuming consequences of their judgment, i.e., giving additional explanations for each student statement they judged as being true (vs. a lie). Before actually judging the students’ statements they were informed about the judgment tendency of other teachers about the upcoming student statements (true vs. lie tendency of other teachers). It was assumed that participants ‘cleverly’ choose a resource-saving judgment tendency and show a true (vs. lie) tendency when additional explanations for their lie (vs. true) judgments were required. Moreover, it was assumed that participants’ accuracy rate would be higher if their own judgment tendency opposed the judgment tendency of other teachers.

The study involved 26 male Nigerian undergraduate students evidencing severe examination anxiety. These students were randomly assigned to one of three groups with different treatment goals (a “mind change” group, a “behaviour change” group, and a “No Goal” group). All subjects received the same treatment — a combination of systematic desensitization and a process of gradual habituation. Differences between the groups in willingness to participate in treatment were assessed on the basis of the actual frequency of attendance at scheduled treatment sessions by subjects in each group. The results indicated that the subjects in the “behaviour change” group attended significantly more treatment sessions than the subjects in the other two groups. This finding suggests the need for awareness of the possible effects of the stated or implied treatment goals on the acceptance of psychological treatment among university-level educated clients." .

Gaps in knowledge include issues as basic as RB’s typical symptom presentation during childhood and which symptoms differ across sex. The current study sought to fill these gaps in the literature by establishing the prevalence and psychometric properties of specific RB behaviors in a sample of 1022 twin boys and 1010 twin girls between the ages of 6 and 10 years. Legal RB behaviors (e.g., breaking rules, swears, lying or cheating) were present to varying degrees in most children, regardless of whether or not they passed the clinical threshold for RB. They were also more common in boys than in girls regardless of their clinical status. In sharp contrast, illegal RB behaviors (e.g., stealing, vandalism, setting fires) were rarely observed in typically-developing children, but were seen at moderate levels in boys and girls with clinically-significant levels of RB. Moreover, sex differences in illegal RB behaviors were observed only for those youth with clinically meaningful levels of RB. Such findings collectively imply that while legal RB behaviors can be found (albeit at different frequencies) in children with and without clinically meaningful levels of RB, illegal RB behaviors may function as relatively ‘unambiguous’ indicator of clinically-significant levels of RB." .

The task on each item was to judge whether the presented variables corresponded to a problem that could be computed. (No values were given and no computation was carried out.) The main finding was a strong interaction: With formulas consisting of uninterpreted letters, judgments of uncomputable items were much slower than judgments of computable items; however, the difference between positive and negative items was much smaller when formulas consisted of meaningful concepts. Attempts to remove the interaction by presenting the nonsense formulas as an integrated network or by using a format allowing easy chunking of the variables in each formula did not succeed. At this point it appears most promising to investigate effects of meaningfulness on basic component processes, such as decisions about whether pairs of items come from the same formula." .

We investigate the numbers of transitions of MinST and MaxST whent increases from-∞ to +∞. We assume that the dimensiond is a fixed constant. Since there areO(n 2) distances amongn points, there are naivelyO(n 4) transitions of MinST and MaxST. We improve these trivial upper bounds forL 1 andL ∞ distance metrics. Letk p (n) (resp.) be the number of maximum possible transitions of MinST (resp. MaxST) inL p metric forn linearly moving points.

We used ancient pictographic characters as stimuli, which were categorized as high or low meaningfulness based on the subjective ratings.

In Experiment 2, Dm effects of familiarity and conceptual fluency were observed, respectively.

We couple these intrinsic dynamics to visual information that stabilizes posture in the visual world. This leads to a theory of postural sway induced by an optic flow field (“moving room” paradigm). The optic flow is parametrized in a simplest approximation by the expansion rate of a relevant perceptual target.

Self-evaluation was lauded as potentially unique partially because of motivational and affective influences. Despite the acknowledgement that motivation influences social cognition such as self-perception, neural models of self-perception have been conspicuously silent on how motivational states affect the neural level of analysis. What can be learned by examining motivational influences on the neural systems underlying social cognition including self-perception? An emerging body of neural research on self-enhancement motivation (i.e., the motivation to see one’s self in a positive light) is described and its implications for longstanding psychological questions about self-enhancement are discussed. Finally, several additional avenues for using the neural level of analysis to test questions about motivational influences on social cognition are discussed." .

One of the central psychological processes of the puerperium is the development of an emotional relationship with the baby. The bond to the infant as well as the interaction with the baby are two aspects of the mother–infant relationship that can be disturbed by mothers with postpartum psychiatric disorders. Dysfunctional maternal cognitions may also influence the development of an emotional bonding and the establishment of a positive interaction with the child. The aim of this study is to investigate differences in the self-perceived experience of bonding and the observed mother–child interaction of severely ill postpartum depressive and psychotic mothers. In addition the association between subjective experience of bonding and objective measurement of mother–child interaction will be described. Results show that depressive mothers perceived their bonding to the baby more negatively than psychotic mothers. No differences could be found in the objective interactional behaviour of the mothers in both groups, with the exception that the infants of psychotic mothers showed more eye contact avoidance towards their mothers. The subjective experience of motherhood clearly influences the maternal interactional behaviour with depressive mothers as well as with psychotic mothers." .

Moreover, there are implicit emotions that cannot be consciously experienced, but still influence human behaviors and memories. It has been proven that conscious emotions can be recognized from physiological signals of the human body. This fact may be used to enhance life-logs with information about unconscious emotions, which otherwise would remain hidden. On the other hand, it is not clear if unconscious emotions can be recognized from physiological signals and differentiated from conscious emotions. Therefore, an experiment was designed to elicit emotions (both conscious and unconscious) with visual and auditory stimuli and to record cardiovascular responses of 34 participants. The experimental results showed that heart rate responses to the presentation of the stimuli are unique for every category of the emotional stimuli and allow differentiation between various emotional experiences of the participants." .

The severity of asthma was evaluated using the Pearlman-Bierman classification. Psychological adjustment was measured using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a semi-structured interview. The results of the interviews indicated that regressive symptoms such as clinging, childish behaviour, dependence, and a demanding nature were widespread. Using the illness in the service of achieving other aims was also common in the asthmatic children. CBCL total problem behaviour scores, social competency, and broad band scores were significantly higher in the asthmatic group than the control sample. Problem scores for asthmatic children were significantly correlated with parental friction at home, unsatisfactory relationships with siblings and other health problems in children. However, neither the CBCL total problem scores nor the social competency scores were correlated with the severity and the duration of illness." .

Patients and methodsSeventy-four families (189 individuals: 74 patients, 54 spouses, 46 offspring, and 15 other relatives) completed self-report questionnaires. Perception of family functioning was assessed using the family relationship index (FRI) and its three dimensions (cohesiveness, expressiveness, and conflict) and was classified into groups by a cluster analytic approach. Psychological distress was assessed using the Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS). Main resultsCluster analysis yielded three groups of patients and their family members: one cluster with high cohesiveness, high expressiveness, and low conflict (“supportive” type: n=64); a second group with low cohesiveness, low expressiveness, and high conflict (“conflictive” type: n=65); and a third group with limited cohesiveness, limited expressiveness, and low conflict (“intermediate” type: n=60). Analysis of variance revealed that conflictive families manifested the highest level of depression and anxiety among these clusters. ConclusionsTypology of family functioning can identify psychologically at-risk families. A family-focused approach can help to reduce psychological distress, especially in conflictive families." .

We conducted a population-based study of dizygotic female twins to elucidate this hypothesis, assuming that the sex of the co-twin influences the level of prenatal exposure to testosterone. We invited parents of 24,552 3- to 15-year-old twins to answer questionnaires on traits of ADHD and ASD. We analysed the data using a proportional odds model with sex of the co-twin as an instrumental variable for prenatal exposure to testosterone of female twins. We received responses for 6,339 girls from dizygotic twin pairs. Odds ratios for male versus female co-twin were 0.71 (95 % confidence interval 0.61–0.81) for ADHD traits and 0.74 (0.66–0.83) for ASD traits, indicating that a twin brother reduces traits of ADHD and ASD in females. In conclusion, we found that female twins with a twin brother scored significantly lower in parent-reported traits of ADHD and ASD than those with a twin sister. The reason for this may be parental reporting bias, or confounding by unmeasured variables, or a causal effect of an intrauterine environment modified by the sex of the co-twin in the opposite direction of what we expected." .

ObjectiveHere, we evaluated the role of CB2 receptors in the rewarding properties of nicotine, as assessed in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and mecamylamine-precipitated withdrawal in nicotine dependent mice. MethodsUsing complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches, we investigated the involvement of CB2 receptors in nicotine- and cocaine-induced CPP in mice and mecamylamine-precipitated withdrawal in nicotine-dependent mice. We also determined whether deletion of CB2 receptors affects nicotine-induced hypothermia and hypoalgesia. ResultsNicotine-induced (0.5 mg/kg) CPP was completely blocked by selective CB2 antagonist, SR144528 (3 mg/kg) in wild-type mice, and was absent in CB2 (−/−) mice. Conversely, the CB2 receptor agonist, O-1966 (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg) given in combination with a subthreshold dose of nicotine (0.1 mg/kg) elicited a place preference. In contrast, O-1966 (20 mg/kg) blocked cocaine (10 mg/kg)-induced CPP in wild type mice, while CB2 (−/−) mice showed unaltered cocaine CPP. CB2 (+/+) and (−/−) nicotine-dependent mice showed almost identical precipitated withdrawal responses and deletion of CB2 receptor did not alter acute somatic effects of nicotine. ConclusionsCollectively, these results indicate that CB2 receptors are required for nicotine-induced CPP in the mouse, while it is not involved in nicotine withdrawal or acute effects of nicotine. Moreover, these results suggest that CB2 receptors play opposing roles in nicotine- and cocaine-induced CPP." .

A distinct pattern of psychotherapy orientations and fortes emerged which transcended professional backgrounds and proved stable across generations, despite some interactions between training and time. Subjects' professed areas of expertise were closely aligned with their beliefs about what methods are most effective in psychotherapy, and both these variables were significantly associated with their value profiles. The correlation matrix suggested a three-factor model of related psychotherapy and value orientations surrounding the three predominant modalities: insight, corrective emotional experiences, and learning.

In this way our justification for beliefs about the physical world may be nondoxastic and this differentiates my proposal from traditional foundationalist theories such as those defended by Laurence BonJour, Richard Fumerton, and Timothy McGrew. On the other hand, it differs from certain non-traditional foundationalist theories such as that defended by James Pryor according to which perceptual experience is sufficient to justify beliefs about the external world. I propose that justification for propositions describing our perceptual experiences partially constitutes any justification we may possess for beliefs concerning the external world. In this way, our justification for beliefs about the physical world may only be inferential since it is grounded in any justification we have for at least one other proposition. This theory occupies an intermediate position between the two aforementioned foundationalist accounts, which allows it to sidestep problems that confront each of them." .

For example, a known change in the base rate of targets and distractors on a recognition memory test will lead optimal decision makers to shift their criterion accordingly. In the present study, 95 individuals participated in two recognition memory tests that included periodic changes in the base rate probability that the test stimulus had been presented during the study session. The results reveal a wide variability in the tendency to shift decision criterion in response to this probability information, with some appropriately shifting and others not shifting at all. However, participants were highly reliable in their tendency to shift criterion across tests. The goal of the present study was to explain what factors account for these individual differences. To accomplish this, over 50 variables were assessed for each individual (e.g., personality, cognitive style, state of mind). Using a regression model that incorporated different sets of factors, over 50 % of the variance was accounted for. The results of the analysis describe the total, direct, and mediating effects on criterion shifting from factors that include memory strength, strategy, and inherent characteristics such as a fun-seeking personality, a negative affect, and military rank. The results are discussed with respect to understanding why participants rarely chose an optimal decision-making strategy and provide greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of recognition memory." .

Reasons for this include the increasing volume of road traffic and a rising quantity of road signs, traffic lights, and other distractions at the roadside (such as billboards), to name a few. The application of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, in particular if taking advantage of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technology, can help to increase the perceptivity of a driver, leading as a direct consequence to more relaxed mental stress of the same. One situation where we see potential in the application of such a system are merging areas on the expressway where two or more varying traffic streams converge into a single one. In order to reduce cognitive liabilities (in this work expressed as panic or anger), drivers are exposed to while merging, we have developed two behavioral rules. The first (“increased range of perception”) enables drivers to change early upstream into a spare lane, allowing the merging traffic to join into mainline traffic at reduced conflicts, the second (“inter-car distance management” in the broader area of merging) provide drivers with recommendations of when and how to change lanes at the best. From a technical point of view, the “VibraSeat” a in-house developed car seat with integrated tactile actuators, is used for delivering information about perception range and inter-car distances to the driver in a way that does not stress his/her mental capabilities. To figure out possible improvements in its application in real traffic and at a meaningful scale, cellular automaton–based simulation of a specific section of Madrid expressway M30 was performed. Results from the data-driven simulation experiments on the true to scale model indicate that AmI technology has the potential to increase road throughput or average driving speed and furthermore to decrease the panic of drivers while merging into an upper (the main) lane." .

To examine this issue, an incidental recall paradigm was used to assess whether subclinically depressed individuals have self-schemas that facilitate the diffuse processing of any depressive information, or whether such structures are specific to state-relevant versus trait-relevant depressive information. In addition to the automatic information processing that is usually assessed in depression, effortful information processing was examined to determine if depressive cognitive dysfunctions were limited to automatic processing mechanisms. Results for subclinically depressed subjects showed a sensitivity to state depressive information processed automatically, and to trait depressive information processed effortfully. These data are consistent with the presence of a relatively specific, state self-referent depressive schema in subclinical depression, and suggest that, when presented with unfavorable information, subclinically depressed individuals will focus more attention on information that is qualitatively more negative." .

In the first experiment tridimensional stimuli similar to the object stimuli of Weisstein and Harris (1974), were used. In the second and third experiments arrows and triangles were used as stimuli, composed of one of the four right angles of a square and a diagonal. In the first two experiments the diagonal lines served as targets, and external diagonal lines were detected better than internal diagonals or diagonals without context. In the third experiment the right angles served as targets; these were detected better in arrows than in triangles or without the context diagonal. In each experiment the targets formed vertices and intersections with other line segments of the stimulus. It is argued that these local configurational features facilitated target detection by automatically attracting attention, particularly if they were located at the boundaries of the stimulus figure." .

In vision, this effect has been attributed to the inhibition of irrelevant locations, and recently, of their task-assigned responses. Interestingly, auditory versions of the task did not yield evidence for inhibitory processing of task-irrelevant events which might suggest modality-specific distractor processing in vision and audition. Alternatively, the inhibitory processes may differ in how they develop over time. If this were the case, the absence of inhibitory after-effects might be due to an inappropriate timing of successive presentations in previous auditory spatial negative priming tasks. Specifically, the distractor may not yet have been inhibited or inhibition may already have dissipated at the time performance is assessed. The present study was conducted to test these alternatives. Participants indicated the location of a target sound in the presence of a concurrent distractor sound. Performance was assessed between two successive prime-probe presentations. The time between the prime response and the probe sounds (response-stimulus interval, RSI) was systematically varied between three groups (600, 1250, 1900 ms). For all RSI groups, the results showed no evidence for inhibitory distractor processing but conformed to the predictions of the feature mismatching hypothesis. The results support the assumption that auditory distractor processing does not recruit an inhibitory mechanism but involves the integration of spatial and sound identity features into common representations." .

The influence of fiber aspect ratio on the CTEs is also investigated. It is noted that the parameters of fiber aspect ratio have a significant effect on both the longitudinal CTEs and transverse CTEs. The CTEs of composites are also very sensitive to the different fiber volume fractions. Moreover, the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of composites are taken into account in the present analysis. The theoretical derivations are applicable for the composites under mechanical or thermal environment conditions. The present model offers a direct prediction of CTEs and can account for the effects of fiber aspect ratio and volume fractions." .

Since overt allocation of attention appears as eye movements, the mechanism of selective attention can be uncovered through computational studies of eyemovement predictions. Since top-down attentional control in a task is expected to modulate eye movements significantly, the models that take a bottom-up approach based on low-level local properties are not expected to suffice for prediction. In this study, we introduce two representative models, apply them to a facial discrimination task with morphed face images, and evaluate their performance by comparing them with the human eye-movement data. The result shows that they are not good at predicting eye movements in this task." .

Keeping the application context constant, we focus on management science and find that only non-alpha numeric characters and a balanced title structure have small, but significant effects on citation count. Surprisingly, attributes which tended to show significant effects in other disciplines (though often in opposite directions), such as length, context, and linguistic attributes exhibited no relationship with citation count." .

The first experiment examined the combined effects of irrelevant speech and articulatory suppression when target items were presented auditorily. Contrary to the suggestions of Neath, but consistent with the phonological loop model, the effects of articulatory suppression and irrelevant speech were additive even when the irrelevant speech was presented during the retention interval. The second experiment examined the combined effects of irrelevant speech and phonological similarity when target items were presented visually. Consistent with the phonological loop model, the effects of phonological similarity and irrelevant speech were additive when participants were specifically instructed to use articulatory/phonological rehearsal to remember the list items. The results therefore contradicted Neath’s claim that irrelevant speech abolishes the phonological similarity effect when list items are presented visually. However, the effect of phonological similarity was abolished in the irrelevant speech conditions when no instructions were given concerning rehearsal. It is argued that the phonological similarity effect disappears in some experiments because participants sometimes employ a semantic rehearsal strategy, consistent with the views of Salamé and Baddeley (1986)." .

Studies describe observed therapeutic outcomes such as increased speech, social interaction, joint and directed attention, but few detail a robot-inclusive protocol which evaluates a set of robot tasks using widely-accepted, clinical assessments to evaluate the efficacy of the approach. In this study, we employed a low-cost, toy-like robot prototype with safety features such as a snap-off head and two snap-off arms, a camera for face, hand detection and session recording, two autonomous games and a teleoperated mode. We then developed and tested a new, robot-assisted intervention. Eight study participants and three controls diagnosed with ASD and a speech deficiency were recruited. The study group received pre-, post-intervention measures with the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale II (VABS-II), mean length spontaneous utterance determination (MLSUD), motor imitation scale (MIS), unstructured imitation assessment (UIA) and Expressive Vocabulary Test 2 (EVT-2) and participated in twelve 30 min interventions.

The identification errors made were classified either as “intrusion” (i.e., a report of a letter not in the array), or as “location” (i.e., a report of a noncritical or context letter from the array), and the arrays used were either unpronounceable non-words or words. In the first experiment all stimuli were four letters long and were presented in two parts: a leading array in which the information from two quadrants of a vertical by horizontal division of each letter was presented, and, after intervals of 40 and 160 ms, a trailing array of the complementary letter parts. The cue for the critical letter appeared either 80 ms before the initiation of the leading array or 320 ms after. The results showed a word advantage in all conditions, and an analysis of mislocations as proportions of total errors did not show that they differed significantly for non-words and for words. In the second experiment the stimuli were eight letters long and they were presented intact, followed after 140 ms by a patterned mask. The critical letter was again pre- and post-cued, and arrays subtended either 1.6° or 5° of visual angle. The results again showed a general word advantage and no difference in the proportions of mislocations for non-words and words. The results of both studies failed to provide support for the notion that the non-words probably required more attention than the words, and since this differential-attention hypothesis questioned the equality of encoding assumption of the Interactive Activation model of word perception, its rejection supported the latter proposition. It was concluded, therefore, that the encoding of the strings of letters in these studies was independent of their linguistic properties." .

Two hundred and thirty-seven 12- to 17-year-old new patients in an urban public mental health service were prospectively recruited and evaluated using semi-structured interviews and standardized questionnaires to obtain socio-demographic, psychopathological, family, school and substance use data. The most prevalent primary diagnoses among males were attention deficit disorder and conduct disorder, while among females they were eating disorders, affective and conduct disorders. Substance use disorder was diagnosed as follows: cannabis in 10.1% of the sample, alcohol in 3.4% and other drugs in 0.4%. A pattern of substance use with high risk of developing problems (at least regular use of alcohol or occasional use of cannabis or other illegal drugs) was found in 48.9% of the sample. After adjusting for age in the multivariate logistic regression, this pattern of risky use of drugs was found to be associated with Youth Self-Report scales of thought problems, delinquent and aggressive behaviour, in both genders. Altered family structure, having had to repeat a school grade and Youth Self-Report attention problems were only significantly associated with risky drug consumption in females. The high prevalence of risky and problematic substance use in adolescents entering mental health treatment warrants early systematic screening and specific preventive and therapeutic interventions, addressing mental health psychoeducation and motivation to avoid drugs, as well as differential associated risk factors for males and females." .

Based on a pilot study performed by the first author, in which second year DMT students scored higher on hypnotizability than first year students, we expected that hypnotizability and a related personality variable, absorption, would increase for DMT trainees over the training year. Fourteen DMT trainees and a comparison group of ten social welfare or psychology trainees were given hypnotizability, absorption and imagery tests at the beginning and end of their first year. Unexpectedly, DMT trainees began with higher levels of absorption and imagery thinking styles than the comparison group. The difference between groups on absorption increased over time, as the DMT group scores increased while the comparison group scores decreased. As predicted, hypnotizability tended to increase for the DMT group (p<.09, 1-tailed test) but not for the comparison group. We discuss both the distinctiveness of DMT trainees and the personality changes attributable to dance movement therapy training." .

The goal of decentralized consensus protocols is to exchange information among nodes so that each node acquires the information held by every other node in the system. This paper presents a quorum-based, self-stabilizing maxima finding protocol which is based on a decentralized consensus protocol.

We predict that if core disgust and socio-moral disgust are different constructs, then their co-associated elicited emotions are likely to be different, and time as well as gender are likely to differentially affect their intensity (via a greater reliance of socio-moral disgust on cognitive appraisal). To test these predictions, participants were shown photographs of core and socio-moral disgust elicitors and asked to provide a wide ranging rating of their emotional response to each at 3 time points. Each elicitor generated a significantly different emotional response. Furthermore, the disgust response to core elicitors weakened over time whereas socio-moral responses intensified. Males and females showed similar levels of disgust to socio-moral elicitors, but females showed higher levels to core elicitors. Overall, the results suggest that a different emotional construct was activated by each type of elicitor." .

Two hundred and one headache patients attending the Headache Center of the University of Turin were selected for the study and divided into 5 groups: (1) migraine, (2) episodic tension–type headache, (3) chronic tension–type headache, (4) migraine associated with episodic tension–type headache and (5) migraine associated with chronic tension–type headache. A group of 45 healthy subjects served as controls. All the subjects completed the State–Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Beck's Depression Inventory and the Cognitive Behavioral Assessment. Anger control was significantly lower in all headache patients (p<0.05) except in migraineurs. Patients with migraine and tension–type headache showed a significantly higher level of angry temperament and angry reaction (p<0.05). In addition, chronic tension–type headache and migraine associated with tension–type headache patients reported a higher level of anxiety (p<0.05), depression (p<0.001), phobias (p<0.001) and obsessive–compulsive symptoms (p<0.01), emotional liability (p<0.001) and psychophysiological disorders (p<0.001). Our study shows that chronic tension–type headache and migraine associated with tension–type headache patients present a significant impairment of anger control and suggests a connection between anger and the duration of headache experience." .

Such assessments are especially rare for Arab women with breast cancer. AimsTo assess the effect of spousal support, sharing household tasks, and body image in relation to emotional distress in Arab breast cancer survivors compared with matched healthy controls. MethodFifty-six Israeli Arab breast cancer survivors (stages I–III), and 66 age- and education-matched women answered Brief Symptoms Inventory-18, Perceived Body Image, Perceived Spousal Support and Division of Household Labor scale questionnaires. ResultsBreast cancer patients experienced higher psychological distress, especially anxiety and somatization. They reported receiving more support from their spouses and higher sharing of household tasks than did matched healthy controls, but were not different regarding body image. Twenty-eight percent of the variance of psychological distress was explained, with group, perceived support, and group × body image interaction. Thus, higher psychological distress was more likely to occur in participants receiving lower support and in breast cancer survivors with lower body image. ConclusionsThe study described the effects of breast cancer on Arab women compared to healthy women. It highlights the need for culture-sensitive care for Arab breast cancer patients, as well as other patients from minority groups residing in other Western countries." .

If this is accepted, it follows that the main indication for advocating such adjuvant psychological therapy to patients should be an expert assessment that the patient is likely to benefit; it should not (as is usual at present) be restricted to either those patients with overt psychopathology, or those few who specifically request it. We describe five main kinds of therapy, arranging them on a hierarchy of increasingly active participation by the recipient, and noting the status of evidence for their efficacy. These five types are: providing information, emotional support, behavioral training in coping skills, psychotherapy (of various kinds), and, more speculatively, spiritual/ existential therapy." .

The present study sought to examine the singular and combined effects of thought suppression instructions and anxiety induction (as induced by an anticipated impromptu speech) on the frequency of threat-relevant thoughts. Socially anxious participants were randomized to one of four conditions: (a) thought suppression instructions—anticipated speech; (b) thought suppression instructions—no anticipated speech; (c) no thought suppression instructions—anticipated speech; and (d) no thought suppression instructions—no anticipated speech. Contrary to prediction, those instructed to suppress their target thoughts under conditions of heightened anxiety reported fewer anxious thoughts following suppression than the non-suppression group. This effect was not observed among participants in the no anxiety induction control condition. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that anxiety induction may actually facilitate successful suppression of threat-relevant thoughts. Theoretical implications are discussed." .

Suppression of responding during conditioned stimulus (CS) presentation in CER may reflect behavioural competition between lever pressing and adopting a shock-avoidance posture, or it may alternatively reflect altered value of the food reward following its association with a footshock, thus reducing its ability to motivate responding. If this is the case, then drugs that reduce the CER may interfere with the mechanism by which CSs are able to motivate responding, rather than by reducing anxiety. The standard test of the ability of Pavlovian cues to motivate responding is the Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm and it has recently been suggested that CER may be ‘negative PIT’. Materials and methodsWe compared the effect of MPEP (0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) and diazepam (0, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) in CER and PIT. ResultsBoth MPEP and diazepam significantly reduced conditioned suppression in the CER paradigm. MPEP, but not diazepam, significantly reduced PIT. ConclusionThe findings support the hypothesis that MPEP may reduce expression of anxiety in the CER paradigm by interfering with the way in which emotionally salient cues are able to affect behaviour, but do not support such an analysis of the effect of diazepam. Diazepam and MPEP may therefore achieve their effects in CER by influencing different psychological processes." .

Conventional behavioral psychophysical techniques are both time and labor intensive, whereas measurement of CS functions by means of the pattern electroretinogram (PERG) is considerably more rapid and efficient. Are the two methods comparable, however? To answer this question, contrast-sensitivity functions were obtained using both the PERG and behavioral psychophysics in the same subjects, which were White Carneaux pigeons. The stimuli, in both methods, were phase-reversing, contrast-modulated sweeps of sinusoidal gratings. The PERG-CS functions were recorded via corneal electrodes and the behavioral data were collected using a modified staircase method that used moderate food deprivation and food reward. The results indicated that the PERG-CS functions had comparable bandwidth and peak spatial frequency to the behavioral CS functions. The PERG-CS functions, however, were lower on average than the behavioral curves by about 54%. The visual acuity of the two methods, as estimated from the high-frequency cutoff of the CS functions, differed by 37%. Both of these values are roughly consistent with the √2 advantage of binocular viewing (behavioral method) over monocular viewing (PERG method). In addition, the peak spatial frequency showed a decrease of 0.125 c/deg with the PERG method and bandwidth was reduced by approximately 0.5 octave. These findings suggest that the PERG is an acceptable alternative to behavioral measurement of CS functions, especially in animal psychophysics, if one takes into account the underestimation of CS by the PERG method and the small changes in peak spatial frequency and bandwidth." .

The knowledge of the distribution of m6A is helpful for understanding its regulatory roles. Although the experimental methods have been proposed to detect m6A, the resolutions of these methods are still unsatisfying especially for Arabidopsis thaliana. Benefitting from the experimental data, in the current work, a support vector machine-based method was proposed to identify m6A sites in A. thaliana transcriptome. The proposed method was validated on a benchmark dataset using jackknife test and was also validated by identifying strain-specific m6A sites in A. thaliana. The obtained predictive results indicate that the proposed method is quite promising. For the convenience of experimental biologists, an online webserver for the proposed method was built, which is freely available at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/M6ATH. These results indicate that the proposed method holds a potential to become an elegant tool in identifying m6A site in A. thaliana." .

Through filial imprinting, young precocial birds quickly learn the features of their social partners by mere exposure. It is not clear though to what extent chicks can extract abstract patterns of the visual and acoustic stimuli present in the imprinting object, and how they combine them. To investigate this issue, we exposed chicks (Gallus gallus) to three days of visual and acoustic imprinting, using either patterns with two identical items or patterns with two different items, presented visually, acoustically or in both modalities. Next, chicks were given a choice between the familiar and the unfamiliar pattern, present in either the multimodal, visual or acoustic modality. The responses to the novel stimuli were affected by their imprinting experience, and the effect was stronger for chicks imprinted with multimodal patterns than for the other groups. Interestingly, males and females adopted a different strategy, with males more attracted by unfamiliar patterns and females more attracted by familiar patterns. Our data show that chicks can generalize abstract patterns by mere exposure through filial imprinting and that multimodal stimulation is more effective than unimodal stimulation for pattern learning." .

Previous studies showed that bumblebees and hummingbirds discriminate against albinos when presented with mixtures of the 2 morphs, and that it takes these pollinators longer to fly between successive flowers on albino than on blue-flowered inflorescences. To explore the link between these observations, we measured pollinator preferences and flower-to-flower flight times (“handling times”) before and after painting flowers in 2 alternative ways that enhanced albino nectar guides. In all of 16 experimental replicates discrimination against albinos was reduced or eliminated after painting, and albino handling times declined toward values for blue-flowered inflorescences. This consistent result indicates that an inferior nectar guide increases the energetic cost of foraging at albinos. Increased cost in turn explains discrimination, under the reasonable assumption that hummingbirds and bumblebees are sensitive to foraging economics." .

We hypothesized that such phenomenon could be identified in instruments that were not only projective techniques. The research’s goal was to study perceptive distortions in a cognitive test and their relations with personality instruments. Responses from 222 participants in the Computerized Test of Primary Emotions Perception (PEP) were rated in distortion scores, which related to perceiving emotions that were not present. We used Spearman correlations between these scores and the Rorschach Inkblot test, Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory, and tasks of Verbal and Abstract Reasoning. Results showed that the distortions were not related to intellectual abilities. Distortions of joy were associated with greater interest in interpersonal contact; love with positive view of the interactions and need for attention; fear with concerns about aggressiveness and autonomy; sadness with lower perception of damaged objects; disgust with feelings of loneliness; and anger with criticism avoidance, distrust, feelings of loneliness, and aggressive behaviour. The results support the proposal that altered perception of reality is related to affective or personality characteristics." .

But does this reflect a broader dimensional relationship within the general population? A clearer understanding of this relationship might inform improvements in mental health service provision. However, ascertainment and referral bias means that there is limited value in conducting further research with clinically referred samples. We, therefore, conducted a cross-sectional population-based study investigating children’s manual coordination using an objective computerised test. These measures were related to teacher-completed responses on a behavioural screening questionnaire [the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. We sampled 298 children (4–11 years old; 136 males) recruited from the general population. Hierarchical (logistic and linear) regression modelling indicated significant categorical and continuous relationships between manual coordination and overall SDQ score (a dimensional measure of psychopathology). Even after controlling for gender and age, manual coordination explained 15 % of the variance in total SDQ score. This dropped to 9 % after exclusion of participants whose SDQ responses indicated potential mental health problems. These results: (1) indicate that there is a clear relationship between children’s motor and mental health development in community-based samples; (2) demonstrate the relationship’s dimensional nature; and (3) have implications for service provision." .

This process has developed under the rubrics of “awareness,” “social translucence,” “social activity indicators,” “social navigation,” etc. Although the name and details vary, the central ideas are similar. By making social presence and activities more visible or perceivable, they provide social context for members to make sense of situations and guide their activities more informatively and appropriately. In this work, we introduce a class of visualizations called social context displays, which use and share graphical representations to depict people’s presence and activity information with an explicit focus on groups. The aim of this work is to examine social context displays in use and contribute new abstractions for understanding how making social information more visible works in general. Through our first-hand experience with user-centered design and empirical investigations of two social context displays in real settings, we uncovered not only how they provide social context to inform actions and decisions, but also how members perform and manage their self- and group-representations through the display. Drawing on Goffman’s performance framework, we provide a detailed description of how people react and respond to these two social context displays and reconsider some of the broader issues associated with computer-mediated interactions such as privacy, context, and media richness." .

In the first experiment, subjects who were instructed to learn different numbers of spatial relations traversed the same locomotion path one, three or five times. In a subsequent test phase they traversed the path once more, giving numerical estimates of directions and distances to reference points that had been designated along it. The effects of practice and information load indicated that the processing of locational information was effortful. The latencies and the accuracy of the estimates also suggested that the acquisition of information about the directions and crow-flight distances between the reference points required more central information processing than did the acquisition of information about the locomotion path. The amount of central processing capacity allocated to the acquisition of locational information did not, however, seem to be much affected by instructions to learn only a subset of spatial relations. This finding was substantiated by the results of the second experiment in which half of the subjects received no learning instructions." .

However, there may be important inter-individual variations ranging from no improvement at all to significant improvement and long periods of stabilization. Carotid atherosclerosis is associated with cognitive decline in elderly people. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) predicts response to cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer’s disease. Patients and methods: A series of 54 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease were enrolled consecutively in an open-label trial. At baseline, all patients were assessed on the following clinical scales: Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating, the Hachinski Ischemic Scale, Blessed Dementia Rating Scale, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and a daily-living activities scale (Disability Assessment for Dementia [DAD]). Investigations included magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a colour echo-Doppler scan of the carotid arteries to measure the maximum IMT. Patients were then commenced on galantamine treatment for 6 months, after which scores on the ADAS-cog, NPI and DAD scales were reassessed. Results: A total of 50 patients completed the study. Their mean age was 77.78 years (SD 6.51 years); 34 patients were female. Galantamine treatment decreased the mean NPI score from 17.68 to 13.86 points, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). On the ADAS-cog scale, a modest and nonsignificant mean difference of −0.4 points (p = 0.7) was observed. A weak (correlation coefficient r = 0.4) but significant correlation between IMT and changes in clinical scale score was found, with low carotid IMT being shown to be a predictor of response on both the ADAS-cog (p = 0.003) and NPI (p = 0.006) scales; these findings were corroborated in multivariate analysis. For men, the correlation was stronger (r = 0.7 and 0.8 for the ADAS-cog and NPI scales, respectively). Conclusion: Although the magnitude of effect was moderate, carotid IMT could be a significant predictor of clinical response to cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with Alzheimer’s disease." .

On my view, the mind-brain relationship is to be explained in terms of evolutionary forces, some of which tug in the direction of a reductionistic mind-brain relationship, and some of which which tug in the opposite direction. This theory of forces makes possible an anti-reductionist account of the cognitive mind-brain relationship which avoids psychophysical anomalism. This theory thus also responds to the complaint which arguably lies behind the Churchlands' strongest criticisms of anti-reductionism — namely the complaint that anti-reductionists fail to supply principled explanations for the character of the mind-brain relationship. While lending support to anti-reductionism, the view defended here also insures a permanent place for mind-brain reduction as an explanatory ideal analogous to Newtonian inertial motion or Aristotelian natural motion." .

Maximal aerobic speed (MAS) is a measure of aerobic performance; however, the time and personnel demands of establishing MAS are considerable. This study aimed to determine whether time-trials (TT), which are shorter and less onerous than traditional MAS protocols, may be used to predict MAS. Methods28 Australian Rules football players completed a test of MAS, followed by TTs of six different distances in random order, each separated by at least 48 h. Half of the participants completed TT distances of 1200, 1600 and 2000 m, and the others completed distances of 1400, 1800 and 2200 m. ResultsAverage speed for the 1200 and 1400 m TTs were greater than MAS (P < 0.01). Average speed for 1600, 1800, 2000 and 2200 m TTs were not different from MAS (P > 0.08). Average speed for all TT distances correlated with MAS (r = 0.69–0.84; P < 0.02), but there was a negative association between the difference in average TT speed and MAS with increasing TT distance (r = −0.79; P < 0.01). Average TT speed over the 2000 m distance exhibited the best agreement with MAS. ConclusionsMAS may be predicted from the average speed during a TT for any distance between 1200 and 2200 m, with 2000 m being optimal. Performance of a TT may provide a simple alternative to traditional MAS testing." .

On token-functionalist views of belief, mad belief in this sense is conceptually impossible. Cases of delusion—or at least some cases of delusion—might be cases of belief gone half-mad, cases in which enough of the functional role characteristic of belief is absent that the subject is in an “in-between” state regarding the delusive content, such that it is neither quite right to say the subject determinately believes the delusive content nor quite right to say that she determinately fails to believe that content. Although Bortolotti (2010) briefly mentions such “sliding scale” approaches to the relationship of delusion and belief, she dismisses such approaches on rather thin grounds and then later makes some remarks that seem consonant with sliding scale approaches." .

Existing theoretical models emphasize the importance of the employee’s motivation and output control for the effectiveness of PfP-systems. However, empirical evidence on which factors influence PfP-system’s introduction in NPOs is still lacking. Based on an exploratory study of nine Austrian NPOs, this paper develops hypotheses on what organizational factors distinguish NPOs that rely on PfP-systems for managing employees’ performance differences from those that use alternative approaches (e.g., job enrichment, NPO-spirit). Findings suggest that decisions on the application of PfP-systems are influenced by five determinants: perceived degree of competitiveness regarding funding and service provision; degree of strategic freedom; clarity of strategic objectives; existence of management instruments; and organizational culture." .

Methods: A total of 54 healthy workers (27 male and 27 female, aged 41.2 ± 12.5 years) in a company were investigated for 8-OH-dG levels in the peripheral blood leukocytes at the time of a questionnaire survey regarding several factors, such as working hours, workload, fatigue, sleep, psychological stress and the prospect of alleviating it. Subjects were limited to non-smoking and non-drinking workers to exclude the influence of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking, which have been reported to have associations with the formation of 8-OH-dG. Results: The levels of 8-OH-dG in female subjects were significantly related to the perceived workload (F=5.56, P=0.010), the perceived psychological stress (F=6.15, P=0.007), and the impossibility of alleviating stress (F=3.82, P=0.048). No associations were observed in male subjects. Conclusions: Psychological stress and perceived overwork appear to be related to the pathogenesis of cancer via the formation of 8-OH-dG, particularly in female workers." .

Because sequential swallowing requires breath-holding, it seems likely that it could increase the drive to breathe. This study was designed to determine if sequential swallowing is accompanied by an increased drive to breathe in young, healthy adults. We predicted that sequential swallowing would be accompanied by prolonged breath-holding in most cases, and that this would be followed by a recovery phase during which ventilation would increase for a brief period. Results showed that not only did healthy participants increase ventilation after sequential swallowing, they also experienced breathing discomfort (dyspnea) despite the fact that they usually continued to breathe during the swallowing sequence. Given that these effects are observable in young, healthy adults, it seems reasonable to assume that individuals with respiratory and/or neurological compromise would also have an increased drive to breathe during sequential swallowing." .

This account has been called into question by Baayen et al. Psychological Review, 118, 438–482 (2011), who pointed out that the prime words previously tested in the morpho-orthographic condition vary in the extent to which the suffix conveys regular meaning. In the present study, we investigated whether evidence for morpho-orthographic segmentation can be obtained with a set of tightly controlled prime words that are entirely semantically opaque. Using a visual lexical decision task, we compared priming from truly suffixed primes (hunter-HUNT), completely opaque pseudo-suffixed primes (corner-CORN), and non-suffixed primes (cashew-CASH). The results show comparable magnitudes of priming for the truly suffixed and pseudo-suffixed primes, and no priming from non-suffixed primes, and therefore provide further important evidence in support of morpho-orthographic segmentation processes operating in the absence of any possible role for semantics." .

To improve the recognition rate and to reduce the memory requirements of the hypercolumn model (HCM), a shared map is constructed to replace a set of local neighborhood maps in the feature extraction and feature integration layers. The shared maps increase the ability of the network to deal with translation and distortion variations in the input image. The proposed face recognition system employed a FSHCM neural network to perform feature extraction and use a linear support vector machine for a recognition task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by measuring the recognition accuracy using the misaligned ORL face database." .

We find few significant differences. In the trust game, experienced subjects are less trustworthy and they also trust less. Furthermore, experienced subjects submit fewer non-monotonic strategies in the risk elicitation task. We find no differences whatsoever in the other decisions. Nevertheless, the minor differences observed between experienced and inexperienced subjects may be relevant because we document a potential recruitment bias: the share of inexperienced subjects may be lower in the early recruitment waves." .

Mastery goal orientation was also analyzed as a predictor of instructional quality. Teachers’ optimism, engagement, and strain were assessed to gain information about the construct validity of the scales on self-efficacy and mastery goal orientation. We analyzed the self-report data of 203 German in-service teachers who participated in all of three time points of assessment (the years 2001, 2008, and 2011). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the assumed three-dimensionality of instructional quality. Teacher self-efficacy was found to be relatively stable and to be a long-term predictor of instructional quality as indicated by the results of latent variable modeling. Moreover, instructional quality is predicted by mastery goal orientation, which in turn is regressed on self-efficacy. As supported also by bias-corrected bootstrapping, mastery goal orientation partially mediated the relationship between classroom climate and self-efficacy. Results and an outlook for future research are discussed." .

One reason for such discrepancies may be related to the types of cues (uninformative and informative) that have been used, as they are known to induce different types of shifts of attention (exogenous and endogenous, respectively). To systematically address this question, two experiments were performed in which an uninformative peripheral cue (Experiment 1) or an informative central cue (Experiment 2) preceded a peripheral target with a short (100–150 ms) stimulus-onset asynchrony. Participants performed the task with their left hand, right hand, both hands, or no hands near the display. Cueing effects were obtained in both experiments, but they were only modulated by hand position in Experiment 1, with larger effects observed in the right- and both-hand conditions. These findings suggest that exogenous attention shifts are affected by hand proximity, while endogenous shifts are not." .

On the next six lists, subjects had either positive, negative, neutral, or mixed lists of words and a final list of neutral words to measure aftereffects. The intensity of extremely positive and negative words satiated during the six lists and had aftereffects as predicted by an antagonistic adaptation level model. The recognition memory results indicate that hit rates progressively decreased during satiation, but encoding discriminability (d’) remained relatively constant. This supports a retrieval model of memory. Positive words, however, were significantly less discriminable than negative or neutral words and had negative aftereffects on the encoding d’ of subsequent neutral words that were related to inertia effects in category organization." .

Regression analyses indicated that sensation seeking and behavioral risk-taking predicted unique variance in number of sexual partners. These findings suggest that, for young men, acquisition of new partners is associated with need for excitement and reward and willingness to take risks to meet those needs. Sensation seeking, behavioral risk-taking, and skin conductance reactivity to arousing stimuli was related to ever having engaged in sex with a stranger, indicating that, for men, willingness to have sex with a stranger is related not only to the need for excitement and risk-taking but also with innate responsiveness to arousing environmental triggers. In contrast, regression analyses indicated that young men who were impulsive in the context of negative emotions were less likely to use condoms, suggesting that emotion-based impulsivity may be an important factor in negligent prophylactic use. This study adds to the current understanding of the divergence between the correlates of risky sexual behaviors and may lend utility to the development of individualized HIV prevention programming." .

Results showed that older adults were less accurate in the visuospatial tasks and in pointing at landmarks in an unfamiliar environment, but performed as well as the young adults when pointing to familiar places. Pointing performance correlated with visuospatial tests accuracy in both familiar and unfamiliar environments, while only pointing in an unknown environment correlated with visuospatial working memory (VSWM). The spatial representation of well-known places seems to be well preserved in older adults (just as well as in young adults), while it declines for unfamiliar environments. Spatial abilities sustain the mental representations of both familiar and unfamiliar environments, while the support of VSWM resources is only needed for the latter." .

The aim was to produce a robust demonstrator-consistent responding effect in order that future analytic experiments could investigate the psychological processes responsible for this effect. The joystick responses of observer rats trained using the standard bidirectional control procedure parameters were compared with those of observers subject to conditions identified in the social learning literature as favourable for imitation. Unlike mice, observer rats in experiments 1 a and 1 b tended to push a joystick in the same direction as their demonstrators when the demonstrators were either familiar or unfamiliar males and females. Comparable demonstrator-consistent responding occurred following observation of a standard and a salient joystick response (experiment 2). Experiment 3 showed that the discriminative accuracy of a demonstrator’s responding was important for matching behaviour, and suggested that matching might be enhanced with more than the conventional single observation session. Experiment 4 confirmed that the bidirectional control effect is sensitive to the amount of observational experience; after six observation sessions, demonstrator-inconsistent responding occurs. The results of experiments 1–3 are, and those of experiment 4 are not, compatible with the hypothesis that demonstrator-consistent responding in the bidirectional control is caused by olfactory cues deposited by demonstrators on the joystick." .

This study seeks to address this important issue that has largely been overlooked. The data were collected from a juvenile reformatory located in a southern province of China. The findings show that approximately one in five juvenile offenders reported having experienced CSA, a rate that is higher than their same-age counterparts in the population. The reported mental health problem among the CSA victims was found to be more severe than the non-victims in the sample.

The theory makes two predictions: first, an important factor in determining the influence of event 1 on processing event 2 is whether features of event 1 are bound into a unified representation (i.e., selection or retrieval of event 1). Second, whether processing the two events facilitates or interferes with each other should depend on the extent to which their constituent features overlap. In two experiments, participants performed a visual-attention cueing task, in which the visual target (event 2) was preceded by a relevant or irrelevant explicit (e.g., “UP”) or implicit (e.g., “HAPPY”) spatial-conceptual cue (event 1). Consistent with TEC, we found relevant explicit cues (which featurally overlap to a greater extent with the target) and implicit cues (which featurally overlap to a lesser extent), respectively, facilitated and interfered with target processing at compatible locations. Irrelevant explicit and implicit cues, on the other hand, both facilitated target processing, presumably because they were less likely selected or retrieved as an integrated and unified event file. We argue that such effects, often described as “attentional cueing”, are better accounted for within the event coding framework." .

Across trials, the circles appeared in an array of positions on the screen. The participant was required on each trial to indicate whether or not the test circles were two or fewer position units apart in terms of the horizontal dimension of this array. The discrimination that the task required was easier to the extent that the vertical distance between the circles was ignored. When the task was performed under a high degree of speed stress, vertical distance and horizontal distance exerted equivalent effects on measures of performance. When the task was performed under a lesser degree of speed stress, horizontal distance exerted a larger effect than vertical distance did. The results supported the early holistic hypothesis over the dimensional similarity hypothesis as an account of the way information from different dimensions is accessed in perceptual processing." .

PurposeThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of one theory-based and two pragmatic interventions on intention to perform three behaviors, namely (1) finding out what the patient already knows or suspects about their diagnosis; (2) using the actual words “dementia” or “Alzheimer’s disease” when talking to the patient (i.e., the use of explicit terminology); (3) exploring what the diagnosis means to the patient. MethodWithin an intervention-modeling process, members of old-age mental health teams in England were sent postal questionnaires measuring psychological variables. Respondents were randomized by team to one of four groups to receive: theory-based intervention; evidence-based communication; patient-based intervention; or no intervention (control). Interventions were delivered as pen-and-paper exercises at the start of a second postal questionnaire that remeasured the same psychological variables. The outcome measures were intention and scenario-based behavioral simulation. ResultsResponses were received from 644 of 1,103 (58%) individuals from 179 of 205 (87%) mental health teams. There were no significant differences in terms of intention or simulated behavior between the trial groups. The theory-based intervention significantly increased scores for attitudes to (p = 0.03) and perceived behavioral control (p = 0.001) for the behavior of “finding out what the patient already knows or suspects about their diagnosis.” ConclusionsThe intervention had a limited effect. This may be partly explained by clinical or methodological factors. The use of a systematic intervention modeling process allows clearer understanding of the next appropriate steps which should involve further evaluation of the interventions using an interactive delivery method in a less selected group of study participants." .

The new model is capable of explaining the widely observed early burst and heavy tail of topic propagation velocity. The proposed model has a closed-form solution when the individual interest is of uniform distribution with the external influence assumed constant.

We therefore present a comprehensive framework to integrate empirical data and theoretical insights into the citizenship of young people today. To develop and validate the framework, we conducted exploratory and confirmative factor analyses on measures of citizenship attitudes, skills, reflection and knowledge for a sample of 7,768 students in grades 5–9 from 38 Dutch primary and secondary schools. The results were cross-validated using a different sample of 15,940 students in primary and secondary education. We were able to distinguish four citizenship orientations among students (societal interest, prosocial ability, reflective thinking and assertiveness) and two domains of citizenship knowledge (societal knowledge and interpersonal knowledge). This framework can help with the large-scale, empirical evaluation of the effects of citizenship education and also guide schools in the formulation of educational goals to support the development of citizenship competences among students." .

However the association between coping strategies, anxiety, worries, and depression during pregnancy is a relatively neglected area of research. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between coping strategies, antenatal anxiety, pregnancy worries, and depressive symptomatology after controlling for the effects of background variables. The study sample consisted of 163 pregnant women, with gestational age ranging from 11 to 26 weeks, attending antenatal screening at a Greek public hospital. Coping strategies were measured with Brief COPE, pregnancy worries were measured with Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), anxiety was assessed using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X version), and depression was measured with Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression scale (CES-D). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated among all study variables, followed by hierarchical multiple linear regression. In the univariate analysis, low annual income, unemployment, conception after an IVF treatment, and a previous history of miscarriage were associated with anxiety, depression, and worries. Additionally, almost all coping strategies (denial, behavioral disengagement, self-blame, self-distraction, substance use, acceptance, positive reframing, active coping, and seeking emotional support) were significantly associated with antenatal anxiety, worries, and depression. Linear regression analysis showed that only previous history of miscarriage, conception after IVF, as well as denial, behavioral disengagement and acceptance coping strategies were significantly related to anxiety, worries and depressive symptomatology. The risk factors found in this study could help clinicians target anxiety and depression screening to high-risk populations of pregnant women. Provision of adequate training for obstetricians and midwives in the detection and management of anxiety and depression among pregnant women should help to decrease the psychological burden during pregnancy." .

Despite extensive research, controversy remains concerning the information-processing locus of this learning effect. There are three main theories concerning the nature of spatial sequence learning, corresponding to the perceptual, motor, or response selection (i.e., central mechanisms underlying the association between stimulus and response pairs) processes required for successful task performance. The present data investigate this controversy and support the theory that stimulus—response (S—R) rules are critical for sequence learning. The results from two experiments demonstrate that sequence learning is disrupted only when the S—R rules for the task are altered. When the S—R rules remain constant or involve only a minor transformation, significant sequence learning occurs. These data implicate spatial response selection as a likely mechanism mediating spatial sequential learning." .

Therapeutic change was defined as the change in outcome measures [externalizing problem behavior and parenting self-efficacy (PSE)] from before treatment to afterward. Three different types of predictors were analyzed: child variables (gender, age, and initial externalizing and internalizing behavior), parent variables (age, initial PSE and parental psychopathology) and socioeconomic status and other sociodemographic characteristics of the family (parental school education, employment, family status, language). The parent management training was part of the Prevention Program for Externalizing Problem Behavior, which was evaluated as an effectiveness trial under routine care conditions using a within-subject control group design. Between 78 and 270 families were included in the analysis, which investigated therapeutic change over two time intervals: (1) immediate change from the pre-treatment to the post-treatment assessments, and (2) long-term-change from pre-treatment to 1-year follow-up. Throughout several analyses, the only predictor of therapeutic change that was consistently significant over the two time periods for the externalizing problem behavior of the child was the initial externalizing problem behavior. More impaired children improved more. Similarly, the only predictor of therapeutic change for the two time periods in PSE was the initial level of PSE. Parents with less PSE gained more during the course of the training." .

This conflict is thought to have costs that carry over into daily life, e.g., triggering negative affect and/or recurring ruminations, which may ultimately impact long term outcome. Hence, increasing research effort is being dedicated to understand the link between emotional and ruminative processes in the etiology and maintenance of AN. We investigated whether affective states influence disorder-related rumination in AN applying “ecological momentary assessment”, a method which allows the experimenter to gain insight into psychological processes in the natural environment and assess data in real time. Participants (AN = 37, healthy controls = 33) were given a smartphone for 14 days. A ringtone signaled at six random time-points each day to fill in a questionnaire, which gauged disorder-typical thoughts about food and weight as well as affective state. Analyses, applying hierarchical linear models confirmed that AN patients spend more time thinking about food, body shape and weight than controls (p < 0.001). Additionally, the results support the hypothesis that momentary negative affect (but not baseline depression (p = 0.56) or anxiety symptoms (p = 0.60) are positively associated with a higher amount of disorder-related rumination in patients (p < 0.001). Our findings are in line with theories which claim that ruminative thinking induces a vulnerability to negative stimuli which, in turn, fosters heightened negative affect. Thus, therapeutic interventions could be improved by implementing modules that specifically target disorder-related rumination." .

In addition to the resonance contributions from the low-lying states, we write an expression for the contribution from f8 Regge exchange in terms of contributions to electromagnetic mass differences from A20 Regge exchange. Assuming that the A20 Regge pole gives the correct contribution to the e.m. mass differences, we estimate the contribution of the f8-meson. In the approximation of neglecting the continuum spectrum, the ratio of tadpole contributions is given by the ratio of coupling constants of the f8-meson with hadrons. The results of the tadpole model are in agreement with the subtraction scheme of Segrè. We also find that in the presence of such anSU 3-symmetry-breaking term, the renormalization of the hadronic weak-strangeness-changing vector current vertex, to second order in such a term, is quadratically divergent." .

In most studies the task was to count high-pitched tones when high-pitched and low-pitched tones were presented in a random sequence. In this paper the hypothesis is examined that dual-task interference in the particular combination of tasks results from task integration, in particular from the learning of an integrated visual-auditory sequence in which every second (auditory) element is random. Instead of the tone-counting task a similar go/no-go task was used in which foot responses to high-pitched tones were performed. In Exp. 1 the sequence of tones was random in one condition, but in two other conditions repeated tone sequences of 5 and 6 elements were combined with visual sequences of 6 elements. Under dual-task test conditions, implicit learning of the visual as well as the auditory sequences was better with the auditory sequence of 6 elements than of 5 elements, while under single-task test conditions the nature of the tone sequence had no effect. In Exp. 2 the superior implicit learning with the 6-element sequence was replicated with different test procedures in which either the visual or auditory sequence was changed to random or in which the two sequences remained intact but were shifted by one element relative to each other. Randomization of the visual or auditory sequences not only impaired visual or auditory RT, respectively, but also impaired RT to stimuli in the other modality, and this cross-modal effect was almost as strong as the intra-modal effect of randomization. Finally, in Exp. 3 it was shown that integrated visual-auditory sequences are learned only when responses to both of them are required, but not when the tones can be neglected. These results are consistent with a conception of implicit learning as (at least partly) a basic and nonselective type of learning of all potentially behaviorally relevant relations between stimuli in the environment and one's own actions." .

The objective of this study was to determine if the use of cocaine prenatally identifies women for ongoing risk of psychological symptoms. Four hundred and two women (207 cocaine using [C], 195 non-cocaine using [NC]) were assessed for rates of clinically elevated psychological symptoms shortly after childbirth, 6.5 months and 1, 2, 4 and 6 years after using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Generalized estimating equation modeling (GEE) was used to compare psychological symptom severity, controlling for confounding factors including early childhood trauma. Results indicated that women identified as having used cocaine during pregnancy had clinically elevated psychological distress (OR = 1.76, 95%CI = 1.15–2.71, p = 0.01), psychoticism (OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.41–2.76, p = 0.001), interpersonal sensitivity (OR = 2.34; 95%CI = 1.65–3.34; p < 0.0001) and phobic anxiety (OR = 1.86; 95%CI = 1.24–2.79) across all assessments compared to NC women. Childhood emotional abuse was also independently associated with psychological distress. Women who use cocaine during pregnancy should be recognized as at very high risk of ongoing clinically elevated psychological symptoms and should receive early and regular assessments and intervention for mental health and substance use problems." .

AimsOur aim was to explore the effect of subjective cognitive decline on falls in community-dwelling older adults with or without objective cognitive decline. MethodsWe included 470 older adults (mean age 73.6 ± 5.2; 329 women) living in the community and obtained data on fall history directly from the participants. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a self-administered question. Objective cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Statistical analyses were carried out separately for participants with objective cognitive decline and those without. ResultsA multiple logistic regression analysis showed that, among participants without objective cognitive decline, subjective cognitive decline was positively associated with falls [OR 1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17–3.12; p = 0.01). Conversely, among participants with objective cognitive decline, subjective cognitive decline was negatively associated with falls (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01–0.85, p = 0.04). DiscussionThe result suggests that the objective–subjective disparity may affect falls in community-dwelling older adults. ConclusionsThe presence of subjective cognitive decline was significantly positively associated with falls among cognitively intact older adults. However, among their cognitively impaired peers, the absence of subjective cognitive decline was positively associated with falls." .

The assumption was that the BC-BC performances are based on matching equivalence and nonequivalence relations (equivalence- equivalence). The present study examined if the BC-BC performances could have resulted from matching stimuli with same discriminative (S+, S-) properties. In Experiment 1, the subjects were first trained on a simple Q discrimination task (Q1+/Q2-). After testing the discriminative functions of these stimuli independent from one another, conditional A-B and A-C discriminations were trained. Finally, 3 tests were presented. One test assessed equivalence (B-C, C-B). The second test permitted matching on the basis of same functional (equivalence, nonequivalence) relations (BC-BC). The third test measured the S+ function of compounds with same-class elements and the S- function of compounds with different-class elements (BC/BC), or matching on the basis of same discriminative functions (Q-BC). The order of the tests varied across conditions except that the equivalence test was always presented first. Experiment 2 was the same except that the equivalence was tested last. In both experiments, almost all subjects demonstrated equivalence and selected compounds with same-class elements during a simple BC discrimination test (e.g., B1C1+/B1C2-). Most of these subjects also matched Q and BC stimuli of same discriminative functions (e.g., Q1-B1C1, Q2-B1C2), and BC compounds with same- and with different-class elements (B1C1-B3C3, B2C3- B3C2), more so in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2. These findings indicate that the BC-BC performances result from matching same discriminative functions. The implications of these findings for equivalence-equivalence as a model for classical analogies are discussed." .

All tetraploid families obtained from 4x x 2x (FDR) matings exhibitedheterosis (the mean of the F1 exceeded that of the higher yielding parent), and outyielded other tetraploid families and 4x cultivars at both locations. The tuber yield of 4x x 2x (SDR; families was higher than that of the families derived from 4x x 4x matings, although the 2x parents had significantly lower yield than tetraploid parents. Specific combining ability (S.C.A.) was found to be significant when families obtained from each category (4x x FDR, 4x x SDR and 4x x 4x) were analyzed individually. Both general combining ability (G.C.A.) (2x) and S.C.A. were significant when families obtained from: 1) 4x x FDR plus 4x x SDR; 2) 4x x FDR plus 4x x 4x; and 3) all categories, were analyzed. Only S.C.A. was found to be significant when 4x x SDR and 4x x 4x families were analyzed together. Consistent results were obtained at each of, and over, the two locations. These results strongly demonstrated that FDR gametes were superior in breeding value to either SDR or n (2x) gametes, and were more homogeneous, Gametes formed by SDR might be superior to n (2x) gametes although they were as heterogeneous. Distinct yield differences between 4x x FDR and 4x x SDR families plus the significant G.C.A.

The data on the overall dimensions of known last and upper stages of launch vehicles makes it possible to single out five compact groups of such objects from the NORAD catalog in the 500–2000 km altitude interval. The orbits of objects of each group have approximately the same inclinations. The features of the mutual distribution of the orbital planes of LSD objects in the group are shown in a portrait of the evolution of deviations of the right ascension of ascending nodes (RAAN). In the case of the first three groups (inclinations of 71°, 74°, and 81°), the straight lines of relative RAAN deviations of object orbits barely intersect each other. The fourth (83°) and fifth (97°–100°) LSD groups include a considerable number of objects whose orbits are described by straight lines (diagonals), which intersect other lines many times. The use of diagonals makes it possible to significantly reduce the temporal and total characteristic velocity expenditures required for object flybys, but it complicates determination of the flyby sequence. Diagonal solutions can be obtained using elements of graph theory. A solution to the flyby problem is presented for the case of group 5, formed of LSD objects at sun-synchronous orbits." .

However, it is unclear as to whether this is caused by inaccurate self-estimation of physical ability or inaccurate perception of height. We, therefore, measured both visual height perception ability and self-estimation of step-over ability among young and older adults. Forty-seven older and 16 young adults performed a height perception test (HPT) and a step-over test (SOT). Participants visually judged the height of vertical bars from distances of 7 and 1 m away in the HPT, then self-estimated and, subsequently, actually performed a step-over action in the SOT. The results showed no significant difference between young and older adults in visual height perception. In the SOT, young adults tended to underestimate their step-over ability, whereas older adults either overestimated their abilities or underestimated them to a lesser extent than did the young adults. Moreover, visual height perception was not correlated with the self-estimation of step-over ability in both young and older adults. These results suggest that the self-overestimation of step-over ability which appeared in some healthy older adults may not be caused by the nature of visual height perception, but by other factor(s), such as the likely age-related nature of self-estimation of physical ability, per se." .

Recently arrived CALD students (N = 221) enroled at a specialised high school in Australia completed a battery of measures assessing: social support, school connectedness, acculturation, resilience, and mental wellbeing. A series of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the three social relatedness factors (social support, school connectedness, and acculturation) were related to mental wellbeing. However, their variance decreased when resilience was added. Mediation analyses indicated that resilience was a partial mediator for the relationship between each of the social relatedness elements and mental wellbeing. Resilience was also shown to play a significant role in the relationship between social relatedness and mental wellbeing.

Binge-like ethanol exposure of neonatal rats depletes cells in the cerebellum, including Purkinje cells, granule cells, and deep nuclear cells, and produces deficits in simple tests of motor coordination. However, the extent to which anatomical damage is related to behavioral deficits has been difficult to estimate. Eyeblink classical conditioning is known to engage a discrete brain stem-cerebellar circuit, making it an ideal test of cerebellar functional integrity after developmental ethanol exposure. Eyeblink conditioning is a simple form of motor learning in which a neutral stimulus (such as a tone) comes to elicit an eyeblink when repeatedly paired with a stimulus that evokes an eyeblink prior to training (such as mild periorbital stimulation). In eyeblink conditioning, one of the deep cerebellar nuclei, the interpositus nucleus, as well as specific Purkinje cell populations, are sites of convergence for tone conditioned stimulus and somatosensory unconditioned stimulus information, and, together with brain stem nuclei, provide the necessary and sufficient substrate for the learned response. A series of studies have shown that eyeblink conditioning is impaired in both weanling and adult rats given binge-like exposure to ethanol as neonates. In addition, interpositus nucleus neurons from ethanol-exposed rats showed impaired activation during eyeblink conditioning. These deficits are accompanied by a permanent reduction in the deep cerebellar nuclear cell population. Because particular cerebellar cell populations are utilized in well-defined ways during eyeblink conditioning, conclusions regarding the underlying neural substrates of behavioral change after developmental ethanol exposure are greatly strengthened." .

Humans, however, usually solve such tasks quickly and efficiently. We present experiments studying human path planning performance and the cognitive processes and heuristics involved. Twenty-five places were arranged on a regular grid in a large room. Participants were repeatedly asked to solve traveling salesman problems (TSP), i.e., to find the shortest closed loop connecting a start location with multiple target locations. In Experiment 1, we tested whether humans employed the nearest neighbor (NN) strategy when solving the TSP. Results showed that subjects outperform the NN-strategy, suggesting that it is not sufficient to explain human route planning behavior. As a second possible strategy we tested a hierarchical planning heuristic in Experiment 2, demonstrating that participants first plan a coarse route on the region level that is refined during navigation. To test for the relevance of spatial working memory (SWM) and spatial long-term memory (LTM) for planning performance and the planning heuristics applied, we varied the memory demands between conditions in Experiment 2. In one condition the target locations were directly marked, such that no memory was required; a second condition required participants to memorize the target locations during path planning (SWM); in a third condition, additionally, the locations of targets had to retrieved from LTM (SWM and LTM). Results showed that navigation performance decreased with increasing memory demands while the dependence on the hierarchical planning heuristic increased." .

They were matched by age and sex with 11 children who had a similar history of snoring and sleep disturbance but without an obvious sleep and breathing problem when monitored (snorer group) and also with a group of ten children most of whom were refered for an unrelated surgical procedure (control group). All children were studied before and 3–6 months after surgery. Pre-operatively the SBD and snorer groups both had significantly more restless sleep than the control group. The SBD group also had significantly more (>4%) dips in oxygen saturation than the other two groups. After surgery there were no longer any significant differences between the three groups. After adenotonsillectomy the SBD group showed a significant reduction in aggression, inattention and hyperactivity on the parent Conners scale, and an improvement in vigilance on the Continuous Performance Test. The snorer group also improved showing less hyperactive behaviour than pre-operatively and better vigilance. The control groups's behaviour and performance did not change significantly. There were no significant changes in the performance of the Matching Familiar Figures Test in any of the groups." .

POD is a subtype of RBD in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders Diagnostic and Coding Manual, second edition (ICSD-2). An updated classification of POD also includes subclinical RBD-NREM parasomnia, RBD-sleep-related eating disorder, RBD-sexsomnia, RBD-rhythmic movement disorder, and status dissociatus (SD), which is another subtype of RBD in the ICSD-2. Similar to POD, a core feature of SD is sleep motor-behavioral dyscontrol, with release of dream-related behaviors suggestive of RBD, but with nearly continuous ambiguous polygraphic sleep precluding the identification of NREM/REM sleep states. SD exemplifies extreme state dissociation. SD is always a symptomatic disorder, and is causally associated with a broad range of neurologic disorders, often with thalamic, limbic, striatal, and pontine involvement. The parasomnia behaviors associated with POD and SD — typical RBD behaviors — can often be controlled with bedtime clonazepam therapy, including the abnormal dreaming." .

We consider self-avoiding walk and percolation in ℤ d , oriented percolation in ℤ d ×ℤ+, and the contact process in ℤ d , with p D(·) being the coupling function whose range is proportional to L. For percolation, for example, each bond is independently occupied with probability p D(y−x). The above models are known to exhibit a phase transition when the parameter p varies around a model-dependent critical point p c . We investigate the value of p c when d>6 for percolation and d>4 for the other models, and L≫1. We prove in a unified way that p c =1+C(D)+O(L−2 d ), where the universal term 1 is the mean-field critical value, and the model-dependent term C(D)=O(L− d ) is written explicitly in terms of the random walk transition probability D. We also use this result to prove that p c =1+cL− d +O(L− d −1), where c is a model-dependent constant. Our proof is based on the lace expansion for each of these models." .

However, numerous studies have shown that durable change is difficult to achieve unless people have an adequate understanding of the problem and of appropriate behavioral solutions. Creating such an understanding has not been easy; the very nature of global change makes effective communication difficult. This paper proposes that one reason information has been unsuccessful is that it is not generally structured to take advantage of the way people process information. The cognitive processes involved in information acquisition and the special problems associated with communicating about global change are discussed. This discussion is used to identify those informational characteristics that will facilitate the transfer of information about global change. Stories (also referred to as case-studies or analogies) are suggested as one structure that encapsulates these characteristics; the role of stories in information transfer is elaborated upon. Though written from the point of view of presenting information to the public so that it creates understanding and impacts behavior, the paper is also relevant for scientists who wish to effectively communicate their ideas to the media and to researchers in other disciplines." .

In a unique study, Mermelstein (1978) claimed that consonants and vowels are the appropriate units because a single piece of information (duration, in this case) can be used for one distinction without affecting the other. In a replication, this apparent independence was found, instead, to reflect a lack of statistical power: The vowel and consonant judgments did interact. In another experiment, interdependence of two phonetic judgments was found in responses based on the fricative noise and the vocalic formants of a fricative-vowel syllable. These results show that each judgment made on speech signals must take into account other judgments that compete for information in the same signal. An account is proposed that takes segments as the primary units, with syllables imposing constraints on the shape they may take." .

Women were more strongly influenced by task-irrelevant spatial information than men (i.e., the Simon effect was larger in women, Cohen’s d = 0.39). Further, the analysis of sex differences in behavioral adjustment to errors revealed that women slow down more than men following mistakes (d = 0.53). Based on the combined results of previous studies and the current data, it is proposed that sex differences in selective attention are caused by underlying sex differences in core abilities, such as spatial or verbal cognition." .

In these cases, maxillary protraction is required for the harmonious facial esthetics and functional occlusion. Case presentationA 7-year old boy had been diagnosed as severe maxillary constriction due to unilateral complete cleft lip and palate. The author tried to correct the secondary deformity by early distraction osteogenesis with the aim of avoiding marked psychological impact from peers of elementary school. From 1999 to 2006, repeated treatments, which consisted of Le Fort I osteotomy and face mask distraction, and complementary maxillary protraction using miniplates were performed including orthodontics. But, final facial profile was not satisfactory, which needs compromising surgery. ConclusionsThe result of this study suggests that if early distraction treatment is performed before facial skeletal growth is completed, an orthognathic surgery or additional distraction may be needed later. Maxillofacial plastic and reconstructive surgeons should notify this point when they plan early distraction treatment for cleft maxillary deformity." .

I will argue that this conflict between scientific education and practical training has its roots in the underlying, more systematic question about the conceptual foundation of medicine: how far or in what respects can medicine be considered to be a science? By analyzing the epistemological status of medicine I will show that the internal aim of medicine(“promoting health through the prevention and treatment of disease”) differs from the internal aim of science (“the methodological and systematic acquisition of knowledge”). Therefore, medicine as a whole discipline should not be considered as a science. However, medicine can be conceptually and methodologically scientific in so much as it is based on scientific knowledge. There is evidence from cognitive science research that diagnostic reasoning not only relies on the application of scientific knowledge but also — especially in routine cases – on a process of pattern recognition, a reasoning strategy based on the memory of previously encountered patients. Hence, medical education must contain both: the imparting of scientific knowledge and the rich exposure to concrete cases during practical training. Hence, the question of teaching science vs. the apprentice model will not be “either-or” but rather “both — but in which proportion?”" .

Previous work has indicated that as some diagnostic liquid crystal displays (LCDs) increase in backlight hours (BLH), the luminance measured with an external luminance meter exceeds the luminance reported by the manufacturer’s built-in meter. The purposes of this work were as follows: first, to characterize several luminance and color performance characteristics for 23 Barco Coronis Fusion 6-MP MDCC 6230 color displays and, second, to provide initial data for a longitudinal study evaluating changes in luminance and color performance as BLH increase. Grayscale display conformance and maximum luminance were evaluated using a calibrated luminance meter and AAPM Task Group 18 test patterns, and agreement between target and measured luminance was calculated. Luminance uniformity was evaluated by calculating maximum luminance deviation. Color point and color uniformity were evaluated using a spectrophotometer, and the radial color distances between the corners and center of the display were calculated. Above 3 cd/m2, there was good agreement between the target and measured luminance. At the maximum luminance, the mean difference was less than 1 %. The mean maximum luminance deviation for these displays was 10.40 ± 2.38 %. Color point was observed to be very consistent between displays with mean values of u′ and v′ of 0.187 ± 0.002 and 0.474 ± 0.004, respectively. Among all displays, maximum radial color distance had a mean value of 0.003 ± 0.001. These data provide a baseline for the acceptance of future displays as well as for longitudinal studies of luminance and color performance." .

Performance following placebo, as measured by the ability of subjects to detect nominated target words and discriminate them from phonemically distracting words, was superior when attention was focused on one ear than when divided between the ears. Following droperidol, target detection and discrimination were reduced for both divided and focused attention and in the latter case responses were also slowed. However, these effects were small compared to the striking withdrawn behaviour of the subjects, who reported an unwillingness to attend to external events. Methylphenidate reversed all of these effects when administered following droperidol. Administered alone, methylphenidate had no effect on dichotic measures of attention but had marked effects on spontaneous behaviour, when most subjects reported a substantial increase in both the field and distractibility of attention. These results are interpreted as implicating central dopaminergic pathways in the regulation of attention without precluding a role for other neurotransmitter systems including ascending noradrenaline and serotonin pathways to cerebral cortex. The disparity between these objective and subjective assessments of the effects of the drugs on attention is discussed in terms of the degree of mental effort voluntarily brought to bear by subjects in the selective allocation of their attentional capacity." .

L. Hewitt & G. L. Flett, 1991) has been linked to psychopathology but can have both positive and negative elements. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether the relationship of SOP to positive and negative affect would be mediated by the presence of specific cognitions regarding “Personal Standards (PS),” and “Concern over Mistakes (CM)” as well as goal motivations. Two mediations involved in SOP were hypothesized: (1) in the presence of approach goals, the cognition of PS emerges from activated SOP and leads to positive affect; and (2) in the presence of avoidant goals, the cognition of CM emerges from activated SOP and leads to negative affect. In Study 1, 358 college students completed the research questionnaire, and structural equation modeling was used to test the mediation model. In Study 2, 60 participants, 30 rated high and 30 rated low in SOP, were presented with either an approach or an avoidant goal for an experimental task, and asked to rate their perfectionism cognitions and affects. The findings provided partial support for the hypotheses." .

This pattern of results is not in line with those previously reported for more complex figures, nor may it be attributed to any “oblique effect,” since the same function is obtained with the comparison gratings placed at different retinal orientations.

Event-related potentials to the Stroop are a bioelectrical correlate of executive function. We tested whether event-related potentials to the executive Stroop test may reflect executive dysfunction in MS. Methods29 MS patients (M/F:14/15; mean age 40 ± 8), and 16 healthy control subjects were included in the study (M/F:7/9; mean age 36 ± 10). Patients underwent a neuropsychological battery and, according to the performance obtained, they were divided in two groups: 13 frontal patients (F-MS; M/F:6/7; mean age: 40 ± 8) and 16 non frontal patients (NF-MS; M/F:8/8; mean age: 41 ± 7). Simple and complex reaction times to the Stroop task were measured using a computerized system. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to the same stimuli were obtained from 29 channel EEG, during mental discrimination between congruent and incongruent stimuli. Multivariate analysis was performed on reaction times (RTs) and ERPs latencies; topographic differences were searched with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). ResultsSignificant group effects were found on the percentage of correct responses: F-MS subjects committed more errors than the other two groups. F-MS patients showed delayed P3 and N4 compared to NF-MS patients and delayed P2, N2, P3 and N4 compared to controls. NF-MS subjects showed significantly slower P2, N2 and P3 compared to control subjects. Moreover, frontal score correlated negatively with ERPs’ latency and with complex RTs. At source analysis F-MS patients presented significantly reduced activation predominantly over frontal, cingulate and parietal regions. ConclusionsTaken together, these findings suggest that bioelectrical activity to the Stroop test may well reflect the speed and extent of neural synchronization of frontal circuits. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of Stroop reaction times and ERPs for detecting frontal involvement early at a subclinical stage, allowing early cognitive therapy, and as a paraclinical marker for monitoring treatment outcomes." .

Casual message-logging protocols have several attractive properties: they introduce no blocking, send no additional messages over those sent by the application, and never create orphans. Causal message logging, however, does require the casual effects of the deliveries of messages to be tracked. The information concerning causality tracking is piggybacked on application messages, and the amount of such information can become large. In this paper we study the cost of tracking causality in causal message-logging protocols. One can track causality as accurately as possible, but to do so requires piggybacking a considerable amount of additional information. One can reduce the amount of piggybacked information on each message by reducing the accuracy of causality tracking. But then, causal message logging may piggyback the reduced amount of information on more messages. We specify six different methods of tracking causality, each representing a natural choice based on the specification of causal message logging. We describe how these six methods can be implemented and compare them in terms of how large of a piggyback load they impose. This load depends on the application that is using causal message logging. We characterize some applications for which a given method has the smallest piggyback load, and study using simulation the size of the piggyback load for two different models of applications." .

We aim to investigate the relation between the dynamic properties of GBPs and their longitudinal magnetic field strengths. High spatial and temporal resolution observations were recorded simultaneously with G-band filtergrams and Narrow-band Filter Imager (NFI) Stokes I $I$ and V $V$ images with Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope. The GBPs are automatically identified and tracked in the G-band images, and the corresponding longitudinal magnetic field strength of each GBP is extracted from the calibrated NFI magnetograms by a point-to-point method. After categorizing the GBPs into five groups by their longitudinal magnetic field strengths, we analyzed the dynamics of each group of GBPs. The results suggest that with increasing longitudinal magnetic field strengths of GBPs correspond to a decrease in their horizontal velocities and motion ranges as well as by showing more complex motion paths. This suggests that magnetic elements showing weaker magnetic field strengths move faster and farther along straighter paths, while stronger elements move more slowly in more erratic paths within a smaller region. The dynamic behaviors of GBPs with different longitudinal magnetic field strengths can be explained by that the stronger flux concentrations withstand the convective flows much better than weaker ones." .

Here, we investigate the conditions surrounding these types of errors, or misnamings, in which a person (the misnamer) incorrectly calls a familiar individual (the misnamed) by someone else’s name (the named). Across 5 studies including over 1,700 participants, we investigated the prevalence of the phenomenon of misnaming, identified factors underlying why it may occur, and tested potential mechanisms. We included undergraduates and MTurk workers and asked questions of both the misnamed and the misnamer. We find that familiar individuals are often misnamed with the name of another member of the same semantic category; family members are misnamed with another family member’s name and friends are misnamed with another friend’s name. Phonetic similarity between names also leads to misnamings; however, the size of this effect was smaller than that of the semantic category effect. Overall, the misnaming of familiar individuals is driven by the relationship between the misnamer, misnamed, and named; phonetic similarity between the incorrect name used by the misnamer and the correct name also plays a role in misnaming." .

This is a prospective cohort study on the population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n = 8,959). Information was gathered from parents, teachers and adolescents using questionnaires at the age of 7, 8 and 15. Response rates were 80–90%. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed with Rutter Children’s Behavioural Questionnaires for teachers (RB2) and parents (RA2) during the first grade at age 8. At adolescence, self-reported life satisfaction was measured with a question including five response alternatives. According to teachers’ assessments, 13.9% of the children had high emotional or behavioural problems (RB2 ≥9). These assessments predicted life dissatisfaction in adolescence (ORcrude = 1.77; 95% CI 1.43–2.20) in several models including also health behaviour and use of psychotropic medicine. However, introducing all the significant variables in the same model, RB2 lost its significance (OR = 1.28; 0.96–1.70), but good school achievement assessed by teachers was still a significant predictor. Life satisfaction in adolescence was associated with a variety of favourable concurrent factors. In conclusion teachers’ assessments of children during the first school year predicted life satisfaction in adolescence. In mental health promotion, teachers’ early assessments should be utilized for the benefit of children." .

It has been questioned whether attentional components are modality specific or not. The T-ANT explores alertness, orienting, cognitive control, and their relationships, similar to its visual counterpart, in the tactile modality. The unique features of the T-ANT are in utilizing stimuli on a single plane—the torso—and replacing the original imperative flanker task with a tactile Simon task. Subjects wore a waist belt mounted with two vibrotactile stimulators situated on the back and positioned to the right and left of the spinal column. They responded by pressing keys with their right or left hand in reaction to the type of vibrotactile stimulation (pulsed/continuous signal). On a single trial, an alerting tone was followed by a short tactile (informative/noninformative) peripheral cue and an imperative tactile Simon task target. The T-ANT was compared with a variant of the ANT in which the flanker task was replaced with a visual Simon task. Experimental data showed effects of orienting over control only when the peripheral cues were informative. In contrast to the visual task, interactions between alertness and control or alertness and orienting were not found in the tactile task. A possible rationale for these results is discussed. The T-ANT allows examination of attentional processes among patients with tactile attentional deficits and patients with eyesight deficits who cannot take part in visual tasks. Technological advancement would enable implementation of the T-ANT in brain-imaging studies." .

In humans, this process is fast and extremely robust, as demonstrated by classical experiments showing that human observers reliably judge causal relationships and attribute interactive social behavior to strongly simplified stimuli consisting of simple moving geometrical shapes. While psychophysical experiments have identified critical visual features that determine the perception of causality and agency from such stimuli, the underlying detailed neural mechanisms remain largely unclear, and it is an open question why humans developed this advanced visual capability at all. We created pairs of naturalistic and abstract stimuli of hand actions that were exactly matched in terms of their motion parameters. We show that varying critical stimulus parameters for both stimulus types leads to very similar modulations of the perception of causality. However, the additional form information about the hand shape and its relationship with the object supports more fine-grained distinctions for the naturalistic stimuli. Moreover, we show that a physiologically plausible model for the recognition of goal-directed hand actions reproduces the observed dependencies of causality perception on critical stimulus parameters. These results support the hypothesis that selectivity for abstract action stimuli might emerge from the same neural mechanisms that underlie the visual processing of natural goal-directed action stimuli. Furthermore, the model proposes specific detailed neural circuits underlying this visual function, which can be evaluated in future experiments." .

In a first experiment pigeons learned to discriminate instrumentally four successively presented target stimuli. Pecks to them were reinforced with graded amounts of reward and penalty (A++, B+, C-, D- -). These stimuli were accompanied by four different neutral stimuli (Na, Nb, Nc, Nd) but responses to these had no consequences. After discrimination of the target stimuli had been established the neutral stimuli were presented in pairs and in the absence of the target stimuli. These tests revealed a graded preference in accordance with the value transfer hypothesis. In a second experiment pigeons were taught to discriminate two target stimuli A+ and B-. Each of these was again accompanied by a neutral stimulus (Na, Nb). Pigeons developed a strong preference for Na. A discrimination reversal affecting the target stimuli (B+, A-) led to a strong reversed preference for Nb. A third experiment employed a similar design but in it one group of pigeons, unlike the control group, was prevented from pecking the neutral stimuli by transparent barriers. As both groups preferred the reward-related neutral stimulus with approximately equal strength it is concluded that classical conditioning, rather than pseudo-operant conditioning was responsible for the value transfer observed. A modification of an algebraic instrumental conditioning model incorporating an adventitious classical conditioning element is shown to emulate the value transfer obtained. The role of classical conditioning in instrumental discrimination learning is discussed." .

Experienced and non-experienced dart players were asked to predict, from temporally occluded video sequences, the landing position of a dart thrown previously by themselves (self) or another (other). This prediction task was performed while additionally performing (a) an action-incongruent secondary motor task (right arm force production), (b) a congruent secondary motor task (mimicking) or (c) an attention-matched task (tone-monitoring). Non-experienced dart players were not affected by any of the secondary task manipulations, relative to control conditions, yet prediction accuracy decreased for the experienced players when additionally performing the force-production, motor task. This interference effect was present for ‘self’ as well as ‘other’ decisions, reducing the accuracy of experienced participants to a novice level. The mimicking (congruent) secondary task condition did not interfere with (or facilitate) prediction accuracy for either group. We conclude that visual–motor experience moderates the process of decision making, such that a seemingly visual–cognitive prediction task relies on activation of the motor system for experienced performers. This fits with a motor simulation account of action prediction in sports and other tasks, and alerts to the specificity of these simulative processes." .

EBC takes advantage of the ability to analyze another’s task performance, a necessary skill for all domains. This technique can be used to help address some barriers to CTA methods such as domain access restrictions, frequency and predictability of observable and self-reported events, and difficulties in recruiting domain experts to participate. The technique enables controlled presentation of problem stimuli in order to obtain repeated measuring of the same task from multiple participants. To investigate this method, our team performed a CTA of inferential analysis using the EBC technique. Specifically, we observed six expert intelligence analysts critiquing a trainee analyzing the Ariane 501 launch failure. A second trainee was critiqued for reference. The method can be combined with other CTA methods to build knowledge about a domain, can be considered as an addition to participatory design methods, and can be varied depending on the domain being investigated." .

Reported prevalence is 1 in 68 children. Ophthalmic disorders have been reported in as many as 50 % of children with ASD, making a comprehensive ophthalmic examination necessary for all such children upon diagnosis. Photoscreeners are a useful tool to initially assess children with ASD. Eye examination techniques include observation, social story, visual schedule, and behavioral strategies to maximize chances of identifying ocular problems. Examination under anesthesia should be reserved for cases where ocular pathology is suspected and attempts to examine the child in the office have been unsuccessful." .

First, it examines 7th and 10th graders' perception of their teachers as epistemic authorities. The results showed that a teacher's subject matter, as well as students' age and gender, influence perception of him/her as an epistemic authority. In addition, interest in the subject matter was found to be an important predictor of students' perception. The second part focuses on teachers' self-perceptions as epistemic authorities. The results indicated that teachers' personal efficacy is the most powerful predictor of their self-perception. Finally, the study compares students' perceptions of teachers as epistemic authorities, teachers' self-perceptions in these terms and teachers' perceptions of how their students perceive them. Two main findings showed the following: (a) teachers perceive themselves as being more of an epistemic authority than their students consider them; (b) teachers believe that students perceive them as being more of an epistemic authority than the students actually think." .

MethodsWe recorded scalp EEG while subjects performed a Sternberg task. In each trial, subjects judged whether a probe item was one of the three items in a study list. Lists were composed of stimuli from one of five pools whose items either were verbally rehearsable (letters, words, pictures of common objects) or resistant to verbal rehearsal (sinusoidal grating patterns, single dot locations). ResultsWe found oscillatory correlates unique to verbal stimuli in the θ (4–8 Hz), α (9–12 Hz), β (14–28 Hz), and γ (30–50 Hz) frequency bands. Verbal stimuli generally elicited greater power than did nonverbal stimuli. Enhanced verbal power was found bilaterally in the θ band, over frontal and occipital areas in the α and β bands, and centrally in the γ band. When we looked specifically for cases where oscillatory power in the time interval between item presentations was greater than oscillatory power during item presentation, we found enhanced β activity in the frontal and occipital regions. ConclusionThese results implicate stimulus-induced oscillatory activity in verbal working memory and β activity in the process of subvocal rehearsal." .

These signs may be used for differential diagnosis. The significance of proserine and atropine as indicators of pre-and postganglionic denervation (proserine-atropine dissociation, atropine paradox) was demonstrated. The author illustrates the dual character of chemoreceptive postsynaptic transmission, namely, the presence of cholinopositive (cholinomimetic) phylogenetically older, and cholinonegative (cholinolytic, inhibitory) phylogenetically younger structures. Various special points of application of proserin, atropine, pilocarpine (acetylcholine) are given (within the range of the pre-and postsynaptic transmission)." .

It was one important theme of his fundamental ontology in the 1920s. There is, according to Heidegger, an intricate connection between awakening our moods and developing a reflexive stance. He provides us with a rich phenomenological description of different forms of boredom. In this article I approach Heidegger’s conception of boredom from an educational point of view. I am suggesting a reading where the experience of boredom has transformative potentialities that also can illuminate our cultural situation as a whole. By turning away from boredom there is always a possibility of turning away from ourselves." .

Dual process theories of impression and judgment formation specify person information that confirms or disconfirms stereotypical expectations as determinants of how judgments are formed. While expectation-confirming information should result in stereotype-based judgments, expectation-disconfirming information should lead to more information-integrating processes. Moreover, attitudes should also be affected in a positive way when a person encounters expectation-disconfirming information. The current study experimentally investigated these hypotheses with regard to stereotypical expectations about ethnic minority students. Eighty-three experienced teachers were randomly divided into four different groups. One group judged a below-average ethnic minority student (confirming) and another group a below-average ethnic majority student. Two other groups judged either an above-average ethnic minority (disconfirming) or ethnic majority student. When assessing a below-average student, teachers judged the confirming ethnic minority student as less proficient in language than the ethnic majority student. These differences could not be found for mathematical achievement or between the above-average ethnic minority and majority students. Attitudes toward ethnic minority students were not affected in the expected way. Findings are discussed with respect to their implications for future research." .

The functioning of the classic differential shunts was compared to the automatically (Orbis-Sigma) functioning shunts. The reference group, with intact compensatory parameters is also presented. The influence of different types of shunts on the intracranial compensation ability was compared. Automatic shunts produce less decrease in the resorption resistance of CSF in the post-shunted examination than the classic differential shunts. Classic differential shunts disturb the mono-exponential character of the pressure-volume relationship in a higher degree than automatic shunts. Shunt functioning models were proposed as well as the method of detection of eventual recovery to the normal resorption reserve. This method can be applied only to patients with automatic shunts." .

The theoretical grounds for the concept of prisoner politicization are delineated, and a measure of politicization is constructed based on research undertaken at three British Columbia penitentiaries, involving direct interviews with prisoners. The decline of prisoner politicization over the past decade is related to innovative penal strategies that re-individualize prisoner orientations and discourage potential alliances between prisoners and non-prisoner activist groups." .

The task was to detect slightly smaller target bars having a specified color (red or blue) and location (left or right). The ERP elicited by stimuli at an attended location contained a sequence of phasic components (P122/N168/N264) that was highly distinct from the sequence associated with selection on the basis of color (N150-350/P199/P400-500). These findings suggested that spatially focused attention involves a gating or modulation of evoked neural activity in the visual pathways, whereas color selection is manifested by an endogenous ERP complex. When the stimulus locations were widely separated, the ERP signs of color selection were hierarchically dependent upon the prior selection for spatial location. In contrast, when the stimulus locations were adjacent to one another, the ERP signs of color selection predominated over those of location selection. These results are viewed as supporting “early selection” theories of attention that specify the rejection of irrelevant inputs prior to the completion of perceptual processing. The implications of ERP data for theories of multidimensional stimulus processing are considered." .
