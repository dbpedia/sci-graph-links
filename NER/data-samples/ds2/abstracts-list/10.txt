The nonlocal theory is used to model the mechanical behavior of structure in small scale. The obtained differential equations are solved using a simply supported boundary condition and Navier analytical method. Moreover the twisted vibration and bending of curved nanotube is analyzed and also the armchair model is assumed in this study. The following parameters were studied in this paper: the effect of nonlocal parameter, the curved nanotube’s opening angel, the Young’s modulus and the mode number is studied. The results were verified with the previous literature which showed an excellent agreement. The results of this paper can be used as a benchmark for future investigations." .

This stabilization method is innovative allowing thin films containing gold nanoparticles to be obtained, and it was used for the first time in the preparation of carbon paste electrodes (CPEs). The charged silsesquioxanes were characterized by liquid 13C NMR. The gold nanoparticle/silsesquioxane systems were characterized by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) and transmission electron microscopy. In sequence, they were immobilized on silica matrix coated with aluminum oxide. The resulting solid materials designated as Au-Py/AlSi and Au-Db/AlSi were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. The results showed that the gold nanoparticle/silsesquioxane systems are strongly adhered to the surface-forming thin films. The Au-Py/AlSi and Au-Db/AlSi materials were used to prepare CPEs for the electrooxidation of nitrite (NO2−) using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The Au-Py/AlSi and Au-Db/AlSi CPEs showed high sensitivity and detection limits of 71.87 and 53.66 μA mmol–1 L and 1.3 and 3.0 μmol L–1, respectively." .

The goal was to develop the topical formulation based on bio-nano-silver to control the infection and healing the wounds with higher efficacy.

At the same time, the health effects and environmental impacts of nanoparticles become an emerging concern to be addressed. Both in vitro and in vivo studies are of importance to better understand the toxicity of nanoparticles. It is thus essential to have a nanoparticle disperser capable of dispersing individual nanoparticles for these studies. A twin-head electrospray (THES) nanoparticle disperser for animal inhalation exposure studies has recently become commercially available from TSE Systems Inc. Different from the cone-jet electrospray method used in the majority of literature, this particular disperser operates at the multi-jet mode. In this study, we reported our finding on the performance evaluation of the THES disperser with respect to its mass throughput and quality of size distribution of aerosol produced. Three different nanomaterials (TiO2, ZnO, and NiO) were used in this study. It is found that the maximal mass throughput of the studied disperser was achieved by keeping the distance between two opposite spray capillary tips at 3.0 cm, operating the primary carrier-to-capillary sheath flow rates at the ratio of 4:3, and feeding spray suspensions at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. Under the above settings and operations, the highest mass concentration for nano-ZnO was measured at 14.56 mg/m3. Nanoparticle streams with higher concentrations can be further produced by lowering the total carrier gas flow rate and spraying suspensions of higher nanomaterial concentrations. Our study also found that the particle mass throughput of the studied disperser had a good linear relationship with the mass concentration of spray suspension. In addition, the spatial uniformity of nano aerosol distribution in a TSE head-nose-only exposure chamber was investigated. An acceptable nano aerosol uniformity result was concluded based on the criteria of the coefficient of variation. Highlights Experimental evaluation of TSE Systems twin-head electrospray nanoparticle disperser was performed.TiO2, ZnO, and NiO were used in the mass throughput study of the investigated nanoparticle disperser.Nano-ZnO mass concentration at 14.56 mg/m3 was achieved in this evaluation.Nanoparticles in their individual form were evidenced by measured size distributions of nanoparticles, dispersed via the studied disperser.Spatial uniformity of nano-aerosol in the animal exposure chamber was examined by the fluorescent nanoparticles." .

Low-temperature pearlite obtained under pressure is very fine; the cementite platelets are broken up.5.The variation of the mechanical properties of pearlite obtained under pressure conform with the changes in its structure — coarse pearlite has a low ductility, the strength and ductility increase with decreasing distance between platelets of pearlite." .

The resulting material (Au/MWCNTs) was characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The developed Au/MWCNTs sensor was used in the determination of nitric oxide (NO) in phosphate buffer solution at pH 4.4 by differential pulse voltammetry. In the potential window between 0.5 and 0.65 V, a well-defined oxidation peak was observed, whose height was proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The Au/MWCNTs-modified electrode exhibited high sensitivity for the determination of nitric oxide, with the limit of detection being 0.21 nmol L−1 (S/N = 3). No significant interference was detected for nitrite and CO2 in the NO detection.

It is important that workers utilize appropriate PDE with characteristics to accomplish this. During the liquid-phase process, nanomaterials are released with water aerosol, which can easily affect the health of workers. The efficiency of PDE in protecting workers against silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) aerosolized with water aerosol was evaluated. The rate of penetration of AgNPs with water aerosol through cleanroom wear was faster than that for a lab coat. This can be attributed to differences in the filling rate of water, as the result of differences in capillary force. Therefore, humidity appears to be a major factor in the rate of penetration of nanomaterials in the presence of water aerosol. Although no penetration was observed when disposable protective gloves were observed, the presence of AgNPs on the surface of gloves was clearly found. Based on these findings, recommendations for the safe use of PDE can now be made." .

We developed a system for post-hoc drug delivery to uncoated stents. MethodsWe coupled rapamycin or a chemically similar fluorescent dye to superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The antiproliferative activity of rapamycin coupled to nanoparticles was confirmed in vitro in primary porcine vascular cells. The particles were then incorporated into lipid based microbubbles. Commercially available stents were made magnetizable by nickel plating and used to induce strong field gradients in order to capture magnetic microbubbles from flowing liquids when placed in an external magnetic field. ResultsNanoparticle bound Rapamycin dose dependently inhibited cell proliferation in vitro. Magnetic microcbubbles carrying coated nanoparticles were caught by magnets placed external to a flow-through tube. Plating commercial stents with nickel resulted in increased deposition at stent struts and allowed for widely increased distance of external magnets. Deposition depended on circulation time and velocity and distance of magnets. Deposited microbubbles were destroyed by ultrasound and delivered their cargo to targeted sites. ConclusionsDrugs can be incorporated into nanoparticle loaded microbubbles and thus be delivered to magnetizable stents from circulating fluids by applying external magnetic fields. This technology could allow for post-hoc drug coating of already implanted vascular stents." .

Results showed that AgNPs (0.05–5.00 mg/L) decreased nitrification activity down to only 2 % compared to the control (free NAS without AgNP exposure). Calcium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol-entrapped cells could mitigate inhibition of nitrification activity up to 100 % (no inhibition observed) and 88 % compared to the controls (entrapped NAS without AgNP exposure), respectively. Cells entrapped in a larger matrix size (both with and without AgNP exposure) performed nitrification better.

The hypothesis was that these products might also show superior caries-inhibiting effect than regular fluoride toothpastes, since they were designed for stronger erosive acid challenges. Materials and methodsEnamel specimens were obtained from bovine teeth and pre-demineralized (pH = 4.95/21 days) to create artificial caries lesions. Baseline mineral loss (ΔZB) and lesion depth (LDB) were determined using transversal microradiography (TMR). Ninety specimens with a median ΔZB (SD) of 6027 ± 1546 vol% × μm were selected and randomly allocated to five groups (n = 18). Treatments during pH-cycling (14 days, 4 × 60 min demineralization/day) were brushing 2×/day with AmF (1400 ppm F−, anti-caries [AC]); AmF/NaF/SnCl2/Chitosan (700 ppm F−/700 ppm F−/3500 ppm Sn2+, anti-erosion [AE1]); NaF/KNO3 (1400 ppm F−, anti-erosion [AE2]); nano-hydroxyapatite-containing (0 ppm F−, [nHA]); and fluoride-free toothpastes (0 ppm F−, negative control [NC]). Toothpaste slurries were prepared with mineral salt solution (1:3 wt/wt). After pH-cycling specimens presenting lesion, surface loss (mainly by NC and nHA) were discarded. For the remaining 77 specimens, new TMR analyses (ΔZE/LDE) were performed. Changes in mineral loss (ΔΔZ = ΔZB − ΔZE) and lesion depth (ΔLD = LDB − LDE) were calculated. ResultsAll toothpastes caused significantly less demineralization (lower ΔΔZ) than NC (p < 0.05, ANOVA) except for nHA. The fluoride toothpastes did not differ significantly regarding ΔΔZ and ΔLD (p > 0.05, ANOVA).

According to the results, the electrochemical surface area of the Pt-PdNPs/TBIrGO is 3.67, 2.06 and 1.78 times higher than those of TBIrGO, PdNPs/TBIrGO and PtNPs/TBIrGO, respectively. The Pt-PdNPs/TBIrGO/GCE also exhibited higher peak current for methanol oxidation than those of comparable TBIrGO/GCE, PdNPs/TBIrGO/GCE, PtNPs/TBIrGO/GCE modified GCEs, thus providing evidence for its higher electro-catalytic activity." .

Single-color femtosecond pump-probe experiments were performed to investigate the time dependence of laser-induced ultrafast desorption and deformation processes of silver nanoparticles in glass. After laser excitation at wavelengths close to the surface plasmon resonance, transient extinction changes were found to exhibit dynamics on quite different time scales ranging from sub-picoseconds to some hundred ps. The slowest observed decay component is identified as characteristic for the deformation/desorption processes. Possible mechanisms for these processes are discussed." .

The effects of the internal length scale parameter, transverse shear deformation, rotary inertia, and geometrical nonlinearity are taken into account. The principle of virtual displacements and the harmonic balance method are used to derive the nonlinear equations of motion, which are solved iteratively by the linearized updated mode method to obtain the fundamental nonlinear frequencies and mode shapes of H–H, C–H, and C–C SWNTs with uniform, linear, and quadratic radius variation. The convergence and accuracy of the non-local shear deformable beam p-element are demonstrated through comparison with other methods. It is shown that the non-uniformity parameters influence significantly the backbone curves and mode shapes of non-prismatic SWNTs." .

However, the increasing use of nanomaterials has raised concern over inadvertent exposure and potential risks for human health and the environment. Henceforth, in vivo testing of nanoparticles and protection against its toxicity is required. Using rat as an animal model, effect of sodium selenite (Se), an essential trace element, on rat testes exposed to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was evaluated. Male rats were treated with AgNPs (5 mg/kg/b.w) i/p or Se (0.2 mg/kg/b.w) by gavage. AgNP administration decreased Glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). However, treatment with Se increased GSH levels and activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx compared with AgNP-treated group and decreased the level of MDA and inflammatory biomarkers significantly (p < 0.05) as compared with AgNP-treated group. Light microscopic analyses also revealed that AgNP induced histopathological changes in testes tissue. Further, protection by Se on biochemical results was confirmed by alleviation of the histopathological changes in the tissue. Results show the adverse effects of AgNPs on the male reproductive tract, particularly spermatogenesis, and suggest that Se possesses significant potential in reducing AgNP-induced testicular toxicity." .

The evolution of size distribution is followed after each step by means of dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and crosschecked by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The as-ablated colloidal suspension of Si nanoparticles presents a large size distribution, ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers. Centrifugation drives the very large particles to the bottom eliminating them from the remaining suspension. Subsequent irradiation of height-separated suspensions with a second high-fluence (40 mJ/pulse) Nd:YAG laser operating at the fourth harmonic ($$\\lambda =266$$ λ=266 nm) leads to size reduction and ultra-small nanoparticles are obtainable depending on the starting size. Si nanoparticles as small as 1.5 nm with low dispersion ($$\\pm 0.7$$ ±0.7 nm) are observed for the uppermost part after irradiation. These nanoparticles present a strong blue photoluminescence that remains stable for at least 8 weeks. Optical absorption (UV–Vis) measurements demonstrate an optical gap widening as a consequence of size decrease. Raman spectra present features related to pure silicon and silicon oxides for the irradiated sample. Interestingly, a defect band associated with silicon oxide is also identified, indicating the possible formation of defect states, which, in turn, supports the idea that the blue photoluminescence has its origin in defects." .

Yet little is known about the mechanism of cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of nanoparticles. An array of nanomaterials has recently been introduced into cancer research promising for remarkable improvements in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Among them, quantum dots (QDs) distinguish themselves in offering many intrinsic photophysical properties that are desirable for targeted imaging and drug delivery. ResultsWe explored the kinetics and mechanism of cellular uptake of QDs with different surface coatings in two human mammary cells. Using fluorescence microscopy and laser scanning cytometry (LSC), we found that both MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells internalized large amount of QD655-COOH, but the percentage of endocytosing cells is slightly higher in MCF-7 cell line than in MCF-10A cell line. Live cell fluorescent imaging showed that QD cellular uptake increases with time over 40 h of incubation. Staining cells with dyes specific to various intracellular organelles indicated that QDs were localized in lysosomes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images suggested a potential pathway for QD cellular uptake mechanism involving three major stages: endocytosis, sequestration in early endosomes, and translocation to later endosomes or lysosomes. No cytotoxicity was observed in cells incubated with 0.8 nM of QDs for a period of 72 h. ConclusionsThe findings presented here provide information on the mechanism of QD endocytosis that could be exploited to reduce non-specific targeting, thereby improving specific targeting of QDs in cancer diagnosis and treatment applications. These findings are also important in understanding the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials and in emphasizing the importance of strict environmental control of nanoparticles." .

For practical applications, spatial variability in carrier density and carrier mobility must be controlled and minimized. We present a simple framework for assessing the quality and homogeneity of large-area graphene devices. The field effect in both exfoliated graphene devices encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride and chemical vapor-deposited (CVD) devices was measured in dual current–voltage configurations and used to derive a single, gate-dependent effective shape factor, β, for each device. β is a sensitive indicator of spatial homogeneity that can be obtained from samples of arbitrary shape. All 50 devices investigated in this study show a variation (up to tenfold) in β as a function of the gate bias. Finite element simulations suggest that spatial doping inhomogeneity, rather than mobility inhomogeneity, is the primary cause of the gate dependence of β, and that measurable variations of β can be caused by doping variations as small as 1010 cm−2. Our results suggest that local variations in the position of the Dirac point alter the current flow and thus the effective sample shape as a function of the gate bias. We also found that such variations lead to systematic errors in carrier mobility calculations, which can be revealed by inspecting the corresponding β factor. " .

We have investigated the spectral density of shot noise for the system of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two single-wall carbon nanotube terminals irradiated with a microwave field on the QD. The terminal features are involved in the shot noise through modifying the self-energy of QD. The contributions of carbon nanotube terminals to the shot noise exhibit obvious behaviors. The novel side peaks are associated with the photon absorption and emission procedure accompanying the suppression of shot noise. The shot noise in balanced absorption belongs to sub-Poissonian, and it is symmetric with respect to the gate voltage. The differential shot noise displays intimate relation with the nature of carbon nanotubes and the applied microwave field. It exhibits asymmetric behavior for the unbalanced absorption case versus gate voltage. The Fano factor of the system exhibits the deviation of shot noise from the Schottky formula, and the structures of terminals obviously contribute to it. The super-Poissonian and sub-Poissonian shot noise can be achieved in the unbalanced absorption in different regime of source-drain bias." .

GE of liquids is delayed by co-ingesting solids. No researchers have used salivary paracetamol concentrations to show this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether salivary paracetamol concentrations can detect the food-induced delay in liquid GE. Methods: Paracetamol absorption was measured twice in five healthy male volunteers. Following an overnight fast, they received 10 mg/kg paracetamol in 200 ml water alone on one occasion, and received this solution after consuming a 400 kcal-containing cookie on another occasion. After thorough rinsing of the month, 1 ml saliva was obtained, simultaneously with 2 ml blood, at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 h after paracetamol intake. The peak concentration (Cmax), the time to Cmax (tmax), the area under the curve (AUC), and Cmax/AUC in plasma were calculated. Salivary Cmax and tmax were also determined. Results: Plasma Cmax and AUC were not significantly different between the two occasions. In contrast, significant differences in plasma tmax and Cmax/AUC (P < 0.05) established the food-induced delay in GE. Salivary tmax could detect the delayed GE, whereas salivary Cmax could not. Conclusions: Salivary tmax can document the solid meal-induced delay in liquid GE." .

The biological activity of nanoparticles of metals depends directly on their physical and chemical properties. The objective of this work is to study the physicochemical parameters and antibacterial effects of copper nanoparticles for the standardization of the given nanomaterial during further use as an antibacterial agent. The physical and chemical parameters and antibacterial effects of copper nanoparticles are investigated. Optical methods, including atomic force microscopy, spectrophotometry, and fluorometry, are used to determine the sizes of associates of nanoparticles. The size of copper nanoparticles was 75 nm, and the sizes of nanoparticle associates are 481.1–1037 nm. An oxide film without any admixture of organic molecules is detected on the surface of nanoparticles. The antibacterial effects of copper nanoparticles are studied on the basis of clinical polyantibiotic-resistant strains of epidermal staphylococcus and gramnegative nonfermentative microorganisms (causative agents of purulent flammatory diseases among patients of traumatology and orthopedic in-patient hospital departments). As a result of the investigations, a clear antibacterial effect of copper nanoparticles with specified physical characteristics on gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms of causative agents of wound infection is detected, which gives prospects for the further use of these particles as antibacterial agents." .

A common materials platform, namely, nanowires, enables us to fabricate state-of-the-art components at reduced volume and show chemical sensing within the available energy budget. We demonstrate a photovoltaic mini-module made of silicon nanowire solar cells, each of 0.5 mm2 area, which delivers a power of 260 μW and an open circuit voltage of 2 V at one sun illumination. Using nanowire platforms two sensing applications are presented. Combining functionalised suspended Si nanowires with a novel microfluidic fluid delivery system, fully integrated microfluidic–sensor devices are examined as sensors for streptavidin and pH, whereas, using a microchip modified with Pd nanowires provides a power efficient and fast early hydrogen gas detection method. Finally, an ultra-low power, efficient solar energy harvesting and sensing microsystem augmented with a 6 mAh rechargeable battery allows for less than 20 μW power consumption and 425 h sensor operation even without energy harvesting." .

Mosquitoes transmit serious human diseases, causing millions of deaths every year. Use of synthetic insecticides to control vector mosquitoes has caused physiological resistance and adverse environmental effects in addition to high operational cost. Insecticides of synthesized natural products for vector control have been a priority in this area. In the present study, activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Euphorbia hirta (E. hirta) plant leaf extract against malarial vector Anopheles stephensi (A. stephensi) was determined. Range of concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 ppm) and methanol crude extract (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ppm) were tested against larvae of A. stephensi. The synthesized AgNPs from E. hirta were highly toxic than methanolic crude extract against malarial vector, A. stephensi. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction. SEM analyses of the synthesized showed that AgNPs, measuring 30–60 nm in size, were clearly distinguishable. The synthesized AgNPs showed larvicidal effects after 24 h of exposure; however, the highest larval mortality was found in the synthesized AgNPs against the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae of values LC50 (10.14, 16.82, 21.51, and 27.89 ppm, respectively), LC90 (31.98, 50.38, 60.09, and 69.94 ppm, respectively), and the LC50 and LC90 values of pupae of 34.52 and 79.76 ppm, respectively. Methanol extract exhibited the larval toxicity against the first to fourth instar larvae and pupae of values LC50 (121.51, 145.40, 169.11, and 197.40 ppm, respectively), LC90 (236.44, 293.75, 331.42, and 371.34 ppm, respectively), and the LC50 and LC90 values of pupae of 219.15 and 396.70 ppm, respectively.

Light microscopy demonstrated a purple pigmentation of the sun-exposed upper layers, the central position of the nucleus, and the starch content in the pyrenoids. The smooth surface of the cells occasionally covered with fungal hyphae was shown by scanning electron microscopy. The cytoarchitecture of moist cells revealed many vacuoles and only a thin cytoplasmic area surrounding the two chloroplasts. The secondary cell walls of older cells were up to 4 µm thick. Organelle membranes as well as thylakoid membranes occasionally showed an inversion of contrast. In the chloroplasts, distinct areas with granular content surrounding the pyrenoids were detected. Within the cytoplasm, electron-dense particles with electron-translucent crystalloid structures were observed. When desiccated samples were investigated, the vacuoles and cytoplasmatic portions appeared destroyed, whereas nucleus and chloroplasts generally remained intact.

It is based on the finding that uric acid in a medium containing ammonia and sodium hydroxide at 65 °C can reduce silver ions to form yellow silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). These are stabilized in solution by using poly(vinyl alcohol) as a capping agent. The yellow color of the solution that results from the localized surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs can be observed by the bare eye. The absorbance at 415 nm is proportional to the concentration of uric acid which therefore can be determined quantitatively. The calibration curve is linear in the concentration range from 10 to 200 nM, with a limit of detection of 3.3 nM.

Thus, an appropriate formulation describing the behavior of CNTs must contain the key information about both their initial configuration as graphene and final configuration as CNT. On this note, to date, some models, in particular based on the Cauchy-Born rule, for the description of CNTs behavior exist. A simplifying assumption in some of these models is that the length and perimeter of the CNT equal the corresponding dimensions of the unrolled initial configuration, thus neglecting the induced hoop and longitudinal strains. On the other hand, the present work offers a purely nonlinear continuum model suitable for the description of the large deformation of the graphene, without the need for the simplifying assumption and employment of the Cauchy-Born rule. The presented closed-form expressions for the Young’s modulus and critical buckling strain of single-walled carbon nanotubes are functions of the elastic constants of the graphene, geometrical properties of the tube section, and a new material parameter that depends on the chirality angle; the new parameter is the coefficient of the introduced nonlinear term. The computed results are in good agreement with the available molecular mechanics results reported by different investigators." .

The present work studies 10–20-nm silver nanoparticle aggregation triggered by the presence of chloride ions. The aggregation process was followed by UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We found that the mechanism involved differs from the classic explanation of nanoparticle aggregation triggered by an increase in the ionic strength. Moreover, our results give evidence that even when nanoparticles are resistant to an increment of the total amount of ions, the formation of insoluble salts in the vicinity of the nanoparticle is enough to induce the aggregation. The presence of silver chloride around the silver nanoparticles was documented by an X-ray diffraction pattern and electrochemical methods because chloride anions are ubiquitous in real media; this alternative process jeopardized the development of many applications with silver nanoparticles that depend on the use of stable colloids." .

Given its merits, such as its selective distribution at tumor sites and its controllable drug release, drug-loaded NPs can be effectively delivered to selected organs and targeted cells, thus enhancing its antitumor efficiency and reducing its toxicity. MethodsWe reported that hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated chitosan NPs promoted the drug delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) into tumor cells that highly expressed CD44. ResultsOur new findings suggested that HA-coated chitosan NPs enhanced drug accumulation by effectively transporting NPs into CD44-overexpressed tumor cells, and they also resulted in mitochondrial damage induced by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared to free drug and uncoated NPs, HA-coated chitosan NPs exhibited stronger inhibition rates and induced obvious apoptosis in CD44-overexpressed A549 cells.

Like many other characteristics of nanoparticles, interaction with electromagnetic radiation depends on the dimensions of the particles and thus allows one, for example, to fabricate tailor-made materials for novel optical components. The present special issue of Applied Physics B – Lasers and Optics is devoted to this highly interesting field of the optical properties of nanoparticles and, in particular, to their variation as a function of size and shape. The feature contains articles describing experimental and theoretical work on, for example, linear and nonlinear optical properties, temporal response following ultrafast femtosecond excitation, the influence of the chemical surroundings on the optical spectra of particles embedded in matrices or supported on substrate surfaces, exploitation of the field enhancement accompanying surface plasmon excitation, and, last but not least, the fragmentation behavior often associated with electronic excitation. Clearly, a selection of articles cannot cover this field exhaustively, and this issue should be regarded as a snapshot of current research on optics of nanoparticles. I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to all the authors for their contributions and all the reviewers for their essential work in ensuring the high quality of the published papers. Finally, I would like to thank Daniela Schiller, Experimentalphysik I, Universität Kassel, and Marlene Hillen, Springer-Verlag Heidelberg, for processing the manuscripts and for careful and rapid preparation of this issue." .

The particles have been characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX). Gelatin plays an important role in the formation of the nano-NiO. TEM image shows the formation of nano-NiO with average particle size 16 nm, which agrees well with the XRD data. Moreover, efficient and stable nano-NiO-based anodes were fabricated by casting of the nano-NiO and multi-walled carbon nanotube solution (NiO-MWNT) on glassy carbon (NiO-MWNT/GC), platine (NiO-MWNT/Pt), and carbon paste (NiO-MWNT/CP) electrodes. The electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at modified electrodes has been examined using linear scanning voltammetry (LSV). The OER is significantly enhanced upon modification of the electrodes with NiO-MWNT, as demonstrated by a negative shift in the LSV curves at the NiO-MWNT-modified electrodes compared to that obtained at the unmodified ones. The maximum electrocatalytic activity toward the OER was obtained in alkaline media. The values of energy saving of oxygen gas at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 Pt, CP, and GC electrodes are 14.1, 16.0, and 21.6 kW h kg−1, respectively. The low cost as well as the marked stability of the modified electrodes makes them promising candidates in industrial water electrolysis process." .

However, these powerful techniques are ultimately limited in resolution by the wavelength of light. Electron microscopes offer much greater resolution due to the shorter effective wavelength of electrons, allowing direct imaging of sub-cellular architecture. The harsh environment of the electron microscope chamber and the properties of the electron beam have led to complex chemical and mechanical preparation techniques, which distance biological samples from their native state and complicate data interpretation. Here we describe recent advances in sample preparation and instrumentation, which push the boundaries of high-resolution imaging. Cryopreparation, cryoelectron microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy strive to image samples in near native state. Advances in correlative microscopy and markers enable high-resolution localisation of proteins. Innovation in microscope design has pushed the boundaries of resolution to atomic scale, whilst automatic acquisition of high-resolution electron microscopy data through large volumes is finally able to place ultrastructure in biological context." .

Our characterizations reveal that the hybrid aerogels exhibit a lot of nanoscale channels and pores due to the Ni-nanocutting process, resulting in an improved specific surface area 254 m2/g in contrast with 187 m2/g for the pristine materials. The hybrid aerogels are subsequently used as anode for lithium-ion battery and exhibit a greatly improved performance after nanocutting treatment. Meanwhile, the specific capacity of supercapacitor with the Ni-cutting aerogel electrode can achieve as high as 475 F/g, which is almost 68 times than that of the pure material (7 F/g). This route may open a facile engineering way to produce porous and high performance electrode for specific electrochemical applications." .

The emergence of this new fiber-shaped material with remarkable properties and dimensions of a few micrometers in length and a few tens of nanometers in diameter raises concerns about potential exposure of workers involved in the whole production cycle. These risks emphasize the need to develop tools allowing identifying such objects, either as isolated fibers or entangled in bundles, in situ and if possible in real time. In this context, experiments aiming at detecting potential particle release while manipulating raw CNT powders were performed at ARKEMA research center in a high safety cell dedicated to scientific experiments. Two techniques were employed. First, particle collection on TEM grids was achieved using two samplers, the first based on aspiration and the second on diffusion assisted with thermophoretic repulsion. These allowed differed analysis of single particle morphology, size and chemical composition. Second, real time multi-elemental composition of particle emission was monitored using LIBS. Eventually, though not quantitative, the coupling of TEM grid analysis with LIBS data demonstrated the possibility of real time detection of CNTs entangled in bundles." .

The alkaline hydrolysis of magnetite precursors and reduction of graphene oxide was simultaneously performed using sodium hydroxide to produce reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 nanocomposite on the fabric surface. The prepared cotton fabrics were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The treated fabrics with reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 nanocomposite displayed a low electrical resistivity i.e. 80 kΩ/sq.

In this manuscript, an extended phase field model is developed to simulate the polarization switching in a finite ferroelectric body with free surfaces. The void region outside the ferroelectric body was modeled as an elastic body having the same elastic stiffness as the ferroelectrics as well as properly distributed eigenstrain which functions to satisfy the traction-free boundary condition. Based on this scheme, periodic boundary conditions can be applied to the discrete system including a finite ferroelectric body and the voids outside. The elastically inhomogeneous system can be solved easily. This model has high calculation efficiency and can be conveniently applied to finite ferroelectric bodies with arbitrary boundaries. Finally, the domain pattern formation in a ferroelectric nano-particle is simulated. The obtained polarization pattern and stress field are illustrated." .

We investigate the causes of inertness by studying the interactions with calcite of a nanoparticle of this class synthesized from malic acid and ethanolamine (M-dots) dispersed in brine (NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) solutions. None of the M-dots are retained in calcite sand-packed columns when dispersed in DI water. Dispersed in the NaCl and mixed brine solutions, 5.6 % of and 7.3 % of the M-dots are initially retained, but 65 and 13 % of these retained particles are subsequently released when the column is flushed with DI water. When dispersed in the CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions, 65 and 54 % of the M-dots are initially retained, and 28 and 26 % subsequently released in the DI water flush. The M-dots have a small negative zeta potential in all solutions, but the calcite zeta potential changes from strongly negative to strongly positive across the solution series, and the particle retention tracks this change. Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) modeling of the force between a calcite probe and an M-dot coated surface shows that hydration forces repel the particles in the DI water, NaCl, and mixed solutions, but not in the CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions. These results show that near-zero charge and strongly hydrophilic decoration are the causes of the remarkable inertness of carbon-cored nanoparticles, and also suggest that nanoparticles could be useful in solute-surface interaction studies.

Two motion equations are advanced to characterize the eccentric and deflective mode of the nano-bearing, respectively. On the basis of these equations, the coaxial stability of the nano-bearing under two axis-deviation perturbations is investigated. A characteristic parameter λ* governing the coaxial stability of the nano-bearing is determined. The influences of the angular velocity, interlayer spacing and axial length of the nano-bearing on the characteristic parameter λ* are analyzed and discussed in detail. It is found that when the angular velocity or interlayer spacing is smaller than a certain critical value, the parameter λ* keeps negative, and the coaxial stability of the nano-bearing is maintained. However, the axial length has very insignificant influence on λ*. In addition, for the two non-coaxial modes, the eccentric mode occurs more easily than the deflective one. The results of this paper provide a further insight into the coaxial stability of nano-bearing via the spatial model." .

The segmentation stage determines the accuracy of the measurement process of nanotube when assessing the quality of nanomaterials. In this work, we propose two segmentation algorithms for carbon nanotube images. Each algorithm includes three stages: preprocessing, segmentation and postprocessing. The first one is applied on images from scanning electron microscopy and employs a matched filter bank in the preprocessing step followed by a neural network in the segmenting phase. The second algorithm uses the Perona–Malik filter for enhancing the nanotube information. The segmentation phase is composed of the relaxed Otsu’s threshold and an artificial neural network. This algorithm is applied on images from transmission electron microscopy. The postprocessing stage, for both algorithms, is based on mathematical morphology. The performance of the proposed algorithms is numerically evaluated by using real image databases, manually segmented by an expert. The algorithm for segmentation of scanning electron microscopy achieved 92.74% of overall accuracy, while the algorithm for segmentation of transmission electron microscopy obtained an accuracy of 73.99% if the whole image is considered. A performance improvement is accomplished if only the region of interest is segmented, arriving to 84.19% of overall accuracy." .

The CO chemisorption results in the transition of the majority of the Fe3C nanoparticles from the ferromagnetic to the superparamagnetic state. The O2 chemisorption results in the backward transition." .

The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by their UV-vis absorption spectra and transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images. The UV-vis absorption spectra showed that NaBH4 served not only as a reducing agent but also as a stabilizer, which protects the aggregation of silver nanoparticles. The TEM images showed that the particles were dispersed better with increasing the NaBH4 concentration." .

Targeted applications are pH-meters devices. The integration of the microfluidic channel allows decreasing the volume required for each measurement. The sensing part of the device consists of a field effect transistor (FET) with a suspended gate directly performed above the fluidic channel. Chemicals under test are driven through the sensing area between the electrical channel of the FET and the suspended gate. By this way products that flow in the microfluidic channel directly module the concentration of charges inside the transistor’s gap and thus induce changes in the transfer characteristic. This paper describes the fabrication process and the technological choices for materials. Electrical tests, performed in air and in liquid, have shown a good behavior of the transistor, linked to a good mechanical sustain of the fluidic channel. The system is able to detect transition between air and liquid media. Moreover, it has shown a high sensitivity (about 300 mV/pH) to pH measurements." .

These properties include small tip radii (and small source size), high electrical conductivity, high melting point, and resistance to electromigration under an applied electric field. Here, carbon nanotube electron point sources are shown to be remarkably stable, with high brightness, low energy spread, and low noise. These are favorable attributes of an electron source to be used in an electron-optical system. By combining wafer-scale carbon nanotube growth technology with microfabrication techniques, it is possible to mass produce high-performance emitter arrays that can deliver high current beams at high frequencies." .

Accurate nanoparticle size distribution analysis with AFM requires non-agglomerated nanoparticles on a flat substrate. The deposition of polystyrene (100 nm), silica (300 and 100 nm), gold (100 nm), and CdSe quantum dot (2–5 nm) nanoparticles by spin coating was optimized for size distribution measurements by AFM. Factors influencing deposition include spin speed, concentration, solvent, and pH. A comparison using spin coating, static evaporation, and a new fluid cell deposition method for depositing nanoparticles is also made. The fluid cell allows for a more uniform and higher density deposition of nanoparticles on a substrate at laminar flow rates, making nanoparticle size analysis via AFM more efficient and also offers the potential for nanoparticle analysis in liquid environments." .

In this paper, the bandgap properties of Kagomé photonic crystal fibers (KPCFs) are investigated in detail. First, the bandgap properties of PCFs based on the basic Kagomé lattice are analyzed and compared with the PBGs of PCFs based on honeycomb and triangular lattices. We highlight the similarities between KPCFs and honeycomb PCFs in their PBGs, both having air-guiding regions only at very large air filling fractions (AIFs), whereas the PBGs of triangular PCFs can have large air-guiding regions at smaller AIFs due to the difference in the gap structure. In the second half of this paper, we show how the PBGs of KPCFs can be modified by introducing an extra air hole into the vacant space of the original lattice. In particular, KPCFs with medium-sized air holes can be designed to guide air by introducing extra air holes of a larger size. The air-guiding regions of KPCFs with very large air holes can also be greatly extended by the extra air holes. These air-guiding regions occur at higher normalized frequencies, resulting in larger air hole pitches favorable for fabrication." .

Based on the morphology characterizations on the hybrid film, the Co3O4 hollow microspheres are uniformly and closely attached on three-dimensional (3D) graphene/carbon nanotubes (GR/CNTs) network, which decreases the agglomeration of Co3O4 microspheres effectively.

In impact dissociation processes, which are the origin of ODCR, donorbound excitons have larger cross section for impinging electrons than for holes, and conversely, acceptor- bound excitons have larger cross section for holes than for electrons. Moreover, the ratio of impact dissociation cross section for holes to that for electrons varies with the number of excitons bound to an impurity. These phenomena are understood primarily in terms of exchange interaction between impinging carriers and constituents of bound excitons. In addition, it is found that the relative intensity of hole cyclotron resonance against electron resonance is larger in ODCR than in CR. This is understood in terms of exchange interaction by taking the many valley nature of the conduction band into account." .

Separation occurs always at a preestablished zone of abscission at the base of the crown. We used electron microscopy to study the abscission zone of Sabella penicillus, both in specimens whose crown was intact and in those whose crown had separated. The abscission zone is within the intermediate layer, between the crown skeleton and the body wall musculature, and only structures supported by the crown skeleton separate from the animal's body. Abscission involves a rupture of the paramyosin muscle cells which form bridges connecting extensions from the epimysium of the body wall musculature and from the cartilage matrix of the crown. After abscission the anterior and posterior ends of the cells remain in place on the crown and body respectively. Sabella penicillus appears able to control the loss of its tentacular crown, so this abscission is a kind of autotomy. Under some circumstances autotomy of the crown may permit escape or confer some surgical benefit to the animal. Using standard histology we found the same anatomical provision for crown abscission in a variety of sabellids. We conclude that differences in their capacities to autotomize the crown have a behavioral/physiological basis rather than an anatomical one." .

Materials and methodsForty premolars and 40 molars with proximal carious lesions and macroscopically intact surfaces (International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) II; code 2) were radiologically assessed and randomly allocated to four groups (with 20 E2 and 20 D1 lesions, respectively). In each group, 10 lesions were deproteinized (NaOCl; 1 %) before etching (HCl; 15 %) and resin infiltration (Icon). Areal surface roughness (Sa) at the most demineralized lesion part (DIAGNOdent) was evaluated topometrically before and after deproteinization, after etching, and after infiltration using focus variation 3D scanning microscopy. ResultsPretreatment with NaOCl (n = 40) had no significant effects on Sa (p = 0.208), but resulted in significantly differing Sa values between premolars and molars after etching (p = 0.011). Regarding the effects between etching and baseline, significantly differing Sa values (p = 0.0498) were found for premolars and molars (n = 40/40); Sa after resin infiltration (compared to etching) differed significantly between premolars and molars (p = 0.009).

For this reason, extensive attention has been paid on pulse anodization to regulate the nanostructure of PATNT. However, the relationships between the nanostructures and current curves still remain unclear. Based on the traditional potentiostatic and pulse anodizations, five different modes (i.e., potentiostatic, pulse, triangle wave, decrease, and increase step by step) of applied voltage and their influences on the nanostructures of PATNT have been investigated in detail. The growing rates of the nanotubes anodized under five different modes were compared for the first time. The results show that the growing rate of pulse voltage anodization is the fastest, reaching 116.4 nm min−1. The slowest is triangle wave voltage anodization, only 59.3 nm min−1. When the applied voltage decreases step-by-step, branched nanotubes can be formed in the bottom of PATNT. Yet, when the applied voltage increases step-by-step, triple-layer nanotubes with different diameters are formed, and the forming mechanism of this special nanostructure is discussed. The present results may be helpful to understand the mechanism of PATNT and facilitate the assembling diverse nanostructures for extensive applications in photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells, and biomedical devices." .

Accordingly, some related applications of this phenomenon such as dye degradation with the advantage of using a higher wavelength range of light have been reported. Herein, we have selected four synthetic methods for preparation of CQDs to examine their upconversion properties in the presence and absence of an excitation filter. Independent of different synthetic strategies used, the results clearly indicated that the so-called upconversion phenomenon is, in fact, only a normal photoluminescence excited by the second-order diffraction light (λ/2) passing from the excitation monochromator. In addition, CQDs were used to prepare TiO2/CQDs nanocomposites in order to check their potential applications in degradation of methyl orange using the visible range of light. From the results, no difference between the efficiency of pure TiO2 and TiO2/CQDs nanocomposites using this range of wavelengths were observed." .

Here, we present results on the performance of a silver nanoparticles delivery system using natural rubber latex (NRL) as the polymeric matrix. Our aim was to obtain an optimized wound dressing by combining materials with potential healing action. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles and their characterization by UV–Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are depicted. The NRL membranes are good matrix for silver nanoparticles and allow for their gradual release. The release of 30 nm silver nanoparticles by the NRL membranes depends on their mass percentage in NRL membranes. The total concentration of AgNP released by the NRL membranes was calculated. The AgNP attached to the cis-isoprene molecules in the NRL matrix remain attached to the membrane (~0.1 % w/w). So, only the AgNP bound to the non-rubber molecules are released. FTIR spectra suggest that non-rubber molecules, like aminoacids and proteins, associated with the serum fraction of the NRL may be attached to the surfaces of the released nanoparticles, thereby increasing the release of such molecules. The released silver nanoparticles are sterically stabilized, more stable and well dispersed. Because the serum fraction of the NRL is responsible for the angiogenic properties of the matrix, the silver nanoparticles could increment the angiogenic properties of NRL. This biomaterial has desirable properties for the fabrication of a wound dressing with potential healing action, since it combines the angiogenic and antibacterial properties of the silver nanoparticles with the increased angiogenic properties of the NRL.

Medicine, in particular, could benefit from nanotechnology, due to emerging applications for noninvasive imaging and therapy. One important nanotechnological platform that has shown promise includes the so-called iron oxide nanoparticles. With specific relevance to cancer therapy, iron oxide nanoparticle-based therapy represents an important alternative to conventional chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Iron oxide nanoparticles are usually composed of three main components: an iron core, a polymer coating, and functional moieties. The biodegradable iron core can be designed to be superparamagnetic. This is particularly important, if the nanoparticles are to be used as a contrast agent for noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Surrounding the iron core is generally a polymer coating, which not only serves as a protective layer but also is a very important component for transforming nanoparticles into biomedical nanotools for in vivo applications. Finally, different moieties attached to the coating serve as targeting macromolecules, therapeutics payloads, or additional imaging tags. Despite the development of several nanoparticles for biomedical applications, we believe that iron oxide nanoparticles are still the most promising platform that can transform nanotechnology into a conventional medical discipline." .

The main challenge in this way is to generate enough contrast that could be traceable on images. In order to compensate for the low quantity of contrast agents in desired sites, surface engineering has to be done to enhance relaxation rates. As many factors such as magnetic field strength can affect relaxation rates of NPs, knowledge of the relation between field strength and relaxation rates is essential to compare results of different fields and choosing an optimum agent for a specific field. In this study, we evaluate the effects of magnetic field strengths of 0.35, 1.5, and 3 T on relaxation rates of PEGylated SPIOs. Longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates of all samples with various concentrations were analyzed quantitatively on appropriate spin–echo sequences. Our results suggest that the increasing of the field strength leads to a marked decrease of longitudinal relaxivity. In the case of transverse relaxivity, all NPs showed an increase between 0.35 and 1.5 T. Upon further increasing the field strength, relaxation rates only slightly increased except for two samples that showed saturation." .

The chief components of automobile exhaust include carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrocarbons. Indium zirconate (InZrOx) and gold/indium zirconate (Au/InZrOx) composite nanopowders are believed to be interesting materials to detect these substances. To this end, characterization and gas sensing properties of InZrOx and Au/InZrOx composite nanopowders are discussed. InZrOx nanoparticles with In/Zr atomic ratio of 1.00 (±0.05) are synthesized via pH-controlled co-precipitation of In and Zr salts in aqueous ammonia. Gold (Au) nanoparticles are subsequently deposited on InZrOx using an in situ sacrificial Au electrolysis procedure. The products are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The gas sensing performance of Au/InZrOx composite nanopowder is studied by depositing a thick powder film on interdigitated electrode structures patterned on SiC substrate to facilitate high temperature operation. The resistivity of the Au/InZrOx layer is the sensor signal, and the sensors could be operated at 500–600 °C, which is a suitable temperature range for engine exhaust measurements. The control sensing measurements reveal that Au/InZrOx composite nanopowder exhibits higher response towards 2–20 % O2 gas as compared to pristine InZrOx nanoparticles. Further studies show that when applied to exhaust gases such as CO and nitric oxide (NO), the response of Au/InZrOx sensors is significantly higher towards NO in this temperature range.

The nanosized mass sensors are based on the fact that the resonant frequency is sensitive to the resonator and the attached mass. The change of the attached mass on the resonator causes the resonant frequency to deviate from its original value. The key challenge in mass detection is in quantifying the changes in the resonant frequencies due to the added masses. The present paper deals with the free vibration analysis of a single-walled carbon nanotube with attached distributed mass, located in a generic position. According to the nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, a system of three equations of motion, of a single-walled carbon nanotube with an added mass, is derived. Using an approximate method, generalized nondimensional calibration constants are derived for an explicit relationship between the added mass, the nonlocal parameter, and the frequency shift. Numerical results for different boundary conditions and nonlocal coefficient are performed in order to evaluate the effect of the added mass." .

ResultsA collection of three PEGylated terpolymers with varied compositions in poly(ADMC-co-CL) block was designed with high cell-biocompatibility. The copolymers could readily self-assemble into nanoscale micelles (~ 100 nm) in aqueous medium and exhibit high stability over 80-h incubation in different mediums including deionized water, neutral NaCl solution, and heparin sodium solution. Due to the protonation-deprotonation of tertiary amine groups in ADMC units, acid-induced structural deformation of micelles was disclosed in terms of the variation in CAC value and hydrodynamic size at different pH. Drug loading efficiency was comparable to that of reported PEG-polyester micelles with specifically designed structures purposed for drug-loading improvement.

These devices are made by depositing small gap interdigitated contacts on polycrystalline diamond films grown by Microwave Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition. Gold interdigitated contacts were deposited on the typically rough surface of these films by using both wet etching and unconventional lift-off lithographic processes. These detectors were tested through X-ray irradiation in order to compare their potentialities in obtaining higher performance diamond photoconductive detectors. A better resolution was observed in samples obtained through the lift-off process. In particular for these samples the gap between electrodes could be kept very small and of the order of the grain size, giving higher response due the lower contribution of grain boundary effects." .

In this paper, we investigate the interaction of deoxyribonucleic acid inside single-walled carbon nanotubes. Using classical applied mathematical modeling, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the encapsulation of DNA inside single-walled carbon nanotubes. We adopt the 6–12 Lennard–Jones potential function together with the continuous approach to determine the preferred minimum energy position of the dsDNA molecule inside a single-walled carbon nanotube, so as to predict its location with reference to the cross-section of the carbon nanotube. An analytical expression is obtained in terms of hypergeometric functions which provides a computationally rapid procedure to determine critical numerical values. We observe that the double-strand DNA can be encapsulated inside a single-walled carbon nanotube with a radius larger than 12.30 Å, and we show that the optimal single-walled carbon nanotube to enclose a double-stranded DNA has radius 12.8 Å." .

Here we examine the environmental degradation of triangular silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in laboratory air. In the early stages of corrosion, transmission electron microscopy shows that dissolution of the single-crystal, triangular, AgNP (side lengths 50–120 nm) is observed with the accompanying formation of smaller, polycrystalline Ag particles nearby. The new particles are then observed to corrode to Ag2S and after 21 days nearly full corrosion has occurred, but some with minor Ag inclusions remaining. In contrast, a bulk Ag sheet, studied in cross section, showed an adherent corrosion layer of only around 20–50 nm in thickness after over a decade of being exposed to ambient air. The results have implications for antibacterial properties and ecotoxicology of AgNP during corrosion as the dissolution and reformation of Ag particles during corrosion will likely be accompanied by the release of Ag+ ions." .

The improvement in the photo-current resulted from the light scattering of embedded Ag nanoparticles. The I–V curve of n-ZnO/p-Si degraded after thermal treatment (A-ZnO/p-Si) because the silicon robbed the oxygen from ZnO to form amorphous silicon dioxide and left an oxygen vacancy. Notably, the properties of ZnO/nano-PAg/p-Si were better in the time-dependent photoresponse under 10 V bias. Ag nanoparticles (15–20 nm) scattered the UV light randomly and increased the probability for the absorption of ZnO to enhance the properties of the photodiode." .

With the advantages of both graphene and Au nanoparticles, SGN/Au hybrid showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards O2 reduction. Furthermore, it provided a conductive and favorable microenvironment for the glucose oxidase (GOD) immobilization and thus promoted its direct electron transfer at the glassy carbon electrode. Based on the consumption of O2 caused by glucose at the interface of GOD electrode modified with SGN/Au hybrid, the modified electrode displayed satisfactory analytical performance, including high sensitivity (14.55 μA mM−1 cm−2), low detection limit (0.2 mM), an acceptable linear range from 2 to 16 mM, and also the prevention from the interference of some species.

With these two goals in mind, planar and nanotexturized c-Si photovoltaic devices were built and their radiation incident side was covered with CdTe quantum dots (QDs) dispersed in a poly-methyl-methacrylate thin film ~100 nm thick. The measured performance with and without the CdTe QD layer indicates that the down-shifting photoluminescence (DSPL) of the synthesized QDs triggers an increase in the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current, resulting in an overall improvement of ~1.5 % in the power conversion efficiency of the produced devices. This observation can be understood as a result of decreasing the number of high energy photons that are prone to unproductive near surface absorption in c-Si p-n junction solar cells and the re-emission of lower energy photons that are more effectively bulk-absorbed in c-Si solar cells. The result of lowering the near surface photon absorption represents a reduction of carrier losses due to the high surface recombination velocity as well as the low lifetime that normally plague the diffused side of an active junction device. Additionally, solar cells with a layer of CdTe QDs exhibit a higher external quantum efficiency when compared to devices without the aforementioned quantum dots. Layers of CdTe QDs are economically attractive, highly photostable and their absorption and emission spectra have a strong dependence on particle size, therefore, they lend themselves to providing a broad DSPL spectrum and promoting the proliferation of photovoltaic structures." .

The P–Pt/C samples were observed using a transmission electron microscope. The average particle size of the Pt nanoparticles decreased as the NaPH2O2 concentration in the precursor solution increased. The average particle size was in the range 0.9–3.4 nm. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt were estimated using cyclic voltammetry. In contrast to the average particle size, the ECSAs increased as the NaPH2O2 concentration was increased. The decrease in the size of the Pt nanoparticles using NaPH2O2 effectively increased the ECSA.

The dielectric function of yttrium in the range between 0.2 μm and 2 μm is composed of a harmonic oscillator contribution due to a discrete interband transition and the contribution of free electrons. Hence, it is possible to discuss surface plasmon polaritons as well as other electronic resonances in the optical extinction spectra of yttrium nanoparticles. For the latter, we discuss the broadening of the resonance caused by the aggregation of particles. When particles are lumped into aggregates, the color of the particle system also changes. Aggregation also affects the surface plasmon resonance in yttrium nanoparticles in a way comparable to silver or gold nanoparticle aggregates. Comparison is made with the first experimental results on yttriumnanoparticles, showing that aggregation is the dominant effect for the broad resonance in the measured extinction spectra." .

Fourier transform infrared spectra, SEM, and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the successful immobilization of PB. Compared with PB films and graphene sheets, the PB–graphene composite films showed the largest current response to the reduction of H2O2, probably due to the synergistic effects between graphene sheets and PB nanoparticles. Therefore, a fast and highly sensitive amperometric sensor for H2O2 was obtained with a detection sensitivity of 1.6 μA μM−1 H2O2 per cm2 and a linear response range of 50∼5,000 μM. The detection limit of H2O2 was 20 nM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. These obtained results are much better than those reported for carbon nanotubes-based amperometric sensors." .

The body is subjected to either uniform tensile tractions at infinity or a uniform pressure on the void surfaces. In each case, the effect of varying the distance between the void centers on the deformations of the body is analyzed. When the voids are located close to each other, a uniform pressure on the void surfaces results in noncircular deformed voids, and for a fixed value of the pressure, the deformation induced increases as the voids get closer to each other. When the body is subjected to uniform tensile tractions at infinity, say along thex-axis, the voids are deformed into ellipsoids with major axes aligned along thex-axis." .

Besides the Euler-Lagrange equation and natural boundary condition, a new boundary constitutive equation is derived from the variation of the Lagrangian and configuration on which the Lagrangian is defined. On the boundary surface, explicit expression of the vector potential with respect to the field variable and surface curvature is determined. Based on this framework, an elastic model with relevance to the surface energy is established. The Young-Laplace’s formula is generalized to an elastic solid in a new fashion. Making use of this model, we investigate the surface energy effect in the radial vibration of a spherical nanoparticle. Numerical calculation shows that natural frequencies of the nanoparticle will shift down due to the surface energy. This shift is especially apparent in the vibration of soft matter nanoparticles." .

Materials and methods E. faecalis strain JCM 7783 was introduced into dentinal tubules of semicylindrical dentin specimens by centrifugation and incubated for 1 week. Fifty microliters of CONPs or CHNPs was placed on the root canal side of the infected dentin specimens. The specimens were then incubated in aerobic condition at 37 °C and 100 % relative humidity for 1 week. The treated dentin specimens were subjected to fluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to analyze the proportions of non-vital and vital bacterial cells inside the dentinal tubules. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the effect of the medicaments on the bacteria in the dentinal tubules. Calcium oxide (CO) and calcium hydroxide (CH) were used as controls. ResultsBased on the CLSM and SEM analyses, CHNPs were more efficient than CONPs in the elimination of the bacteria in the dentinal tubules. CONPs significantly killed more E. faecalis than CO and CH (P < .05). Neither CO nor CH was able to kill the bacteria.

It is based on the formation of a Pt-Pb nanoalloy from Pt nanoparticles and Pb that is formed by reduction with NaBH4. The nanoalloy accelerates an oscillatory reaction involving Toluidine Blue (TB), NaBH4 and oxygen. In this reaction, TB is reduced by NaBH4 to form reduced TB (rTB), and this is accompanied by a color change from blue to colorless. However, rTB can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen and the color turns back to blue. The Pt-Pb nanoalloy exerts a strong catalytic effect on this reaction. If the concentration of NaBH4 is low enough, the rate of reducing TB is lower than that of the oxidation of TB. The time of the transition from blue → colorless → blue is inversely correlated to the concentration of Pb(II). The methods works in the 1 to 1000 nM Pb(II) concentration range, with a 0.63 nM detection limit, This highly sensitive and selective method was applied to the determination of Pb(II) in spiked river water samples.

Therefore, it is essential to quantify dissolved Ag in nanosilver suspensions for investigations of nanoparticle toxicity. We developed a method to measure dissolved Ag in Ag+/AgNPs mixtures by combining aggregation of AgNPs with centrifugation. We also describe the reproducible synthesis of stable, uncoated AgNPs. Uncoated AgNPs were quickly aggregated by 2 mM Ca2+, forming large clusters that could be sedimented in a low-speed centrifuge. At 20,100g, the sedimentation time of AgNPs was markedly reduced to 30 min due to Ca2+-mediated aggregation, confirmed by the measurements of Ag content in supernatants with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. No AgNPs were detected in the supernatant by UV–Vis absorption spectra after centrifuging the aggregates. Our approach provides a convenient and inexpensive way to separate dissolved Ag from AgNPs, avoiding long ultracentrifugation times or Ag+ adsorption to ultrafiltration membranes." .

The quantum Goos-Hänchen effect in graphene is found to be the lateral shift of Dirac fermions on the total reflection at a single p-n interface. In this paper, we investigate the lateral shifts of Dirac fermions in transmission through a monolayer graphene barrier. Compared to the smallness of the lateral shifts in total reflection, the lateral shifts can be enhanced by the transmission resonances when the incidence angle is less than the critical angle for total reflection. It is also found that the lateral shifts, as the function of the barrier’s width and incidence angle, can be negative and positive in the cases of Klein tunneling and classical motion. The modulation of the lateral shifts can be realized by changing the electrostatic potential and induced gap, which gives rise to some applications in graphene-based devices." .

Aqueous silver nanoparticle (AgNP) dispersions were evaluated for their homogeneity of mass fraction and particle size and found sufficiently homogeneous to be used as reference materials.

Chicken breasts were homogenized by cryo-milling and spiked with aqueous AgNP dispersions. Rapid freezing over liquid nitrogen resulted in homogeneous and stable materials. The spiked chicken materials were characterized for their total Ag mass fraction by neutron activation analysis and for the AgNP particle size by TEM and single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The observed differences in particle sizes between the spiked chicken samples and the original silver dispersions indicate relevant matrix effects.

In this paper, by studying the adsorption of NO, N2O, and NO2 on pristine and silicon (Si)-doped graphene with density functional theory methods, we evaluated the possibility of using Si-doped graphene as a candidate to detect or reduce harmful nitrogen oxides. The results indicate that, while adsorption of the three molecules on pristine graphene is very weak, Si-doping enhances the interaction of these molecules with graphene sheet in various ways: (1) two NO molecules can be adsorbed on Si-doped graphene in a paired arrangement, while up to four NO2 molecules attach to the doped graphene with an average adsorption energy of −0.329 eV; (2) the N2O molecule can be reduced easily to the N2 molecule, leaving an O-atom on the Si-doped graphene. Moreover, we find that adsorption of NO and NO2 leads to large changes in the electronic properties of Si-doped graphene. On the basis of these results, Si-doped graphene can be expected to be a good sensor for NO and NO2 detection, as well as a metal-free catalyst for N2O reduction." .

Filariasis is vectored by mosquitoes, with special reference to the genus Culex. The main control tool against mosquito larvae is represented by treatments with organophosphates and insect growth regulators, with negative effects on human health and the environment. Recently, green-synthesized nanoparticles have been proposed as highly effective larvicidals against mosquito vectors. In this research, we attempted a reply to the following question: do green-synthesized nanoparticles affect predation rates of copepods against mosquito larvae? We proposed a novel method of seaweed-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles using the frond extract of Caulerpa scalpelliformis. The toxicity of the seaweed extract and silver nanoparticles was assessed against the filarial vector Culex quinquefasciatus. Then, we evaluated the predatory efficiency of the cyclopoid crustacean Mesocyclops longisetus against larval instars of C. quinquefasciatus in a nanoparticle-contaminated water environment. Green-synthesized silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV–vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In mosquitocidal assays, the LC50 values of the C. scalpelliformis extract against C. quinquefasciatus were 31.38 ppm (I), 46.49 ppm (II), 75.79 ppm (III), 102.26 ppm (IV), and 138.89 ppm (pupa), while LC50 of silver nanoparticles were 3.08 ppm, (I), 3.49 ppm (II), 4.64 ppm (III), 5.86 ppm (IV), and 7.33 ppm (pupa). The predatory efficiency of the copepod M. longisetus in the control treatment was 78 and 59 % against I and II instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus. In a nanoparticle-contaminated environment, predation efficiency was 84 and 63 %, respectively. Predation was higher against first instar larvae over other instars. Overall, our study showed that seaweed-synthesized silver nanoparticles can be proposed in synergy with biological control agents against Culex larvae, since their use leads to little detrimental effects against aquatic predators, such as copepods." .

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible accumulation and histological damage resulting from the exposure of fish to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Hence, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed for 21 days to sublethal concentrations of either colloidal or powdered forms of silver nanoparticles (cAgNPs or pAgNPs, respectively); the resulting histological changes (in gills, intestines, liver, and kidneys) and bioaccumulation (in gills, intestines, liver, and white muscles) were examined on days 11 and 21. In the case of cAgNPs, the highest concentrations of silver were observed in the liver, gills, and intestines. Meanwhile, in the case of pAgNPs, the highest concentrations of silver were observed in the intestines, liver, gills, and muscles. The greatest histopathological impacts were observed in the gills (mostly proliferation and inflammation), intestines (mostly necrosis and inflammation), and liver (mostly pigmentation). Thus, when taken together, the current findings indicate that both forms of AgNPs had a chronic effect on the rainbow trout (as a model aquatic organism); therefore, preventing the entry of these nanomaterials into the aquatic environment would seem to be essential." .

Objective and design:Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the development of inflammation. These markers are generally measured using tedious ELISA procedures. In this study, a novel technique utilizing antibody conjugated quantum dot nanoparticles was developed to detect Myeloperoxidase, Interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) in vivo in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of experimental colitis. Materials and methods:Colitis was induced in animals (n = 8 animals/group) by feeding 4% DSS solution ad libitum for seven to eight days. Quantum Dots (QDs) exhibiting fluorescence at various wavelengths were conjugated to MPO, IL-1α and TNF-α polyclonal antibodies and tested in vivo at various stages of colitis. Tissue sections obtained were imaged with confocal microscope. The image intensity obtained from the tissue specimen was correlated with clinical activity measured as Disease Activity Index (DAI). Results:Myeloperoxidase, IL-1α and TNF-α were visualized with quantum dots on various days of disease. The intensity of quantum dots increased with the increase in inflammation. The increase in intensity showed an excellent correlation with the DAI based on the clinical parameters. Conclusion:The study demonstrated that multiple biomarkers can be detected simultaneously and their quantitative expression correlated well with clinical disease severity. This novel technology should facilitate design of a novel optical platform for imaging various biomarkers of inflammation, early detection of acute and chronic disease markers and inflammation-mediated cancer markers.

MethodsThis paper describes the construction of the anti-EGFR nanoparticle EGFR–BSA–PCL. This nanoparticle was characterized for EGFR-targeted binding and cellular uptake in EGFR-overexpressing cancer cells by using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Anti-EGFR and non-targeted nanoparticles were labeled with 131I using the chloramine-T method. Analyses of cytotoxicity and targeted cell killing with 131I were performed using the MTT assay. The time-dependent cellular uptake of 131I-labeled anti-EGFR nanoparticles proved the slow-release effects of nanoparticles. A radioiodine therapy study was also performed in mice. ResultsThe EGFR-targeted nanoparticle EGFR–BSA–PCL and the non-targeted nanoparticle BSA–PCL were constructed; the effective diameters were approximately 100 nm. The results from flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed significant uptake of EGFR–BSA–PCL in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. Compared with EGFR–BSA–PCL, BSA–PCL could also bind to cells, but tumor cell retention was minimal and weak. In MTT assays, the EGFR-targeted radioactive nanoparticle 131I–EGFR–BSA–PCL showed greater cytotoxicity and targeted cell killing than the non-targeted nanoparticle 131I–BSA–PCL. The radioiodine uptake of both 131I-labeled nanoparticles, 131I–EGFR–BSA–PCL and 131I–BSA–PCL, was rapid and reached maximal levels 4 h after incubation, but the 131I uptake of 131I–EGFR–BSA–PCL was higher than that of 131I–BSA–PCL. On day 15, the average tumor volumes of the 131I–EGFR–BSA–PCL and 131I–BSA–PCL groups showed a slow growth relationship compared with that of the control group. ConclusionThe EGFR-targeted nanoparticle EGFR–BSA–PCL demonstrated superior cellular binding and uptake compared with those of the control BSA–PCL. The EGFR-targeted radioactive nanoparticle 131I–EGFR–BSA–PCL exhibited favorable intracellular retention of 131I. Radionuclide therapy using 131I–EGFR–BSA–PCL, which showed excellent targeted cell killing, suppressed cancer cell growth caused by EGFR overexpression." .

MethodsMNP uptake was examined under field on/off conditions, utilizing varying magnetite concentration MNPs. MNP-loaded cell viability and functional integrity was assessed using metabolic respiration, cell proliferation and migration assays. ResultsMNP uptake in endothelial cells significantly increased under the influence of a magnetic field versus non-magnetic conditions. Larger magnetite density of the MNPs led to a higher MNP internalization by cells under application of a magnetic field without compromising cellular respiration activity. Two-dimensional migration assays at no field showed that higher magnetite loading resulted in greater cell migration rates. In a three-dimensional migration assay under magnetic field, the migration rate of MNP-loaded cells was more than twice that of unloaded cells and was comparable to migration stimulated by a serum gradient. ConclusionsOur results suggest that endothelial cell uptake of MNPs is a force dependent process. The in vitro assays determined that cell health is not adversely affected by high MNP loadings, allowing these highly magnetically responsive cells to be potentially beneficial therapy (gene, drug or cell) delivery systems." .

It was found that the ablation of diamond nanoparticles results in larger amounts of long polyynes compared to the ablation of graphite particles. It was also found that the chain length distribution of polyynes produced from diamond nanoparticles is dependent on the laser irradiation time and the fraction of long polyynes is higher when the irradiation time is shorter. These results allow us to conclude that the direct evaporation of carbon atoms from pristine diamond nanoparticles at the initial stage of laser irradiation results in the larger amounts of long polyynes." .

The graphene layer was very thin and the mesoporous TiO2 particles were nano-scale, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Graphene and mesoporous TiO2 displayed remarkable enhancement effect and greatly increased the oxidation signals of two azo colorants, i.e., Ponceau 4R and Allura Red. The influence of electrolyte, scan rate, amount of graphene and mesoporous TiO2, accumulation potential, and time on the signal enhancement of Ponceau 4R and Allura Red was discussed, and therefore, a novel and sensitive electrochemical method was developed for the detection of Ponceau 4R and Allura Red. The linear range was wider than two order of magnitude for both of Ponceau 4R and Allura Red. The limit of detection for Ponceau 4R and Allura Red was 1.35 and 0.34 nM, respectively. Finally, this method was successfully applied in soft drink and sausage samples, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography technique." .

This presuppositionless analysis fully explains a hysteresis with respect to the phase fraction and the pressure observed experimentally. It is important to mention that the results of this analysis may be transferred to the role of any external volumetric field acting on phase transforming nanoparticles. Typical examples are phase transformations of ferromagnetic intermetallics subjected to the influence of magnetic fields." .

MethodsWe compared vessel images detected prior to the use of contrast with those detected by enhanced ECDUS in 29 patients with recurrent esophageal varices. After the pre-contrast ECDUS examination, all 29 patients received Levovist intravenously, at a concentration of 300 mg/ml. A 7.5-ml dose of the contrast agent was injected at a slow infusion rate, of 1 ml/min. The perforating veins detected by ECDUS were classified, according to flow direction, into three different types. Type 1 showed inflow from the paraesophageal veins to the esophageal varices. Type 2 showed outflow from the esophageal varices to the paraesophageal veins, while type 3 was a mixed type with both inflow and outflow. For comparison, 26 patients without recurrent esophageal varices were studied. ResultsColor flow images of perforating veins were obtained in 9 (31.0%) of the 29 patients with recurrent esophageal varices with pre-contrast ECDUS. The detection rate of perforating veins in the patients with recurrent esophageal varices (31.0%) was significantly higher than that in patients without recurrent esophageal varices (0 of 26; 0%) with pre-contrast ECDUS. Color flow images of perforating veins were detected in 22 (75.9%) of the 29 patients with recurrent esophageal varices after Levovist contrast. On the other hand, color flow images of perforating veins were not detected in any of the 26 patients without recurrent esophageal varices after Levovist contrast. Type 1 perforating veins were recognized in 6 (20.7%) of the 29 patients, type 2 in 2 (6.9%) of the 29, and type 3 in 1 (3.4%) of the 29 prior to the use of contrast. After the enhanced ECDUS, type 1 perforating veins were recognized in 13 (44.8%) of the 29 patients, type 2 in 6 (20.7%) of the 29, and type 3 in 3 (10.3%) of the 29. All color-flow images detected with pre-contrast ECDUS were enhanced after Levovist contrast. ConclusionsPerforating veins can be detected at a high rate by ECDUS with Levovist in patients with recurrent esophageal varices after endoscopic therapy." .

First, the Si molds were fabricated by an optimized, through-wafer deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process to achieve small roughness. To further reduce the roughness, the Si molds were then oxidized and etched in BHF for three times to achieve surface roughness average (R a) and root mean square (RMS) roughness below 25 nm while peak-to-valley (P–V) roughness is below 150 nm. We monitored the surface roughness and morphology of the sidewalls of Si mold through three cycles of oxidation and BHF etching using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We found that further oxidation and BHF etching might not have much effect in further reducing the roughness while the device feature definitions might be compromised. Finally, the PDMS TIR-based devices replicated from the Si molds were evaluated by means of FESEM, AFM and by imaging of the fluorescent evanescent spots." .

The perturbation is deviation from unity of the ratio of the minor to the major axes of the ellipse. For the body containing an ellipsoidal void, two different loadings are considered; one in which the void surface is taken to be traction free and a uniform compressive load is applied at infinity, and the other in which a uniform pressure is applied to the void surface and null tractions at infinity. For the case of a rigid inclusion, uniform normal tensile tractions are applied at infinity. It is shown that a slight deviation from the circular shape of the cavity or the inclusion has a noticeable effect on the maximum stresses induced in the nonlinear elastic body." .

Here we report on a novel method for coating a magnetic iron oxide onto the surface of core nanoparticles in an aqueous suspension. The method is based on the heterogeneous nucleation of an initial product of Fe3+/Fe2+ co-precipitation on the core nanoparticles. The close control of the supersaturation of the precipitating species required for an exclusively heterogeneous nucleation and the growth of the shell were achieved by immobilizing the reactive Fe3+ ions in a nitrate complex with urea ([Fe((CO(NH2)2)6](NO3)3) and by using solid Mg(OH)2 as the precipitating reagent. The slow thermal decomposition of the complex at 60 °C homogeneously releases the reactive Fe3+ ions into the suspension of the core nanoparticles. The key stage of the process is the thermal hydrolysis of the released Fe3+ ions prior to the addition of Mg(OH)2. The thermal hydrolysis results in the formation of γ-FeOOH, exclusively at the surfaces of the core nanoparticles. After the addition of the solid hydroxide Mg(OH)2, the pH increases and at pH ~ 5.7 the Fe2+ precipitates and reacts with the γ-FeOOH to form magnetic iron oxide with a spinel structure (spinel ferrite) at the surfaces of the core nanoparticles. The proposed low-temperature method for the synthesis of composite nanoparticles is capable of forming well-defined interfaces between the two components, important for the coupling of the different properties. The procedure is environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and appropriate for scaling up to mass production. Graphical abstract" .

Having compared the variations of CI and of the solar 0.05–0.8 nm soft X-ray flux over the period 1986–1995 we did not find any significant correlation between the two quantities.

A drop of a volume fraction of both types of particles after the YAG laser pulse was observed by laser light extinction at a wavelength of 633 nm. The nanoparticle sizes and peak particle temperature were measured by the two-colour time-resolved laser-induced incandescence technique. The dependences of the evaporated part of the particle volume fraction and peak particle temperature on laser fluence, particle size and particle formation conditions have been analysed for the carbon and iron nanoparticles. It was found that the process of carbon nanoparticle vaporisation depended on their size and structure, which varied in different formation conditions. It was assumed that the difference in vaporisation process of iron nanoparticles from the bulk was caused by the change of their size and surface tension leading to higher vapour pressure. It is shown that an equilibrium description of nanoparticle vaporisation in laser-induced incandescence model is not valid at high laser fluence and an essential correction of the description of the vaporisation process is necessary." .

Mosquito control is to enhance the health and quality of life of county residents and visitors through the reduction of mosquito populations. Mosquito control is a serious concern in developing countries like India due to the lack of general awareness, development of resistance, and socioeconomic reasons. Today, nanotechnology is a promising research domain which has a wide ranging application in vector control programs. These are nontoxic, easily available at affordable prices, biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific activities against different species of vector mosquitoes. In the present study, larvicidal activity of aqueous leaf extract and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using C. asiatica plant leaves against late third instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The range of varying concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 μg/mL) and aqueous leaf extract (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 μg/mL) were tested against the larvae of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. The synthesized AgNPs from C. asiatica were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract in three important vector mosquito species. The results were recorded from UV–Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis (EDX). Considerable mortality was evident after the treatment of C. asiatica for all three important vector mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values of C. asiatica aqueous leaf extract appeared to be effective against An. stephensi (LC50, 90.17 μg/mL; LC90, 165.18 μg/mL) followed by Ae. aegypti (LC50, 96.59 μg/mL; LC90, 173.83 μg/mL) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC50, 103.08 μg/mL; LC90, 183.16 μg/mL). Synthesized AgNPs against the vector mosquitoes of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90 values: An. stephensi had LC50 and LC90 values of 17.95 and 33.03 μg/mL; Ae. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of 19.32 and 34.87 μg/mL; and Cx. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of 20.92 and 37.41 μg/mL. No mortality was observed in the control. These results suggest that the leaf aqueous extracts of C. asiatica and green synthesis of silver nanoparticles have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus. This is the first report on the mosquito larvicidal activity of the plant extracts and synthesized AgNPs." .

The main problem of this methodology is to get a good adhesion between the graphene and the target substrate that ensures both protection and interaction. In this paper, we analyze the capability of graphene to adapt to underlying simple and complex substrates. We observe the important adhesion differences depending on the graphene thickness and the target substrate roughness. We take advantage of graphene coatings to protect different materials from high current densities, mechanical frictions and oxidation.

We then inject artificially generated noise into a massively parallel system and measure its influence on the performance of collective operations.

Considering the expertise on the processing of silicon, various implementations of silicon counterparts of these nanoscale components such as silicon nanotubes and silicene nanoribbons have also been reported recently. In this work, electronic transport properties of metallic graphene and silicene nanoribbons (GNRs and SiNRs) are compared. Ab initio simulations based on density functional theory combined with non-equilibrium Green’s function formalism are used to obtain the voltage-dependent transmission spectra, resistance–voltage variations and the potential profiles of realistic metallic GNR and SiNR samples. The investigation of the variations of the transmission characteristics of the GNRs and SiNRs exposes that both nano structures show voltage-dependent resistances due to elastic potential scattering compliant with Büttiker formalism. However, the variation of the transmission spectra of GNRs by the applied voltage is lower than that of SiNRs indicating that metallic GNRs seem to be better candidates compared to their silicon counterparts for use as metallic interconnects." .

It is known to be an effective mosquito control agent. In the present study, we have synthesized the silver and gold nanoparticles using C. tropicum. These nanoparticles have been characterized through Microscan reader, X-ray diffractometer, transmission electron microscopy, and further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The characterization study confirmed the spherical shape and size (2–15 and 20–50 nm) of gold and silver nanoparticles. These silver and gold nanoparticles have been tested as a larvicide against the Aedes aegypti larvae. The larvicidal efficacy was noted when performed against all instars of A. aegypti at six different log concentrations, and significant results could be observed. The gold nanoparticles used as an efficacy enhancer have shown mortality at three times higher concentration than the silver nanoparticles. The larval mortality was observed after different time of exposures. The mortality values were obtained using the probit analysis. The larvae of A. aegypti were found to be highly susceptible for the silver nanoparticles. The second instar larvae have shown 100% mortality against the silver nanoparticles after 1 h, whereas the first, third, and fourth instars have shown efficacy (LC50 = 3.47, 4, and 2; LC90 = 12.30, 8.91, and 4; LC99 = 13.18, 13.18, and 7.58, respectively) after 1 h.

Only the surface energy density of bulk materials and the surface relaxation parameter are involved, instead of the surface elastic constants in the classical surface elasticity theory. Two kinds of nanowires with different boundary conditions are discussed. It is demonstrated that the new continuum theory can predict the buckling behavior of nanowires very well. Similar to the prediction of the classical elasticity theory, the critical compressive load of axial buckling of nanowires predicted by the new continuum theory increases with an increasing characteristic length, such as the diameter or height of nanowires. With the same aspect ratio, a nanowire with a rectangular cross section possesses a larger critical buckling load than that with a circular one. However, the surface effect could enhance the critical buckling load not only for a fixed–fixed nanowire but also for a cantilevered one in contrast to the classical elastic model. All the results predicted by the new continuum theory agree well with predictions by the surface elasticity models. The present research not only verifies the validation of the new continuum theory, but also gives a much more convenient characterization of buckling behaviors of nanowires. This should be helpful for the design of nanodevices based on nanomaterials, for example, nanobeams in NEMS or high-precision instruments." .

For neat liquids at high densities such clustering might account for the strong orientational correlations which have been observed in numerical simulations. Three examples are given to illustrate the far infrared spectroscopic properties of such microclusters: the fundamental modes of libration of linear “dimer” and “trimer”, and an adiabatic rotational mode in a seven dipoles cluster. In the latter example the rotational motions are concerted so that no potential barrier exist along a complete rotational cycle; consequently the corresponding absorption should extend over the thermal free rotation spectral region. Such an absorption has been recently observed by F.I.R. spectroscopy in liquid methyl chloride." .

The authors also investigated the histological impact of non-radiolabeled oMWCNT or GONP as they passed through systemic circulation and their excretion pathways in comparison to co-exposure groups of both (oMWCNTs and GONP). Results indicated that oMWCNTs were mainly excreted through feces rather than urine. From the blood, oMWCNTs first entered the stomach, then intestines via chyme, and were finally excreted in feces. GONP also followed this pathway, but could also be excreted through urine when co-exposed with oMWCNTs. In summary, the biodistribution patterns and excretion rates of the nanomaterials in vivo depended on their composition and chemical modifications. A new mechanism is proposed to explain how chemical modification groups affect the behavior of nanomaterials in vivo. The behavior and fate of GONP depended strongly on oMWCNTs in mice in vivo, but the GONP did not affect deeply biodistribution and excretion pattern of oMWCNTs in co-exposure." .

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to study the oxygen functionalities in graphene oxide and in reduced graphene oxide. Graphene-doped TiO2 thin films were coated by sol-gel routed spin coating technique and characterized by ultraviolet-visible, photoluminescence analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction studies, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of blocking layer on the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells was studied using the photocurrent-voltage characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The studies indicated that the titania-graphene composite thin film worked as both blocking layer and ohmic contact between porous TiO2 and fluorine-doped tin oxide glass improved the overall device performance by reducing the interfacial resistance which in turn depends on the doping concentration of graphene in TiO2.

The AuNPs/rGO nanocomposite was synthesized by co-reduction of Au(III) and graphene oxide and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The response of the modified GCE to melamine was investigated by using hexacyanoferrate as an electrochemical reporter. It is found that the electrochemical response to hexacyanoferrate is increasingly suppressed by increasing concentration of melamine. This is attributed to competitive adsorption of melamine at the AuNP/rGO composite through the interaction between the amino groups of melamine and the AuNPs. The presence of rGO, in turn, provides a platform for a more uniform distribution of the AuNPs and enhances the electron transfer rate of the redox reaction. The findings were used to develop a sensitive method for the determination of melamine. Under optimized conditions, the redox peak current of hexacyanoferrate at a working voltage of 171 mV (vs. SCE) is linearly related to the concentration of melamine in 5.0 to 50 nM range. The method was successfully applied to the determination of melamine in food contact materials.

The use of plants in the synthesis of nanoparticles emerges as a cost effective and eco-friendly approach. A green synthetic route for the production of stable silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) by using aqueous silver nitrate as metal precursor and Artocarpus elasticus stem bark extract act both as reductant and stabilizer is being reported for the first time. ResultsThe resultant Ag-NPs were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, powder X-Ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR). The morphological study by TEM and SEM shows resultant Ag-NPs in spherical form with an average size of 5.81 ± 3.80, 6.95 ± 5.50, 12.39 ± 9.51, and 19.74 ± 9.70 nm at 3, 6, 24, and 48 h. Powder X-ray diffraction showed that the particles are crystalline in nature, with a face-centered cubic structure. The FT-IR spectrum shows prominent peaks appeared corresponds to different functional groups involved in synthesizing Ag-NPs. ConclusionsAg-NPs were synthesized using a simple and biosynthetic method by using methanolic extract of A. elasticus under room temperature, at different reaction time. The diameters of the biosynthesis Ag-NPs depended on the time of reaction. Thus, with the increase of reaction time in the room temperature the size of Ag-NPs increases. From the results obtained in this effort, one can affirm that A. elasticus can play an important role in the bioreduction and stabilization of silver ions to Ag-NPs.Graphical abstract:Figure illustrates stabilization of silver nanoparticles after formation by A. elasticus stem bark extract." .

In this paper, effects of optical and material properties on the performance of three different types of photonic crystal based mechanical sensors, i.e., force, displacement, and strain sensors, are investigated. The microcantilevers of sensors are made in Si and Si/SiO2 and exhibited in air and water atmosphere. As we found, both the resonant wavelength and the resonant wavelength shift for microcantilever mechanical sensors exhibit a linear relationship to the signal detection parameters (i.e., force, displacement, and strain) both in air and water. The sensitivity of force and strain sensors operated in water is higher than that in air. Si/SiO2 bilayer microcantilever sensor shows a higher sensitivity in force detection, whereas the Si cantilever sensor shows a higher sensitivity in strain and vertical displacement detection. The optical, material and mechanical properties of sensor material have great effect on the sensitivity of the new photonic crystal based microcantilever mechanical sensor." .

On the basis of the experimental results, we discuss the transitional process from the spherical shape to the cylindrical shape in the growth model of ncSi crystallization. The constrained effect for the crystal growth increases with a decrease of the aSi sublayer thickness.

A polysaccharide, dextran, was chosen as the vector of plasmid DNA-encoded NK4 that acts as an HGF-antagonist and anti-angiogenic regulator for inhibitions of tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Spermine (Sm) was chemically introduced to the hydroxyl groups of dextran to obtain dextran-Sm. When Fe2+ solution was added to the mixture of dextran-Sm and a plasmid DNA, homogenous DNA nanoparticles were formed via chemical metal coordination bonding with average size of 230 nm. Characterization of DNA nanoparticles was performed via dynamic light scattering measurement, electrophoretic light scattering measurement, as well as transmission electron microscope. DNA nanoparticles effectively condensed plasmid DNA into nanoparticles and enhanced the stability of DNA, while significantly improved transfection efficiency in vitro and tumor accumulation in vivo. In addition, magnetic DNA nanoparticles exhibited high efficiency in antitumor therapy with regards to tumor growth as well as survival of animals evaluated in the presence of external magnetic field. We conclude that the magnetic properties of these DNA nanoparticles would enhance the tracking of non-viral gene delivery systems when administrated in vivo in a test model. These findings suggest that DNA nanoparticles effectively deliver DNA to tumor and thereby inhibiting tumor growth." .

Review discusses cytotoxic to neurotoxic effects of CuO, ZnO, and TiO2 nanoparticles based on the scenario drawn from various in vitro and in vivo studies. ENPs such as TiO2 and ZnO NPs have great practical importance in industrial applications. CuO NPs is also widely used in biomedical applications as catalyst supports, drug carriers, and gene delivery. However, study conducted on TiO2 NPs have forecast that oxidative DNA damage could be attributed due to reduced glutathione levels with concomitant increase in lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, there are many evidences showing that ZnO NP and CuO NPs generates ROS production and can cause cell death in different types of cultured cell.

This indicates a bright future for nanomedicine in treating neurological diseases in clinics. However, the effects of nanoparticles per se in inducing neurotoxicology by altering amino acid neurotransmitters, if any, are still being largely ignored. The main aim of nanomedicine is to enhance the drug availability within the central nervous system (CNS) for greater therapeutic successes. However, once the drug together with nanoparticles enters into the CNS compartments, the fate of nanomaterial within the brain microenvironment is largely remained unknown. Thus, to achieve greater success in nanomedicine, our knowledge in understanding nanoneurotoxicology in detail is utmost important. In addition, how co-morbidity factors associated with neurological disease, e.g., stress, trauma, hypertension or diabetes, may influence the neurotherapeutic potentials of nanomedicine are also necessary to explore the details. Recent research in our laboratory demonstrated that engineered nanoparticles from metals or titanium nanowires used for nanodrug delivery in laboratory animals markedly influenced the CNS functions and alter amino acid neurotransmitters in healthy animals. These adverse reactions of nanoparticles within the CNS are further aggravated in animals with different co-morbidity factors viz., stress, diabetes, trauma or hypertension. This effect, however, depends on the composition and dose of the nanomaterials used. On the other hand, nanodrug delivery by TiO2 nanowires enhanced the neurotherapeutic potential of the parent compounds in CNS injuries in healthy animals and do not alter amino acids balance. However, in animals with any of the above co-morbidity factors, high dose of nanodrug delivery is needed to achieve some neuroprotection. Taken together, it appears that while exploring new nanodrug formulations for neurotherapeutic purposes, co-morbidly factors and composition of nanoparticles require more attention. Furthermore, neurotoxicity caused by nanoparticles per se following nanodrug delivery may be examined in greater detail with special regards to changes in amino acid balance in the CNS." .

From the correlation between XMCD and dc magnetic measurements (Verwey transition) the presence of non-stoichiometric magnetite in Ag@Fe3O4 nanoparticle systems was confirmed. From the spin and orbital contribution to the total magnetic moment, we conclude that the sample with less Ag seeds particle concentration presents a non-quenched orbital contribution.

The simple and low-cost fabrication process combined with large displacement capability of the membrane is favorable for use in disposable fluidic devices. Passivated ferromagnetic cobalt nanoparticles (~37 nm) synthesized by the chemical route were embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to fabricate nano-composite flexible membranes. Magneto-mechanical and mechanical properties of the PDMS composite elastomeric membrane loaded with various concentrations of cobalt (Co) nanoparticles (between 15 and 75 % by weight) were studied. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements of the nano-composite membranes were conducted as a function of the applied frequency (between 0.1 and 56 Hz). With higher concentration (50-wt%) of Co nanoparticles in PDMS, the elastic modulus was increased by 3–4 times as compared with that of membranes with lower concentrations of nanoparticles. Shore hardness was maximum for the nano-composite membrane loaded with 50-wt% of Co nanoparticles. A fluidic actuator with 400 μm thick PDMS membrane of 18 mm free diameter loaded with 50-wt% Co nanoparticles was manufactured and tested under external magnetic field. In the region where the magnetic field gradient is highest, high deflection of the membrane could be obtained (0.68 mm for 1 Tesla). However some hysteresis of the membrane deflection could be observed, even at very low frequency. Loading of PDMS with Co nanoparticles allowed a wider range of control of the wetting properties of PDMS surfaces under oxygen plasma treatment, from hydrophobic to hydrophilic to super-hydrophilic.

Two lymphocyte fractions separated on density seem to have different characteristics, both morphologically and immunologically. In this study these two fractions have been characterized ultrastructurally by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and a relationship has been established between the surface architecture (SEM), the cell size (SEM/TEM) and surface-Ig/C3-receptors (LM, light microscopy). Finally three types of lymphocytes have been described in the two lymphocyte fractions separated on density. Morphometric information such as cell size, cell shape, eu-/heterochromatin ratio in the nucleus and the nucleus-/cell ratio have been correlated to the stage of activation of the B lymphocyte in a representative density separation." .

The novelty of these nanoparticles is that the hydrophobic environment in the pores allows for facile immobilization of drugs that are not freely soluble in water. This was demonstrated by loading the pores of the nanoparticles with either the antibiotic chlortetracycline (ctcl) or the anticancer drug chlorambucil (cmbl). The structural and magnetic properties of the resulting drug-nanoparticle complexes were extensively characterized by various techniques which revealed that they were both paramagnetic and highly ordered, and had an excellent drug-loading capacity. Gradual release of both chlortetracycline and chlorambucil was demonstrated by studying their release profiles. The profiles for both GdSiO–ctcl and GdSiO–cmbl nanoparticles and their paramagnetic properties show that these species are appropriate candidates for controlled drug delivery, particularly in combination with MRI studies." .

The silver nanoparticles were dispersed in polar liquids (distilled water and ethylene glycol) without any other reducing agent, in the presence of the stabilizer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The optical properties, thermal properties, and morphology of the synthesized silver particles were characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, photopyroelectric technique, and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that for the both solvents, the effect of microwave irradiation was mainly on the particles distribution, rather than the size, which enabled to make stable and homogeneous silver nanofluids. The individual spherical nanostructure of self-assembled nanoparticles has been formed during microwave irradiation. Ethylene glycol solution, due to its special properties, such as high dielectric loss, high molecular weight, and high boiling point, can serve as a good solvent for microwave heating and is found to be a more suitable medium than the distilled water. A photopyroelectric technique was carried out to measure thermal diffusivity of the samples. The precision and accuracy of this technique was established by comparing the measured thermal diffusivity of the distilled water and ethylene glycol with values reported in the literature. The thermal diffusivity ratio of the silver nanofluids increased up to 1.15 and 1.25 for distilled water and ethylene glycol, respectively." .

Efficiencies of particle collection by fibers have been calculated as depending on the number of rows of fibers in a wide range of Peclet numbers. It has been shown that the effect of a diffusion wake after a fiber on the nanoparticle deposition in highly porous filters with the three-dimensional structure is less pronounced than that in filters with a two-dimensional structure. Moreover, at a packing density of three-dimensional filters below 0.05, the effect of the diffusion wake may be ignored. The double hexagonal model has been proposed to be used as an adequate model of real fibrous filters." .

The responses of the sensors to NO2 at room temperature increased significantly with increasing UV illumination intensity. The underlying mechanisms for the enhanced response of the ZnS nanowire sensor to NO2 gas by CuO decoration and UV irradiation are discussed." .

We present a one-pot synthesis for the selective preparation of phase-pure clinoatacamite (Cu2(OH)3Cl) and cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticles by controlling the pH of the solution. The effect of pH on the phase of the product was systematically investigated utilizing 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer. Here, the MES buffer was crucial for the synthesis. It not only allowed for selective synthesis by controlling pH but also guided the morphology of the CuO nanoparticles. In addition, it directed the growth of Cu2(OH)3Cl to provide pure clinoatacamite without the presence of related polymorphs. The products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible light spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Infrared spectroscopy was essential for characterization of closely related polymorphs of Cu2(OH)3Cl indistinguishable by XRD. A plausible mechanism has been proposed and discussed for the formation of the CuO and Cu2(OH)3Cl nanostructures." .

However, despite of these advantages over conventional methods, some limitations in sensitivity and selectivity still exist in microfluidic systems. Recently advancements in nanotechnology offer some new approaches for the detection of target analytes with high sensitivity and selectivity. As a result, it is an appropriate method to enhance the detection sensitivity through a combination between microfluidic system and nanotechnology. Optical detection is a dominant technique in microfluidics because of its noninvasive nature and easy coupling. Numerous studies that integrate optical microfluidic system with nanotechnology have been reported in recent years. Therefore, optical microfluidic systems in combination with nanomaterials (NMs) are reviewed in our work. We illustrate the functions of different NMs in optical microfluidic systems and the efforts of different researchers to improve the performance of devices. After the introduction of different nanoparticle-based optical detection methods, challenges and future directions in the development of nanoparticle-based optical detection schemes in microfluidics have also been discussed." .

In order to exploit this effect, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for Cys was covalently linked to the QDs via allyl mercaptan. The resulting nanomaterials (QDs, MIP-coated QDs, and nonimprint-coated QDs) were characterized by FTIR and scanning electron microscopy. The adsorption of Cys was studied in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with respect to equilibration times (5, 15, and 40 min, respectively), binding constants [2.98, 2.42, and 0.96 (×104 M−1)], and Langmuir isotherms (R2 = 0.9995, 0.9999, and 0.9983) in the Cys concentration range between 3.33 μM to 500 μM. The method has a detection limit of 0.85 μM (3σ, blank, for n = 10). The selectivity of the MIP-coated QDs for Cys over 19 other amino acids is similar to that of bare QDs, but MIP-QDs afford better recoveries of Cys from solutions also containing bovine serum albumin (90 %) and fetal bovine serum (97 %), respectively, when compared to the recoveries that are obtained with bare (non-imprinted) QDs (135 % and 120 %). This is probably due to the fact that the outer MIP shell largely reduces protein wrapping, dot aggregation, and matrix inclusion. FigureUsing the turn-on fluorescence detection of cysteine template, quantum dots (QDs) conjugated with MIP via allyl mercaptan were synthesized in a one-pot polymerization and exhibited a higher binding selectivity in the presence of serum matrices compared to bare QDs and non-imprinted polymer-QDs." .

They are usually synthesized by the reduction of gold(III) chloride. However, the presence of halide ions in the reaction mixture is not always welcome. In some cases, these ions have detrimental influence on the morphology and structure of resulting nanoparticles. Here, we present a simple and halogen-free procedure to prepare gold nanoparticles by reduction of gold(III) oxide in neat oleylamine. The method provides the particles with an average size below 10 nm and dispersity of tens of percent. The process of nanoparticle formation was monitored using UV–Vis spectroscopy. The structure and chemical composition of the nanoparticles was determined by SEM, XPS and EDX. We also proposed the mechanism of reduction of gold(III) oxide based on MS, IR and NMR data. Importantly, the synthetic protocol is general and applicable for the preparation of other coinage metal nanoparticles from the corresponding metal oxides. For instance, we demonstrated that the absence of halogen enables efficient alloying of metals when preparing gold–silver bimetallic nanoparticles." .

According to our analysis, Young’s modulus ratio of the armchair membrane to the zigzag NPG membrane decreases with an increase in porosity.

The aim was to explore factors determining nanoparticle formation and crystallinity. The amino acid nanoparticles have been prepared at different saturation conditions in the aerosol reactor. In a condensed state, the particles were formed by droplet drying. The raise in temperature induced the sublimation of amino acids from the aerosol particles. The amino acid vapor was condensed by physical vapor deposition in a rapid cooling process. The diffusion coefficients and nucleation rates of amino acids have been calculated to understand particle formation. Upon the vapor deposition, amino acids formed crystalline nanoparticles except in the case l-phenylalanine according to X-ray diffraction. The crystal polymorph of glycine in the nanoparticles depended on the applied reactor temperature. The preference of crystallographic orientation varied in both the particle formations from condensed and vapor phase. l-Valine, l-phenylalanine, and l-leucine formed leafy-looking particles.

The distribution of CNTs across the thickness of the face sheets may be uniform or functionally graded. The equivalent single- layer theory of Timoshenko is used to construct the Hamiltonian of the beam under the von Kármán type of geometrical nonlinearity assumptions. A uniform temperature field through the beam is also included in the formulation. The Ritz method with polynomial basis functions is used to discrete the equations of motion and establish the matrix representation of the governing equations. A nonlinear eigenvalue problem is obtained and solved using a standard continuation procedure. After validating the developed solution method and formulation, parametric studies are conducted to examine the influences of thermal environment, core thickness-to-face sheet thickness ratio, boundary conditions, amplitude of vibrations, CNTs volume fraction and their distribution pattern. It is concluded that an increase in the volume fraction of CNTs results in higher fundamental frequency and decreases the nonlinear-to-linear frequency ratio." .

At the same time, the toxic effects of these nanoparticles on human and fish cells have also been observed; therefore, their release and distribution into the surface and subsurface environment is a subject of concern. The aim of this research is to evaluate and compare the transports and retentions of two types of engineered nanoparticles (multiwalled carbon nanotubes and C60) and the natural carbon nanoparticles collected from a fire accident. Several laboratory experiments were conducted to observe the transport behavior of nanoparticles through a column packed with silica sand. The column experiments were intended to monitor the effect of ionic strength on transport of nanoparticles as a function of their shapes. It was observed that the mobilities of both types of engineered nanoparticles were reduced with the increasing ionic strength from 1.34 to 60 mM. However, at ionic strengths up to 10.89 mM, spherical nanoparticles were more mobile than cylindrical nanoparticles, but the mobility of the cylindrical nanoparticles became significantly higher than spherical nanoparticles at the ionic strength of 60 mM. In comparison with natural fire-born nanoparticles, both types of engineered nanoparticles were much less mobile under the selected experimental condition in this study. Furthermore, inverse modeling was used to calculate parameters such as attachment efficiency, the longitudinal dispersivity, and capacity of the solid phase for the attachment of nanoparticles. The results indicate that the combination of the shape and the solution chemistry of the NPs are responsible for the transport and the retention of nanoparticles in natural environment; however, fire-burned nanoparticles can be highly mobile at the natural groundwater chemistry." .

This index is explained because the silver oxide shell modifies the local surrounding medium of the metallic nanoparticles." .

Although much is known about how characteristics depend on nanotube chirality and diameter, relatively little is known about how the photoinduced current depends on CNT length. We showed here that photoinduced current generated on a large-area multiwalled CNT forests exhibits a strong dependence on nanotube length. Photoinduced current of MWNTs in different temperature and atmosphere pressure was also discussed. The results showed that the long nanotubes significantly reduced photoinduced current, due to more gas in nanotube network inhibiting the photocurrent generation." .

Firstly, based on the Galerkin approximation method, a Duffing-type model is derived from the equation of motion that describes the oscillation of the embedded single-walled carbon nanotube clamped at both ends under a transverse load. And then, the Melnikov function of the Duffing-type model is derived. From the Melnikov function, the analytical condition of the chaos in the nanotube is obtained. Finally, a structure-preserving difference scheme for the original oscillating model is constructed based on the generalized multi-symplectic framework and the chaotic vibration of the nanotube is reproduced to verify the accuracy and the validity of the analytical condition. The analytical condition obtained in this paper gives some guidance on the property studying and the structure designing of some carbon nanotube devices." .

The significant increase in voltammetric responses for pre-adsorbed alizarin compared with those for solution confirms high affinity of alizarin to carbon nanoparticles (possibly due to π–π stacking interaction between aromatic rings of alizarin and surface-sulfonated carbon nanoparticles). To obtain the optimum of adsorption conditions, the effects of pH, agitation rate, and adsorption time are investigated. Under square wave voltammetry conditions, the peak current for the reduction of alizarin shows a linear relationship with concentration in the range from 2.0 to 10.0 nM. The limit of detection is estimated 5.8 × 10−9 mol L−1. Next, alizarin is applied as a receptor for sensing of trace vanadium in acetate buffer pH 5. Linear calibration curves are obtained for vanadium in the range of 1.0 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−4 mol L−1 and the limit of detection is estimated 9.6 × 10−8 mol L−1. Determination of vanadium in real samples such as sea and tap water is demonstrated." .

Some of the advantages made magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an exclusive modality. Gd-DTPA is one of the most common contrast agents in clinical applications. In this study, the concentrations of three gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents were measured and quantification accuracy of these contrast agents by MRI method was investigated. Different concentrations from the Gd-DTPA, Gd2O3–DEG and paramagnetoliposome nanoparticles (encapsulated Gd2O3–DEG nanoparticles in liposome) samples were prepared. Physical characteristics of the contrast agents were investigated by DLS and TEM methods. The T 1-weighted images of the prepared samples were recorded using MRI scanner. For each sample, gadolinium concentrations were determined using the relaxation rates and relaxivities. Determined concentrations by the experimental and ICP/OES methods were compared and the standard errors of the results were determined. Morphology, dimension and hydrodynamic diameter of the contrast agents were investigated. The hydrodynamic diameter of Gd2O3–DEG and PML nanoparticles were 90 ± 7.2 nm (with PdI = 0.328) and 96.8 ± 6.5 nm (with PdI = 0.299), respectively. In assessment of gadolinium concentrations, standard deviations of the experimental and ICP/OES data were ranged from 0.007 to 0.04. P values of all data points were higher than 0.05 that confirm there is no significant difference between the experimental and ICP/OES measurements. From the results, it could be concluded that MR systems could be used as an accurate and available method to estimate gadolinium concentrations." .

We applied indirect immunolabeling with polyclonal antibodies against phytochrome from etiolated oat seedlings or polyclonal antibodies against ubiquitin from rabbit reticulocytes, together with a goldcoupled second antibody, on serial ultrathin sections of resin-embedded material. Immediately after a 5-min pulse of red light-converting phytochrome from the red-absorbing (Pr) to the far-redabsorbing (Pfr) form-the label for phytochrome was found to be sequestered in electron-dense areas. For up to 2 h after irradiation, the size of these areas increased with increasing dark periods. The ubiquitin label was found in the same electrondense areas only after a dark period of 30 min. A 5 min pulse of far-red light, which reverts Pfr to Pr, given immediately after the red light did not cause the electron-dense structures to disappear; moreover, they contained the phytochrome label immediately after the far-red pulse. In contrast, after the reverting far-red light pulse, ubiquitin could only be visualised in the electron-dense areas after prolonged dark periods (i.e. 60 min). The relevance of these data to light-induced phytochrome pelletability and to the destruction of both Pr and Pfr is discussed." .

The acrosomal region contains a granule measuring 0.7 μ in diameter which consists of electron dense material arranged in concentric lamellae. Five concentric very electron dense lamellae alternate with areas of much less electron dense material in the central region of the granule. This granule rests in an anterior nuclear depression. The nucleus is circular in shape and contains one or two unbound vacuoles which frequently contain a fine granular material. Posteriorly the nucleus is bounded by a large mitochondrion and an occasional Golgi complex. The proximal centriole which contains a lateral arm of dense material lies in a deep fossa projecting into the nucleus. The distal centriole lies posteriorly in the mitochondrial mass and gives rise to nine satellite projections and their Y-shaped connective extensions.

Recent advances in the synthesis and production of nanoparticles have enabled the production of environmentally responsive surface-modified nanoparticles with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface groups. These nanoparticles act like colloidal surfactants. In this paper, environmentally responsive surface-modified silica nanoparticles are synthesized and used for enhancement of oil recovery. For this purpose, silica nanoparticles are coated with polyethylene glycol chains as hydrophilic agent and propyl chains as hydrophobic agent at various quantities, and their ability to modulate oil–water interface properties and oil recovery is examined. Oil–water interfacial tension and water surface tension are decreased by 50 % in the presence of silica nanoparticles coated with both agents. Measuring oil-drop contact angle on oil-wetted glass slides and carbonate rock sections, after aging in various surface-modified silica nanofluids, indicates that the wettability of various oil-wetted surfaces is modified from strongly oil-wet to water-wet. Flooding nanofluids to glass micro-models and pore-level investigations demonstrate that surface modification of silica nanoparticles, specially, with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents improves considerably their performance in increasing oil recovery and wettability alteration." .

Also, antifungal activity against Candida species with resistance to fluconazole was evaluated through determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC50) according to protocol M27-A3 of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Minimum Fungicide Concentration (MFC). This study was carried out with strains Candida krusei and Candida glabrata. As a result, the formation of spherical nanoparticles was obtained with mean sizes of 19 nm and positive surface charge. Values of MIC50 were 0.1 µg ml−1 AgNPs for the studied species, and MFC were 0.25 and 0.5 µg ml−1 for C. glabrata and C. krusei, respectively. The AgNPs synthesized showed cytotoxic effect in 50 % of Murine Fibroblast Cells (CC50) at a mean concentrations of 10 µg ml−1 (100 times higher than MIC50).

It is a material with a high dielectric constant, low leakage current, and some of its properties can be changed by adding or modifying the concentration of a dopant, which can be used for a wide range of functional purposes, from simple capacitors to complicated microwave devices. Therefore, in this work, we report the development of a new route to synthesize SrTiO3 nanoparticles based on the solvothermal method by employing two precursor solutions: strontium chloride and titanium(IV) butoxide. Our route allows the production of cubic SrTiO3 nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The particle sizes range between 8 and 24 nm, forming agglomerates of SrTiO3 in the range of 128–229 nm. It was demonstrated that the Ti/Sr molar ratio employed into the precursor solution has an important effect onto the chemical composition of the resulting SrTiO3 nanoparticles: when using Ti/Sr < 1, the formation and incorporation of the SrCO3 compound into the nanoparticles was observed while with Ti/Sr ≥ 1 nanoparticles are free of contaminants. The as-prepared nanoparticles were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution TEM, selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering." .

MethodsDoxorubicin was conjugated to Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which was formulated into nanoparticle via solvent-diffusion method. The surface of the nanoparticles was subsequently linked with Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide to realize both passive and active targeting functions. The multifunctional nanoparticles were then tested against several malignant cancer cell lines. ResultsThe conjugation increased loading efficiency of doxorubicin to PLGA nanoparticles (the encapsulation efficiency was over 85%) and alleviated the drug burst release effect substantially. The drug was released from the polymeric matrix in a sustained release manner over a period of 12 days. The resultant nanoparticles were spherically uniform and well-dispersed. The nanoparticle targeting ability was proven through strong affinity to various integrin-expressing cancer cells, and much less affinity to the low integrin expression cancer cells. The nanoparticles also showed high efficacy in inducing apoptosis in specific malignant cancer cell.

Several attempts have been made in the latest decades to finely control actin production and polymerization, in order to promote certain cell responses. In this paper we demonstrate the possibility of modulating F/G-actin ratio and mechanical properties of normal human dermal fibroblasts by using boron nitride nanotubes dispersed in the culture medium and by stimulating them with ultrasound transducers. Increasing concentrations of nanotubes were tested with the cells, without any evidence of cytotoxicity up to 10 μg/ml concentration of nanoparticles. Cells treated with nanoparticles and ultrasound stimulation showed a significantly higher F/G-actin ratio in comparison with the controls, as well as a higher Young’s modulus. Assessment of Cdc42 activity revealed that actin nucleation/polymerization pathways, involving Rho GTPases, are probably influenced by nanotube-mediated stimulation, but they do not play a primary role in the significant increase of F/G-actin ratio of treated cells, such effect being mainly due to actin overexpression." .

The effect of pulse duration, number of pulses, and total process time on pore filling was investigated for porous Si with different porosities and porous Si layer thicknesses in the above thickness range. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the samples. It was found that pore filling starts with Ni nucleation and nanoparticle formation at different points of the pore walls along the whole pore length and continues with nanoparticle coalescence to form continuous Ni nanowires that completely fill the pores. The mechanism involved in pore filling is particle nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth of Ni nanoparticles that coalesce to nanowires. From the beginning of the process, a metal film starts to form on the porous Si surface, and its thickness increases with increasing the process time. However, the presence of this film does not impede further pore filling and nanowire formation into the pores. This supports further the diffusion-controlled growth mechanism. Finally, it was demonstrated that full pore filling and continuous Ni nanowire formation were also achieved under direct current electrodeposition, and the results are quite similar to those obtained with pulsed electrodeposition when the same total deposition time is used in both cases." .

With increasing the density of the Ag nanoparticles, the SPR wavelength shows a redshift from less than 400 nm to more than 570 nm. The tuning of the SPR wavelength is found to correlate to the increase of the fraction of closely spaced nanoparticle pairs that are near-field coupled with the deposition mass. The coverage dependent SPR properties are also compared with the results from discrete dipole approximation (DDA) calculations." .

When reflectance from optically linear and nonlinear Maxwell Garnett nanoparticles was calculated it was observed that the reflectance, in the case of attenuated total reflection, depends on the fill fraction of the nanospheres and their nonlinear susceptibility. According to simulations a good sensitivity of the nonlinear contribution on the reflectance can be obtained by using a probe wavelength corresponding to the resonance frequency of the nanosphere system. In Kretchmann#x0027;s configuration it was observed that the surface-plasmon-resonance angle depends on the fill fraction and on the intensity of the incident light.

They are intended for use in the detection of the foodborne bacterial pathogens Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were doped with FITC and Ru(bpy), conjugated to the respective antibodies, and then used in a conventional lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Fluorescence was recorded by inserting the nitrocellulose strip into a smart phone-based fluorimeter consisting of a light weight (40 g) optical module containing an LED light source, a fluorescence filter set and a lens attached to the integrated camera of the cell phone in order to acquire high-resolution fluorescence images. The images were analysed by exploiting the quick image processing application of the cell phone and enable the detection of pathogens within few minutes. This LFIA is capable of detecting pathogens in concentrations as low as 105 cfu mL−1 directly from test samples without pre-enrichment. The detection is one order of magnitude better compared to gold nanoparticle-based LFIAs under similar condition. The successful combination of fluorescent nanoparticle-based pathogen detection by LFIAs with a smart phone-based detection platform has resulted in a portable device with improved diagnosis features and having potential application in diagnostics and environmental monitoring.

However, the vast landscape of possible building blocks makes predicting the final behavior of tethered nanoparticles a priori a challenging task. Concepts from the computer science field of modeling integrated computing may provide an efficient means to optimize this complex design problem. Here, we investigate the use of model integrated computing for the simulation of tethered nanoparticles. We outline our development of a “meta-programming” tool that enables the creation of a domain specific modeling language for tethered nanoparticle simulation and also provides tools for the creation and synthesis of simulation workflows. To test these tools and provide insight into their behavior, we report calculations of the vapor–liquid equilibrium of tethered nanoparticles as a function of grafting density and grafting length." .

The processes of the nanoparticles penetration and accumulation in biotissue are accompanied by the changes in optical properties of skin which affect the OCT images. The continuous OCT monitoring of the process of the nanoparticles penetration into skin showed that these changes appeared in 30 min after application of nanoparticles on the surface; the time of accumulation of maximal nanoparticles concentration in skin was observed in period of 1.5–3 h after application. Numerical processing of the OCT signal exhibited the increase in contrast between upper and lower parts of dermis and contrast decay of the hair follicle border during 60–150 min. The transmission electron microscopy technique confirmed accumulation of the both types of nanoparticles in biotissue.

We focus on the humidity dependency of nanoscale oxidation of graphene. The relations between the oxidation size and the setting values of the AFM, such as the set point, tip speed, and the humidity, are observed. By changing these values, proper parameters were found to produce features with on-demand size. This technique provides an easy way for graphene oxide lithography without any chemical resists. We obtained oxidation sizes down to 50 nm with a 6-nm-high oxide barrier line by using a 0.1-μm/s tip scanning speed. We also obtained micrometer-sized symbols on a graphene flake. We attribute the bumps of oxidized graphene in the graphene layer to local anodic oxidation on graphenes surface and to an incorporation of oxygen ions into the graphene lattice." .

Tryptophan does not require illumination nor heating, and the solution color changes immediately after the mixing of reagents if sodium hydroxide is added to the solution (pH = 10).
