Abstract A composite material obtained by ultrasonication of graphene oxide (GO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was loaded with manganese dioxide (MnO2), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and the resulting multilayer hybrid films were deposited on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The microstructure, composition and electrochemical behavior of the composite and the modified GCE were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectra, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The electrode induces efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of dopamine at a rather low working voltage of 0.22 V (vs. SCE) at neutral pH values. The response is linear in the 0.5 μM to 2.5 mM concentration range, the sensitivity is 233.4 μA·mM‾1·cm‾2, and the detection limit is 0.17 μM at an SNR of 3. The sensor is well reproducible and stable. It displays high selectivity over ascorbic acid, uric acid and glucose even if these are present in comparable concentrations. Graphical abstractGold nanoparticles were self-assembled onto the surface of the MnO2 decorated graphene oxide-carbon nanotubes composites with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as a coupling agent. Further, a sensitive electrochemical sensor of dopamine was developed via immobilizing this nanocomposite on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE).
