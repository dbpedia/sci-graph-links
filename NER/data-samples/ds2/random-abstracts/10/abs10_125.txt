Abstract In this study, Ag nanoparticles were introduced into the titanium oxide (TiO2) photoelectrode to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Ag nanoparticles were synthesized using a chemical reduction method. By varying the concentration of the reducing agent (NaBH4), Ag nanoparticles with different sizes were obtained and discussed. The Ag–TiO2 composite photoelectrode was fabricated using a simple approach by immersing sintered P-25 photoelectrode into the solution containing Ag nanoparticles. The DSSC using Ag–TiO2 composite photoelectrode exhibits better solar conversion efficiency than that using simply TiO2 photoelectrode (P-25). The DSSC efficiency enhances from 2.75 to 5.66% using larger Ag nanoparticle size of 82.7 nm.
