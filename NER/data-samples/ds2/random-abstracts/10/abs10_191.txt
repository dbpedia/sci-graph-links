Abstract The dynamics of vortex structure for polarizations in free-standing ferroelectric nanoparticles has been numerically investigated based on a thermodynamics-based continuum phase field approach under open-circuit boundary conditions. Both size effect and surface effect have been considered in this work: different assumptions for the extrapolation length have been made for the electric boundary condition and therefore accounting for the intrinsic size effect; the surface effect is studied by introducing the intrinsic surface stress, which causes volume mechanical balancing stress in the nanoparticles below free surfaces. The computed results are summarized in this article for square-shaped nanodots. It has been noticed that the particle size and intrinsic surface stress together play significant roles in the dynamics of vortex structure for polarizations. They affect both polarization configuration and existence conditions in ferroelectric nanoparticles.
