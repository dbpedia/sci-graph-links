Abstract Magnetic molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MMIPs) with improved dispersity and an increased number of adsorption sites are described. Uniform silica layers were first deposited on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) in order to improve the dispersity of magnetic nanoparticles. Then, 4-formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA) as functional monomer was immobilized on the magnetic carriers to improve the efficiency of template eluting and rebinding. A thin layer of polyaniline imprinted with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a model glycoprotein was then placed on the magnetic nanoparticles to enhance the dispersity of the resultant MMIPs. These exhibit high adsorption capacity (62 mg g−1), a satisfactory imprinting factor ( 3.78) and short adsorption equilibrium time (40 min) toward HRP, and the limit of detection is 18.7 μg L−1. This kind of MMIPs, therefore, is deemed being a useful tool for extracting low-abundance glycoproteins from even complex samples. Graphical abstractSchematic of the preparation of magnetic molecular imprinted nanoparticles using Fe3O4 nanoparticles as carriers, 4-formylphenylboronic acid as functional monomer, aniline as cross linker and horseradish peroxidase as template. TEOS: tetraethyl orthosilicate; APTES: 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane; FPBA: 4-formylphenylboronic acid; HRP: horseradish peroxidase.
