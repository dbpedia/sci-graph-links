Abstract Forming a monolayer of mixed nickel and gold nanoparticles through self-assembly via simple solution processing constitutes an important step toward inexpensive nanoparticle-based carbon nanofiber growth. In this work, mixed gold and nickel nanoparticles were anchored on the silicon wafer using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as a template. SAMs of 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTS-SAMs) were formed on silicon wafer, with the exposed thiol functionality providing ligand exchange sites to form the mixed monolayer of nickel and gold nanoparticles via a two-step sequential soaking approach. The densities of the nickel and gold nanoparticles on the surface can be varied by adjusting the soaking sequence.
