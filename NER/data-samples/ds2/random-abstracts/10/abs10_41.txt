Abstract Green biosynthesis of nanoparticles and their applications in sensor field is of great interest to the researchers. We report herein a simple green approach for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) using Acacia nilotica Willd twig bark and its application for the detection of 4-nitro phenol (4-NP). The synthesized Ag-NPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis. The size of synthesized Ag-NPs was in the range of 10–50 nm. The Ag-NPs modified electrode shows a high sensitivity and selectivity towards the sensing of 4-NP. The fabricated modified electrode shows a low detection limit of 15 nM on the wider linear response range from 100 nM to 350 μM with the sensitivity of 2.58 ± 0.05 μAμM−1 cm−2. In addition, the fabricated sensor shows good repeatability and reproducibility. FigureThe schematic representation of the fabrication of Ag-NPs and application of 4-nitrophenol sensing
