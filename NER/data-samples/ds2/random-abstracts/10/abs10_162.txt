Abstract Shock compression-induced phase transformations of graphite into carbon dense modifications in cylindrical recovery containers (p shc = 20–36 GPa, T shc = 1800–3500 K) have been studied. The dependences of the lonsdaleite and diamond yields on the compression conditions have been established. The results obtained have been analyzed taking into account the formation mechanisms of the dense phases and special features of their shock-wave synthesis.
