Abstract A nanocomposite consisting of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Fe3O4 nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (CTAB-Fe3O4-rGO) was prepared, characterized, and used to modify the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The voltammetric response of the modified GCE to 4-nonylphenol (NPh) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and revealed a strong peak at around 0.57 V (vs. SCE). Under optimum conditions, the calibration plot is linear in the ranges from 0.03 to 7.0 μM and from 7.0 to 15.0 μM, with a 8 nM detection limit which is lower that that of many other methods. The modified electrode has excellent fabrication reproducibility and was applied to the determination of NPh in spiked real water samples to give recoveries (at a spiking level of 1 μM) between 102.1 and 99.1%.
