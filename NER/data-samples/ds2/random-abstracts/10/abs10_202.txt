Abstract A nanocomposite consisting of helical carbon nanotubes, polyallylamine hydrochloride and CdSe quantum dots was synthesized and used for the electrochemiluminescent determination of dopamine in presence of peroxodisulfate. The nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, UV-absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The electrochemical process was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Under optimized conditions, the ECL intensity decreases linearly with the concentration of dopamine in the 1.0 × 10-9 mol · L-1 to 2.0 × 10-5 mol · L-1 range, with a 0.2 × 10-9 mol · L-1 detection limit. The method represents a rapid, simple and sensitive protocol for the determination of dopamine. Graphical AbstractA glassy carbon electrode was modified with a nanocomposite prepared from helical carbon nanotubes, polyallylamine hydrochloride and CdSe quantum dots, and used for electrochemiluminescent determination of of dopamine.
