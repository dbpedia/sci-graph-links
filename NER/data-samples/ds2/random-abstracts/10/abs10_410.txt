Abstract The properties of CdS nanoparticles synthesized in a polyethylene matrix and an ortho-xylene solution are compared. It is shown that these nanoparticles have different shapes, structures, and degrees of imperfection. Due to these differences, unaggregated nanoparticles in solution exhibit luminescence in contrast to nanoparticles in polyethylene. The stabilization of nanoparticles in polyethylene most probably occurs via OH groups, while nanoparticles in solution are stabilized due to partial interaction with dissolved sulfur. The absorption and luminescence spectra of samples with polyethylene are strongly distorted by reabsorption and scattering, while this effect in solution is absent due to a small concentration of nanoparticles.
