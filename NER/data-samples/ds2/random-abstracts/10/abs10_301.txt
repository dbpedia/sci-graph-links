Abstract Silver (Ag) at 0.1–2.0 wt% was incorporated into cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells as a catalyst for oxygen reduction. A novel processing route for Ag incorporation ensuring a very homogeneous Ag ion distribution is presented. From the results of X-ray powder diffraction it can be concluded that the La0.65Sr0.3MnO3−δ perovskite phase is already formed at 900 °C. The solubility of Ag in the crystal lattice in this type of perovskite was below 1 wt%. The electrochemical tests of these materials show that there is only a slight catalytic effect of Ag. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a low mechanical contact of the cathode grains to the electrolyte due to the low cathode sintering temperature that was chosen.
