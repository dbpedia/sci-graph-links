Abstract A sensitive amperometric hydrogen peroxide (HP) sensor was constructed based on silver nanoparticles/poly(2-(N-morpholine) ethane sulfonic acid) (PMES) modified glassy carbon electrode. PMES and silver nanoparticles were orderly introduced to the surface of the electrode by electrochemical methods and characterized by cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. The fabricated electrode showed a good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of HP with a line range from 0.6 μM to 0.54 mM and a detection limit of 0.18 μM. In addition, the sensor exhibited favorable reproducibility and good long-term stability, and was applied to determine HP in real sample with satisfactory result.
