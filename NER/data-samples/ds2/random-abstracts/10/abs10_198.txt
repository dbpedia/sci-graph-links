Abstract We describe the preparation of a nanohybrid consisting of nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide and CuS nanoparticles (N-rGO/CuS) by in-situ microwave irradiation at weight ratios of 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25. The resulting nanohybrids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR, spectroscopy, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance analysis. It is shown that the CuS nanoparticles are evenly decorated onto the N-rGO surface. The nanohybrids was placed on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) where they showed electro-reductive activity towards picric acid, typically at working voltages between −0.2 and −0.8 V (vs. SCE). Effects of pH value and scan rate were evaluated, and it is shown that two electrons are involved in electro-reduction. The detection limits of the GCE modified with various N-rGO/CuS hybrids (with 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25 wt%) are 6.2, 3.2, and 0.069 μM respectively. The method demonstrates its applicability in sensing of picric acid with good reproducibility. Graphical abstractNitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide nanohybrids was synthesized for the detection of picric acid. A straightforward and preconcentration free analysis of picric acid was successfully demonstrated at nanomolar levels using the nanohybrids.
