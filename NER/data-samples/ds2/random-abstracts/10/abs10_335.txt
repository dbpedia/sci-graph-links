Abstract In this paper, the state-of-the-art progress in research on novel mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials and carbon nanotubes is reviewed. There is evidence that the relation between the strength of nanocrystalline materials and grain size does not observe the classic Hall-Petch plot. Lowtemperature and high-strain rate superplasticity have been found in some nanocrystalline materials. Theoretical prediction and experimental data indicate that carbon nanotubes are materials with high stiffness, high strength, great toughness, and low density. There are already some application examples for novel mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials and carbon nanotubes.
