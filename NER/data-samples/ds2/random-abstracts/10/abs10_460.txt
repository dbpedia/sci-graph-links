Abstract PurposeSeveral individual approaches were combined to fabricate a novel nanoparticulate drug delivery system to achieve targeting and anticancer effects in various malignant cancer cells. MethodsDoxorubicin was conjugated to Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which was formulated into nanoparticle via solvent-diffusion method. The surface of the nanoparticles was subsequently linked with Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide to realize both passive and active targeting functions. The multifunctional nanoparticles were then tested against several malignant cancer cell lines. ResultsThe conjugation increased loading efficiency of doxorubicin to PLGA nanoparticles (the encapsulation efficiency was over 85%) and alleviated the drug burst release effect substantially. The drug was released from the polymeric matrix in a sustained release manner over a period of 12Â days. The resultant nanoparticles were spherically uniform and well-dispersed. The nanoparticle targeting ability was proven through strong affinity to various integrin-expressing cancer cells, and much less affinity to the low integrin expression cancer cells. The nanoparticles also showed high efficacy in inducing apoptosis in specific malignant cancer cell. ConclusionThe developed multifunctional nanoparticles hold potential to treat malignant integrin-expressing cancers.
