Abstract Simple and eco-friendly biosynthesis approach was developed to synthesize silver nanoparticles (SNPs) and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using Ficus racemosa latex as reducing agent. The presence of sunlight is utilized with latex and achieved the nanoparticles whose average size was in the range of 50–120 nm for SNPs and 20–50 nm for GNPs. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by UV/Visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and field emission—scanning electron microscopy techniques toget understand the obtained nanoparticles. The pH-dependent binding studies of SNPs and GNPs with four amino acids, namely l-lysine, l-arginine, l-glutamine and glycin have been reported.
