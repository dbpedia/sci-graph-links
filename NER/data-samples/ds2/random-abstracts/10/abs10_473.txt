Abstract Ni nanoparticles were mass synthesized by solution reduction process successfully. The influence of the parameters on the particle size of Ni nanoparticles were studied and the referential process parameters were obtained. The morphology and structure of the synthesized Ni nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The results show that Ni nanoparticles are of high purity and are covered by hydroxyethyl carboxymethyl cellulose (HECMC) layer and the mean size being about 31 nm. The magnetic measurement revealed that Ni nanoparticles are ferromagnetic.
