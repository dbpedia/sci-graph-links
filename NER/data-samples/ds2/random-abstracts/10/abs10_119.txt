Abstract A new amperometric biosensor for the detection of sugars was prepared. A glassy carbon electrode was modified with Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles protected by chitosan (CS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA), and then gold nanoparticles were assembled onto the electrode followed by the assembly of 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) onto the surface of gold nanoparticles through a sulfur–Au bond to fabricate a self-assembled biosensor. The PB nanoparticles protected by CS and PDDA were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and UV–vis absorption spectroscopy. The characterization of the self-assembled electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The pK a values of the MPBA monolayer before and after combining with sugars were determined. The fabricated electrode exhibited excellent performances for determining d(+)-glucose, d(+)-mannose, and d(−)-fructose on the basis of the change in i p of the Fe(CN)63−/4− ion in the presence of sugars.
