Abstract A simple potentiostatic method was employed to prepare silver nanoparticles deposited on glassy carbon electrode. The silver nanoparticles exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic activities toward the reduction process of chloroacetic acids. The electrochemical behavior of trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and monochloroacetic acid has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry at the silver nanoparticles-modified glassy carbon electrode in 0.1Â M LiClO4 solution; each compound exhibits a series of reduction peaks which represent sequential dechlorination steps up to acetic acid. The electrocatalytic dechlorination mechanism for chloroacetic acids was also discussed in this work.
