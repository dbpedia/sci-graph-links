Abstract In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of high efficiencies tandem solar cells monolithically grown on a silicon substrate using GaAsPN absorber layer. InGaAs(N) quantum dots and GaAsPN quantum wells have been grown recently on GaP/Si susbstrate for applications related to light emission. For photovoltaic applications, we consider the GaAsPN diluted nitride alloy as the top junction material due to both its perfect lattice matching with Si and ideal bandgap energy for current generation in association with the Si bottom cell. Numerical simulation of the top cell is performed. The effect of layer thicknesses and doping on the cell efficiency are evidenced. In these structures a tunnel junction (TJ) is needed to interconnect both the top and bottom sub-cells. We compare the simulated performances of different TJ structures and show that the GaP(n+)/Si(p+) TJ is promising to improve performances of the currentâ€“voltage characteristic.
