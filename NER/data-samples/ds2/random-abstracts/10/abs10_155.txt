Abstract The possibility of ion beam formation of gold nanoparticles in SiO2 and Al2O3 matrices with presynthesized single-layer and multi-layer ensembles of silicon nanocrystals is revealed by analyzing the spectra of optical transmission. The parameters of gold nanoparticles are estimated. It is shown that luminescent properties of Si nanocrystals are preserved under irradiation with gold ions.
