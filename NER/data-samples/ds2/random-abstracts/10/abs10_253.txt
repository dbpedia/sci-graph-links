Abstract Dendritic, cactoid, splintery flowers-like and spinous flowers-like micro/nano-Pd hierarchical architectures were successfully deposited on the conductive substrates without assistance of any templates. Distinct from other general electrodeposition at a constant potential or cyclic potential, we utilized pulse potentials as deposition and dissolution potential, which were controlled by a simple and convenient electrochemical methodâ€”differential pulse amperometry. It was found that the morphologies of these novel micro/nanoparticles could be regulated with different pulse potentials. The resulting nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The results show that series of Pd micro/nanoparticles were bounded on the different index facets. It means that the growth direction could be effectively controlled by regulating the pulse potentials. Moreover, the as-synthesized Pd micro/nanoparticles also exhibited strikingly difference in catalytic activity toward electrooxidation of formic acid.
