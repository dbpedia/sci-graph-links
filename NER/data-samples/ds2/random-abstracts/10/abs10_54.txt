Abstract This paper presents an original design of chemical sensors with an integrated microfluidic channel. Targeted applications are pH-meters devices. The integration of the microfluidic channel allows decreasing the volume required for each measurement. The sensing part of the device consists of a field effect transistor (FET) with a suspended gate directly performed above the fluidic channel. Chemicals under test are driven through the sensing area between the electrical channel of the FET and the suspended gate. By this way products that flow in the microfluidic channel directly module the concentration of charges inside the transistor’s gap and thus induce changes in the transfer characteristic. This paper describes the fabrication process and the technological choices for materials. Electrical tests, performed in air and in liquid, have shown a good behavior of the transistor, linked to a good mechanical sustain of the fluidic channel. The system is able to detect transition between air and liquid media. Moreover, it has shown a high sensitivity (about 300 mV/pH) to pH measurements.
