Abstract The field-emission properties of molybdenum oxide nanowires grown on a silicon substrate and its emission performance in various vacuum gaps are reported in this article. A new kind of molybdenum oxides named nanowires with nanoscale protrusions on their surfaces were grown by thermal vapor deposition with a length of ~1 μm and an average diameter of ~50 nm. The morphology, structure, composition and chemical states of the prepared nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to XRD, XPS, and TEM analyses, the synthesized samples were composed of MoO2 nanowires formed over a thin layer of crystalline Mo4O11. TEM observation revealed that these nanowires have some nanoscale protrusion on their surface. These nanoprotrusions resulted in enhancement of field-emission properties of nanowires comprising nanoprotrusions. The turn-on emission field and the enhancement factor of this type of nanostructures were measured 0.2 V/μm and 42991 at the vacuum gap of 300 μm, respectively. These excellent emission properties are attributed to the special structure of the nanowires that have potential for utilizing in vacuum nanoelectronic and microelectronic applications.
