Abstract This study reports on the synthesis and fabrication of hybrid nanocomposite based on single-walled carbon nanotubes–ZnO nanorods (SWCNT-ZnONR) as resistive gas sensors for NO2 detection. The sensor was prepared using the standard simple and cost-effective hydrothermal process. The sensor was characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy. The findings revealed enhanced porous SWCNT-ZnONR nanocomposites due to the high porosity of the SWCNT. It was also found that the sensor exhibited average response and recovery times of about 70 s and 100 s, respectively. The XRD peak at 26° indicated that the SWCNT pattern was not disturbed, while sensitivity increased with temperature up to 150°C, at which the sensitivity was maximum. Similarly, the sensor sensitivity increased with NO2 concentration at all levels examined. Moreover, the results indicate that the sensor shows significant promise for NO2 gas sensing applications.
