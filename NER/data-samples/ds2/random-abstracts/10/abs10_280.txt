Abstract Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) has attracted a lot of attention because of its possible applications in new microelectronic devices. It is a material with a high dielectric constant, low leakage current, and some of its properties can be changed by adding or modifying the concentration of a dopant, which can be used for a wide range of functional purposes, from simple capacitors to complicated microwave devices. Therefore, in this work, we report the development of a new route to synthesize SrTiO3 nanoparticles based on the solvothermal method by employing two precursor solutions: strontium chloride and titanium(IV) butoxide. Our route allows the production of cubic SrTiO3 nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution. The particle sizes range between 8 and 24 nm, forming agglomerates of SrTiO3 in the range of 128–229 nm. It was demonstrated that the Ti/Sr molar ratio employed into the precursor solution has an important effect onto the chemical composition of the resulting SrTiO3 nanoparticles: when using Ti/Sr < 1, the formation and incorporation of the SrCO3 compound into the nanoparticles was observed while with Ti/Sr ≥ 1 nanoparticles are free of contaminants. The as-prepared nanoparticles were characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution TEM, selected area electron diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering.
