Abstract Recently, graphene oxide (GO), one of the carbon nanomaterials, has received much attention due to its unique physical and chemical properties and high potential in many research areas, including applications as a biosensor and drug delivery vehicle. Various GO-based biosensors have been developed, largely based on its surface adsorption properties for detecting biomolecules, such as nucleotides and peptides, and real-time monitoring of enzymatic reactions. In this review, we discuss recent advances in GO-based biosensors focusing on a novel assay platform for helicase activity, which was also employed in high-throughput screening to discover selective helicase inhibitors.
