Abstract Photoelectrochemically prepared nanotopographies on semiconductors are used for realization of nanoemitter solar devices that are active in the photovoltaic and the photoelectrocatalytic mode. The development of solar devices by a nonlinear electrochemical process and combined chemical/electrochemical metal deposition is described. Based on this low-temperature scalable approach, first efficiencies of 7.3% in the photovoltaic mode are reported for the photoelectrochemical solar cell n-Si/SiO2/Pt/I3 −–I−. With p-Si/Pt nanocomposite structures, light-induced H2 evolution is achieved. The surface chemistry and morphology is analyzed by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The operational principle of Pt-based nanoemitter solar devices that use silicon single crystal absorbers is analyzed by Mott–Schottky plots, chronoamperometric profiles, and PES. Related to simultaneous oxide formation during Pt deposition, evidence for the formation of a metal–oxide–semiconductor junction is obtained that explains the observed electronic behavior.
