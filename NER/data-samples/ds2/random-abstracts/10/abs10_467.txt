Abstract In this study, we describe the preparation and characterization of electrospun Nylon66 composite nanofibers incorporated with carbon nanotubes (CNT) fillers and silver nanoparticles. We have incorporated the composites in to Nylon66 nanofibers to enhance the characteristics of the resultant composite nanofibers. The resultant composite nanofibers were characterized by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and current-voltage (I–V) measurement analysis. The morphology of the composite nanofibers exhibited densely arranged mesh-like ultrafine nanofibers which were strongly bound in between the main fibers. From I–V characteristics, it was observed that the incorporation of CNT fillers and Ag nanoparticles in to electrospun Nylon66 composite nanofibers can be significantly enhanced the electrical properties.
