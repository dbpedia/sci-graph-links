Abstract We report on the 59Fe radiolabelling of iron oxide nanoparticle cores through post-synthetic isotope exchange (59Fe-IONPex) and precursor labelling (59Fe-IONPpre). Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements showed no impact of radiolabelling on nanoparticle size or morphology. While incorporation efficiencies of these methods are comparable—83 and 90% for precursor labelling and post-synthetic isotope exchange, respectively—59Fe-IONPpre exhibited much higher radiochemical stability in citrated human plasma. Quantitative ex vivo biodistribution study of 59Fe-IONPpre coated with triethylene glycol was performed in Wistar rats. Following the intravenous administration, high 59Fe concentration was observed in the lung and the organs of the reticuloendothelial system such as the liver, the spleen and the femur.
