Abstract ZnO nanosheets were prepared by a facile microemulsion-mediated hydrothermal route, and were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. As nano ZnO and bulk ZnO possess the same reaction essence, the relationship between standard molar enthalpies of formation of nano ZnO and bulk ZnO was built by designing a novel thermochemical cycle. Combined with microcalorimetry, standard molar enthalpy of formation of the as-prepared ZnO nanosheets at 298.15 K was successfully acquired as (−333.50 ± 0.29) kJ mol−1. It is an effective strategy for standard molar enthalpies of formation of nano materials through building the relationship with its corresponding bulk material.
