Abstract In this paper we report a simple method that enables the easy fabrication of ordered ZnO nanowire arrays using Anodic Aluminium Oxide (AAO) template. We have used a vacuum injection technique to fill solution into the pores of an AAO template. The AAO template has been fabricated by a two-step anodization process using 0.3 M oxalic acid (H2C2O4) solution under a constant voltage of 40Â V. The AAO template formed through this process has been detached from Al substrate via an anodic voltage pulse using perchloric acid (HClO4) solution (70%). The nanowires of ZnO have been synthesized by injecting the saturated Zn(NO3)2 solution into the pores of the detached AAO template using a vacuum pump. The ZnO nanowires synthesized by this technique have been found dense & continuous with uniform diameter throughout the length of the wire. The structural characteristics of AAO template and ZnO nanowires have been studied by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Atomic force microscope (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).
