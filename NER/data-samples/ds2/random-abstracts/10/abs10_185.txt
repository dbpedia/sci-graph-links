Abstract A magnetic glassy carbon electrode (mGCE) was modified with a ternary composite prepared from Prussian blue (PB), magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in order to obtain an amperometric sensor for hydrazine. The utilization of Fe3O4 facilitates the magnetic immobilization and separation of sensing material, while the use of rGO enhances sensitivity. The surface coverage and the stability of the PB on the modified electrode were considerably improved. The electro-oxidative response to hydrazine was investigated with this modified mGCE using cyclic voltammetry and amperometric. The sensor, typically operated at a voltage of 0.2 V (vs. SCE), displays superior response hydrazine, with a response time of 4 s, a sensitivity of 97.73 μA μM−1 cm−2 and a 13.7 nM detection limit.
