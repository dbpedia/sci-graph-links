Abstract Three polycrystalline Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 with carbon nanotubes, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 with NbSe2 nanotubes were synthesized by solid state reaction method and studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, magnetization measurements, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The critical temperature T C for the three compounds was about 85 K. There is an enhancement in the critical current density, J C for samples with carbon and NbSe2 nanotubes as compared with pure Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. The enhancement provides evidence that wetting exists for the two doped samples investigated.
