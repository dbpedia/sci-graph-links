Abstract 2D layered SnS2 nanosheets have attracted significant attention owing to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties and thus becoming the potential candidates for versatile applications. Here, a micro-environmental controlled chemical vapor deposition technique was provided to synthesis the high-quality hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets which were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, confocal Raman system, X-ray diffraction, time-resolved photoluminescence, atomic force microscope, and transmission electron microscopy measurements in structural and optical properties. The as-fabricated photodetectors (under 365 nm at room temperature) based on SnS2 flakes exhibited a remarkable photoresponsivity of 1.1 × 103 A W−1, an excellent external quantum efficiency of 3.2 × 105%, and a fast response time of 40 ms at room temperature, which shows better performance than reported photodetectors based on other analogous 2D materials and even their monolayer counterparts. The results indicate that SnS2 nanosheets are very promising potential candidates in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.
