Abstract The growing need for advanced treatment of evolving diseases has become a motivation for this study. Among the noble metals, platinum nanoparticles are of importance because of their catalytic property, antioxidant potential, minimal toxicity and diverse applications. Biological process of synthesis has retained its significance, because it is a simple one-step process yielding stable nanoparticles. Herein, we have synthesised platinum nanoparticles through a green process using the unexplored seaweed Padina gymnospora, a brown alga. The course of synthesis was monitored and the nanoparticles were characterised using UV–visible spectroscopy. The synthesised nanoparticles were studied using TEM, XRD and FTIR. The TEM and XRD studies reveal the size of the nanoparticle to be <35 nm. The catalytic nanoparticles were capable of oxidising NADH to NAD+. The biocompatibility was tested by haemolytic assay for the furtherance of the application of platinum nanoparticles in medicine. This is the first report on the biogenic synthesis of platinum nanoparticles using seaweed.
