Abstract We used aptamers, which are functional equivalents of antibodies, in order to develop a nanosensor immunoassay system based on magnetic nanoparticles and a SQUID magnetometer. Selection was used to obtain DNA aptamers to interleukin-6; their affinity to the target protein was characterized by surface plasmon resonance. It was shown that the biotinylated aptamer binds to magnetic nanoparticles that were functionalized with streptavidin.
