Abstract Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were attached to the surface of boron-doped diamond by electropolymerization using a bridge of polyaniline. A carbon nanotube/diamond hybrid functionalized surface was obtained and testified by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed that this carbon hybrid surface possessed low electron-transfer resistance, large double-capacitance value, and high electrocatalytic ability. This indicated that this functionalized surface had a variety of potential sustainable technology applications such as in supercapacitors, biomolecule-sensing devices.
