Abstract We study orthonormal normal sections of two-dimensional immersions in $${\mathbb R^{n+2}, n\ge 2}$$ , which are critical for a functional of total torsion and which we call Coulomb sections. In particular, we establish upper bounds for the torsion coefficients in the case of non-flat normal bundles. With these notes we continue a foregoing paper on surfaces in $${\mathbb R^4.}$$
