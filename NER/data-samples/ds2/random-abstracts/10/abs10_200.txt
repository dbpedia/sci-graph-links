Abstract We report graphene nanosheets as a durable alternative support material for Pt nanoparticle catalysts for oxygen reduction in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and compared them to XC-72. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical surface oxidation of XC-72 and graphene, and of Pt/XC-72 and Pt/graphene has been compared following treatments for up to 120Â h. The electrochemical performance of the specimens was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry at different surface oxidation time intervals. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the graphene exihibits greatly enhanced electrochemical durability. It is suggested that graphene nanosheet is a promising, low-cost, and durable electrocatalyst support for oxygen reduction in the PEM fuel cell.
