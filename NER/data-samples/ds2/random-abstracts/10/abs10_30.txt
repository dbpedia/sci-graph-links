Abstract The diffusion deposition of aerosol nanoparticles has been studied at small Reynolds numbers in a model filter with a three-dimensional structure formed from two hexagonal networks of parallel fibers rotated relative to each other by the right angle and located normal to the flow direction. Efficiencies of particle collection by fibers have been calculated as depending on the number of rows of fibers in a wide range of Peclet numbers. It has been shown that the effect of a diffusion wake after a fiber on the nanoparticle deposition in highly porous filters with the three-dimensional structure is less pronounced than that in filters with a two-dimensional structure. Moreover, at a packing density of three-dimensional filters below 0.05, the effect of the diffusion wake may be ignored. The double hexagonal model has been proposed to be used as an adequate model of real fibrous filters.
