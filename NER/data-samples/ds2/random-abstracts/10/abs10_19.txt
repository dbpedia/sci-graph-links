Abstract The free vibration of a single-layered graphene sheet (SLGS)-based mass sensor is analyzed using the Galerkin strip distributed transfer function method (GSDTFM) based on the nonlocal Kirchhoff plate theory. The dynamic equations of the SLGS-based mass sensor are formulated, and the semi-analytical solutions of the frequency shift are computed with the GSDTFM. The effects of the nonlocal parameter, the attached nanoparticle locations, the plate side length, as well as the boundary conditions, on the frequency shift are studied. The simulated results show that the frequency shift of the SLGS-based mass sensor becomes smaller when the nonlocal parameter increases. The SLGS-based mass sensor is more sensitive when the attached nanoparticle is closer to the SLGS center or the side length of the SLGS becomes smaller. The boundary conditions strongly affect the frequency shift. Stiffer boundary condition causes larger frequency shift.
