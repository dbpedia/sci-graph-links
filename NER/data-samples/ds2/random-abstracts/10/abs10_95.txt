Summary The small cells of the midgut glands of Armadillidium vulgare, Oniscus asellus, Porcellio scaber, and Alloniscus oahuensis were examined by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis, histochemistry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Inclusions containing large amounts of heavy metals were the most prominent feature of these cells. Various areas of the midgut glands exhibited large differences in storage capacity. Juveniles were free of lead.
