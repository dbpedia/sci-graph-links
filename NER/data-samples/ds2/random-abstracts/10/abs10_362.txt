Abstract In the standard model, if the ratios of Yukawa couplings to gauge couplings are bounded functions of the renormalization point, then the fourth-generation fermion massesm U , m D , andm L (in GeV) are constrained to lie within a domain approximately given by (m U /213)4.8+(m D /209)4.8+(m L /161)2.4<1.
