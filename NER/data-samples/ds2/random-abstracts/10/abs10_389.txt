Abstract The paper present a simple method for the extraction of solar cells parameters with a single diode circuit model from its dark characteristic and considering the series and shunt resistances. In order to extract the four parameters of the solar cell, an optimized technique is presented by using a combination of Lambert W function in its Padé-type approximation and the FindFit function in the Mathematica software package. By using the exact explicit analytical solutions, the current-voltage curves of the Au/SnO2-Si(n)/Al p-n junction solar cell are calculated and simulated. The results have the good agreement between the fitted current-voltage curves and the experimental data of the corresponding solar cell. A closed form expression for the Lambert W function based on a Padé-type approximation is also provided.
