Summary The breakdown performance of CMS barrelmodule prototype detectors and test devices with single and multi-guard structures were studied before and after neutron irradiation up to 2·1014 1 MeV equivalent neutrons. Before irradiation avalanche breakdown occurred at the guard ring implant edges. We measured 100–300 V higher breakdown voltage values for the devices with multi-guard than for devices with single-guard ring. After irradiation and type inversion the breakdown was smoother than before irradiation and the breakdown voltage value increased to 500–600 V for most of the devices.
