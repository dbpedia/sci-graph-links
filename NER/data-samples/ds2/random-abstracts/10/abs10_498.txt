Abstract Bioelectrodes were developed based on a simple deposition of graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphed oxide (rGO) and laccase (Lac) on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode surface. The morphology and electrochemical behavior of the biosensors were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. These results demonstrated that only rGO was successfully applied for the immobilization of the laccase enzyme, improving the analytical signal for the determination of dopamine. The GC/rGO/Lac biosensor was applied to the detection of dopamine in synthetic urine and plasmatic serum samples, achieving a detection limit of 91.0 nmol L−1.
