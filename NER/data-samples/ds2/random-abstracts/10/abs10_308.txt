Abstract A convenient method for in situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles was developed to realize the multifunction of cotton. The silver nanoparticles were obtained through reduction of silver ions by cotton under basic condition at room temperature. The as-synthesized silver nanoparticles achieved the coloration of cotton fibers. Heating increased the color strength of cotton fibers with silver nanoparticles. Mercerization treatment as a common finishing process enhanced the properties of cotton fibers modified by silver nanoparticles. The mercerized cotton exhibited brighter color and had very good colorfastness to washing. The cotton fibers treated with in situ synthesized silver nanoparticles possess strong antibacterial activity with excellent washing durability.
