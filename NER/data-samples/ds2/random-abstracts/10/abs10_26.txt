Abstract Single-crystal SnS nanowires have been successfully synthesized by catalysis-assistant chemical vapor deposition. Applying Au nanoparticles which were applied on the ITO surface as the catalysator, using SnS powder and S powder as precursors and the Ar+H2 mixed atmosphere as the shielding and carrier gas, the SnS nanowires were obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy were employed to characterize the as-synthesized SnS nanostructures. The room-temperature photoluminescence properties of these as-prepared SnS nanowires were presented.
