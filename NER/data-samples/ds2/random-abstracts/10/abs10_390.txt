Abstract A technique has been developed for the routine preparation of transverse sections of oxide scales and metal-oxide interfaces which are electron transparent for examination in a transmission electron microscope. The method developed is essentially a three-step process: electroforming of Ni onto the oxidized surface, sectioning cross sections with a diamond wafering blade, and ion-thinning until holes appear in the oxide scale. Examples are presented of transverse electron transparent scales of NiO on Ni and Cr2O3 on Fe-Cr obtained by this technique, illustrating that it is now possible to obtain microstructural and microchemical information across oxide scales varying in thickness from 1–10 μ.
