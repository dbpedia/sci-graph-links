Abstract The nanosized Fe50Ni50 particles were synthesized by a newly developed electric field-assisted deposition technology in a high energetic cluster deposition system. Their microstructures and lattice characteristics were observed by in situ TEM. The magnetic properties were characterized by a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The purpose of the application of electric field during deposition is to accelerate the condensed nanoparticles to form the compact films with in-plane magnetic softness. The overlarge electric field can induce the appearance of lattice kinks and shoulder characteristics of loops. The in situ variable temperature TEM experiments with the measurement of magnetic properties indicated that excellent in-plane magnetic softness could be obtained by annealing. The thermomagnetization curves verified the ferromagnetic characteristics of the deposited films without any magnetic impurity phase.
