Abstract Remarkable transitions were found in atomic-scale friction-images of the NaF(100) surface and the corresponding sticking-domain distribution by detailed investigation of the load dependence using the two-dimensional frictional force microscope. The tip-position map reveals a new type of sticking-domain distribution pattern, which is different from the simple lattice periodicity.
