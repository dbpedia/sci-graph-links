Abstract This report describes that the Pd nanoparticles are prepared and decorated successfully at the sidewalls of single-walled carbon nanotubes, multiwall carbon nanotubes, and graphite nanofibers without any surface pretreatments by self-regulated reduction of sodium n-dodecyl sulfate. As supported by electrochemical measurements, the newly prepared Pd-nanoparticles-decorated carbon nanomaterials are found to have the high activity for oxygen reduction.
