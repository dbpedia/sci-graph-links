Abstract The marine alginate lyase from Streptomyces sp. ALG-5, which specifically degrades poly-G block of alginate, was functionally expressed as a His-tagged form with an Escherichia coli expression system. The recombinant alginate lyase expressed with pColdI at 15 °C exhibited the highest alginate-degrading activity. The recombinant alginate lyase was efficiently immobilized onto two types of magnetic nanoparticles, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle, and hybrid magnetic silica nanoparticle, based on the affinity between His-tag and Ni2+ that displayed on the surfaces of nanoparticles. An alginate oligosaccharide mixture consisting of dimer and trimer was prepared by the immobilized alginate lyase. The immobilized enzymes were re-used repeatedly more than 10 times after magnetic separation.
