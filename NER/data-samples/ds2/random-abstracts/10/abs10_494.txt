Abstract1-Amino-9,10-anthraquinone was electropolymerized in the presence of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1Â M LiClO4. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) recorded on the GC electrode were compared with those obtained with the MWCNTs. The poly(1-amino-9,10-anthraquinone)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (PAAQ/MWCNT) films showed greater anodic peak currents due to the presence of more active sites on the MWCNTs and their larger surface area. The CVs for the PAAQ/MWCNT films recorded at different scan rates revealed that the anodic peak currents increase with increase in the scan rate, and that the redox process is surface controlled. The polymer was characterized by the CV, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The results obtained from the CVs and SEM revealed that the MWCNTs diffused within the polymer structure. Impedance spectroscopy results also confirmed the CV results. Graphical Abstract
