Abstract Nanostructured Fe2O3–graphene composite was successfully fabricated through a facile solution-based route under mild hydrothermal conditions. Well-crystalline Fe2O3 nanoparticles with 30–60 nm in size are highly encapsulated in graphene nanosheet matrix, as demonstrated by various characterization techniques. As electrode materials for supercapacitors, the as-obtained Fe2O3–graphene nanocomposite exhibits large specific capacitance (151.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate capability (120 F g−1 at 6 A g−1), and excellent cyclability. The significantly enhanced electrochemical performance compared with pure graphene and Fe2O3 nanoparticles may be attributed to the positive synergetic effect between Fe2O3 and graphene. In virtue of their superior electrochemical performance, they will be promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors applications.
