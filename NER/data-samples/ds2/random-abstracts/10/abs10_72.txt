Abstract Deep proton irradiation in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a fabrication method for monolithic integrated micro optics which offers high stability and interesting autoalignment features. The process consists of three basic steps: irradiation of a PMMA substrate followed by either a development of the irradiated regions or a swelling of the irradiated regions by organic vapor or both applied to different regions. With this technique a variety of elementary refractive microoptical components and monolithically integrated combinations can be fabricated: microlenses, microprisms, beam splitters, fiber connectors with selfaligned microlenses on top of each fiber.
