Abstract Heat transfer of Cu–water nanofluid over a stretching cylinder in the presence of magnetic field has been investigated. The group method of data handling (GMDH) type neural networks (NNs) is used to calculate Nusselt number formulation. Results indicate that GMDH-type NN in comparison with fourth-order Runge–Kutta integration scheme provides an effective means of efficiently recognizing the patterns in data and accurately predicting a performance. The effects of nanoparticle volume fraction, magnetic parameter and Reynolds number on Nusselt number are studied by sensitivity analyses. The results show that Nusselt number is an increasing function of Reynolds number and volume fraction of nanoparticles while it is a decreasing function of magnetic parameter. As volume fraction of nanoparticles increases, the effect of this parameter on Nusselt number also increases, but opposite behavior is obtained for magnetic parameter and Reynolds number.
