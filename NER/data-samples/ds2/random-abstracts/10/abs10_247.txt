Abstract We study the homogeneous linewidth of transitions between many-particle states in semiconductor quantum dots due to scattering processes. Carrier–density-dependent scattering rates due to carrier–carrier Coulomb interaction and carrier–LO-phonon interaction are obtained on a non-perturbative level and connected to a von Neumann–Lindblad equation for the quantum-dot many-particle configurations, allowing to identify the dephasing of transitions between many-particle states. For different dot geometries, we discuss implications of energetic quantum-dot wetting-layer separation on Coulomb and LO-phonon contributions.
