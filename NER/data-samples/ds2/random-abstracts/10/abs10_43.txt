Abstract The paper describes a nonenzymatic amperometric H2O2 sensor that uses a nanocomposite consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and mesoporous carbon nanofibers (Co3O4-MCNFs). The Co3O4 NPs were grown in situ on the MCNFs by a solvothermal procedure. The synergetic combination of the electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 NPs and the electrical conductivity of MCNFs as an immobilization matrix enhance the sensing ability of the hybrid nanostructure. The oxidation current, best measured at 0.2 V (vs. SCE) is linear in the 1 to 2580 μM H2O2 concentration range, with a 0.5 μM lower detection limit (at an S/N ratio of 3). The sensor is highly selective even in the presence of common electroactive interferents. It was applied to the determination of H2O2 in spiked milk samples.

It was used as electrocatalyst for direct oxidation of H2O2.
