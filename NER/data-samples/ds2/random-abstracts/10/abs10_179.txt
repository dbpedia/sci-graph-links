Abstract This study elucidates the application of Pd nanoparticles as catalysts of electroless copper deposition and their catalytic effect on the deposition kinetics and microstructure in an electroless copper bath. Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) and high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) demonstrated that the kinetic changes associated with electroless copper deposition (ECD) comprised two stagesâ€”the incubation period and the acceleration period. In the incubation period, small copper particles were deposited. In the acceleration period, the ECD rate increased rapidly and continuously conducting films with large grains were formed. Leaner sweep voltammetry (LSV) and mixed potential theory (MPT) were applied to examine the catalytic powers of the prepared Pd nanoparticles and the related electrochemical kinetics in the ECD bath.
