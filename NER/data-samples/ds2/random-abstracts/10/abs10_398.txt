Abstract In this paper, we developed a numerical calculation program, using Turbo Pascal, to determine the current–voltage characteristics of a $$\hbox {N}^{+}\hbox {P}$$ N+P solar cells in order to find the main parameters influencing the conversion efficiency. We adopted a one-dimensional numerical model for the resolution of the three semiconductor equations, which are: the Poisson’s equation and the two continuity equations of electrons and holes. Our system of equations is written in term of $$\varphi ,\, \varphi _{n}$$ φ,φn , and $$\varphi _{p}$$ φp , and it’s resolved using the finite difference method. This code enables us to draw the current density versus the voltage for different layer thicknesses, the conversion efficiency versus the minority carrier life time and the spectral response versus the wavelength. In order to compare the conversion efficiency of two different solar cells, we simulated a solar cell based on III–V nitride compounds $$(\hbox {In}_\mathrm{x}\hbox {Ga}_{1-\mathrm{x}}\hbox {N})$$ (InxGa1-xN) and a monocrystalline silicon solar cell.
