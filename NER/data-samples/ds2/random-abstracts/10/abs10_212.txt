Abstract The 16 kDa heat shock protein (16 kDa HSP) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT), expressed during the growth phase of MT, is a potential target in diagnostic tests for tuberculosis (TB). We describe here a method for impedimetric determination of the antigen by using a nanogapped dielectric surface consisting of a silver support coated with a thin finger-shaped coating made from zinc oxide and gold and patterned through a lift-off process. The electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Surface chemical functionalization and immobilization of antibody against the 16 kDa HSP was evidenced by FTIR. In order to improve the detection limit, the antigen was conjugated to 10 nm gold nanoparticles. The resulting biosensor is capable of detecting the 16 kDa HSP in concentrations as low as 100 fM. The method covers a wide analytical range that extends from 100 fM to 1 nM. Graphical abstractSchematic presentation of the nanogapped impedimetric immunosensor for the diagnosis of tuberculosis
