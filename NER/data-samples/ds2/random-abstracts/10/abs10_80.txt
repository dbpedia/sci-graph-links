Abstract The optical and electrical properties of graphene doping organic photovoltaics devices are investigated. The root-mean-square roughness, photoluminescence and optical absorption increase with increasing graphene content. Graphene also improves the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density. The best performance was obtained with 3 wt% graphene concent, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.62 V, a short-circuit current density value of 6.138 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 61.912 %, and a power conversion efficiency of 2.35 %.
