Abstract. The paper is devoted to the electron spin resonance and magnetic measurements of Fe3C nanoparticles covered by a carbon structure. There is a reversible modification of the magnetic properties by the chemisorption of CO and O2. The CO chemisorption results in the transition of the majority of the Fe3C nanoparticles from the ferromagnetic to the superparamagnetic state. The O2 chemisorption results in the backward transition.
