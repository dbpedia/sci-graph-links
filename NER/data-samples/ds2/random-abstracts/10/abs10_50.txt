Abstract Let $$N$$ N be a Riemannian manifold and consider a stationary union of three or more $$C^{1,\mu }$$ C1,μ hypersurfaces-with-boundary $$M_k \subset N$$ Mk⊂N with a common boundary $$\Gamma $$ Γ . We show that if $$N$$ N is smooth, then $$\Gamma $$ Γ is smooth and each $$M_k$$ Mk is smooth up to $$\Gamma $$ Γ (real analytic in the case $$N$$ N is real analytic). Consequently we strengthen a result of Wickramasekera for stable codimension 1 integral varifolds regularity to conclude that under the stronger hypothesis that $$V$$ V is a stationary, stable, integral $$n$$ n -varifold in an $$(n+1)$$ (n+1) -dimensional, smooth (real analytic) Riemannian manifold such that the support of $$\Vert V\Vert $$ ‖V‖ is nowhere locally the union of three or more smooth (real analytic) hypersurfaces-with-boundary meeting along a common boundary, the singular set of $$V$$ V is empty if $$n \le 6$$ n≤6 , is discrete if $$n = 7$$ n=7 , and has Hausdorff dimension at most $$n-7$$ n-7 if $$n \ge 8$$ n≥8 .
