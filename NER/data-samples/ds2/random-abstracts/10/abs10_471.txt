Abstract The main goal of present study was the fabrication of cotton fabric with special functions, including electrical conductivity, magnetic, antibacterial, and ultraviolet (UV) blocking. In this regard, the cotton fabric was primarily coated with graphene oxide and then reduction of graphene oxide and synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles accomplished in one step. The alkaline hydrolysis of magnetite precursors and reduction of graphene oxide was simultaneously performed using sodium hydroxide to produce reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 nanocomposite on the fabric surface. The prepared cotton fabrics were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The treated fabrics with reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 nanocomposite displayed a low electrical resistivity i.e. 80 kÎ©/sq. Furthermore, the coated fabrics showed reasonable magnetic properties due to the presence of magnetite nanoparticles on the surface of cotton fabrics. Moreover, this process imparted proper antibacterial properties and UV blocking activity to cotton samples.
