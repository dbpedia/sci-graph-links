Abstract A robust functionalized procedure for gold nanorods (Au NR) with mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), which are assembled with nanoparticles, has been reported in the present work. The self-assembled nanostructures were characterized by UVâ€“Vis-NIR spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Self-assembly procedures, governed by surface chemistry, indicated that chemical reactivity of nanomaterial may contribute in construction of potential nanoscale assemblies. These nanostructures have striking applications as single-molecule detection, plasmonics, and sensing.
