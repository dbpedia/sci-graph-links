AbstractIn this article, we propose a novel electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen on a portable indium tin oxide device. The gold nanoparticle-coated silica nanosphere aggregated with Ru(bpy)32+ was used as an excellent label with the signal amplification technique. The amino-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were treated with 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane. The primary monoclonal antibody to α-carcinoembryonic antigen was immobilized onto the surface of Fe3O4 by glutaraldehyde as coupling agent. Under optimal conditions, the concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen were obtained in the linear range of 0.001–10 ng cm−3 with a detection limit of 0.3 pg cm−3. The resulting immunosensor possessed high sensitivity, good stability, reproducibility, satisfied regeneration and selectivity, and could be used in other biological assays. Graphical Abstract
