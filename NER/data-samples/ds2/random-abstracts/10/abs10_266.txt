Abstract Au/graphene nanocomposites are prepared via a one-pot chemical reduction process at room temperature, using graphene oxide (GO) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) as precursors. The obtained Au/graphene nanocomposites are characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TEM shows that the Au nanoparticles with size of approximately 8.7 nm disperse randomly on the surface of graphene. XPS confirms that the Au/graphene nanocomposites show a higher atomic percentage of C/O (6.3/1), in contrast to its precursor GO (2.2/1). Electrochemical studies reveal that the Au/graphene nanocomposites have electrochemically active surface area of 9.82 m2 g−1. Besides, the influence of borohydride concentration on the as-prepared Au/graphene nanocomposites is investigated in details by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry. The results indicate that high concentration of borohydride can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of the Au/graphene catalyst.
