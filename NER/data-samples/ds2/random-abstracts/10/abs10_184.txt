Summary The appearance of perinucleolar electron-dense spots in the nuclei of macroconidia ofNeurospora crassa incubated at 46‡C and their disaggregation after shift-down to 25 ‡C have been investigated by high-resolution autoradiography after (5-3H) uridine pulses with or without chase periods. The RNA of these ribonucleoprotein-rich dense spots has been found to originate mainly from the heatsensitive nucleolus; after return to 25 ‡C, the nucleolar activity was recovered and the RNA material stored either in an unprocessed or a mature rRNA form in the dense spots was found to be progressively extruded into the cytoplasm.
