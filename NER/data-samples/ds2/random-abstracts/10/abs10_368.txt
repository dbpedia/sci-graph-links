Abstract The formation of gold-silver cluster structures on surfaces of glasses has been investigated. The properties of these structures are analyzed in dependence on the weight ratio of metal nanoparticles and the particle concentration in the colloid. It is shown that the optical properties of these structures may change significantly with a change in the morphological properties and chemical composition of the structures.
