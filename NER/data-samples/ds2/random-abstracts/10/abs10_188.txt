Abstract The authors describe a method for the ultrasensitive optical determination of Pb(II). It is based on the formation of a Pt-Pb nanoalloy from Pt nanoparticles and Pb that is formed by reduction with NaBH4. The nanoalloy accelerates an oscillatory reaction involving Toluidine Blue (TB), NaBH4 and oxygen. In this reaction, TB is reduced by NaBH4 to form reduced TB (rTB), and this is accompanied by a color change from blue to colorless. However, rTB can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen and the color turns back to blue. The Pt-Pb nanoalloy exerts a strong catalytic effect on this reaction. If the concentration of NaBH4 is low enough, the rate of reducing TB is lower than that of the oxidation of TB. The time of the transition from blue → colorless → blue is inversely correlated to the concentration of Pb(II). The methods works in the 1 to 1000 nM Pb(II) concentration range, with a 0.63 nM detection limit, This highly sensitive and selective method was applied to the determination of Pb(II) in spiked river water samples. Graphical abstractA strategy combining an oscillatory reaction with a change in the catalytic behavior of platinum nanoparticles to visually and ultrasensitively detect Pb2+ was designed.
