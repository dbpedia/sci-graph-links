Abstract In this work, we describe a facile single-step approach for the simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide to graphene, functional doping of graphene with nitrogen, and loading of the doped graphene with well-dispersed platinum (Pt) nanoparticles using a solvent mixture of ethylene glycol and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The as-prepared Pt/nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) catalysts are characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy while the electrocatalytic methanol oxidation properties of the catalysts are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Compared with an updoped Pt/graphene control catalyst, the Pt/N-graphene catalyst shows a narrower particle size distribution and improved catalytic performance. Considering the facile, green and effective single-step synthetic process for the Pt/N-graphene catalyst, the results are promising for the potential application of these materials in emerging fuel cell technologies.
