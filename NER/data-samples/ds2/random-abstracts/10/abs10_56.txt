Abstract Recently, the use of Sn–Pb eutectic solder has been prohibited by restriction of the use of hazardous substances (RoHS), since Pb may have a bad influence on human and the environment. Instead, Tin–Silver–Copper (Sn–Ag–Cu) system is adopted as the lead free solder. However, the melting temperature of Sn–Ag–Cu is higher than that of Sn–Pb, which may induce damages in the electronic packages. To solve this problem, Sn nanoparticles were fabricated in this study. Morphology observation and component analysis of Sn nanoparticles were carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, respectively. The melting temperature of Sn nanoparticles was measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC822e). The lowest melting temperature of the present Sn nanoparticles is 440 K, which is approximately 65 K lower than that of the bulk Sn.
