Abstract A novel microfabrication process based on optimized photolithography combined with pyrolysis-reduction is proposed to fabricate interdigital porous carbon/tin quantum dots (C/Sn QDs) microelectrodes. C/Sn QDs active microelectrodes are also employed as current collectors of a micro-supercapacitor (MSC). A uniform dispersion of Sn QDs (diameter of ~3 nm) in the carbon matrix is achieved using our facile and controllable microfabrication process. The as-fabricated C/Sn QDs MSC obtained by carbonization at 900 °C exhibits a higher areal specific capacitance (5.79 mF·cm−2) than that of the pyrolyzed carbon-based MSC (1.67 mF·cm−2) and desirable cycling stability (93.3% capacitance retention after 5,000 cyclic voltammetry cycles). This novel microfabrication process is fully compatible with micromachining technologies, showing great potential for large-scale fine micropatterning of carbon-based composites for applications in micro/nano devices.
