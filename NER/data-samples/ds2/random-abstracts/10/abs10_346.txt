Abstract. The quantum Goos-Hänchen effect in graphene is found to be the lateral shift of Dirac fermions on the total reflection at a single p-n interface. In this paper, we investigate the lateral shifts of Dirac fermions in transmission through a monolayer graphene barrier. Compared to the smallness of the lateral shifts in total reflection, the lateral shifts can be enhanced by the transmission resonances when the incidence angle is less than the critical angle for total reflection. It is also found that the lateral shifts, as the function of the barrier’s width and incidence angle, can be negative and positive in the cases of Klein tunneling and classical motion. The modulation of the lateral shifts can be realized by changing the electrostatic potential and induced gap, which gives rise to some applications in graphene-based devices.
