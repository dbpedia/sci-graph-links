Abstract The article describes a sensor for the voltammetric determination of the azo dye Basic Red 13 (BR13) during its degradation by using sonoelectrochemistry in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles. A glassy carbon electrode was modified with silver nanoparticles and graphene oxide sheets. The performance of the method was compared to that of the spectrophotometric assay at 523 nm. The voltammetric sensor, best operated at +0.752 V vs. SCE, has a linear range that covers concentrations from 0.5 to 100.0 μM BR13, which is much wider than that of spectrophotometry. The detection limit is 2.0 μM. The method was successfully applied to BR13 detection in wastewater samples collected a textile plant. Graphical abstractA new method is presented for controlling dye concentration during sonoelectrocatalyst degradation. A GCE modified by AgNP and GO. AgNP have an electrocatalytic effect in BR13 oxidation. AgNP/GO composition will increase the surface area, so the background voltammetric response and sensitivity than those for the GO, and AgNPs modified surfaces.
