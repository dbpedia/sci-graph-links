Abstract We consider the Dirichlet problem for biharmonic maps u from a bounded, smooth domain $${\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n (n\ge 5)}$$ to a compact, smooth Riemannian manifold $${N\subset{\mathbb {R}}^l}$$ without boundary. For any smooth boundary data, we show that if u is a stationary biharmonic map that satisfies a certain boundary monotonicity inequality, then there exists a closed subset $${\Sigma\subset\overline{\Omega}}$$ , with $${H^{n-4}(\Sigma)=0}$$ , such that $${\displaystyle u\in C^\infty(\overline\Omega\setminus\Sigma, N)}$$.
