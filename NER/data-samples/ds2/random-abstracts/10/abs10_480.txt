Abstract For a graphene sheet with confining structures in the orthogonal directions of zigzag- and armchair-edge, the confined carrier states are determined. These wavefunctions and eigenvalues are used to study carrier-longitudinal optical (LO)-phonon interactions in these graphene quantum dots. The optical deformation potential is derived for these graphene quantum dots as the basis for the study of these carrier-LO-phonon interactions. Phonon bottleneck effects are identified and the Fermi golden rule transition rates are formulated.
