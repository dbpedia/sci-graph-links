AbstractWe present a utilization of carbon quantum dots (CQDs), passivated with polyethylene glycol as a fluorescent recognition probe for DNA damage. Synthesized CQDs were characterized in detail, using optical and electrochemical methods. Further, fluorescent behavior of CQDs was monitored in the presence of genomic DNA, isolated from Staphylococcus aureus. In laboratory conditions, after 30 min of exposure to UV irradiation (λ = 254 nm), the DNA/CQDs complex significantly increased its fluorescence. Further, stratospheric probe was suggested and crafted by using technology of 3D printing (acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene as a material). CQDs were exploited to evaluate the DNA damage in stratospheric conditions (up to 20,000 m) by determination of fluorescence increase (λ exc = 245 nm, λ em = 400 nm), together with other parameters (temperature, humidity, altitude, pressure, UV intensity, and X-ray irradiation). The obtained data showed that the sensor utilizing the DNA/CQDs was able to identify the DNA damage, together with external conditions. It was shown the proposed concept is able to operate at temperatures lower than −70 °C. The proposed protocol may by applicable as a biosensor for long-term space missions, like international space station, missions to the Moon or Mars. Graphical abstract
