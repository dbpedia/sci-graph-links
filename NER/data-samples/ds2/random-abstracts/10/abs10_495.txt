Abstract An electrochemical sensor has been constructed for the determination of adriamycin (ADM) that is based on a glassy carbon electrode modified with silver nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes with carboxy groups. The modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and exhibits a large enhancement of the differential pulse voltammetric response to ADM. Signals are linear with the concentrations of ADM in the range from 8.2 × 10−9 M to 19.0 × 10−9 M, with a detection limit of 1.7 × 10−9 M. The sensor is highly reproducible and exhibits excellent stability. It was to detect calf thymus DNA.
