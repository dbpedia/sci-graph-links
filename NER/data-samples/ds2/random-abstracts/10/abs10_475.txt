Abstract A flexible Co3O4 hollow microsphere/graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid film is successfully prepared through a facile filtration strategy and a subsequent thermally treated process. The composition, morphology, and structure of the as-prepared film are characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Based on the morphology characterizations on the hybrid film, the Co3O4 hollow microspheres are uniformly and closely attached on three-dimensional (3D) graphene/carbon nanotubes (GR/CNTs) network, which decreases the agglomeration of Co3O4 microspheres effectively. In this hybrid film, the 3D GR/CNT network which enhances conductance as well as prevents aggregation is a benefit to help Co3O4 to exert its lithium storage capabilities sufficiently. When used as a binder-free anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the hybrid film delivers excellent electrochemical properties involving reversible capacity (863 mAh g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1) and rate performance (185 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1600 mA g−1).
