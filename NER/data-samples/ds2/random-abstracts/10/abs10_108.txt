Abstract We describe a simple method for the synthesis of highly magnetic and fluorescent bifunctional chitosan nanoparticles (MF-CSNPs). Water-soluble and magnetic Fe3O4-chitosan nanoparticles and CdSe quantum dots capped with thioglycolic acid were incorporated into a chitosan matrix via electrostatic interaction. The optical, magnetic, crystallographic and morphological properties of the new nanoparticles were studied by UV-visible, fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, MF-CSNPs are found to be a useful probe for the determination of copper ion which acts as a quencher of fluorescence. The relative fluorescence intensity of MF-CSNPs is linearly related to the concentration of copper ion in the 0.125 to 25 ng·mL-1 concentration range. The MF-CSNPs also are found to adsorb copper ion which therefore can be separated and enriched by manipulating them with an external magnetic field. Before enrichment, the limit of detection (LOD) for copper ion is 120 pg·mL-1, but after enrichment, the LOD is 46 pg·mL-1. FigureHigh magnetic and fluorescent bifunctional chitosan nanoparticles (MF-CSNPs) have been successfully synthesized via electrostatic interaction. MF-CSNPs are shown to represent a quenchable fluorescent probe for the detection of copper ion in water solution.
