Abstract CdSexTe1-x semiconductor alloy nanotubes (with an external diameter of 140 nm and an internal diameter of 100 nm) were successfully prepared based on the sacrificial template of Cd(OH)Cl nanorods, and were further in situ assembled with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via a sonochemical approach to form the CdSexTe1−x/Au nanotubes. The prepared CdSexTe1−x/Au nanotubes were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectra. CdSexTe1−x/Au nanotubes could integrate the advantages of the electronic properties of CdSeTe and the biocompatible properties of AuNPs. A novel biosensor was fabricated after the immobilization of hemoglobin (Hb) on CdSexTe1−x/Au nanotubes. The immobilized Hb exhibited fast direct electron transfer and good electrocatalytic performance to H2O2.
