Summary A method is presented for the determination of London dispersive forces and specific interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent, taking into account the deformation polarizability in inverse gas chromatography (IGC) at infinite dilution. Previous methods for the interpretation of IGC experimental results have frequently revealed their inadequacies and limits in the case of solids such as carbon blacks, graphite powders and carbon fibres, or led to rough estimations when based on molar deformation polarization only.
