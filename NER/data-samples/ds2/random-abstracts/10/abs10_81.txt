Abstract This paper deals with the thermal analysis of carbon nanotube (CNT) based composites by meshless element free Galerkin method. Cylindrical representative volume element (cylindrical RVE) has been chosen to evaluate the thermal properties of nano-composites using multi-domain and simplified approaches. The values of temperature have been calculated at different points and plotted against RVE length and RVE radius. A sensitivity analysis of RVE as well as CNT dimensions has been carried out in detail. The present computations show that the equivalent thermal conductivity is a function of CNT length, CNT radius, RVE length and RVE radius. Based on present numerical simulations, an approximate formula is proposed to calculate the equivalent thermal conductivity of nano-composites. The results obtained by simplified approach have been found in good agreement with those obtained by multi-domain approach.
