Abstract Torcs are a specific type of ornamented metal neckring, which are typical artefacts of ancient barbarians. This study of Celtic gold torcs introduces the use of modern technology to analyse and classify the finds. The results emphasise the dynamic character of goldworking practised in the late, pre-Roman Celtic times.
