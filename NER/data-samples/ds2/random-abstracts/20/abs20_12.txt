Abstract A comparison of sources cited in the Japanese language Geographical Review of Japan and six western language, Japanese geographical serials reveals that while both cite the same proportion of foreign sources (a third), authors tend to select Japanese sources which are written in the language of the host publication. Foreign sources in the Japanese literature are overwhelmingly from the English language world, especially the United States, with a small admixture in German, from the F.R. Germany. The proportion of foreign sources in the Japanese literature appears to be in decline.
