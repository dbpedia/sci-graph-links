Abstract The goal of this article is to demonstrate that Old Japanese(8th c. of C.E.) is a language which combines nominative andactive typology, with an obvious preference for a nominativeconstruction. The author focuses on case particles i and wo andtheir functions in Old Japanese and shows that the case particlei is an active case marker while wo may function as an accusativeor an absolutive case marker.
