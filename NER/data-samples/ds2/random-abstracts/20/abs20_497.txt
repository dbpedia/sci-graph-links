Abstract Some results of the double station television meteor observations provided in Kiev during the Perseid shower period in years 1991 â€“ 1993 are presented. The dependence of the beginning hights of meteors on their initial velocities based on 57 best reduced double station meteors is constructed. Exceptionaly great beginning heights of meteors are discussed, as well as the exceptional case of a Perseid bolide.
