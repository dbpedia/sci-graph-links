Abstract Attention is paid to structure preserving properties of transformations from a non-left-recursive context-free grammar to a Greibach normal form grammar. It is demonstrated that such a transformation cannot only be ambiguity preserving, but also both cover and functor relations between grammars or their associated syntax-categories can be obtained from such a transformation.
