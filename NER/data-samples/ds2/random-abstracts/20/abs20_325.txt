Abstract Reasoning from recent psycholinguistic research, it was predicted that discrimination between two monochromatic stimuli would be poorer when they belong to the same color category, better when they belong to different color categories in the language of the observer. Accordingly, it was predicted that hue discrimination functions vary systematically from one language community to the next to the extent that the different languages categorize the spectrum differently. Both predictions were supported by color labeling and discrimination measures obtained from speakers of English and of Tzotzil.
