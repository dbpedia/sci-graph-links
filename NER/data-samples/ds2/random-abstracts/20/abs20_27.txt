Abstract Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language may be read as a dialogic-agonal exchange with his precursor Nietzsche in their endeavors to demystify language-use. Wittgenstein’s contradictory relationship to Nietzsche has its origins in his borrowings from Fritz Mauthner. Nietzsche’s and Wittgenstein’s transvaluations of language occur most vividly via the metaphor of vision, semiological relationality, rules and the will.
