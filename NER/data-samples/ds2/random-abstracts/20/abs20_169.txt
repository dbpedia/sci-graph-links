Abstract This article is a contribution to the growing body of scholarly literature on scribal translation between dialects during the Middle English period. The output of one scribe, active in two late medieval manuscripts of different English poems (Gower's Confessio Amantis and the anonymous Gest Hystoriale of the Destruction of Troy), is subjected to analysis, and the reasons for the different linguistic behaviour evidenced in these two texts is investigated. The article concludes by drawing attention to the value of interdisciplinary collaboration between paleographers and philogists for the future development of both disciplines.
