Abstract Writing medical papers is a challenge in any language, but writing in a foreign language such as English can be especially difficult. This paper provides some suggestions on how to overcome common problems in preparing medical papers and presentations, for writers whose native language isn't English. Stylistic and grammatical peculiarities of the English language are considered, as well as Americanizations of Latin terminology, scientific (“international”) notation, variations in usage between Britain and the U.S.A., scientific and ethical standards of medical publications in English, and some resources for foreign-language researchers who want to compose papers or presentations in English.
