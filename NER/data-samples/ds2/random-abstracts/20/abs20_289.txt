Abstract Acanthocolpus liodorus Lühe, 1906 and Stephanostomoides tenuis (Manter, 1963) are reported from Chirocentrus dorab (Forsskål) for the first time from off New Caledonia. Stephanostomum noumeaense n. sp. from Carangoides dinema Bleeker is described with an uninterrupted ring of 34–42 circum-oral spines. It differs from other species with a similar circum-oral spine number and configuration, and a similar vitelline distribution, by its short cirrus-sac, not reaching close to the vitellarium. S. paratantabiddii n. sp. from Carangoides fulvoguttatus (Forsskål) is superficially similar to S. tantabiddii Bray & Cribb, 2004, with an interrupted ring of 34–39 circum-oral spines, but differs in its short genital atrium and cirrus-sac, the armament of the ejaculatory duct and the vitelline fields being interrupted at the level of the gonads. Stephanostomum carangi Liu, 1998 from Carangoides fulvoguttatus and S. hawaiiense Yamaguti, 1970 and S. nyoomwa Bray & Cribb, 2003 from Caranx sexfasciatus Quoy & Gaimard are reported from off New Caledonia for the first time, and their measurements are given.
