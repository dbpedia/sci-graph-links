Abstract This paper describes the parser, especially its mapping rule interpreter, used in KBMT-89. The interpreter is characterized by its ability to produce semantic and syntactic structures of a parse simultaneously and therefore more efficiently than other kinds of analyzers. Applicable forms of parser mapping rules, which map syntactic structures to semantic structures, are introduced. The parser, a modified version of Tomita's universal parser, is briefly described. Sample traces illustrate the functioning of the parser and mapping rule interpreter.
