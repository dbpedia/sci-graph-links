Abstract This study examined four universal operating principles for first language acquisition proposed by Slobin (1973) and MacWhinney (1978). The applicability of these principles to second-language acquisition was tested by teaching children and adults a miniature linguistic system. The results suggested that the four principles played a major role in the learning of the system by 5- to 7-year-olds but not by adults. Modifications were made in the standard miniature linguistic system technique in order in maximize linguistic naturalness and referentiality. The result was a complex system that could still be taught even to 5-year-olds in the space of a few hours.
