Abstract We consider the problem of forming descriptions of admissible processes in a dynamic system. As the language of the descriptions we use the language of regular expressions. We propose a method of analysis based on the use of a generator of the system language. We develop an algorithm for implementing the method that organizes a procedure for solving a matrix equation for the linguistic elements.
