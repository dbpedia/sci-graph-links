Abstract Twenty French-English and 16 Greek-English bilinguals were postcued to recall items from one or both of their languages. The usual phenomenon of superior recall of weak-language items was not observed. It was concluded that subjects give rehearsal priority to weak-language items when they are set to recall from both languages.
