Abstract The local adjunct grammars and languages have been introduced by Joshi, Kosaraju, and Yamada in response to linguistic considerations. These grammars differ fundamentally from the Chomsky phrase-structure grammars, and they generate a distinct class of languages. In this paper, it is shown that the local adjunct languages are actually closely related to the regular and context-free languages, despite the entirely different form of definition. The adjunct languages are obtained by closure of the finite set of strings under the set operations of union, product, and a new operation, “iterated adjunction.” This method of generating adjunct languages is of exactly the same form as that of the regular sets (closure under union, product, and Kleene star) and a more recent characterization of the CFL's derived independently by several authors. In fact, iterated adjunction is obtained by a natural modification of the “iterated substitution” operation used to generate the CFL's.
