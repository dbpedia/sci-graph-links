Abstract A Roman dominating function on a graph G is a function f : V(G) → {0, 1, 2} satisfying the condition that every vertex u for which f (u) = 0 is adjacent to at least one vertex v for which f (v) = 2. The weight of a Roman dominating function is the value $${f(V(G))=\sum_{u \in V(G)}f(u)}$$. The Roman domination number, γ R (G), of G is the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function on G. In this paper, we study graphs for which contracting any edge decreases the Roman domination number.
