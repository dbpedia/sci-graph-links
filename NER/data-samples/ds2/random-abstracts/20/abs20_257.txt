Abstract This study aims to examine whether the development of media literacy could effectively promote learners’ second language (L2) oral communicative competence. Although media literacy has been revealed to have several positive effects for language learning, research regarding its use for effective L2 oral communicative competence has been lacking particularly in Southeast Asia. Through a conversation analytic approach, this inquiry explores the nature of how media literacy could be fostered by teaching based on news broadcasts for L2 learners’ enhanced communicative competence. Data were collected through an online networking environment and analyzed based upon the emergent patterns to ascertain learners’ oral communicative competence in their target language. The results demonstrate that the development of media literacy facilitates learners’ L2 oral communicative competence from the practical and genuine linguistic input. Learners’ linguistic and operational competencies are also strengthened as Canale (1983) as well as Canale and Swain (1980) categorize as essential tools for effective communicative competence. The authentic language exposure that comes with the development of media literacy also assists learners in developing their L2 more efficiently through the gradual authentic scaffolding to leverage their L2 output for effective second language acquisition (SLA).
