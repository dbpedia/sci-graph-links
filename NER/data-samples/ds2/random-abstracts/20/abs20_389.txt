Abstract This study aims to explore the shifting roles of Standard English and World Englishes in the identity construction process of EFL learners. This was a qualitative study of two Taiwanese EFL undergraduate students in Taiwan, which synthesized the data from (1) three semi-structured interviews, (2) field notes, (3) an opinion survey, and (4) the participants’ reflections on journal articles. The two participants intellectually appreciated the idea of World Englishes but realized it was difficult to have a real sense of owning English. The data showed that the two participants had formed images of English native speakers and differently relied on their own values in order to identify their perceptions and feelings as English speakers within the EFL discourse. One aspired to become, or indeed saw herself as, an English-speaking American, whereas the other emphasized her Taiwanese EFL background. The findings implied that the two participants perceived non-native English speakers’ initial marginality, and thus the value of taking on a more privileged identity, to be followed by either social solitude, or empowerment within a Taiwanese context that did not necessarily embrace learners’ new English-influenced identity. EFL learners’ real understanding of the legitimacy of L1s and native culture, and their genuine and empowering awareness of the rich proliferation of World Englishes, should insofar as possible be placed at the center of foreign language education.
