Abstract Let $$D$$ D be a finite and simple digraph with vertex set $$V(D)$$ V(D) and arc set $$A(D)$$ A(D) . A signed Roman dominating function (SRDF) on the digraph $$D$$ D is a function $$f:V(D)\rightarrow \{-1,1,2\}$$ f:V(D)→{-1,1,2} satisfying the conditions that (i) $$\sum _{x\in N^-[v]}f(x)\ge 1$$ ∑x∈N-[v]f(x)≥1 for each $$v\in V(D)$$ v∈V(D) , where $$N^-[v]$$ N-[v] consists of $$v$$ v and all in-neighbors of $$v$$ v , and (ii) every vertex $$u$$ u for which $$f(u)=-1$$ f(u)=-1 has an in-neighbor $$v$$ v for which $$f(v)=2$$ f(v)=2 . The weight of an SRDF $$f$$ f is $$w(f)=\sum _{v\in V(D)}f(v)$$ w(f)=∑v∈V(D)f(v) . The signed Roman domination number $$\gamma _{sR}(D)$$ γsR(D) of $$D$$ D is the minimum weight of an SRDF on $$D$$ D . In this paper we initiate the study of the signed Roman domination number of digraphs, and we present different bounds on $$\gamma _{sR}(D)$$ γsR(D) . In addition, we determine the signed Roman domination number of some classes of digraphs. Some of our results are extensions of well-known properties of the signed Roman domination number $$\gamma _{sR}(G)$$ γsR(G) of graphs $$G$$ G .
