Summary Two song types were described for the Cuban Grassquit,Tiaris canora. A short song characterized by buzzy and harmonic rich syllables increased in the presence of males and was probably primarily aggressive in function. A second, longer song type, characterized by many pure-toned syllables, increased in the presence of females and was probably sexual in function. Pairs also participated in duet singing against territorial rivals, or as greeting ceremonies between mates after a period of separation. Duetting in Cuban Grassquits probably functions in maintenance of the pair bond. Comparisons were made with other avian species having different song types serving different functions.
