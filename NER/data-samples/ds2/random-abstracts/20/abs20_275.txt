Summary In this paper, we study the linguistic means that are acquired by two adult learners of a second language in order to express spatial concepts, and attempt to define the linguistic and communicational factors determining the observed acquisition. The data analysed come from the European Science Foundationâ€™s second language data base (Feldweg 1993), and they allow us to adopt both a longitudinal and a cross-linguistic approach: we compare the acquisition of Dutch and French by Moroccan learners. The results obtained are briefly compared and contrasted with those of previous work in a similar framework, in particular Carroll/Becker (1993).
