Abstract McNeill (1970) asserted recently that language was possible before the emergence of the symbolic function because such language is dependent upon the existence of strong linguistic universals. The syntactical category [N] is such a universal and does not depend upon cognitive or extra-linguistic causes. In the present paper three aspects of his argument are considered: (1) historical and grammatical evidence regarding the status of [N]; (2) empirical evidence that nouns are uniquely important in early child language and that they exhibit grammatical development during the holophrastic period; (3) the independence of cognition and language. Arguments in support of the interdependence and interaction of linguistic and cognitive factors during the acquisition period are presented.
