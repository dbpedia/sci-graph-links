Abstract The putative linguistic concerns of Niclas Ziegler figure prominently in de-scriptions of the Orthographic reform attributed to the Habsburg chanceries during the reign of Maximilian I. The essay introduces materials on Ziegler which require that his role in the history of the German language be redefined. This raises further questions about the contribution of the Habsburg chanceries to the emergence of the German common language.
