Summary Corn Bunting populations in Central England have 2 song types, during spontaneous singing they are sung approximately equally frequently and in bouts. Playback of song does not elicit song matching. The tendency to approach the source of playback wanes with repeated presentation of song — the birds habituate. The approach response is restored by playback of the other song type (dishabituation) — evidence that Corn Buntings can discriminate between song types. The functional significance of song types and the reason for differences in song type use between British and European populations remain unclear.
