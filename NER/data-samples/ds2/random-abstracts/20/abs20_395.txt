Abstract Graph language recognizability is defined and investigated by virtue of the syntactic magmoid, analogously with the syntactic monoid of a word language. In this setup, the syntax complexity of a given recognizable graph language can be determined, giving rise to a syntactic classification inside the class of recognizable graph languages.
