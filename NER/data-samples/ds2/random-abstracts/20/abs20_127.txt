Abstract This paper examines the historical and current connections between English language education policy and economic development policy in Singapore. Policy statements on English language education policy in Singapore are used to demonstrate the ways that English is given a role in economic development and modernization by government officials and educators. The discourse of policy statements on the economic utility and cultural value of languages is discussed with reference to Bourdieu’s concepts of capital and field. Comparative reference is made to policy statements on so-called “Mother Tongue.” The analysis provides background on language policy in Singapore and locates current reform efforts within that discourse.
