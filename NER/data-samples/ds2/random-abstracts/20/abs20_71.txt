Abstract I often passed the kindergarten on campus during my assignment as a teacher of English at the Sichuan Institute of Finance and Economics in Chengdu. Each time I marveled at the charm of the children as they intently learned while playing. I vowed to arrange a visit before my year was over. It was a bright April day in 1984 when my interpreter and I were welcomed to this busy place.
