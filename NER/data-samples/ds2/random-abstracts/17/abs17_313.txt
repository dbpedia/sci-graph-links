Abstract The characteristics and potential applications of a test assessing animals' behavioral responses to another individual placed in the neighboring sector of the cage, divided in half by a transparent partition with holes, are discussed. The animals' behavioral responses differed depending on the physiological and psychological state of an individual, its social experience, type of partner in the neighboring sector, and line. The “partition” test can be informative and productive in experiments designed to study the neurochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms of sociability, anxiety, olfaction, aggressive and sexual behavior, and in experiments addressing the psychotropic properties of agents.
