Abstract This paper describes a novel optical motion capture technique. Motion capture is a technique for producing a 3-D model of a human motion or action. Unlike the existent methods of motion capture, the presented technique neither performs camera calibration nor employs markers. Instead it makes use of a motion database, and, by retrieving the database, it recognizes the unknown motion of an observed human and it reproduces the motion by use of a digital human model. This new motion capture system may provide a simple and easy-to-use motion capture system. Performance of the proposed technique is shown experimentally.
