Abstract In this article the author draws from the empirical work done in clinical psychology, counseling, social work, social psychology, and behavior modification to construct a model of clinical social work intervention which takes into account how individual cognitive processes, perceptions, and other relevant intrapersonal and interpersonal factors influence the development, maintenance, and course of the interpersonal helping process. In keeping with the author's developmental orientation to the helping process, a variety of interpersonal and clinical skills are identified which the social worker must aquire and learn to exhibit effectively if treatment is to be successful.
