Summary A necessary and sufficient Fourier analytic condition is given for a real-valued LÃ©vy process X to be such that all perturbations, X+f, of X by measurable functions f have range with positive Lebesgue measure. The condition is compared to one due to Kesten for the range of X alone to have positive Lebesgue measure, and in some cases it is found to coincide, whereas in others it is stronger.
