Abstract A new test combination for presumptive phenospecies identification of mesophilic aeromonads by testing for suicidal activity in conjunction with esculin hydrolysis and gas production from glucose was evaluated. Of 40 clinical isolates ofAeromonas tested statically at 30 Â°C, seven were identified asAeromonas hydrophilia (non-suicidal, aerogenic, esculin positive), eight asAeromonas sobria (suicide variable, mostly aerogenic, esculin negative), and 25 asAeromonas caviae (suicidal, anaerogenic, esculin positive). The results corresponded exactly to those obtained with the conventional biochemical tests. The test combination was rapid and simple to perform.
