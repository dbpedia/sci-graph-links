Abstract We solve the oscillation stability problem for the Urysohn sphere, an analog of the distortion problem for â„“ 2 in the context of the Urysohn space U. This is achieved by solving a purely combinatorial problem involving a family of countable ultrahomogeneous metric spaces with finitely many distances.
