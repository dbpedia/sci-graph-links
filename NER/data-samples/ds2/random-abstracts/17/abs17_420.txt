Abstract Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) can induce immediate or — more often — delayed hypersensitivity. We report the case of 48-year old female admitted to the out-patient allergy clinic a day after her visit in a beauty parlour, where she had her eyelashes and eyebrows dyed with henna. Physical examination revealed prominent edema of the upper part of the face including forehead, cheeks and eyes causing severe narrowing of the palpebral chink. Skin prick tests (SPT) with common allergens were positive for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae and moulds, while the SPT with PPD was negative. Patch test to PPD was positive. Further investigations revealed eosinophilia in the tear fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PPD-induced contact blepharoconjunctivitis (CB) with concomitant increased eosinophilia in the tear fluid.
