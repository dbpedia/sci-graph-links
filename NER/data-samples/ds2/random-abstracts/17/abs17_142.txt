The author has modified a traditional pH titration laboratory experiment to an inquiry-based approach she learned in a PACT (Partnership for the Advancement of Chemical Technology) NSF-funded short course on analytical problem solving during the summer of 1996. In this modification, students are given an initial handout and asked to complete a short, attention-getting exercise. They must continue to work on logical, short exercises given to them one-at-a-time, in handout format, in order to complete the entire laboratory experiment. The inquiry-based approach is intended to increase studentsâ€™ comprehension of what they are doing in laboratory and why they are doing it.
