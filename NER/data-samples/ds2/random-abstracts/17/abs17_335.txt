Abstract Exploratory and survey research indicate that effective contraception requires specific cognitive and behavioral skills. Adolescents often lack these critical skills. Previous research documents an increase in adolescents' use of contraception following a skills-training program presented in intensive small-group format. The present study evaluated cognitive and behavioral skills training methods implemented with large groups (N> 20) in the natural environment. Findings support the feasibility of large-group procedures for helping adolescents cope with sexuality and, in particular, with contraception.
