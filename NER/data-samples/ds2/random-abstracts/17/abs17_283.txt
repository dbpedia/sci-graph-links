Abstract In this paper we investigate the upper bounds on the numbers of transitions of minimum and maximum spanning trees (MinST and MaxST for short) for linearly moving points. Here, a transition means a change on the combinatorial structure of the spanning trees. Suppose that we are given a set ofn points ind-dimensional space,S={p 1,p 2, ...p n }, and that all points move along different straight lines at different but fixed speeds, i.e., the position ofp i is a linear function of a real parametert. We investigate the numbers of transitions of MinST and MaxST whent increases from-∞ to +∞. We assume that the dimensiond is a fixed constant. Since there areO(n 2) distances amongn points, there are naivelyO(n 4) transitions of MinST and MaxST. We improve these trivial upper bounds forL 1 andL ∞ distance metrics. Letk p (n) (resp.) be the number of maximum possible transitions of MinST (resp. MaxST) inL p metric forn linearly moving points. We give the following results in this paper: κ1(n)=O(n 5/2 α(n)),κ ∞(n)=O(n 5/2 α(n)),, and where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann's function. We also investigate two restricted cases, i.e., thec-oriented case in which there are onlyc distinct velocity vectors for movingn points, and the case in which onlyk points move.
