Abstract Facial trauma is commonly associated with excessive consumption of alcohol and is often associated with interpersonal violence or motor vehicle accidents. Alcohol-related trauma presentation to hospitals causes a major service burden, and there have been efforts to reduce such trauma load with educational programs and social support. Brief alcohol intervention (BAI) in an acute setting (emergency department or trauma centre) has been shown as an effective means to reduce future alcohol intake and the incidence of future alcohol-related injuries, especially in the period immediately following injuries. Less is known about the potential benefit of BAI when provided by the surgical team in the same clinical context. This article explores the individual component of brief alcohol intervention and its provision by an acute surgical service by way of a narrative review. The progress of research into brief alcohol intervention for facial trauma patients is also reviewed. The methods and rationale behind screening patients for targeted BAI are discussed in a separate article.
