Abstract. We present a simple isospin invariant parametrization for $(B \to K\pi)$ decay amplitudes which consistently includes CP violation and (quasi-elastic) hadronic final state interactions. We find that the observed $(B \to K \pi)$ decays do not lead to a significant bound on the angle $\gamma $ of the unitarity triangle. On the other hand, we claim that a sizeable CP violation asymmetry in $(B^\pm \to K\pi^\pm)$ rates is by no means excluded.
