Abstract The authors evaluated the effects of brief group cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (G-CBT-I) in outpatients with psychophysiological insomnia (PPI). This brief G-CBT-I was designed to yield results in a shorter period of time, because its strategy was intended to lower the dropout rate and enhance the cost performance. And also, it was intended to be easy to make use of CBT-I for both therapists and patients. This process consists of four components and only two sessions weekly, and a total therapy time is approximately 3 h. Thirty-three participants (including 17 women) with PPI received G-CBT-I therapy. The short-term outcome (4 weeks after G-CBT-I) was measured using sleep logs, actigraphy, the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-J), and the Japanese version of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-J). The long-term outcome was evaluated by checking medical records at 6 months after G-CBT-I. At 4 weeks after G-CBT-I, subjective sleep onset latency decreased by 32.1%, and objective sleep efficiency increased to approximately 90%. The dissociation between subjective and objective evaluations of sleep decreased. The total score of the PSQI-J and the scores on the DBAS-J (“consequences of insomnia”, “control and predictability of sleep”, and “sleep-promoting practice”) were decreased. At the long-term follow-up, the amount of hypnotics needed by each participant decreased by 0.6 mg (1 being equivalent to 1 mg of flunitrazepam) (33% reduction). These findings suggested that patients with PPI could derive significant benefit from brief G-CBT-I therapy.
