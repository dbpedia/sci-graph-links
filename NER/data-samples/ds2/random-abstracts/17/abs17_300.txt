Summary Based on the internal variable theory, a viscoelastic constitutive model of a highly deformable continuous medium is proposed. A set of second rank tensorial internal state variables corresponding to Biot's strain is introduced, and a nonlinear evolution law for these internal variables is suggested. The proposed model may be considered as an extension of the network theory of rubber elasticity to take the viscous effects into account. In order to verify the validity of the present model, uniaxial tension tests for HDPE are carried out at different strain rates. The prediction of the present model shows a good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, a discussion of the present constitutive model is given. It is found that the present constitutive model is more flexible to describe the strain rate sensitivity of polymeric materials in a wide range of strain rates.
