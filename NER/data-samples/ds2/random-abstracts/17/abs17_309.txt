Abstract BackgroundThe present study was designed to investigate whether there is a correlation between manual skills in laparoscopic procedures and manual skills in flexible endoscopy. MethodsIn a prospective study using laparoscopy and endoscopy simulators (MIST-VR, and GI-Mentor II), 24 consecutive subjects (gastrointestinal surgeons, novice and experienced gastroenterologists, and untrained subjects) were asked to perform laparoscopic and endoscopic tasks. Their performance was assessed by the simulators’ software and by observers blinded to the levels of subjects’ experience. Performance in experienced vs inexperienced subjects was compared. Score pairs of three parameters—time, errors, and economy of movement—were also compared. ResultsExperienced subjects performed significantly better than inexperienced subjects on both tasks in terms of time, errors, and economy of movement (p < 0.05). All three performance parameters in laparoscopy and endoscopy correlated significantly (p < 0.02). ConclusionBoth simulators can distinguish between experienced and inexperienced subjects. Observed skills in simulated laparoscopy correlate with skills in simulated flexible endoscopy. This finding may have an impact on the design of training programs involving both procedures.
