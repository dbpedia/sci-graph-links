Abstract A program for investigating the capabilities of automatic scanning of bubble chamber photographs is described. The program consists of two routines: the first (PHOTO) simulates the operation of a film-reading device; the second (ASINI: Automatic Scanning and Identification of Nuclear Interactions) identifies the tracks on the pictures simulated by PHOTO. Experimental results indicate the possibility of pratical implementation of the proposed recognition method.
