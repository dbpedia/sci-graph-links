Abstract The effects of varying CO2 concentration, and intervals between CO2 presentations, were determined from the performance by five pigeons of a learned motor act which eliminates CO2 from the inspired air. The length of time from the onset of an externally-produced increase in inspired CO2 to the performance of the learned motor response terminating the CO2 presentation was inversely related to the CO2 concentration presented (3 per cent and 5 per cent) and directly related to the inter-trial interval (3 minutes and 1.5 minutes). Chemoreceptors on the ventrolateral surfaces of the medulla are postulated to be the initial site of stimulation in the chain of events leading to the behavioral bioregulation of inspired CO2 concentration.
