Abstract The present study evaluated the effectiveness of two cognitive strategies for the enhancement of self-esteem. Twenty-four subjects were assigned to one of four groups: (a) cognitive restructuring, in which individuals were trained at identifying and criticizing the negative ideas about themselves; (b) cognitive rehearsal, in which subjects underwent a program consisting of identifying and rehearsing statements about positive personal characteristics; (c) self-observation, in which subjects were given practice in self-observing thoughts associated with positive and negative feelings about themselves; and (d) delayed treatment control, which consisted of administering both cognitive strategies to subjects after the posttest. Following a 4-week treatment phase, there were no significant differences in the enhancement of self-esteem and the reduction of depressive feelings in the case of either of the cognitive strategies. No significant therapeutic advantage was observed in combining both these procedures. In comparison with the self-observation group, only the cognitive treatment groups fared significantly better than the waiting-list control group. The relationship between cognitive restructuring and cognitive rehearsal and the role of self-observation in these procedures are discussed. It is suggested that the feelings of self-worth are more strongly influenced by the quality than by the quantity of self-appraisals.
