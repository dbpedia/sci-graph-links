Abstract We study the effective kinetic energy of scalar fields for two classes fo supersymmetric theories. In theories with very large VEVs of scalar fields, as proposed by Witten, the use of the renormalization group improved effective action prevents the appearance of negative norm states. For simpler theories a general criterium for the absence of negative norm states is given, which is violated in a model withO(N)â€”symmetry proposed recently.
