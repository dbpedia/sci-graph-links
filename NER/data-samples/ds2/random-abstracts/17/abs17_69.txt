Abstract The anomalies in second order elastic constants have been derived for barium titanate for the phase transition from orthorhombic to rhombohedral state. The equilibrium values of order parameter, strain variables and fluctuations in order parameter have been derived using stability conditions and Landau-Khalatnikov equations respectively. Expression for shift in specific heat is obtained. All the anomalies in second order elastic constants have been derived and relations among them reported. The numerical values of anomalies in the individual constants are calculated and their variation is represented graphically. Changes in elastic constants occur over a range of temperature of the order 10âˆ’2K.
