Abstract. We establish an integral test involving only the distribution of the increments of a random walk S which determines whether limsup n →∞(S n /n κ ) is almost surely zero, finite or infinite when 1/2<κ<1 and a typical step in the random walk has zero mean. This completes the results of Kesten and Maller [9] concerning finiteness of one-sided passage times over power law boundaries, so that we now have quite explicit criteria for all values of κ≥0. The results, and those of [9], are also extended to Lévy processes.
