Summary ECRC forms violet coloured chelates with aluminium(III) and gallium(III) with λmax 540 nm and 550 nm respectively at pH 4.5 and 3.5. The metal ligand ratio in both the cases has been found to be 1∶1. The chelates of aluminium and gallium are stable between pH 3.5 to 5.5 and pH 2.7 to 6.0 respectively. The apparent stability constants are 104.9 (pH 4.5) and 104.8 (pH 3.8) respectively for the aluminium and gallium chelates at 25°. The range of concentration for adherence toBeer's law, the effective range of photometric determination and the molar absorptivities are 0.27 to 0.97 p. p. m.; 0.18 to 0.97 p. p. m. and 3.20 · 104 for aluminium, and 0.093 to 2.52 p. p. m.; 0.46 to 2.52 p. p. m. and 2.20 ·104 for gallium respectively.
