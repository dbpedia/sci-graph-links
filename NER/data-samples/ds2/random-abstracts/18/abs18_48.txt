Abstract Statically permissible stress fields of metal are obtained when drawing continuous axisymmetric profiles in conical matrices; the Amonton-Coulomb frictional law and strain hardening are taken into account here. On that basis, a method for analysis of the stress state is developed. The stress distributions at the contact surface and in the volume of the deformed metal are determined. The dependence of the load coefficient in the central layers on the drawing parameters is established.
