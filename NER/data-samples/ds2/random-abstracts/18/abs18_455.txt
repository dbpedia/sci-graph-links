Abstract The present work is a generalization of the recent work [arXiv.1206.1420] on the modified Hawking temperature on the event horizon. Here the Hawking temperature is generalized by multiplying the modified Hawking temperature by a variable parameter $$\alpha $$ Î± representing the ratio of the growth rate of the apparent horizon to that of event horizon. It is found that both the first and the generalized second law of thermodynamics are valid on the event horizon for any fluid distribution. Subsequently, the Bekenstein entropy is modified on the event horizon and the thermodynamical laws are examined. Finally, an interpretation of the parameters involved is presented.
