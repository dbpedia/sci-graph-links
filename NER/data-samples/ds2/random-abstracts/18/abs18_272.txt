Abstract ISO 9000 does not require the revision of functional tasks or modes of operation of metrological services for quality management. Documented control procedures for inspection, measuring, and test equipment can be considered a subsystem of total quality management. The satisfaction of legal requirements for the assurance of measurement uniformity is a priority in metrological activity at factories.
