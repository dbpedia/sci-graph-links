Abstract It is pointed out that the Horton–Rogers–Lapwood problem becomes singular when a Newtonian fluid is replaced by a standard power-law fluid. It is shown how this singularity can be removed. When this is done, the nanofluid effects due to thermophoresis and Brownian motion become independent of the power-law index.
