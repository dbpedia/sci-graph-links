We study random lifts of a graph G as defined in [1]. We prove a 0-1 law which states that for every graph G either almost every lift of G has a perfect matching, or almost none of its lifts has a perfect matching. We provide a precise description of this dichotomy. Roughly speaking, the a.s. existence of a perfect matching in the lift depends on the existence of a fractional perfect matching in G. The precise statement appears in Theorem 1.
