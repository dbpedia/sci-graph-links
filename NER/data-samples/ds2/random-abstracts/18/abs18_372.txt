Abstract In this paper, we essentially compute the set of x,y>0 such that the mapping $z\longmapsto(1-r+re^{z})^{x}(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda-z})^{y}$ is a Laplace transform. If X and Y are two independent random variables which have respectively Bernoulli and Gamma distributions, we denote by μ the distribution of X+Y. The above problem is equivalent to finding the set of x>0 such that μ *x exists.
