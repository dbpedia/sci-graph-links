Summary The application of 2-pyridyl-2-thienyl-β-ketoxime to the spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of palladium(II) is described. The effects due to pH, time, reagent concentration, temperature and diverse ions are reported. Beer's law is obeyed in the range of 0.15 to 2.10 ppm and the molar extinction coefficient at 433 nm is 9.18×103.
