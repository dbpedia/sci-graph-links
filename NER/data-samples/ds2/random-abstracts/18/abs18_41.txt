Abstract Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is used to calculate the driving-point impedance of the circular groove guide diode mount. A simple way is proposed to approximate the curvilinear metal boundary of circular groove guide. Discrete equations are obtained from the Ampere's law and Faraday's law. Perfectly matched layer (PML) is applied on the open boundary of circular groove guide. At last program is made to obtain the field components. The driving-point impedance can be achieved from the ratio of the Fourier transform of the voltage and the Fourier transform of the current. The cutoff frequency and field pattern of the dominant mode are also obtained with well agreement with the theoretical results, this verifies the validity of the FDTD program.
