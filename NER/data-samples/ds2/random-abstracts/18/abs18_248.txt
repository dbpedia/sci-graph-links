Summary It has been established that 1-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyiminoethyl)-1-quinolinium chloride, 1-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyiminoethyl)-1-isoqui-nolinium chloride, 1-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyiminoethyl)-1-(4′-methyl)-quinolinium chloride and 1-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyiminoethyl)-1-(6′-methyl)quinolinium chloride react with palladium(II) chloride in the pH range 3.3–7.1 and form yellow water-soluble 1∶1 complexes with maximum absorbance at 413 nm. The conditional stability constants of the complexes at the optimum pH of 6.5 are all about 104.7, and the molar absorptivities are in the range 2.2–2.6×103 l·l mole−1·cm−1 at pH 6.5 and 413 nm. Beer's law is obeyed up to 3–4×10−4 M oxime concentration, depending on the oxime determined.
