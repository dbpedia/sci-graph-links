Summary For fixed design regression data kernel estimation is widely used to estimate μ(v)(t), thev-th derivative of μ(t). Denoting such an estimator by $$\hat \mu _{nv} (t),$$ this paper is concerned with the almost sure convergence of $$\hat \mu _{nv} (t) - E\hat \mu _{nv} (t)$$ . It is shown that under several inserting procedures a law of iterated logarithm holds.
