Summary A spectrophotometric method for the micro-determination of bromate ions has been described. A red colored complex is obtained when 3 ml of 5% antipyrine, 3 ml of 60% perchloric acid and 1 ml of 0.1M sodium nitrite solution are added in a solution containing bromate ions. The maximum absorbance occurs at 525 nm. Beer's law is obeyed for solutions containing 25.0–140.0μ/ml of bromate ions. Sensitivity has been found to be 0.029μg BrO3 −/cm2 for logI 0/I=0.04 with a molar absorptivity of 2·103 moles−1, cm−1. liter. As(III), Ce(IV), Fe(III), CrO4 2−, Cr2O7 2−, and Cl− interfere in the determination.
