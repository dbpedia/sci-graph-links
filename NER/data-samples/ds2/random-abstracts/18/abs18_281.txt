u ,∇u)=f, is to take the average onto the same mesh of the two equations of the mixed form, the conservation law div p=f and the constitutive law p=ϕ(u,∇u). In this paper, we perform the numerical analysis of two Keller-like box-schemes for the one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation cu x −ɛu xx =f. In the first one, introduced by B. Courbet in [9,10], the numerical average of the diffusive flux is upwinded along the sign of the velocity, giving a first order accurate scheme. The second one is fourth order accurate. It is based onto the Euler-MacLaurin quadrature formula for the average of the diffusive flux. We emphasize in each case the link with the SUPG finite element method.
