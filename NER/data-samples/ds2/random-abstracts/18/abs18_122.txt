Abstract. In usual probability theory, various characterizations of the Gaussian law have been obtained. For instance, independence of the sample mean and the sample variance of independently identically distributed random variables characterizes the Gaussian law and the property of remaining independent under rotations characterizes the Gaussian random variables. In this paper, we consider the free analogue of such a kind of characterizations replacing independence by freeness. We show that freeness of the certain pair of the linear form and the quadratic form in freely identically distributed noncommutative random variables, which covers the case for the sample mean and the sample variance, characterizes the semicircle law. Moreover we give the alternative proof for Nica's result that the property of remaining free under rotations characterizes a semicircular system. Our proof is more direct and straightforward one.
