Summary It is shown that a thermodynamic yield criterion, previously proposed by the author for a specific model of viscoplasticity, may be derived from the Clausius-Planck inequality for a very general model of plasticity, rate-dependent or rate-independent, provided only that a flow rule (as defined in the paper) exists. Special cases of the yield criterion thus derived include the Schmid law and the von Mises criterion. Moreover, under appropriate assumptions the thermodynamic yield stress may be identified with the Frank-Read source activation stress.
