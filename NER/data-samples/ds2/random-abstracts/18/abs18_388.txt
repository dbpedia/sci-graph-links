Summary An attempt has been made to determine the flow curve of fluids obeying the power law rheological model on a rolling ball viscometer. The theoretical analysis is based on the hydrodynamical model developed byLewis in 1956 for the purpose of rolling ball viscometer calibration and extended in 1964 byTurian andBird for the two-parametric power law model. The shear rate variation has been accomplished on varying the tube angle of inclination. Experiments performed on an adapted, commercialHoeppler viscometer with aqueous solutions of carboxymethylcellulose and polyacrylamide reproduced the flow curves obtained simultaneously on rotational and capillary instruments with reasonable accuracy.
