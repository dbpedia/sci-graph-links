Summary A method for rapid extraction and spectrophotometric determination of cerium (IV) is described. The cerium-N-p-tolylbenzo-hydroxamic acid complex is extracted into chloroform at the pH 8.4 to 9.8. Maximum absorbance occurs between 460 and 470 nm. The values are reproducible at 465 nm and Beer's law is obeyed at this wavelength over the range of 0.03–40,μ per ml of the cerium(VI). The molar absorptivity of the cerium-p-TBHA complex is 4.6×103 l · mole−1 · cm−2 at 465. An attempt has been made to determine the cerium in sea water.
