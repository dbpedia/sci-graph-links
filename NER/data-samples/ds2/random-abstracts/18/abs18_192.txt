Summary LetX 1,X 2, ... be a sequence of independent random variables with common lattice distribution functionF having zero mean, and let (S n ) be the random walk of partial sums. The strong law of large numbers (SLLN) implies that for any α∈ℝ and ε>0 $$Pm: = P\{ S_n > \alpha + \varepsilon n {\text{for some }}n \geqq m\} $$ decreases to 0 asm increases to ∞. Under conditions on the moment generating function ofF, we obtain the convergence rate by determiningp m up to asymptotic equivalence. When α=0 and ε is a point in the lattice forF, the result is due to Siegmund [Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor. Verw. Geb.31, 107–113 (1975); but this restriction on ε precludes all small values of ε, and these values are the most interesting vis-à-vis the SLLN. Even when α=0 our result handles important distributionsF for which Siegmund's result is vacuous, for example, the two-point distributionF giving rise to simple symmetric random walk on the integers. We also identify for both lattice and non-lattice distributions the behavior of certain quantities in the asymptotic expression forp m as ε decreases to 0.
