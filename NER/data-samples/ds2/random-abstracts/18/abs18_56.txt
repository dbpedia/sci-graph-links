Abstract The minimum orders of degree-continuous graphs with prescribed degree sets were investigated by Gimbel and Zhang, Czechoslovak Math. J. 51 (126) (2001), 163â€“171. The minimum orders were not completely determined in some cases. In this note, the exact values of the minimum orders for these cases are obtained by giving improved upper bounds.
