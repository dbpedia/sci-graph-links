Summary Palladium chloride was determined spectrophotometrically withβ-ethylthioethylenethioglycolic acid (β-ETETGA) and ethylene-bis-thioglycolic acid (EBTGA) in acid medium. The Pd-β-ETETGA system obeys Beer's law in the range 0.5–5.0μg/ml and Pd-EBTGA system obeys Beer's law in the range 0.4–8.0μg/ml. Determination of palladium in presence of many “associated metals” and many anions is reported.
