Summary Let {Y i} be iid with EY 1=0, EY 12=1. Let {Xi} be iid normal mean zero, variance one random variables. According to Strassen's first almost sure invariance principle {X i} and {Y i} can be reconstructed on a new probability space without changing the distribution of each sequence such that $$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {Y_i - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {X_i } = o(n{\text{ }}\log _2 n)^{1/2} } $$ a.s., thus improving on the trivial bound obtainable from the law of the iterated logarithm: $$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {Y_i - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {X_i } = O(n{\text{ }}\log _2 n)^{1/2} } $$ a.s. In this work we establish analogous improvements for symmetric {Y i} in the domain of normal attraction to a symmetric stable law with index 0<α<2. (We make this assumption of symmetry in order to avoid messy details concerning centering constants.) Let {X i} be iid symmetric stable random variables with index 0<α<2. Then, for example, hypotheses are stated which imply for a given γ satisfying 2>γ≧α that $$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {Y_i - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {X_i } = o(n^{1/\gamma } )} $$ a.s., thus improving on the trivial bound: $$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {Y_i - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {X_i } = o(n^{1/\alpha + \varepsilon } )} $$ a.s., ɛ>0.
