Abstract â€‚A system consisting of an elastic matrix with randomly distributed pores of uniform shapes but with sizes governed by a power-law distribution is investigated in a theoretical way. The velocities of elastic waves propagating through such a system are calculated. The obtained results are that the velocities decrease with increasing total porosity and for a given porosity velocities moderately decrease with increasing absolute value of the exponent D in a power-law distribution of pore sizes.
