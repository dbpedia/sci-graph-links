Summary The role played by conservation laws and selection rules is analyzed for production and annihilation of antinucleons. The cross sections for these processes are developed in terms of the independent cross sections for the transitions which conserve the total isotopic spin. In addition, the initial and final states are analyzed and selection rules are stated for the different processes.
