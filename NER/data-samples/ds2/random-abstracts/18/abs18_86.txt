Abstract We report on a universal pattern observed in the collapse dynamics of a sand heap. Collapse dynamics of a three-dimensional sand heap were studied through experiments and numerical simulations. A phenomenological law that describes the shape of a collapsed sand heap was found, we call this the geometric constitutive law of friction. The law is summarized as the linear relation between the frictional coefficient and the local horizontal curvature.
