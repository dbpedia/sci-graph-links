Summary The law of radioactive decay is derived along the lines originally proposed by Wigner and Weisskopf. It is found that the use of the Laplace transform permits a more exact evaluation of the probability amplitude of the decaying state than the original derivation. Nonexponential behaviour is obtained for very short and very long times. The uncertainty principle precludes observation of the short-time deviation from the exponential (as we demonstrate); this is the resolution of a proposed paradox. The long-time deviation becomes substantial only after an enormous number of lifetimes and is thus not observable in practice.
