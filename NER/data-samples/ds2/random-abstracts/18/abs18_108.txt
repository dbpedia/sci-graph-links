Abstract We deal with a class of Lipschitz vector functions U = (u 1, . . . , u h ) whose components are nonnegative, disjointly supported and verify an elliptic equation on each support. Under a weak formulation of a reflection law, related to the Pohoz̆aev identity, we prove that the nodal set is a collection of C 1,α hyper-surfaces (for every 0 < α < 1), up to a residual set with small Hausdorff dimension. This result applies to the asymptotic limits of reaction–diffusion systems with strong competition interactions, to optimal partition problems involving eigenvalues, as well as to segregated standing waves for Bose–Einstein condensates in multiple hyperfine spin states.
