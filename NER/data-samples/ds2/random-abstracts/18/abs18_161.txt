Abstract. In this paper we prove the free analog of the Lévy-Itô decomposition for Lévy processes. A significant part of the proof consists of introducing free Poisson random measures, proving their existence and developing a theory of integration with respect to such measures. The existence of free Poisson random measures also yields, via the free Lévy-Itô decomposition, an alternative proof of the general existence of free Lévy processes (in law).
