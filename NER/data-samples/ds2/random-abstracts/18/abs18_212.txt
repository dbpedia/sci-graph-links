Abstract This paper presents a framework for formulating frame-free constitutive laws for simple materials accounting for thermal effects. It is shown how memory can be modeled within this framework and fading memory is given as an example. The restrictions that the second law of thermodynamics on the constitutive laws for materials with fading memory are found using the Colemanâ€“Noll procedure. It is shown that materials with fading memory, when undergoing a process that is long and slow enough can be approximated in some sense. Finally, equilibrium states are considered and under weak assumptions the familiar relations from thermostatics are obtained.
