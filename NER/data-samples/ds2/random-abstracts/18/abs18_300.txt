Abstract Standard hypoplasticity is examined with respect to the thermodynamic requirement of non-negative energy dissipation. We introduce a stress energy function and derive a dissipation inequality in terms of the stress-dependent operators of the hypoplastic law. A general form for the non-linear operator is also found, which makes it straightforward to construct thermodynamically consistent hypoplasticity laws. We further examine the subclass of hypoplasticity where the linear term is non-dissipative and construct some examples of hypoplastic laws based on a quadratic stress energy function.
