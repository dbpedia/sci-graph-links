Summary LetX 1,X 2,... be a sequence of independent random variables with common distribution functionF having zero mean, and let (S n ) be the random walk of partial sums. The weak and strong laws of large numbers, respectively, imply that for any α∈ℝ and ε>0 the probabilitiesP{S m >α+εm} and $$Pm: = P\{ S_n > \alpha + \varepsilon n {\text{for some }}n \geqq m\} $$ tend to 0 asm tends to ∞. Building upon work of Bahadur and Ranga Rao [Ann. Math. Stat.31, 1015–1027 (1960)], Siegmund [Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor. Verw. Geb.31, 107–113 (1975)], and Fill and Wichura [Probab. Th. Rel. Fields81, 189–212 (1989)], we produce complete asymptotic expansions for the probabilitiesP{S m >α+εm} andp m .
