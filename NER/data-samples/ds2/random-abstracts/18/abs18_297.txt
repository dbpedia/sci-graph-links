Abstract There is increasing interest in the role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment, particularly where measurements are in support of fair trade, health & safety and the environment. A lack of clarity, however, in treating measurement uncertainties and in setting specification limits for compliance may sometimes lead to drastic consequences. Examples concerning conformity assessment, particularly in the measurement of trace quantities (Cd in plastics and antibiotic trace residues in shrimps), are amongst cases identified in the ongoing EU project MetroTrade, which can be significant impediments to international trade. This paper considers the present status of the role of measurement uncertainty in conformity testing, covering both recent work in international standardisation and physical metrology (e.g. OIML recommendations on weighing). One conclusion is that, while much has been achieved, there still exists some work to be done in order to facilitate acceptance of conformity from both customer and supplier and avoid perceived barriers to trade and serious international trade disputes.
