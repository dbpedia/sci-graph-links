Abstract A natural coordinate system is introduced for the analysis of the global stability of the Hardy-Weinberg (HW) polymorphism under the general multilocus additive viability model. A global convergence criterion is developed and used to prove that the HW polymorphism is globally stable when each of the loci is diallelic, provided the loci are overdominant and the multilocus recombination is positive. As a corollary the multilocus Hardy-Weinberg law for neutral selection is derived.
