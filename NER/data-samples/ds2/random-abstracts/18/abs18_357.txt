Abstract The new superspace of Wess and Zumino is generalized to the unconstrainedN-extendedD-dimensional case, it amounts actually to a reparametrization of the old superspace. Recurrence relations for the transformation law and for the covariant derivatives of the superfields defined in the new superspace are obtained. The definition of the component fields as local Lorentz covariant fields has the consequence that the gauge covariant expressions obtained for the vielbein and the connection of the new superspace don't contain the terms dropped out in the Wess-Zumino gauge of supergravity.
