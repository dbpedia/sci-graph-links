Abstract. Many watermarking techniques have been proposed for digital video and digital broadcast video. In general, they address the seller's or broadcaster's concerns, such as copyright-violation deterrence, copyright-violation detection and copy protection. Some of them provide for data integrity (tamper proofing), which is a shared concern of both subscriber and broadcaster. In all these cases, the watermark generation and embedding is performed or controlled by the seller or broadcaster. Therefore, a broadcaster with malicious intentions could, with manipulation, falsely implicate an innocent subscriber in copyright violation. This could be a major concern for subscribers. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution to manage the broadcaster's copyright and subscriber's false-implication concern (subscriber's rights) for digital video broadcasts. The proposed novel approach makes use of interactive watermarking techniques and protocols to help protect digital rights of all parties involved in video broadcasting.
