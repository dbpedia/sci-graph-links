Summary A bounding-surface plasticity model is formulated in stress space in a general enough manner to accommodate a considerable range of hardening mechanisms. Conditions are then established under which this formulation can be made equivalent to its strain-space analogue. Special cases of the hardening law are discussed next, followed by a new criterion to ensure nesting. Finally, correlations with experimental data are investigated.
