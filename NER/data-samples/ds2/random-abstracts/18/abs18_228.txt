Abstract. For an irrational number x and n ≥ 1, we denote by k n (x) the exact number of partial quotients in the continued fraction expansion of x given by the first n decimals of x. G. Lochs proved that for almost all x, with respect to the Lebesgue measure $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{k_n(x)}{n}=\frac{6 \log 2 \log 10}{\pi^2}.$$ In this paper, we prove that an iterated logarithm law for {k n (x): n ≥ 1}, more precisely, for almost all x, $$\mathop{\lim\sup}_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{k_n(x)-\frac{6\, {\rm log}\, 2 \,{\rm log}\, 10}{\pi^2}n}{\sigma \sqrt{2n\log\log n}}=1,$$ $$\mathop{\lim\inf}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{k_n(x)-\frac{6 \, {\rm log}\, 2 \, {\rm log}\,10}{\pi^2}n}{\sigma \sqrt{2n\log\log n}}=-1,$$ for some constant σ > 0.
