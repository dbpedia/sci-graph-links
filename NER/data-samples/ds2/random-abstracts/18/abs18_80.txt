Abstract In a first order approximation the influence of meridional circulations in a spherical shell on the radial dependence of the angular velocity is studied. Due to stationarity the flux of angular momentum which is transported through any sphere by the circulations must be cancelled by the flux of angular momentum due to turbulent friction. If the circulation goes equatorward at the outer surface the law of rotation must be such that angular momentum is transported in outward direction through the sphere.
