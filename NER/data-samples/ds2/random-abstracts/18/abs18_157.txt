Abstract. Let f n denote a kernel density estimator of a bounded continuous density f in the real line. Let Î¨(t) be a positive continuous function such that Under natural smoothness conditions, necessary and sufficient conditions for the sequence \scriptstyle{t\inR/}\big|\Psi(t)(fn(t)-Efn(t))\big| (properly centered and normalized) to converge in distribution to the double exponential law are obtained. The proof is based on Gaussian approximation and a (new) limit theorem for weighted sup-norms of a stationary Gaussian process. This extends well known results of Bickel and Rosenblatt to the case of weighted sup-norms, with the sup taken over the whole line. In addition, all other possible limit distributions of the above sequence are identified (subject to some regularity assumptions).
