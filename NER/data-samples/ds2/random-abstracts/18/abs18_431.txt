Abstract Taylor's power law (y=am b) was used to analyze the spatial pattern ofBoophilus microplus (Canestrini) larvae in tropical pastures. The index of aggregationb was 2.75 and showed that larvae were highly aggregated. Theb-values differed significantly among certain pastures (LSD,P<0.05), and pasture type and use could have contributed to differences inb. The use of Taylor's power law to adjust for sampling inconsistencies that occur in tropical pastures where regimented sampling cannot always be followed is discussed.
