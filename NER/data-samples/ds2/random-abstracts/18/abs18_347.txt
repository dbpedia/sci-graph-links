Abstract In Japan, there was a drastic change in food control system, which was brought about by problems with BSE. Food Safety Basic Law was newly enacted and Food Hygiene Law, Japanese Agricultural Standards Law and so on were revised. Food Safety Commission was newly established for risk assessment, and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare were reorganized on food safety. National Food Research Institute (NFRI) works for improvement of technology for food analysis, development of technology to ensure food safety and so on. Objects of food analysis are inorganic elements, acrylamide, mycotoxins, functional components, genetically modified organisms, varieties of rice and so on. Proficiency testing schemes (PTs) were introduced to NFRI for reliability of food analysis. Certified reference materials (CRMs) of food related materials prepared in Japan, and PTs provided by Japanese organization were limited. It is requested for Japanese organizations to prepare new CRMs and provide many kinds of PTs for solution of peculiar problems.
