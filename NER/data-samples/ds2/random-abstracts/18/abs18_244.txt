Abstract Homogeneous cosmological models of all Bianchi types with a general (nondiagonal) metric are considered near the singularity. The spaces are filled with an arbitrary sourceless six-component electromagnetic field (EMF) and a perfect fluid at rest. It is shown that in the general case the models of types VI0, VII0, VIII, and IX have an oscillatory regime. The models of all the other types have Kasner asymptotics. The main result of the present paper is the derivation of the law of rotation of the Kasner axes.
