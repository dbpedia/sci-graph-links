Abstract COMPTEL on board CGRO has observed a very strong (S[> 0.3 MeV] = 2.03 × 10−4 erg cm−2), complex, and long lasting (162 s) gamma-ray burst on February 17, 1994 (GRB 940217). Temporal fluctuations occur on timescales as short as 100 ms. Hard-to-soft spectral evolution has been observed during the burst emission and also within individual peaks. The photon spectra obtained within the 6 peaks can be modelled by single power law spectra and by broken power laws with break energies at around 1 MeV. The best-fit power law slopes vary between 1.1 and 3.5 throughout the event. The burst is located at [α 2000,δ 2000] = [29.5°, 3.8°] with a 3σ error radius of 0.9°. COMPTEL does not detect any significant “post-burst” emission (as reported by EGRET) at low energies (< 30 MeV), and our upper limits are marginally consistent with the EGRET detections. Using high energy spectral and temporal information, distance limits to GRB 940217 have been derived.
