Abstract I analyze a quiet-Sun magnetogram with an orthogonal wavelet transform, which allows me to define an entropy measure. The entropy measure of the magnetogram as a function of spatial scale obeys a scaling law, which leads to a fractal dimension ofD f = 1.7. Furthermore, the entropy scaling law is directly related to the intermittency of magnetic features, which increases for decreasing spatial scales, as expected for a turbulent signal. In this context, the scaling law parameter can be interpreted as a fractional reduction in volume from one step of the turbulent cascade to the next.
