Abstract An analytical solution to the partially plastic deformation of a nonlinearly hardening wide curved bar is derived. The bar considered has a narrow rectangular cross-section and is under pure bending. The analytical treatment is based on Trescaâ€™s yield criterion, its associated flow rule and a Swift-type nonlinear hardening law. Taking numerical limits, the complete solution is verified in comparison to the linear hardening solution available in the literature.
