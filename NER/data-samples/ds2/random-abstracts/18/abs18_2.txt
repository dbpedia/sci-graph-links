Abstract In this paper we present new results related to various equivalencies of the reverse order law $${(AB)^{\dag} = B^{\dag} A^{\dag}}$$ for the Moore–Penrose inverse for operators on Hilbert spaces. Some finite dimensional results given by Tian (Int J Math Educ Sci Technol 37(3):331–339, 2007) are extended to infinite dimensional settings; also some new more general relations are proved.
