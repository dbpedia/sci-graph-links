Summary The red complex formed between hafnium(IV) and 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (1 ∶ 2) at pH 4.0 is used for Spectrophotometric determination of hafnium., the absorbance being measured at 545 nm. Beer's law is obeyed for hafnium concentration of 0.2 to 3.6μg per ml. Molar absorptivity is 3.86×104 and Sandell sensitivity is 0.0046μg per cm2. Hafnium has been determined in the presence of 6-fold amounts of zirconium. The relative standard deviation is ± 1.0%.
