Abstract ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the importance of cytochrome P 450 enzymes for the reported interaction between tramadol and warfarin. Materials and methodsCases of suspected interaction between tramadol and warfarin resulting in International Normalised Ratios increases that were reported to the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee until March 2003 were included. Ten cases had been genotyped for known polymorphisms of CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. ResultsSeven of ten patients carried defective CYP2D6 alleles (population prevalence 42.2%) (one-sided binomial test, P=0.07). A further patient received concomitant drug treatments that may have resulted in CYP2D6 enzyme inhibition. ConclusionThe liability to an interaction between tramadol and warfarin may be related to the CYP2D6 activity.
