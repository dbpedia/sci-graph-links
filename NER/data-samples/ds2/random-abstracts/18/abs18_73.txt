Abstract.  The threshold behaviour of the cross section for break-up of an atomic particle into N charged fragments is described by a power law, , where E is the energy excess above the threshold. The threshold index μ reflects the dynamics of long-range Coulomb correlation. The general features of the theory are discussed. The charge and mass dependence of the threshold index is analyzed for some particular systems.
