Abstract A family ℱ of sets has propertyB if there exists a setS such thatS∩F≠0 andS⊄F for everyF∈ℱ. ℱ has propertyB(s) if there exists a setS such that 0<|F∩S|<s for everyF∈ℱ. Denote bym(n) (respectivelym(n, s)) the size of a smallest family ofn-element sets not having propertyB (respectivelyB(s)). P. Erdős has asked whetherm(n, s)≧m (s) for alln≧s. We show that, in general, this inequality does not hold.
