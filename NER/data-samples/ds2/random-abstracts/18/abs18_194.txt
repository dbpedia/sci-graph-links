Abstract It is shown that the normalized fluctuations of Riemannâ€™s zeta zeros around their predicted locations follow the Gaussian law. It is also shown that fluctuations of two zeros, $$\gamma _{k}$$ and $$\gamma _{k+x},$$ with $$x\sim \left( \log k\right) ^{\beta }, \beta >0,$$ for large $$k$$ follow the two-variate Gaussian distribution with correlation $$\left( 1-\beta \right) _{+}\! .$$
