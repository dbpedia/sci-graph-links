Abstract This article explores recent efforts to resurrect casuistry as an effective means for resolving public policy debates on difficult issues such as abortion. The essay begins by comparing casuistical and legal methods of decision-making and goes on to consider the possible benefits of a casuistical approach to abortion policy. On the basis of a detailed examination ofRoe v. Wade andPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, I argue that apparent similarities between feminist methodologies and casuistry do not render casuistry an approach to moral reasoning compatible with feminist concerns for improving women's lives in relation to abortion decisions.
