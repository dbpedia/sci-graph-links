Summary The Ag-stainability of the nucleolus organizer region (NOR) was studied in the acrocentric chromosomes identified by Q-banding of cultured lymphocytes in 51 karyotypically normal persons (31 males and 20 females). A consistent pattern of Ag-positive NORs was found in each individual. Ninety percent of the individuals have a modal number of 8â€“10 Ag-positive NORs per cell. The frequency of Ag-positive NORs is similar in all five acrocentrics. A statistically nonsignificant lower frequency is found in chromosome 22. Ag-negative NORs on both homologues were found in four cases. The observed frequency distribution of individuals with homozygous NOR-positive, heterozygous, and homozygous negative acrocentric chromosomes was in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg law in all five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes as well as in total. No sex difference was observed in our material.
