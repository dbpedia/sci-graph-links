Abstract Two well-known former neural computation researchers explain the legal protection available for neural networks in Europe, and in particular the applicability of patent law to the unique concepts underlying neural research1. The result is an introductory guide for all groups whose projects are approaching, or have taken, the leap from the drawing board, and who wish to make commercial use of their results.
