Abstract At low temperatures, a perfect quasicrystal is in the “critical” state of metal-insulator transition. A power-law temperature dependence of conductivity, which was experimentally observed at T<5 K in the icosahedral phase of Al-Pd-Re, was obtained using the critical wave functions. Mott’s hopping law was also observed in the Al-Pd-Re samples and explained by the delocalization of electronic states in the momentum space.
