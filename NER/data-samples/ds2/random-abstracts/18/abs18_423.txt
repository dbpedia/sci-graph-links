Abstract We investigate the evolution of the power law k-essence field in FRWL spacetime. The autonomous dynamical system and critical points are obtained. The corresponding cosmological parameters, such as Ω ϕ and w ϕ , are calculated at these critical points. We find it is possible to achieve an equation of state crossing through −1 for k-essence field. The results we obtained indicate that the power law k-essence dark energy model can be compatible with observations.
