Summary Habitat change by means of flight activities has been observed in the life cycle of the univoltine, macropterous species Amara plebeja Gyll. The hibernation- and reproduction habitats are quite different, viz. deciduous trees and grass vegetation, respectively. Young as well as old females and males are present in both habitats, but at different periods of the year. The flight muscles are generally autolysed but apparently only temporarily. After complete reconstruction of the flight muscles, habitats are changed by mean of flying both in spring and in autumn, if weather conditions are favourable. In spring, when the individuals are flying from hibernation to reproduction habitat they may be drifted by air currents, whereby migration becomes dispersal, and founding or refounding of populations in suitable localities may result. During the autumn, the insects fly from reproduction to hibernation habitats orientating towards distinct silhouettes in the landscape.
