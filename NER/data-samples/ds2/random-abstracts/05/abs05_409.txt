Abstract Brazil officially joined the International Long Term EcologicalResearch (ILTER) network in January 2000, when nine researchsites were created and funded by the Brazilian Council forScience and Technology (CNPq). Two-years later some positivesigns already emerge of the scientific, social and politicalachievements of the Brazilian LTER program. We discuss examplesof how ecosystem and biodiversity information gathered within along-term research approach are currently subsidizingdecision-making as regards biodiversity conservation andwatershed management at local and regional scales. Success inthis respect has often been related to satisfactorycommunication between scientists, private companies, governmentand local citizens. Environmental education programs in the LTERsites are playing an important role in social and politicalintegration. Most examples of integration of ecological researchto decision-making in Brazil derive from case studies at localor regional scale. Despite the predominance of a bottom-upintegrative pathway (from case studies to models; from local tonational scale), some top-down initiatives are also inorder, such as the construction of a model to estimate theinpact of different macroeconomic policies and growthtrajectories on land use. We believe science and society inBrazil will benefit of the coexistence of bottom-up and top-downintegrative approaches.
