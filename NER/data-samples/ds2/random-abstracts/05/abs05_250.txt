Abstract The parrot species Amazona aestiva is categorised as least concern by the Red List of Threatened Species and is one of the most popular parrot species to be traded illegally. Such illegal trade and degradation of its habitat is a threat to the species, with a decrease in the speciesâ€™ population already reported. This study aimed to determine haematology and biochemistry reference values for A. aestiva to assist veterinarian and conservation programmes in the care of this species. Sampling was conducted in April 2014; a total of 32 birds were manually restrained, and their blood samples were collected and divided into two aliquots. Haematological parameters evaluated included red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, differential leukocyte count, haematocrit, thrombocyte count, haemoglobin concentration and RBC indexes. The biochemical parameters measured were alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, albumin, total protein and urea. Comparison between the male and female groups showed no significant difference in haematological parameters, and amongst the biochemical parameters, only calcium level was significantly different. No basophils or eosinophils were detected. Reference values of all measured haematological and biochemical parameters were recorded for the species. Although the results across studies may vary, it is important that all obtained information is revealed for future use. The data gathered in the present study add to the existing knowledge about A. aestiva and will be useful in the conservation and management programmes and for veterinarians.
