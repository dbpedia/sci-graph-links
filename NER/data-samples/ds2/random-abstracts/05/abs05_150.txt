Abstract Many methods for determining pesticide residues in food have been reported. Although natural medicines should be confirmed to be as safe as food, few methods for determining pesticide residues in natural medicines have been reported. In this study, 56 pesticides were detected in natural medicines with a simple, rapid sample preparation method. This study indicates that the proposed method is useful for analyzing pesticides in natural medicines.
