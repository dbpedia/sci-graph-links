Abstract Avian erythrocytes are typically nucleated; however, a small proportion of anucleated erythrocytes, termed erythroplastids, may be encountered in the peripheral blood of birds. The blood films of 77 birds, encompassing 53 species and 15 orders, were assessed to characterise the erythroplastid component. Erythroplastids were recognised in the blood of 30 birds, representing 24 species and 10 orders with the greatest concentration of 23.52 × 109/L. This study documents the presence of erythroplastids in the blood of a wide range of avian species and describes the characteristics of erythroplastids and their relationship to the erythrocyte components of blood.
