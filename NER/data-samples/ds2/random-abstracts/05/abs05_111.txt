Abstract In this study, a stochastic rough-approximation water management model (SRAWM) associated with optimistic and pessimistic options is proposed for supporting regional sustainability in an irrigation system (IS) of an arid region with uncertain information. SRAWM can not only handle conventional stochastic variations in objective functions or constraints, but also tackle objective and subjective (i.e., risk performance of the decision maker) fuzziness through rough-approximation model based on measure Me. The developed model would be applied to a real case study of an irrigation district (ID) in Kaidu-kongque River Basin, China, which is encountering challenges in economic development and a serious environmental crisis (e.g., drought, water deficit, land deterioration, stalinization, soil erosion and water pollution) synchronously. Simulation technical (i.e., support vector regression) is put into SRAWM framework to reflect dynamic prediction of water demand in the future. Results of optimized irrigation area, water allocation, water deficit, pollution reduction, water and soil erosion and system benefit under various water-environmental policies (corresponding to various ecological effects) are obtained. Tradeoffs between ecological and irrigative water usages can facilitate the local decision makers rectifying the current irrigation patterns and ecological protection polices. Moreover, compromises between systemic benefit and failure risk can help policymakers to generate a robust risk-control plan under uncertainties. These detections are beneficial to achieve conjunctive goals of socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability in such an arid IS.
