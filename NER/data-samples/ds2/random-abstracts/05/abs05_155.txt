Abstract Orthopteroid assemblages (orders Orthoptera and Mantodea) were compared along moisture gradient at five sites of the Slovak Karst in southern Slovakia. A total of 40 species were recorded by sweep-net sampling. The occurence of each identified species varied with soil moisture and other factors. Sites with similar moisture conditions tend to have similar assemblages. No species occurred simultaneously at the wettest and driest sites. There were two principal and five subordinate assemblages within the moisture gradient. Assemblages were related to the two commonest habitat types demarcated by the presence of different indicator species. Total orthopteroid species richness and number of grasshopper (Acridoidea) species increased linearly with falling soil moisture and Ellenbergsâ€™s indicator value for moisture.
