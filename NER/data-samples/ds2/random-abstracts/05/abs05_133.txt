Abstract An analysis is given of a mathematical model of two predators feeding on a single prey growing in the chemostat. In the case that one of the predators goes extinct, a global stability result is obtained. Under appropriate circumstances, a bifurcation theorem can be used to show that coexistence of the predators occurs in the form of a limit cycle.
