Abstract Population densities of microtine rodents were studied along an air pollution gradient in the Kola Peninsula, Russia, by long-term and short-term trapping. The study area is affected by high sulphur dioxide and heavy metal emissions from the Severonikel copper-nickel smelter in Monchegorsk. The density of Clethrionomys rufocanus, the most abundant vole species in the area, was lowest close to the smelter and increased with distance up to the farthest, less polluted trapping sites. Clethrionomys glareolus, C. rutilus and Lemmus lemmus were absent from the most severely damaged area and were also scarce at the moderately polluted area 28 km south of the smelter. Although the population of C. glareolus has previously been cyclic at the moderately polluted area, we were unable to demonstrate any regular cycle. The most likely explanation for the low number of microtine rodents in the damaged and moderately polluted areas in a decrease in the quantity of important food plants: epiphytic lichens for C. glareolus and possibly C. rutilus, mosses for L. lemmus and seed plants, especially Vaccinium myrtillus, for C. rufocanus. Close to the smelter, direct toxic effects of heavy metals may also reduce population densities. The results show that pollutants may change the relative proportions of microtine species.
