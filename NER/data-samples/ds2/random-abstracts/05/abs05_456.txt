Abstract Serum biochemical parameters are important aspects in the management of endangered species such as Acipenser persicus and Acipenser stellatus. Serum samples of 14 juvenile A. persicus and A. stellatus were analyzed and their serum parameter values were determined as mean ± SD in both groups. We compared the levels of phospholipid (26.73–42.79 mmol/L), triglyceride (2.38–2.37 mmol/L), total cholesterol (3.04–3.55 mmol/L), total lipid (32.09–50.11 mmol/L), total protein (32.22–27.78 g/L), albumin (7.25–6.85 g/L), globulin (24.86–20.62 g/L), Alb:Glb ratio (0.39–0.18), glucose (7.45 mmol/L), and free fatty acid (110.25–32.58 mg/L) in the two species. We have shown that there was no difference between groups in terms of any parameters (p > 0.05).
