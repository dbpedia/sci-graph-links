Summary Salvia valentina Vahl and Salvia blancoana Webb & Heldr subsp. mariolensis Figuerola, two endemic species of Salvia from the Mediterranean coastal region of Spain, were successfully gegenerated in vitro from adult plants using two explant types (apical and nodal segments). Maximum shoot proliferation for both species was obtained with nodal explants: for S. blancoana on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 6-γ-γ-dimethylallylaminopurine at 1 mg 1−1 (4.9 μM). and for S. valentina on the same medium with kinetin at 1–2 mg 1−1 (4.6–9.3 μM). The influence of apical dominance, and the explant viability in culture were found to be the main differences between the two species during the shoot multiplication phase. Rooting of shoots was low, specially for S. valentina. For both species, rooting was achieved in Murashige and Skoog medium without growth regulators. In general the addition of the auxins indole 3 acetic acid or indole-3-butyric acid did not improve the rooting or, in the case of naphthaleneacetic acid, had an inhibitory effect. In the best rooting media, rooting shoots increased in length. The rooted plantlets were acclimated to ex vitro conditions and a survival percentage > 70% was obtained under greenhouse conditions. This work was carried out as an ex situ conservation method for these Spanish endemic species.
