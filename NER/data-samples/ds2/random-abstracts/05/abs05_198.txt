Abstract The investigated bryozoan fauna of the Upper Permian Zechstein Formation includes 17 species of 9 genera, belonging mainly to the fenestellids and trepostomids and one species belonging to the tubuliporids,Corynotrypa voigtiana (King 1850). Three new species are described (Dyscritella microstoma sp. nov.,Ulrichotrypella incrustata sp. nov., andKingopora baderi sp. nov.). The Zechstein species of the generaAcanthocladia, Synocladia, Penniretepora andKalvariella display close resemblance in their internal morphology, and their derivation from a common ancestor is suggested. The distribution of the bryozoans in the Zechstein Sea was apparently controlled by factors such as lateral sedimentation, distribution of microbial mats and quality of substrates.
