Abstract: Seasonal adjustments to red cell haematology that support altered metabolic requirements in Australian marsupials are either not expressed, or are minimal in brushtail possums introduced into New Zealand. Raised leucocyte differentials in winter imply seasonal challenges to the immune system. A small increase in plasma glucose, fall in plasma protein, and generally high condition index are consistent with the relatively high quality of habitat enjoyed by the marsupial immigrant.
