Abstract. The aim of this research is to analyze the situation of mangroves in Myanmar, including their formation and their economic and ecological importance. Economic importance includes fisheries, fuel-wood, charcoal production, construction materials and medicine, while ecological importance includes shoreline stabilization, protection from wind and storms, coastal ecosystem stability and biodiversity protection. Myanmar's coastal areas were in good condition until 30Â years ago. However, population increase and political instability have caused environmental and economic damage and threaten recovery. Awareness of the importance of the biodiversity of the coastal ecosystem and its endangered situation has led to the implementation of measures to ensure sustainable development and conservation.
