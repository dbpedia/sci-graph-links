Abstract Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis plays an important role in improving plant fitness and soil quality, particularly in fragile and stressed environments, as those in certain areas of Mediterranean ecosystems. AM fungal communities are usually affected by dynamic factors such as the plant community structure and composition, which in turn are imposed by seasonality. For this reason, a one-year-round time-course trial was performed by sampling the root system of two representative shrubland species (Rosmarinus officinalis and Thymus zygis) within a typical Mediterranean ecosystem from the Southeast of Spain. The 18S rDNA gene, of the AM fungal community in roots, was subjected to PCRâ€“SSCP, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Forty-three different AM fungal sequence types were found which clustered in 16 phylotypes: 14 belonged to the Glomeraceae and two to the Diversisporaceae. Surprisingly, only two of these phylotypes were related with sequences of morphologically defined species: Glomus intraradices and Glomus constrictum. Significant differences were detected for the relative abundance of some phylotypes while no effects were found for the calculated diversity indices. These results may help to design efficient mycorrhizal-based revegetation programs for this type of ecosystems.
