Abstract Species within the tardigrade genus Paramacrobiotus could be distinguished via an analysis of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) secondary structures. Sequences of P. richtersi and four populations previously treated under provisional names (Paramacrobiotus ‘richtersi group’ 1 to 4) from different continents were determined and annotated, and their secondary structures were predicted. A tree based on a combined sequence-structure alignment was reconstructed by Neighbor-Joining. The topology obtained is consistent with a tree based on a distance matrix of compensatory base changes (CBCs) between all ITS2 sequence-structure pairs in the global multiple alignment. The CBC analysis, together with 18S rDNA sequences, physiological, biochemical and biophysical data identified three species new to science that are morphologically indistinguishable from P. richtersi. These are formally described under the names Paramacrobiotus fairbanksi sp. nov., P. kenianus sp. nov., and P. palaui sp. nov.
