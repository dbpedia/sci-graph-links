Abstract A new species ofRoumegueriella (Ascomycetes; Hypocreales),R. pulchella, is described and illustrated. This fungus is characterized by its rapid growth on Czapek-yeast extract and YpSs agars at 37Â°C, bright yellow non-ostiolate ascomata, translucent membranaceous peridium, broadly clavate asci, and hyaline one-celled subglobose-ovoid ascospores ornamented with prominent spines. The holotype was isolated from soil in a sugarcane field in Okinawa, Japan.
