Abstract In comparative threat analysis, threats imposed by different environmental problems are measured and compared. This type of analysis can be used to assess the overall threat to the environment, and to identify the most serious threat (‘key problem’) and areas which are particularly threatened (‘problem areas’). Fundamental to comparative threat analysis is a common yardstick by which stresses imposed by different environmental problems can be compared. Such a yardstick may be the carrying capacity of the environment for environmental loads. In this paper we review how carrying capacity for different environmental problems is operationalized. Next, we discuss whether it is possible to compare threats, using the exceeding of carrying capacity as a yardstick. We point out problems and uncertainties in such a comparative threat analysis using three case studies: threats to European groundwater resources; threats to ecosystems in Europe; and threats to ecosystems, human health and groundwater resources in the Netherlands. On the basis of the results we advocate the application of risk assessment to enhance methodological uniformity in assessing protection levels for different environmental problems.
