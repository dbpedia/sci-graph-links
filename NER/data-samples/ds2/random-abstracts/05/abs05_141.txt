Abstract Twenty seven species of the family Eulophidae were reared from 20 new lepidopteran hosts in Ulâ€™yanovsk Province. Among newly revealed host-parasitoid associations, 27, 9, 3, and 3 are those with Phyllonorycter (Gracillariidae), Stigmella and single species of Ectoedemia (Nepticulidae), Yponomeuta (Yponomeutidae), and Tischeria (Tischeriidae), respectively. Ectoparasitoids prevailed among parasitoids of the genus Phyllonorycter, and endoparasitoids, among parasitoids of the genera Stigmella and Tischeria.
