Summary In contrast to results in other studies, nuclear and mitochondrial genes were found to change concordantly in a transect across the hybrid zone betweenBombina bombina andBombina variegata. mtDNAs of both species are found in populations in the central part of the zone, whereas populations at its margins contain mtDNA corresponding to nuclear genomes.
