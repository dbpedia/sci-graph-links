Abstract The western tussock moth (Orgyia vetusta) is very abundant on one stand of bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus) at the Bodega Marine Reserve (Sonoma Co, Calif., USA), but is sparse or absent on nearby stands. To determine what controls its abundance, both within the outbreak area and more globally, I performed experimental manipulations of resource availability and dispersal. To measure resource limitation, I inoculated 30 caged and 30 uncaged bushes with a realistic range of numbers of tussock moth eggs. On caged bushes, starvation led to density-dependent reductions in survival, pupal weight and fecundity. Larvae on uncaged bushes experienced density-independent ant predation on early instars and density-dependent emigration by late instars. From the results of this experiment, I predicted the density of a resource-limited tussock moth population. The predictions agreed fairly well with data from the outbreak area in 1992. To measure dispersal by the moth, which has flightless adult females, I released 30,000 tussock moth eggs at a central point in each of two uninfested lupine stands, and censused larvae weekly in a circle of radius 16 m until pupation. Median displacement over one entire generation was only 2 m, or about 2 bush radii. Rearing experiments indicated that bushes outside the out-break area are fully nutritionally suitable for the moth. I conclude that two major factors limiting the population are resources (within the outbreak area) and inefficient dispersal (more globally).
