Abstract Cluster analyses by different methods and a minimum spanning tree were used to study phenetic relationships in the genusChlerodendrum. 129 species were scored for 52 morphological characters corresponding to 119 character states. The phenetic results suggest a classification into 7 distinct groups, which may be grouped into two subgenera. This classification is supported by the iridoid distribution as well as by some phylogenetic considerations.
