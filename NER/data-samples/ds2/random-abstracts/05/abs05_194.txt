Abstract An ω,ω′-disubstituted hypericin derivative bearing two dicyclohexylurea moieties separated by propionyl chains from the chromophore and an ω,ω′-dithioacetal of hypericin were prepared. Both showed excellent production of oxidizing species comparable to hypericin when irradiated with appropriate light as shown by the photodestruction of bilirubin IXα.
