Abstract â€‚Pollen fertility and compatibility status were investigated in three species of mangroves: Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Rhizophora samoensis, R. stylosa and a hybrid between the two Rhizophora species. Pollen fertility was greater than 80% in the three species but less than 10% in the hybrid. Also, all three species were intraspecifically compatible, while the hybrid showed very low compatibility which may be due to its low pollen fertility. The genera Bruguiera and Rhizophora were found to be completely cross incompatible, while a low reciprocal cross compatibility was observed in interspecific crosses between Rhizophora stylosa and R. samoensis.
