Summary Nestlings of the communally breeding Greycrowned Babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis) were studied to discover if supplemental feeding by auxiliary birds at nests enhanced their growth. Growth of wing, bill, tarsus and weight was measured. Growth curves were fitted by computer using a commercial program (MLAB). Our data provided little support for possible sibling competition. A significant component of the variance in asymptote and growth constant for some variables could be attributed to differences among nests. Environmental variables such as temperature and rainfall were much more strongly associated with nestling growth than were the numbers of auxiliary birds feeding broods.
