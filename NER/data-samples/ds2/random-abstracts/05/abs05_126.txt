Abstract Many desert playas are covered with water in the early spring. As theweather becomes warmer and drier, water evaporates, increasing saltcontent of the soil from 7,000 to almost 16,000 mmol NaCl Kg-1. Changes in respiratory metabolism during the growing season of fourhalophytes characteristic of cold desert playas was followed usingcalorimetry. In order of decreasing salt tolerance, the species examinedwere: the forbs Salicornia rubra, S. utahensis; the grass Distichlisspicata; and the shrub Allenrolfea occidentalis. Tissue collected in thefield from sites of low and high salinity in a single playa during May, June,and August of 1997 was put in isothermal calorimeters and the metabolicheat rate (q) and respiration rate (RCO2) measured. Efficiency ofsubstrate carbon conversion (q/RCO2) and predicted specific growthrate (Î”HBRSG) were calculated. These species are allwell-adapted to the environment in which they are found. Highestmetabolism, respiration, efficiency and growth are found during May andJune and are lowest during the hot, dry month of August. Differencesbetween the species are also noted.
