Abstract The Sicalis flaveola specie is also known as saffron finch. It is known to be in the illegally traded and mostly to be used as pets. Although the saffron finch is not listed as threatened species, the hunting, destruction of habit, and introduction of hybrid and exotic specimens to the natural environment can put the specie in risk, and they have been already cited in some regions to be found rarely. Due to the lack of hematological data for the specie S. flaveola, this study aimed to describe the hematological reference values and biometric data (weight) for the specie. Thirty-eight saffron finches where captured in a private ranch located at Guarapari (ES), South-East of Brazil. Capture and sampling were conducted in October 2014. Body mass was measured, and blood was collected. A blood smear was done, and differential leukocyte count was performed. The mean body mass found for the saffron finch was 19.6 ± 1.9 g. The hematological reference values were 16.7 to 63.7 % for heterophils, 36.1 to 82.3 % for lymphocytes, and 0.0 to 2.0 % for monocytes. Using the data gathered in the present study, reference values were calculated.
