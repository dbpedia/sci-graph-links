Abstract. â€‚We illustrate a method of global sensitivity analysis and we test it on a preliminary case study in the field of environmental assessment to quantify uncertainty importance in poorly-known model parameters and spatially referenced input data. The focus of the paper is to show how the methodology provides guidance to improve the quality of environmental assessment practices and decision support systems employed in environmental policy. Global sensitivity analysis, coupled with uncertainty analysis, is a tool to assess the robustness of decisions, to understand whether the current state of knowledge on input data and parametric uncertainties is sufficient to enable a decision to be taken. The methodology is applied to a preliminary case study, which is based on a numerical model that employs GIS-based soil data and expert consultation to evaluate an index that joins environmental and economic aspects of land depletion. The index is used as a yardstick by decision-makers involved in the planning of highways to identify the route that minimises the overall impact.
