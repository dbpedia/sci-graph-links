Abstract In wireless networks, the betweenness of a node has been considered an indication of that node’s importance in efficiently and reliably delivering messages. In a large wireless network, however, the cost of computing the betweenness of every node is impractically high. In this paper, we introduce a new representation of a node’s vicinity, called the expanded ego network (shortly, x-ego network) of that node. We also propose an approach that calculates the x-ego betweenness of a node (i.e., the betweenness of that node in its x-ego network) and use it as an estimate of the true betweenness in the entire network. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm that quickly computes x-ego betweenness by exploiting structural properties of x-ego networks. Our evaluation results show the benefits and effectiveness of the above approach using trace data obtained from real-world wireless networks.
