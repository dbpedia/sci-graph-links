Abstract The mobile health (mHealth) and electronic health (eHealth) systems are useful to maintain a correct administration of health information and services. However, it is mandatory to ensure a secure data transmission and in case of a node failure, the system should not fall down. This fact is important because several vital systems could depend on this infrastructure. On the other hand, a cloud does not have infinite computational and storage resources in its infrastructure or would not provide all type of services. For this reason, it is important to establish an interrelation between clouds using communication protocols in order to provide scalability, efficiency, higher service availability and flexibility which allow the use of services, computing and storage resources of other clouds. In this paper, we propose the architecture and its secure protocol that allows exchanging information, data, services, computing and storage resources between all interconnected mHealth clouds. The system is based on a hierarchic architecture of two layers composed by nodes with different roles. The routing algorithm used to establish the connectivity between the nodes is the shortest path first (SPF), but it can be easily changed by any other one. Our architecture is highly scalable and allows adding new nodes and mHealth clouds easily, while it tries to maintain the load of the cloud balanced. Our protocol design includes node discovery, authentication and fault tolerance. We show the protocol operation and the secure system design. Finally we provide the performance results in a controlled test bench.
