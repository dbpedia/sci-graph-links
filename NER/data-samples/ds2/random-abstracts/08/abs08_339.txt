Abstract Nowadays, Internet users are depending on various search engines in order to be able to find requested information on the Web. Although most users feel that they are and remain anonymous when they place their search queries, reality proves otherwise. The increasing importance of search engines for the location of the desired information on the Internet usually leads to considerable inroads into the privacy of users. A heated debate is currently ongoing at European level regarding the question if search engine providers that are established outside the European Union are covered by the European data protection framework and the obligations it imposes on entities that process personal data. The scope of this paper is to examine the applicability of the European data protection legislation to non-EU-based search engine providers and to study the main privacy issues with regard to search engines, such as the character of search logs, their anonymisation and their retention period. Ixquick, a privacy-friendly meta-search engine, will be presented as an alternative to privacy intrusive existing practices of search engines.
