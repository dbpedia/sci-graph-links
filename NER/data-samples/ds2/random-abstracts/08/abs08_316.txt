Abstract In wireless networks, multi-user video streaming under limited resource is a challenging problem. The main challenge is how to meet the transmission requirements under the different channel condition and video content complexity. In this paper, we propose an uncoded video transmission framework to deliver the multi-user video over wireless networks. In order to evaluate the overall performance of multi-user network more practically, three optimization strategies are proposed in this paper: 1) minimizing the total distortion; 2) minimizing the maximal distortion; 3) minimizing the summation of square root distortion. Furthermore, the corresponding joint resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the optimization problems. The simulation results demonstrate that different optimization strategies have different resource allocation and performance for each user. The optimization strategy 1) performs the best in terms of average PSNR of all users, the optimization strategy 2) achieves more fair result, and the optimization strategy 3) achieves a good balance. The strategy 3) can improve the performance for users with bad channel condition, while little loss is caused for users with good channel condition.
