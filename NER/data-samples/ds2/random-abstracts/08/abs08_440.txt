Abstract Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) can increase the traffic efficiency by allowing arbitrary vehicles to broadcast the messages to other vehicles and road side units (RSUs). But due to the openness of the wireless network, VANET is very vulnerable to forgery attack. Thus, the security and privacy of the messages should be provided, to make sure that the real identity of vehicles can be traceable by authorized party while not be revealed to other vehicles. The existing solutions can neither satisfy the privacy requirement nor have an effective message verification scheme on vehicles. A secure and privacy protect authentication scheme is proposed in this paper, which comprises local authentication and roaming authentication for VANET based on bilinear pairing and can provide secure communications and anonymous authentication among RSUs and vehicles.
