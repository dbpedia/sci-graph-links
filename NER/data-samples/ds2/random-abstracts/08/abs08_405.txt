Abstract Shortest path finding has a variety of applications in transportation and communication. In this paper, we propose a fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithm for the shortest path problem in a distributed system. The improvement made by the proposed algorithm in stabilization times for single-fault situations can demonstrate the desirability of an efficient fault-containing self-stabilizing algorithm. For single-fault situations, the worst-case stabilization time of the proposed algorithm is O(Δ), where Δ is the maximum node degree in the system, and the contamination number of the proposed algorithm is 1.
