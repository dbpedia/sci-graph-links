Abstract Standardized CRC codes used in today’s communication, data storage and process automation systems have odd maximum blocklength, which does not comply with a byte-structure of data where the number of information bits and parity bits is a multiple of eight. To achieve byte-structure, the code’s information part is lengthened by one bit, but without degradation of the code’s minimum distance.
