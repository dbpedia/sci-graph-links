Abstract Privacy is a critical security requirement in mobile cloud computing. To address the dilemma of data forensics in privacy-preserving cloud environment, secure provenance that records the ownership and process history of data objects was proposed in literatures. Although existing secure provenance schemes provide anonymous authentication to cloud servers, confidentiality of sensitive documents, unforgeability of provenance records and provenance tracking of disputed documents, they do not address the revocation of anonymous user or introduce high computational overhead into anonymous authentication. In this study, we propose a practical secure data provenance for cloud computing. Our scheme provides the necessary security features and efficient revocation of anonymous credentials without sacrificing performance (i.e. computational overhead is minimal). Using provable security techniques, we prove that the proposed scheme is secure under the standard model.
