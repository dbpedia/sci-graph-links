Conclusion 1.To increase the reliability of converters made by the forced read and binary brush method it is possible to effectively use linear correcting codes (Hamming or Elias codes) and to double converters containing an evenness control bit.2.The efficiency from using correcting codes and, in particular, cyclic codes, significantly increases in sequential information output and if the number of information bits is increased.3.Tripling with a majority logic is an effective and literally the only method for increasing reliability for converters made in Gray code.4.The use of redundant codes and the introduction of a control bit is possible only at the stage of developing converters and converters can be tripled by using industrially produced units and taking into account economic advantageousness.5.The estimate for the failure-proof operation probability of converters is somewhat understated in this article since- we considered a variant with parallel information output in all bits.
