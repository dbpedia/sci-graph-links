Abstract In lossless image compression, many prediction methods are proposed so far to achieve better compression performance/complexity trade off. In this paper, we concentrate on some well-known and widely used low-complexity algorithms exploited in many modern compression systems, including MED, GAP, Graham, Ljpeg, DARC, and GBSW. This paper proposes a new gradient-based tracking and adapting technique that outperforms some existing methods. This paper aims to design an efficient highly adaptive predictor that can be incorporated in modeling step of image compression systems. This claim is proved by testing the proposed method upon a wide variety of images with different characteristics. Six special sets of images including face, sport, texture, sea, text, and medical constitute our dataset.
