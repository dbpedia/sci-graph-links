Abstract In order to meet the requirements of information exchange varieties and manners in wide area protection system, a communication service model based on IEC 61850 is proposed. This service model can realize communication consistency and cooperation between different types of devices. Furthermore, the communication reliability and time delay performance are guaranteed to meet the requirements of relay protection from the upper layer. Message structure of generic substation event (GSE) and its communication mechanism are discussed. General methods to communicate digital information by generic substation status event (GSSE) and communicate analog sampling information by sampling analog value (SAV) of GSE are proposed.
