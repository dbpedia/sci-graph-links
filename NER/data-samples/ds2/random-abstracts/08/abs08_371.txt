Abstract A sliding-window dynamic frameproof code is a scheme for discouraging the piracy of digital broadcasts through the use of digital fingerprinting. In this paper, we formally define sliding-window dynamic frameproof codes and provide optimal constructions for a certain class of these schemes. We also discuss bounds on the number of users such schemes can support.
