Abstract There are many schemes in the literature for protecting digital data from piracy by the use of digital fingerprinting, such as frameproof codes and traitor-tracing schemes. The concept of traitor-tracing has been applied to a digital broadcast setting in the form of dynamic traitor-tracing schemes and sequential traitor-tracing schemes, which could be used to combat piracy of pay-TV broadcasts, for example. In this paper, we extend the properties of frameproof codes to this dynamic model, defining and constructing both l-sequential c-frameproof codes and l-dynamic c-frameproof codes. We also give bounds on the number of users supported by such schemes.
