Abstract. In this paper, we first present a brief overview of two main network security problems related to digital libraries, privacy and authentication, and then we propose practical solutions to these problems which are applicable to digital libraries of any type and arbitrary size. More precisely, we propose a key exchange protocol and an identification scheme whose security is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms and factoring large integers.
