Abstract In this paper we introduce a secure and efficient public key cryptosystem using generalized Mersenne primes based on two hard problems: the cubic root extraction modulo a composite integer and the discrete logarithm problem (DLP). These two problems are combined during the key generation, encryption and decryption phases. To break the scheme, an attacker has to solve the cubic root computation and the DLP separately which is computationally infeasible.
