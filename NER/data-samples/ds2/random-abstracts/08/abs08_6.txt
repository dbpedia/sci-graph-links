Abstract Trust management in a networked environment consists of authentication and integrity checking. In a mobile computing environment, both remote hosts and mobile code are suspect. We present a model that addresses trust negotiation between the remote host and the mobile code simultaneously. Our model uses tamper resistant hardware, public key cryptography, and one-way hash functions.
