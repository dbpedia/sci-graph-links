Abstract The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has revolutionized the way of controlling Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) based communication sessions over an open channel. The SIP protocol is insecure for being an open text-based protocol inherently. Different solutions have been presented in the last decade to secure the protocol. Recently, Zhang et al. authentication protocol has been proposed with a sound feature that authenticates the users without any password-verifier database using smart card. However, the scheme has a few limitations and can be made more secure and optimized regarding cost of exchanged messages, with a few modifications. Our proposed key-agreement protocol makes a use of two server secrets for robustness and is also capable of authenticating the involved parties in a single round-trip of exchanged messages. The server can now authenticate the user on the request message received, rather than the response received upon sending the challenge message, saving another round-trip of exchanged messages and hence escapes a possible denial of service attack.
