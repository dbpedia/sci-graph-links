Abstract The Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) mechanism is the well-known error packet recovery solution composed of the Automation Repeat reQuest (ARQ) mechanism and the Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism. However, the HARQ mechanism neither retransmits the packet to the receiver in time when the packet cannot be recovered by the FEC scheme nor dynamically adjusts the number of FEC redundant packets according to network conditions. In this paper, the Adaptive Hybrid Error Correction Model (AHECM) is proposed to improve the HARQ mechanism. The AHECM can limit the packet retransmission delay to the most tolerable end-to-end delay. Besides, the AHECM can find the appropriate FEC parameter to avoid network congestion and reduce the number of FEC redundant packets by predicting the effective packet loss rate. Meanwhile, when the end-to-end delay requirement can be met, the AHECM will only retransmit the necessary number of redundant FEC packets to receiver in comparison with legacy HARQ mechanisms. Furthermore, the AHECM can use an Unequal Error Protection to protect important multimedia frames against channel errors of wireless networks. Besides, the AHECM uses the Markov model to estimate the burst bit error condition over wireless networks. The AHECM is evaluated by several metrics such as the effective packet loss rate, the error recovery efficiency, the decodable frame rate, and the peak signal to noise ratio to verify the efficiency in delivering video streaming over wireless networks.
