Abstract In the recent years, interdisciplinary studies on and applications of nonlinear systems have been increased significantly. Some of these studies are chaos-based applications. Chaos-based encryption, one of the most popular type of applications, has some security drawbacks. In this article, to overcome those drawbacks a secure steganography application with chaos-based encryption is realized by employing a four-dimensional continuous chaotic system. As a first step, the chaotic system that is used in the study is described and analyzed, and then random number generator (RNG) is designed for encryption application. In the next step, the data is encrypted with the designed RNG and then embedded in a carrier in chaos-based manner. As the final step, the security analysis of encryption and data hiding processes is carried out to evaluate their performances. The most important feature of the article contains both encryption and data hiding processes with successful security performances, and these types of studies are rare in the literature.
