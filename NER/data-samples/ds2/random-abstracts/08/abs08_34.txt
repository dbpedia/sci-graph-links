Abstract The difficulty of extracting hidden information, which is essentially a kind of secrecy, is analyzed by information-theoretic method. The relations between key rate, message rate, hiding capacity and difficulty of extraction are studied in the terms of unicity distance of stego-key, and the theoretic conclusion is used to analyze the actual extracting attack on Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganographic algorithms.
