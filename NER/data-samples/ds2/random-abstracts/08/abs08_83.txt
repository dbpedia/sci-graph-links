Abstract A method is presented for the construction of binary linear burst error correcting recurrent codes of type B2, viz. those codes which correct any burst of lengthl=rb or less provided it is confined amongr successive blocks of lengthb. The proposed codes are optimal in the sense they meet the lower bound obtained by Wyner and Ash, and are constructed through a particular bordering of the characteristic matrices of analogous codes of shorter block length. Finally, existing linear recurrent codes are compared for efficiency.
