Abstract In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive: adaptable KP-ABE with time interval (KP-TIABE), which is an extension of key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE). Adaptable KP-TIABE specifies a decryption time interval for every ciphertext such that the ciphertext can only be decrypted within this time interval. To be more flexible, the decryption time interval associated with a ciphertext can be adjusted on demand by a semi-trusted server. We propose a formal model for adaptable KP-TIABE, present a concrete adaptable KP-TIABE scheme and prove its security under the security model.
