Abstract Vehicular cloud computing is a technological paradigm shifting which takes advantage of cloud computing to provide vehicles with useful computing resources and services on the roads. The advancement in smart vehicles and information technologies motivate researchers and industries to pay attention to the combination of vehicular network with cloud computing in recent. In order to make the emerging vehicular cloud computing viable, security issues must be considered. Especially, privacy is one of the critical security issues in vehicular cloud services as well as vehicular communications since a third-party entity may be involved in cloud management and operations. In this paper, we propose an anonymous vehicle-to-infrastructure cloud access management system in which identity and location privacy of service requesting vehicles are prevented from not only a global eavesdropper but also any single system management entity. We devise pseudonymous service access tokens for vehicles and RSU-local revocation mechanism to reduce the size of revocation list containing revoked pseudonyms in the proposed system.
