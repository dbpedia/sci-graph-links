Abstract We report on our experiences in developing a hardware based security solution for a novel, smart-grid enabled energy services system. In this paper, we first give a background to a new energy services model and then describe how we incorporated a CSIRO developed portable trusted computing platform into a practical, prototype system which assures that all transactions between the energy service company and the consumer are trustworthy, secure and private.
