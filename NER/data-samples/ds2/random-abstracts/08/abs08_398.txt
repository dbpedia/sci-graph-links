Abstract Online/offline signature schemes allow one to quickly compute a digital signature from a precomputed coupon. In this paper, we present an ID-based online/offline signature for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which is based on Hohenbergerâ€™ RSA signature (Crypto 09). We argue that due to significant reduction in costs of computation and storage, our scheme is particularly suitable for the WSNs environment with severely constrained resources. Our scheme can be proved secure under the factoring assumption without random oracles.
