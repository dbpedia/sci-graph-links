Abstract The problem of delay-insensitive data communication is described. The notion of delay-insensitive code is defined, giving precise conditions under which delay-insensitive data communication is feasible. Examples of these codes are presented and analyzed. It appears that delay-insensitive codes are equivalent with antichains in partially ordered sets and with all unidirectional error-detecting codes.
