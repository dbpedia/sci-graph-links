Summary The axisymmetric problem of a circular plate partially resting on a smooth elastic foundation and subjected to uniform load distribution has been studied in view ofReissner's thick plate theory. Various edge loadings have been considered. The results contain the case of rigid foundation and those predicted by classical theory, in the limiting case. Numerical results are given in the form of graphs and tables.
