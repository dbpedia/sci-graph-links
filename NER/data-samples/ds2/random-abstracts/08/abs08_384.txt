Abstract This paper presents new proofs of two classic characterization theorems for families of ordered sets. The first is that any finite poset with no restriction isomorphic to $$\underline 2 + \underline 2 $$ has an interval representation. The second is that any finite poset with no restriction isomorphic to $$\underline 2 + \underline 2 $$ or to $$\underline 3 + \underline 1 $$ has a unit interval representation. Both proofs are straightforward and inductive.
