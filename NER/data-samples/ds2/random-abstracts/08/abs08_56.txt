Abstract A new type latch for hard disk drive is proposed. It can retract and protect a read/write head, without additional installation of a few cams and a magnet such as in a conventional hard disk drive. The new latch mechanism comprises two elements. One is a ramp with groove for parking a suspension tab and the other is a balanced-type suspension previously proposed to achieve required shock resistance for mobile use. The new latch mechanism is driven by the Lorentz force of VCM coil generated in the vertical and horizontal directions.
