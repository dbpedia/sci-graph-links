Abstract In this study, we propose a controlled deterministic secure quantum communication (CDSQC) protocol based on the idea of Grover’s quantum search algorithm (QSA). The proposed protocol has the following two advantages over the existing CDSQC protocols: (1) high qubit frequency and (2) less quantum memory. Moreover, the security analysis of the proposed protocol shows that any eavesdropper will be detected with a very high probability under both ideal and noisy quantum channel conditions.
