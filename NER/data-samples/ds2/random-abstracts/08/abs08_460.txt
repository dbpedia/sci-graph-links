Abstract This paper aims to provide a complete security mechanism for DOS attacks in wireless networks. Various techniques and methodologies were proposed in the earlier studies against DOS attack and their solution in terms of detection and prevention rate is very less. In this paper DAD-(defending against DOS) approach is proposed to provide maximum level of security and DAD shows the efficiency in terms of detection and prevention. DAD has two main phases, such as authentication and monitoring. In authentication phase entire node verification and certification is provided by DAD approach. In monitoring phase the entire traffic flow is monitored with a help of USIP-recording and USIP-marking methods. The simulation result shows that the efficacy of DAD is better than the existing approaches in terms of detection and prevention.
