Abstract The k-error linear complexity is an important cryptographic measure of pseudorandom sequences in stream ciphers. In this paper, we investigate the k-error linear complexity of p 2-periodic binary sequences defined from the polynomial quotients modulo p, which are the generalizations of the well-studied Fermat quotients. Indeed, first we determine exact values of the k-error linear complexity over the finite field $$\mathbb{F}_2$$ for these binary sequences under the assumption of 2 being a primitive root modulo p 2, and then we determine their k-error linear complexity over the finite field $$\mathbb{F}_p$$. Theoretical results obtained indicate that such sequences possess ‘good’ error linear complexity.
