Abstract The Braid Diffie–Hellman public key cryptosystem is based on the Diffie–Hellman version of a decomposition problem (DP) in the braid group B n . We propose a linear algebra attack on DP via the faithful Lawrence–Krammer representation $$\rho^{\prime}_n$$. For generic and sufficiently long instance braids we recover the $$\rho ^\prime _n$$-image of the private key using just one matrix inversion.
