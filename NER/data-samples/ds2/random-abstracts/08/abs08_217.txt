Abstract Recently, traditional power grid cannot satisfy the today’s fast development trend of the market, and a more intelligent power system named smart grid is developed acting a significant power infrastructure. How to achieve the energy sellers and buyers’ interact efficiently is a challenging problem for smart grid. The auction requires energy buyers to provide their private bid information to the energy auction servers. However, energy buyers usually do not expect the real information of the bid get leaked out, especially known by other competitors. That means the energy sellers need to inquire suitable bids while preserving the privacy of the energy buyers. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving degree-matching (PPDM) multi-attribute auction scheme which the winner is generated by comparing sorted all of matching degree between sale solution supplied by energy sellers and biddings submitted by energy buyers. Also, the quantitative and qualitative attributes are classified as quantitative assessment finally in energy sellers and buyers’ bid. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme based on the difficulty of integer factorization assumption can secure auction privacy, multi-attribute matching, personalized search, and ranked search. Furthermore, performance evaluation shows that the PPDM can significantly reduce computation overhead and it also has moderate communication overhead.
