Abstract In this paper, a synchronization method of Lurâ€™e systems for chaotic secure communication systems with interval time-varying delay feedback control is proposed. To increase communication security, the transmitted message is encrypted with the techniques of N-shift cipher and public key. Based on Lyapunov method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation, new delay-dependent synchronization criteria are established to not only guarantee stable synchronization of both transmitter and receiver systems but also recover the transmitted original signal at the receiver. Throughout a numerical example, the validity and superiority of the proposed method are shown.
