Abstract Many companies nowadays realise that secure Internet access is a precursor to joining the information superhighway. This paper outlines the solution that BT's Advanced Communications Engineering (ACE) directorate produced, in a joint effort with Concert marketing. It combines off-the-shelf packages with BT's in-depth knowledge of security and secure virtual networks to create a solution that provides managed firewalls, virtual private data networks, and secure, encrypted dial access over the Internet. The key to the success of this service is the service management wrap and scalability of the complete solution.
