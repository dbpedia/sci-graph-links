Abstract In this paper, we introduce an embedded hardware low complexity JPEG 2000 video coding system. The hardware implementation itself exploits temporal redundancy by coding differential frames which are arranged in an adaptive group of picture (GOP) structure. The GOP structure is determined by statistical analysis of previously coded differential frames. We present a hardware video coding system that applies this interframe coding scheme to a digital signal processor environment. This system basically consists of a microprocessor (ADSP-BF533 Blackfin processor from analog devices) and a JPEG 2000 compression engine (ADV202). Our straightforward system is predestined for encoding surveillance-type videos with low cost.
