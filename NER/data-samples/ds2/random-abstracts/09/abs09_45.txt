Abstract Inelastic resonance tunneling through junctions with an amorphous interlayer and superconducting electrodes is studied. The form of the current-voltage characteristic I(V) at low temperature and the temperature dependence of the conductance G(0) at low bias are calculated and are found to be much different from the analogous dependences of structures with normal electrodes.
