Conclusions 1.The laser interferometer that was developed has a resolving power of 30 Å and ensures an error no greater than 0.05% for the measurement of quasistatic strains, which makes it possible to use the interferometer to study the physicomechanical properties of lowductility ceramics.2.Cyclic loading of 3×10×100 mm specimens of piezoceramic TsTBS-3 at a frequency of about 20 kHz for 60 sec increases the piezoconstant of the material by 8–48% within the range of cyclic-stress amplitudes from 27 to 47 MPa.
