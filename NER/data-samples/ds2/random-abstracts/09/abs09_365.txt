Abstract In this work the possibilities for the reduction of friction and wear in micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are investigated. An improvement of the tribological behaviour of microsystems can be realized by optimizing the contact condition and by application of special coatings with low friction and low wear rates. For optimizing the contact condition a defined topography and surface profile is generated by photolithography. Furthermore tribological coatings with low friction and low wear rates are developed and investigated using nanoindentation and micro scratch experiments. Also novel results on micro structured surfaces coated with a-C:H and a-C films will be discussed. The results show the great potential of carbon-based coatings in combination with an optimized geometrical surface design.
