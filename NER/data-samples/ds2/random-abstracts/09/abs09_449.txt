Abstract Amorphous and disordered metal and alloy films are produced by a vapour beam impinging obliquely on a quartz glass substrate at 90 K. After evaporation the transmission is measured for perpendicular incidence of light within the wavelength range 400 nm to 900 nm. The films have an anisotropy of the transmission of linearly polarized light. The transmission has its lowest value when the electric vector in the plane of the film is oriented perpendicular to the vapour beam. The anisotropy is found for e.g. CuSn, BiPb and Cu, Ag, Au and Bi. The transmission anisotropy decreases with the transition to the crytalline state or with the reduction of disorder.
