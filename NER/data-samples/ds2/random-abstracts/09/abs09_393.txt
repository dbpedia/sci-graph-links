Abstract The quenching of steels involves thermal, mechanical, and structural phenomena and their couplings. In this paper, a coupled thermal, phase transformation, internal stresses calculation model is presented. Especially, the stress-phase transformation interactions (transformation plasticity and kinetics modifications through internal stresses) are taken into account in this model, not only for martensitic transformation but also for diffusion dependent transformation. Using a specific case, the cooling of a cylinder made of eutectoid carbon steel, an analysis of how the stress phase transformation interactions affect the internal stresses, and plastic strain evolutions during cooling are performed. The calculated results show that internal stresses have an important effect on the kinetics of pearlitic transformation. These changes in transformation kinetics modify the levels of the internal stresses themselves and the residual stresses.
