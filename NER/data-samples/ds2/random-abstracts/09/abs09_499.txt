Abstract Y2-xGdxO3:Eu3+ luminescent thin films have been grown on Al2O3(0001) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Films grown under different deposition conditions have been characterized using microstructural and luminescence measurements. The crystallinity, surface morphology and photoluminescence (PL) of the films are highly dependent on the amount of Gd present. The photoluminescence (PL) brightness data obtained from Y2-xGdxO3:Eu3+ films grown under optimized conditions have indicated that Al2O3(0001) is one of the most promising substrates for the growth of high-quality Y2-xGdxO3:Eu3+ thin-film red phosphors. In particular, the incorporation of Gd into the Y2O3 lattice could induce a remarkable increase of PL. The highest emission intensity was observed with Y1.35Gd0.60Eu0.05O3, whose brightness was increased by a factor of 3.1 in comparison with that of Y2O3:Eu3+ films. This phosphor may be promising for application in flat-panel displays.
