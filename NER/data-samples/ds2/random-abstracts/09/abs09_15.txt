Abstract An aramid resin, poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA), was electrodeposited on an indium-tin oxide electrode as a mechanically stable film from a dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Two aniline derivatives, o-phenylenediamine and o-aminophenol, were electrooxidized from H2SO4 aqueous solutions using the PPTA film-coated electrode. The PPTA film was permeable to the aniline derivatives, and the derivatives were electrooxidized on the electrode surface. When the derivatives were electrooxidized, the film immobilized the corresponding oligomer species as well as the polymers plain (o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) and poly(o-aminophenol) (PoAP), and the deposited amount of the polymers was increased by the PPTA film. The immobilized amount of PoAP was greater than that of PoPD because of the 1,4-substituted structure of PoAP. In the PPTA film, both PoPD and PoAP were electronically stabilized, and they became durable against oxidative degradation.
