Abstract The fractal dimension of the residual deformation relief on the surface of titanium nickelide is shown to be sensitive to the deformation mechanism. It decreases under phase-transformation-induced inelasticity and increases under plasticity. At the time the basic deformation mechanism changes, fluctuations are maximal. The experimental dependence of the microstrain on the fractal dimension for the initial austenitic phase is not a single-valued function: it consists of two groups of data points that correspond to different deformation mechanisms.
