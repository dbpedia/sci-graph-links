Abstract High-strength coatings on alloys of various morphology prepared by methods of surface impregnation are effective (wear resistant) in operation and economical in production. The requisite structure, wear resistance, and antifriction properties can be provided by a proper choice of the production technology of the coating and the quality parameters of the triboengineering layers, which determine the operating capacity, namely, the geometric (thickness of the coating and depth of the diffusion zone), structural (porosity, phase composition, substructural components), and physical and mechanical (macro- and microstresses, microhardness) parameters and the strength of cohesion with the substrate.
