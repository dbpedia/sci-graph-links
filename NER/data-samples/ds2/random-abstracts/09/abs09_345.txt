Abstract Temperature dependences of resistivity, ρ(T), and Hall coefficient, R H (T), in a 2D doped antiferromagnet are studied for various forms of the dynamic spin susceptibility X(q, θ) (in the mean-field approximation, taking into account attenuation and renormalization of the magnetic excitation spectrum θq, and for so-called strongly overdamped magnons). Doped CuO2 planes in cuprates are considered in the one-band model of the Kondo lattice. Charge carrier scattering anisotropy, which strongly depends on temperature, is taken into account using the density matrix formalism and seven-moment approximation for the nonequilibrium distribution function. It is shown that the behavior of ρ(T) and R H (T) is completely determined by the renormalization θq → $$\omega _q \to \tilde \omega _q $$ of the spin wave spectrum (the renormalization is essentially controlled by the fulfillment of the sum rule for X(q, θ) and by the strong temperature dependence of the gap δ(T). The resultant ρ(T) and R H (T) dependences match the experimental data for optimally doped high-T c superconductors.
