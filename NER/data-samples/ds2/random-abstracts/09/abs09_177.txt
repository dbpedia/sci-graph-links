Abstract Effects of temperature on fracture characteristics of type 304 stainless steel at cryogenic to elevated temperatures are investigated. Three point bending fracture tests according to ASTM E1820 guidelines are conducted on single edge notched bending specimens made of cold drawn flat bars in a temperature range of −195 °C to 500 °C. The test setup includes a thermal chamber, a temperature display and control unit capable of maintaining desired thermal conditions and a remote displacement recording device. Crack lengths are estimated by using load-load line displacement curves with proper calibration equations. The temperature dependency of tensile properties of the test material is also considered. Resistance curves (J-Δa) are then determined for ten values of test temperature. Finally, fracture parameters of test specimens such as critical J values and tearing modulus are extracted. Results reveal that harsh thermal conditions have significant effects on ductile fracture performance of type 304 stainless steel.
