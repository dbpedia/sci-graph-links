Conclusions 1.The maximum density of plasma energy, the qualitative characteristic of which is the specific power of the discharge, provides the greatest thickness of the diffusion layer in saturation from a gas medium at a constant temperature.2.The dependence of the specific power of the discharge on the pressure of the saturating medium has a maximum in various kinds of ITCT of metals and alloys, i.e., nitriding, carburizing (nitrocarburizing), and siliconizing.3.The energy characteristic of the glow discharge, i.e., its specific power, should be one of the main factors determining the diffusion saturation in all kinds of ITCT.
