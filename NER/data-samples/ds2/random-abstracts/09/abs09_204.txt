Summary We have grafted butyl rubber from PVC under a variety of conditions. The physical-mechanical properties of these graft copolymers have been examined both before and after extraction with hexane of the ungrafted butyl rubber. We have found a significant increase in the tensile strength of these materials upon S2Cl2 treatment (curing) in THF solution. This increase was observed even with unextracted copolymers. Electron micrograph studies suggest that curing causes an aggregation of the butyl rubber segments into crosslinked domains.
