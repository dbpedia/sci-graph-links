Abstract The fatigue strengh reduction factor K, can be mitigated or eliminated by suitable surface treatments. Analysis of these affects requires the knowledge of the distributions of load stresses and of residual stresses below the surface of notches. This paper describes a simple, approximate formula to determine load stress distributions and residual stress distributions at notches. The load stress distributions by the present approach were compared with finite element analysis under tension, bending and torsion loading. Residual stress distributions by the simple formula were compared with measured date by shot peening. An example of optimization in surface treatments by such analysis is shown.
