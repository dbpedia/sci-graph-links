Abstract Single-pulse chaos are studied for a functionally graded materials rectangular plate. By means of the global perturbation method, explicit conditions for the existence of a Silnikov-type homoclinic orbit are obtained for this system, which suggests that chaos are likely to take place. Then, numerical simulations are given to test the analytical predictions. And from our analysis, when the chaotic motion occurs, there are a quasi-period motion in a two-dimensional subspace and chaos in another two-dimensional supplementary subspace.
