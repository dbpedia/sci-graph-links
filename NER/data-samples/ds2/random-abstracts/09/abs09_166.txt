Summary Anisotropic orientation of liquid crystalline epoxy(LCE) resin on carbon fiber(CF) surface was investigated and it was correlated with curing behavior and thermomechanical properties of LCE. Anisotropic orientation of a LCE resin was spontaneously induced on CF surface along a long molecular axis of CF during curing and the anisotropic orientation was maintained after curing. Curing of LCE was accelerated by alignment of LCE on CF and anisotropic orientation of LCE enhanced dynamic modulus of CF reinforced LCE composites.
