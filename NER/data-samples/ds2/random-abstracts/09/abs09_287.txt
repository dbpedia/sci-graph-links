Abstract An analytical study is made of the physicomechanical nature of the dynamic hardness coefficient for a cone with an arbitrary angle at the tip, this coefficient being the main criterion for substantiation of the method of double dynamic indentation. A relationship is established between the criterion and strength, as well as the elastoplastic strain properties of metals. A study was made of the laws governing the distribution of pressure and stress over the surface of elastoplastic contact of a conical indenter with a half-space, with allowance for strain-hardening. The study results were used to establish a theoretical foundation for developing a quick and highly accurate method of checking the hardness of metal products on the basis of parameters characterizing elastoplastic contact strain.
