Abstract A technique is developed for measuring the modulus of elasticity of a material with a Nanoscan scanning force microscope on the basis of measuring the dependence of probe vibration frequency on the penetration depth of the needle into the specimen. This technique makes it possible to study materials with elastic moduli from 50 to 1000 GPa. The Young moduli of dense films of carbon nanotubes oriented at angles of 45° and 90° to the quartz substrate are measured. From their ratio, the Young modulus in the direction perpendicular to the tubes and the anisotropy of the elastic moduli are determined. A comparison of these values with the corresponding values obtained for a nanotube film deposited on a silicon substrate is carried out. On the basis of this comparison, a conclusion is made concerning the interaction between single-layer nanotubes and between nanotubes in a mixture of single-layer and multilayer ones.
