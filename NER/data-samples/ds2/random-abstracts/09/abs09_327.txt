Abstract The structure and crystallographic orientation of aluminum films in the Al-Ti-Si and Al-Ti-SiOx-Si systems is studied with the use of electron microscopic, electron diffraction, and x-ray methods and thermodynamic analysis. The role of barrier layers formed by Ti and by the “Ti-SiOx low-temperature oxide” composition in the formation and orientation of aluminum grains is determined.
