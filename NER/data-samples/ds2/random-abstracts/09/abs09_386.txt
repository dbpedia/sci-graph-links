Abstract This work presents the fabrication of magnetic field microsensors based on the magneto-impedance phenomenon and dedicated to NDC applications. The multilayer structure, ferromagnetic/conductive/ferromagnetic, is composed of a copper layer sandwiched with two Finemet® alloy films. The later, initially an amorphous material, is nanocrystallized by heat treatment. The fabrication process has been optimized in order to minimize coercivity and induce transversal anisotropy. The technological defects induced by the lift-off and sputtering processes change the magneto-impedance properties of the sensors. Eliminating these defects permits the sensor to reach to a sensitivity of 1,200 V/T/A at 30 MHz with a bias field larger than the anisotropy field and without hysteresis. The angular dependence of the sensitivity shows that the sensor is only sensitive to the axial component of the magnetic field.
