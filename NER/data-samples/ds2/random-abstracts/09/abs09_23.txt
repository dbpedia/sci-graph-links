Abstract A mixed-mode thermoelectroelastic fracture problem of a functionally graded piezoelectric material strip containing two parallel axisymmetric cracks, such as penny-shaped or annular cracks, is considered in this study. It is assumed that the thermoelectroelastic properties of the strip vary continuously along the thickness of the strip and that the strip is under thermal loading. The crack faces are supposed to be insulated thermally and electrically. Using integral transform techniques, the problem is reduced to that of solving two systems of singular integral equations. Systematic numerical calculations are carried out, and the variations of the stress and electric displacement intensity factors are plotted for various values of dimensionless parameters representing the crack size, the crack location and the material non-homogeneity.
