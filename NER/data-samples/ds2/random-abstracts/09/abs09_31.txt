Summary A two-dimensional mixture theory is developed for wave-propagation in a laminated composite material. The formulated theory is applied for the treatment of a semiinfinite crack propagating in the composite in mode-I and II types of motion. The maximum velocity of the crack tip is determined by the minimum value of the dispersion curves of the relevant generalized Rayleigh waves in the medium. A numerical procedure is applied for the determination of the dynamic stress fields induced by the propagating crack in a laminated composite made of glass-epoxy layers.
