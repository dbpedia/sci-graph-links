Abstract A comprehensive study was made of structural and phase transformations in an alloy based on Ni3Al. It is shown that the aggregate structure formed in the alloy —in which particles of Cr7C3 carbides are located preferentially along grain boundaries — block the migration of the carbides. The intensive dissolution of the strengthening carbide phase seen at T ∼ 1573 K is accompanied by the formation of two-phase (γ + γ′) boundary regions. These regions are the result of an increase in the concentration of chromium. The method of differential thermal analysis was used to detect the occurrence of an endothermic reaction in the alloy at T>1573 K. This reaction is associated with saturation of the γ-phase with carbon up to the eutectic concentration and the fusion of the eutectic.
