Abstract In the present study, graphene-based nanocomposites containing different amounts of nanofiller dispersed into Bis-GMA/tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (Bis-GMA/TEGDA) polymer matrix have been prepared. In particular, the graphene dispersions, produced at high concentration (up to 6Â mg/ml) by simple sonication of graphite in TEGDA monomer, have been used for the direct preparation of nanocomposite copolymers with Bis-GMA. The morphology of the obtained nanocomposites has been investigated as well as their thermal and mechanical properties. SEM analyses have clearly shown that graphene deeply interacts with the polymer matrix, thus resulting in a reinforcing effect on the material as proved by compression and hardness tests; at variance, graphene does not seem to affect the glass transition temperature of the obtained polymer networks.
