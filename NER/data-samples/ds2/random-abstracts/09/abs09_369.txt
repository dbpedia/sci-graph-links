Abstract To fulfill the demands of ever increasingly smaller sizes, lighter weight, and lower price points for optoelectronic products, the size and thickness of each component must as a result be reduced. Since a thinner liquid crystal display (LCD) panel can effectively reduce the thickness of an optoelectronic product, the thickness of a LCD panel is usually thinned out through polishing. However, polishing is likely to produce an uneven surface on the LCD panel which can lead to incomplete fracturing of the anisotropic conductive film (ACF), disabling electrical conductivity. This research focuses on the elimination of the influences of uneven LCD panels in the chip on glass (COG) process. In addition to the standard process parameters a thin film of Teflon was inserted between the bonding head and the driving IC to minimize the influences of an uneven LCD panel. Experiments show that a 0.1 mm thick Teflon film in association with a 290°C bonding head temperature, a 7 s bonding duration, and a 17 kg bonding pressure, can effectively overcome the influence of an uneven LCD panel with 20 μm surface roughness. The yield rate in the production line is thus improved from 95.5 to 99.5%.
