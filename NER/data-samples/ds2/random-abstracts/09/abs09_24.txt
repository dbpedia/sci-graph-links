Abstract This article reviews recent applications of controlled wrinkling for creating structured and/or patterned interfaces, and its use in metrology. We discuss how wrinkles develop as a result of in-plane compression of thin sheets. As the wavelength of wrinkles is only dependent on elastic properties and thickness of the sheets, the phenomenon can be used in metrology for determination of elastic properties. The second aspect is its use for patterning and topographical structuring of surfaces. If mechanical properties and thickness are well controlled, wrinkle orientation and geometry can be tailored. Wavelengths between fractions of a micron and many micrometers are feasible. This process is based on a macroscopic deformation and upscaling to larger areas is possible which provides an attractive alternative to bottom-up or top-down approaches for surface patterning. We describe the formation of stable surface wrinkles in thin sheets of different materials having different surface chemistries, report on applications, and discuss the usefulness of wrinkles for building hierarchical structures.
