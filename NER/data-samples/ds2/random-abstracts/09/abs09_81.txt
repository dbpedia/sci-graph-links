Abstract The order-disorder phase transition in Ni3Fe alloy (26.4 at.% Fe) is investigated experimentally, determining the transition temperature, the size of the antiphase domains, the temperature dependence of the degree of long-range order, and the lattice parameter. The differing and common features of the order -disorder transition in the alloys Ni3Fe and Cu3Au are discussed, and the temperature dependence of the degree of long-range order in these alloys is compared with theoretical predictions, including results obtained by the Green's function method in the present work.
