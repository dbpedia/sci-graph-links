Abstract A micromirror actuated by three piezoelectric microcantilevers is presented for optical data tracking of high-density storage application. The microcantilevers are actuated by 2.5-μm-thick lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films which are deposited on the silicon-based substrate by a compatible sol–gel route. The X-ray diffraction result shows that the PZT film is perovskite structure and has a typical good ferroelectric loop. The quasi-static displacement of the mirror plate increases linearly with increasing the driving voltage and the tracking resolution on disk is as high as 8 nm/V. The micromirror also provides a high bandwidth of about 21 kHz, which is high enough to support the optical data tracking of future high-density storage.
