Abstract This paper concerns mainly on various ring properties of some subrings of a skew triangular matrix ring. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for a skew triangular matrix ring with constant diagonal over a ring to satisfy a certain ring property which is among being local, semilocal, semiperfect, semiregular, left quasi-duo, clean, (weakly) nil clean, exchange, uniquely (nil) clean, Hermite ring, stably finite, semiregular and I-ring. It is also proved that the projective-free property of a ring preserves by a skew triangular matrix ring with constant diagonal.
