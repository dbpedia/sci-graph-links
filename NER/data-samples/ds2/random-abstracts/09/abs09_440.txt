Conclusions 1.Die forging of hemispherical blanks of pseudo-α-titanium alloy in the temperature range of the (α+β)-region in a dynamic recrystallization regime for β-phase leads to preparation in the metal of a weak prismatic texture and components with a predominantly basal orientation form in the vertical direction of a layer in which they are arranged not with a continuous front, but intermittently.2.The weakly textured state of the metal with a discontinuous layered arrangement of components with a predominantly basal orientation gives rise in the vertical and chord directions to isotropicity of ductility, a little anisotropy for strength, and marked anisotropy for impact strengtha 1.
