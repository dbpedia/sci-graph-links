Abstract Nitriding of the industrial alloy FS 65 in conditions of self-propagated high-temperature synthesis was investigated. The effect of the phase composition of the initial alloy on the combustion process was established. The dependence of the degree of nitriding of the products of combustion on the nitrogen pressure, sample diameter, and dilution of the initial batch with inert and activating additives was investigated. Silicon nitride with a 0.07% residual iron content was obtained by the method of acid concentration.
