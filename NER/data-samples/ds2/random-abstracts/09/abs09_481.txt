Abstract The electrochemical behavior of a series of Cu-(7, 30, 50, 70â€‰wt%)Ni alloys in borate buffer and sodium sulfate solutions with and without argon purging was studied by cyclic voltammetry and the photocurrent response method. It is shown that nickel has an effect on both the dark and photocurrents and stimulates oxide film formation. The measurements show that oxygen leads to the formation of passivating p-type Cu2O layers. In sulfate solution this type changes at the potential of the onset of intense alloy dissolution.
