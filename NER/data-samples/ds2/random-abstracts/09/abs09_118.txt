Abstract PurposeThe aim of this study is to compare the results of different operating techniques and suture materials for pyloric exclusion procedures. MethodsThe study was conducted on a sample of 125 rats. Transgastric pyloric exclusions with gastrojejunostomy were performed on the first 50 rats, which were divided into two groups each of 25: a resorbable (polyglactin) suture material was used in the first group and a nonresorbable (silk) material was used in the second group. External pyloric exclusion with a gastrojejunostomy were performed in a subsequent group consisting of 50 rats, again divided into two subgroups of 25 each with an absorbable (polyglactin) suture material used in one and a nonabsorbable (silk) material used in the other. For the last 25 rats external pyloric exclusion with a gastrojejunostomy were performed and a nonresorbable (polypropylene) material was used. ResultsThe ratio of pyloric reopening was higher in the transgastric group than the external exclusion group on the 14th day (P = 0.01). The external pyloric exclusion group with polypropylene suture material had the lowest ratio of pyloric reopening. ConclusionThe external pyloric exclusion technique with nonresorbable (preferably polypropylene) suture material was therefore found to provide a higher pyloric closure incidence on the 14th day, which is the necessary duration period for healing in duodenal injuries.
