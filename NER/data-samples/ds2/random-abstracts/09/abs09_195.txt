Abstract The use of reconstructed silicon wafers obtained after high temperature annealing under H2 atmosphere was demonstrated as an efficient way for increasing the bonding energy of silicon hydrophobic bonding (Rauer et al. 2013). Mechanisms occurring in these bondings are the focus of this paper. Si bonding interface closure was analyzed at the nanometer scale using X-Ray Reflectivity and Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy in multiple internal reflexion mode. These two characterization techniques enable one to follow the interface closure taking under consideration mechanical and chemical aspects. We have shown that the terrace morphology and the monohydride surface termination specific to reconstructed Si surfaces both play a role in obtaining an efficient bonding gap closure after annealing at low temperature.
