Abstract In this paper, for a bounded lattice $$L$$ L and an ideal $$I$$ I of $$L$$ L , we introduce the zero-divisor graph of $$L$$ L with respect to $$I$$ I , denoted by $$\Gamma _I(L)$$ ΓI(L) . We study the interplay of lattice-theoretic properties of $$L$$ L with graph-theoretic properties of $$\Gamma _I(L)$$ ΓI(L) .
