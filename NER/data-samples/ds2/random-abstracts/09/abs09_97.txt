Abstract The measurement of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of composite materials using electrical resistance strain gages is addressed. Analytical expressions for the CTEs of an orthotropic lamina are derived, accounting for the effects of transverse sensitivity and possible misalignment of the gages. Experiments are performed for the characterization of the thermal expansion behavior of a fiber-glass-reinforced epoxy unidirectional lamina using an invar specimen as reference material. Preliminary training cycles are performed for the determination of an optimal heating rate for the measurements, which ensures thermal equilibrium conditions. Three measurement cycles yield the principal CTEs of the lamina α1, α2 and α12 with repeatability within ±0.34×10−6, ±0.85×10−6 and ±2.8×10−6/°C, respectively. It is noted that inhomogeneity of the specimen and variation in thermomechanical properties of the gages can cause a noticeable spead in the measurements.
