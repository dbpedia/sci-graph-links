Abstract At two interfacial-tension measurement experiments with the same experimental conditions, steel samples and mold flux samples of the same compositions were melted in crucibles from the same batch. During the first experiment, the steel drop melted far below its liquidus and then was emulsified. At the second experiment, the steel melted at the expected temperature but did not emulsify. The difference that can be identified is the mass of the steel samples.
