Abstract We study the causes of the errors of the method of indentation of materials by statically applied loads used for the evaluation of the characteristics of Vickers hardness. The influence of the anisotropy of sheet materials on the accuracy of the method is investigated. It is shown that the orientation of indentations relative to the axes of anisotropy of the material must remain invariable in the course of the tests and that the orientation of the sides of indentations is preferable as compared with the orientation of its diagonals.
