Abstract A highly efficient donor polymer, PTB7-Th, combined with acceptor fullerene PC71BM was introduced as the subcell in the series-connected tandem devices to achieve high-performance polymer tandem solar cells. Design of the device architecture was investigated using modeling and simulation methods to identify the optimal structure and to predict performance of the tandem cells. To address the challenge of current matching between the constituent subcells, the effect of active layer thickness, different device structure, and use of ultrathin Ag film were analyzed. It was found that the distribution of optical intensity in the tandem structure can be optimized through the optical spacer effect of interfacial layers and micro-cavity effect derived from the embedded ultrathin Ag film. Our results indicate that the efficient light utilization with appropriate subcells can allow achievement of power conversion efficiency of 12%, which can be 25% higher than that of a single cell of PTB7-Th.
