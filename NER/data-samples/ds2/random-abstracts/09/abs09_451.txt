Conclusions 1.Pearlitic and martensitic transformations in steels 75Kh2GNMF are insensitive to tensile stresses not exceeding 800 N/mm2.2.The kinetics of bainitic transformation depends substantially on the applied stresses. Tensile stresses accelerate this transformation and lower the limit degree of decomposition.
