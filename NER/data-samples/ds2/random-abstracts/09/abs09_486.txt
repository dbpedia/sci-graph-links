Abstract We have fabricated tunnel junctions on thin films of Y1Ba2Cu3O7 which were epitaxially grown by magnetron sputtering on (100) and on (110) oriented SrTiO3 substrates. These junctions of the type Y1Ba2Cu3O7/barrier/Pb or In showed with high reproducibility in the conductance a gap-like structure with the maxima nearÂ±16mV. We supplied experimental arguments that this structure reflects properties of the quasi particle excitation spectrum of Y1Ba2Cu3O7. The gap-like structure was found to disappear atT c mainly by weakening and not by a shift of the peaks to lower voltages.
