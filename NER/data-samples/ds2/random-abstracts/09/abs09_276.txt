Abstract In this paper the methodology and the results of a contactless thermal characterization of a high temperature test chamber will be introduced. The test chamber is used for fatigue testing of different MEMS devices where the homogenous temperature distribution within the close proximity from the heating filaments is very important. Our aim was to characterize the evolving temperature distribution inside the test chamber. In order to achieve smaller time constant a new contactless sensor card was developed. The contactless thermal characterization method introduced in this paper enables in situ heat distribution measurement inside the test chamber during operation, with the detection of potentially uneven heat distribution.
