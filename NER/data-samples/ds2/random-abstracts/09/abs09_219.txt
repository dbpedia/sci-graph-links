Abstract Measurements of the rotation rate of polar magnetic features during 1974–76 lead to a significantly slower rotation rate than that found earlier for polar faculae in 1951–54. Similarly, the rotation rate of these features is slower than the Doppler-determined rate at polar latitudes or the rotation rate of polar filaments. It is suggested that the strong latitude rotation gradient in the subsurface magnetic flux tubes which is implied by these results may presage a very active solar maximum for cycle 21.
