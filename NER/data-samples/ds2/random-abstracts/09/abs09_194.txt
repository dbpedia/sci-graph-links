Abstract Three types of carbon/carbon composites were fabricated using pitch as matrix material. Performance of these composites was evaluated under continuous impact abrasion tests (CIAT). Towards this purpose, a novel testing equipment was designed and developed at AC2T. Tests were carried out at room temperature and 500 °C. The angle of impact was chosen to be 45° and 90°. Analysis of tribological performance was carried out by mass loss. Characterization of the worn surface was done by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical 3D profilometry. In this work, it was shown that wear rates are higher for 45° impact angle compared to 90° for all composites investigated. Fibre debonding and fibre pull out was observed to be the dominating wear mechanisms for these composites during CIAT procedure under normal impact abrasion. Removal of chunk of material contributes to wear under oblique impact abrasion.
