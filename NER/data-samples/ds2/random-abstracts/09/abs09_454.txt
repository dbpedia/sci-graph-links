Abstract In this paper, a 1-V bulk-driven analog winner-takes-all circuit with programmable k-winners capability is proposed. By presetting a set of binary bits, the desired k-winners-take-all or k-losers-take-all function is programmable. The proposed upward-and-downward searching greatly improves the response time. The chip has been fabricated with a 0.25-μm CMOS technology. Simulated results show that the response time of the winner-takes-all circuit is 50 μs under 5-mV identified resolution. The input range is approximately to be rail-to-rail.
