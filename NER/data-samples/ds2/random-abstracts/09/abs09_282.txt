Abstract A unique fabrication method for a curved copper micromesh is proposed and demonstrated. A PDMS mold was fabricated using a microcasting process and then used as a flexible mold in copper electroplating. The fabricated copper micromesh was well formed and connected without any cracks within the entire mold area. The experimental results verified that the fabricated features of the copper micromesh accurately followed the shape of the microstructures and the curvature of the PDMS mold. This unique fabrication method provides an alternative means to produce curved or three-dimensional metal microstructures.
