Abstract. A study is presented on polymetallic remains from several phases of production, refining and moulding processes from metals recovered in Lixus (bronze 6th and iron 2nd century b.c.). SEM/EDX and metallographic techniques are used in a typographical study comparing chemical and microstructural information so that the hypothesis on metallurgical activity can be verified in a technological context (furnace types and construction materials, fuels, alloys, tools, etc) and the socioeconomic context. A re-casting metallurgical furnace is studied to obtain alloys and proof of their use, for instance from the fuel charge of charcoal and bronze nodules recovered from around the furnace. The set of iron material represents practically the whole process of iron production in an ancient smelting furnace. After cleaning the samples, macroscopic analyses permit to differentiate three kinds of materials from the direct reduction process for iron: cast slags, remains of the ancient smelting furnace wall, and metallic iron product resulting from iron mineral reduction.
