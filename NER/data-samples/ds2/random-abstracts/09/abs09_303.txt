Abstract â€‚Surface roughness is one of the crucial factors in silicon fusion bonding. Due to the enhanced surface roughness, it is almost impossible to bond wafers after KOH etching. This also applies when wafers are heavily doped, have a thick LPCVD silicon nitride layer on top or have a LPCVD polysilicon layer of poor quality. It has been demonstrated that these wafers bond spontaneously after a very brief chemical mechanical polishing step. An adhesion parameter, that comprises of both the mechanical and chemical properties of the surface, is introduced when discussing the influence of surface roughness on the bondability. Fusion bonding, combined with a polishing technique, will broaden the applications of bonding techniques in silicon micromachining.
