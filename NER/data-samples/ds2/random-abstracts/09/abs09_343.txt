Summary The distribution of adrenergic and peptidergic (“Gomori-positive”) structures of the hypophysial neuro-intermediate complex in Acipenseridae has been studied by means of light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy. Adrenergic fibres (B-fibres) and their terminals have been detected in the neurohypophysis of these fishes. The terminal swellings of B-fibres as well as the terminals of the neurosecretory peptidergic fibres (A1 and A2) make contact with the basement membrane of the connective tissue layer separating the neurohypophysis from the intermediate lobe. Capillaries are situated within this layer and, therefore, the main part of the fibre terminals is in contact with the pericapillary space. The release of catecholamines from the adrenergic terminals into the capillaries connected with the general circulation is supposed. The diffusion of catecholamines through the connective tissue layer into the parenchyma of the intermediate lobe is also suggested. Hence, the glandular activity of the intermediate lobe seems to be under the dual control of adrenergic and peptidergic elements of the hypothalamus.
