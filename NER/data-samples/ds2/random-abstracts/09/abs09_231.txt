Abstract In this work, corrosion of a 16Mn line pipe steel was investigated in a simulated soil solution by weight-loss test, electrochemical measurement, and surface analysis techniques. Moreover, the implication on the pipeline integrity was analyzed. It was found that a layer of corrosion product, i.e., ferrous and ferric oxides, would form on the steel surface to inhibit the further corrosion of the steel. The structure of the corrosion product layer would change with time, resulting in the steel corrosion experiencing a mechanistic alteration. The effects of oxygen and temperature on the steel corrosion were determined. Moreover, the uniform corrosion rate of the steel is within the acceptable range, and thus does not affect the pipeline integrity.
