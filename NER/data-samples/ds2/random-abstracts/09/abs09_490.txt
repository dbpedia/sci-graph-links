Abstract This review gives brief information of experimental conditions employed by different researchers for deposition of cadmium selenide (CdSe) thin films. For the films synthesized at room temperature, films should be annealed and etched to increase the solar cell efficiency. A photoelectrochemical study revealed that values of fill factor and efficiency of CdSe thin films deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrates exhibited maximum value compared to the film deposited on titanium and stainless steel substrates. This review will be helpful to researchers entering in field to understand basics about the electrodeposition of CdSe and its development towards next-generation photovoltaics.
