Abstract Improving the efficiency of manufacturing processes becomes more and more important. This paper describes a new approach where two technologies are combined to manufacture wear-resistant mold inserts for powder injection molding. By combining laser ablation and electrical discharge machining (EDM) specific advantages of the respective technology can be utilized while drawbacks can partially be eliminated. In the following machining results of die-sinking EDM, EDM milling and laser ablation with structure sizes down to 20 μm are presented and a concept for a new type of electrode for EDM is introduced. Furthermore the combined machining center is presented.
