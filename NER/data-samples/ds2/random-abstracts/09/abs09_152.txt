Abstract Changes in surface potential, surface conductivity, mobility in a field, and Hall electron mobility in activated CdSe films with a surface alloy of indium are studied. The strong enrichment of charge carriers on the surface is explained by the presence of a positive charge on the surface, neutralizing the negative charge of oxygen atoms, with the latter being neutralized as a result of interaction of metal atoms with oxygen adsorbed on the surface. The possibility of determining the parameters of volume traps and the absolute surface potential of the film by experiments with surface alloying is shown.
