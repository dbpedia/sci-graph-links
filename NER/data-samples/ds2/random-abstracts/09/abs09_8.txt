Conclusions 1.A study of the mechanical properties of steel 30KhGS showed that repeated impact loads bring out peculiarities which cannot be observed in static tests and in tests involving single bending impacts.2.The curve for impact fatigue strength of this steel as function of the tempering temperature shows two maxima: one at 200°C and the other at 400°C. The magnitude of these maxima is determined by the single-blow energy.
