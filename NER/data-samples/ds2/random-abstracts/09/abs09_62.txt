Conclusions The higher secondary case hardness of steels tempered in the austenitic condition can be explained by the formation of more highly dispersed carbides during tempering due to the lower diffusion mobility of elements in austenite as compared with Î± phase during the first tempering cycles and the smaller phase strain hardening of the matrix during subsequent tempering cycles, as well as the difference in composition and consequently the tendency of the carbide particles precipitated from austenite and martensite to coalesce.
