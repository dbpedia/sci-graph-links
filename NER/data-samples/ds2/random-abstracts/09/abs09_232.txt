Abstract A novel composite microporous polymer electrolyte composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) and mesoporous SBA-15 was prepared. The composite solid polymer electrolyte (CSPE) exhibits ionic conductivity as high as 0.30 mS·cm −1 with a composition of SBA-15 : PVdF-HFP=3 : 8 at room temperature. Infrared transmission spectroscopic results suggested that the mechanism of micropore formation is similar to that of the phase inversion. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrated that the addition of SBA-15 inhibits the crystallization of PVdF-HFP, while the SBA-15 preserves well its ordered mesoporous structure during the course of preparation. The Li/CSPE/MCF of half-cell was assembled, and it showed a good electrochemical and cyclability performance during charge-discharge cycles.
