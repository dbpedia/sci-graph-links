Abstract The difference between the magnetic tension and magnetic shear was calculated for four vector magnetograms of NOAA AR 4474. It was seen that this difference between the two independent angular measures of magnetic stress is less than 18Â° for more than 50% of the pixels. Magnetic tension is thus found to be fairly well correlated with magnetic shear for AR 4474.
