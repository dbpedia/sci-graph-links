Abstract â€‚Originally developed for the replication of high aspect ratio LIGA structures, micro injection molding is presently on its way to become an established manufacturing process. Enhanced technological products like micro optical devices are entering the market. New developments like the different kinds of injection molding with several components open up opportunities for increasing economic efficiency as well as for new fields of applications. Software tools for the simulation of the thermal household of the molding tool and/or the moldfilling process itself can provide useful but not wholly sufficient assistance for the optimization of micro injection molding.
