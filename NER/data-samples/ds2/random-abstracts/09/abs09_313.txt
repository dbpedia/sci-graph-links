Abstract A method for obtaining nickel-fullerene C60 composite electrodeposits (CEDs) is proposed. The kinetics of CED formation under potentiostatic conditions has been measured, and the structure of deposits has been determined. It is established that fullerene particles are hydrogenated during the deposition. The electrochemical corrosion and tribological properties of nickel-fullerene CEDs have been studied.
