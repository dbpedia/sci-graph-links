Abstract The elastohydrodynamic lubrication in a sliding line contact between a flattened rough plane surface and a smooth plane surface is analytically studied. Both surfaces are assumed as elastic and parallel to one another. The flattened rough surface is treated as equivalent to a rough plane surface with uniformly distributed cylindrical asperities evenly truncated on the top. For understanding the elastohydrodynamic lubrication performance between these two plane surfaces, an inlet zone analysis is taken for the elastohydrodynamic lubrication formed between a truncated cylindrical asperity and the smooth plane surface. It is found from the obtained results that the asperity truncation reduces the elastohydrodynamic load-carrying capacity, and this effect is significant for low sliding speeds or/and heavy loads, while it is negligible for high sliding speeds and moderate loads. The asperity truncation increases the friction coefficient of the asperity contact especially at relatively light loads, while it only slightly increases the friction coefficient of the asperity contact at heavy loads. For heavy loads, the asperity truncation can have a significant effect on the reduction in the maximum surface temperature rise. It is recommended by the present study that the surface asperity be truncated in a certain degree in an elastohydrodynamic contact with high sliding speeds and relatively heavy loads because of giving the benefits of considerably reducing the maximum surface temperature rise while maintaining the elastohydrodynamic load-carrying capacity.
