Abstract Core–shell-structured poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/graphene oxide (GO) composite particles were prepared using a facile process, in which GO was adsorbed spontaneously onto a microspherical PMMA surface when hydrophobic microspheres were dispersed in deionized (DI) water stabilized by amphiphilic GO under ultrasonication. The fabricated composite was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, and thermogravimetric analysis. Results showed that the particle surface could be wrapped with GO without the need for surfactants. In addition, electrorheological behavior of the chain-forming process of the PMMA/GO composite particles was observed by optical microscopy under an applied electric field. Both shear stress and shear viscosity related to the strength of the applied electric field were measured using a rotational rheometer. The proposed Cho–Choi–Jhon model was used to describe their ER performances for the entire shear rate region. Moreover, the response of the shear stress to an imposed square voltage at a fixed shear rate was also examined.
