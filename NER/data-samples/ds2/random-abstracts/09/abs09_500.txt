Abstract The treatment of elastomer articles in a low-temperature glow-discharge plasma in fluorinated organics is an effective method for the enhancement of their wear resistance without changing the formulation of rubbers. As a result of plasma-assisted deposition on an elastomer of a fluorinated antifriction film chemically bound to the substrate, the elastomer friction coefficient is considerably decreased, sticking to a counterface is prevented, and the wear resistance of the elastomer is enhanced, retaining their bulk properties. Based on the study of the structure of the antifriction film at different modification stages and its transformation during friction, a conclusion on the mechanism of elastomer surface failure under dynamic friction conditions was made.
