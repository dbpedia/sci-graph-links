Conclusions 1.Shock-wave treatment causes an increase in the uniformity of the ferritic matrix substructure of the investigated steel.2.Static deformation of the explosive treated ferritic-pearlitic steel leads to substructural readjustments providing intense formation of a cellular substructure more uniform than in the original condition, which causes an increase in the strength properties of the steel.3.The increase in uniformity of the processes and in the level of local deformations and also the formation of a complex fracture surface relief in tensile tests of the explosive treated ferritic-pearlitic steel cause an increase in the energy requirement of the fracture process, which may in turn cause an increase in the brittle fracture resistance of the steel after shock wave treatment.
