Summary 1.Our study did not confirm the findings reported in [1–3]. Addition of strontium to iron changes the shape of graphite particles from branched, crablike, to ‘spotlike’ which is more compact. With 0.068–0.072% Sr present, spheroidal graphite is formed neither in the solidification nor in the annealing of iron. Addition of up to 0.8% of Sr does not produce spheroidal graphite and therefore strontium cannot replace magnesium.2.Graphite forms in strontium-treated iron directly from the liquid during eutectic solidification, and the rate and mechanism of growth of graphite particles in ordinary and in strontium-inoculated irons are the same.
