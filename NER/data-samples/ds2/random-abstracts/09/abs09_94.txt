Conclusion An increase in the annealing temperature of deformed molybdenum containing 0.011% of interstitial elements in the 1150–1550°C interval effects a steady increase in the amount of carbon and oxygen atoms on the grain boundaries as a result of their segregation from the grain body. After annealing above 1350°C (an average grain size d≥30 μm), the process of the outflow of interstitial elements onto the boundaries takes place incompletely, as a result of which a supersaturated solid solution is formed in the grain body. Subsequent annealing at 1150°C for 4 h leads to an additional increase in the oxygen content and to the formation of molybdenum-carbide particles on the boundaries; this causes a small decrease in the strength characteristics, and a sharp decrease in plasticity characteristics.
