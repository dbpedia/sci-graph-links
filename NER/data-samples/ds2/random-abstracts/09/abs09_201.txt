Abstract A probabilistic multiscale framework is proposed to characterize the probabilistic behaviors of macroscopic elastic properties of multiphase composite materials. The first-order perturbation-based stochastic homogenization method is extended to incorporate inherent randomness existed in multiphase constituents materials on basis of our previous work for porous material. Moreover, a generalized stochastic method is introduced to combine above with morphological nonparametric uncertainties. A numerical example for coated particulate composite material demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed methods.
