Conclusions 1.Hot deformation accelerates precipitation of excess ferrite and the pearlitic transformation in steels 40 and U8. With decreasing transformation temperatures this accelerating effect of deformation gradually decreases. Hot deformation of steel U8 slows down the transformation in the bainitic region.2.The difference in the rate of decomposition of deformed and undeformed austenite increases with the austenitizing temperature.3.Hot deformation prevents the formation of Widmanstatten ferrite and refines the ferrite and pearlite grains; the dispersity of pearlite remains unchanged in this case.
