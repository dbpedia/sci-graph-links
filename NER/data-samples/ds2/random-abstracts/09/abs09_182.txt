Abstract In a previous paper the authors studied flatness properties of cyclic actsS/ρ (S denotes a monoid, and ρ is a right congruence onS), and determined conditions onS under which all flat or weakly flat acts of this type are actually strongly flat or projective. In the present paper attention is restricted to monocyclic acts (cyclic acts in which ρ is generated by a single pair of elements ofS), and further results on such collapsing of flatness properties are obtained. An observation which is used extensively in this study is the fact that forw andt inS withwt≠t,S/ρ(wt,t) is flat if and only ift is a regular element ofS.
