Conclusions 1.Application of nickel boride coatings to titanium alloys markedly improves their hardness and wear resistance, and it makes it possible to use titanium alloys for operating in friction assemblies.2.Introduction of chromium into the impregnating mixture during annealing activates the boriding process.3.Alloying a nickel boride coating with chromium improves its resistance to crack formation during operation under wear conditions.
