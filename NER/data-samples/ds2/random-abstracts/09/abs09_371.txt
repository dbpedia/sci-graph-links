Abstract Holographic gratings with grating periods between 0.37 μm and 4.4 μm, respectively, were recorded on the surface of TS-diacetylene single crystals by two interfering 257 nm laser beams. Diffraction efficiencies of up to 35 % were obtained for readout with red light of λ = 633 nm. The main modulation mechanism was phase modulation. The spatial resolution was better than 1600 lines/mm. The upper limit of the polymer chain length was 0.6 μm. The holographic sensitivity was 4.5 cm2/J for immediate read-out at 633 nm without processing after exposure. — A weakly exposed latent hologram may be developed simply by gentle annealing the crystal which increases the sensitivity by one order of magnitude.
