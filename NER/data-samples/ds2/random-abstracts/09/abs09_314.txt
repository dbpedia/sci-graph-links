Summary The impact response of an inclined edge crack in a layered medium with a functionally graded interfacial zone is investigated under the state of antiplane deformation. The interfacial zone is modeled by a nonhomogeneous interlayer having the power-law variations of shear modulus and mass density between the coating and the substrate of dissimilar homogeneous properties. Based on the Laplace and Fourier integral transform technique and the coordinate transformations of basic field variables, the transient crack problem is reduced to the solution of a singular integral equation with a generalized Cauchy kernel in the Laplace transform domain. The crack-tip response in the physical domain is recovered through the inverse Laplace transform to evaluate the dynamic mode III stress intensity factors as functions of time. The peak values of the dynamic stress intensity factors are further obtained versus the crack orientation angle, addressing the effects of crack obliquity on the overshoot characteristics of the transient crack-tip behavior for various combinations of material and geometric parameters of the layered medium.
