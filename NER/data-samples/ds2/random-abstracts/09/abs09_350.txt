Abstract Three kinds of UV-curable prepolymers, urethane acrylate (UA), polysilicone acrylate (SA), and epoxy acrylate (EA) were prepared. These prepolymers were mixed in different proportions to modify the properties of an optical fiber coating. The relationships of component-property and structure-property of the mixture coatings were studied. When the proportion was SA:UA:EA=5:4:3, it was used for a single coating, however, the proportion SA:UA:EA=6:5:2 was used for a primary buffer coating. These mixture coatings were applied to optical fibers.
