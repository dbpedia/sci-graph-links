Abstract The asymptotic problem of a conducting crack emanating from the vertex of a wedge in an anisotropic dielectric material under purely electric loading is investigated. The wedge crack in an isotropic material is solved using a conformal mapping technique. The solution of the wedge crack in an anisotropic dielectric material is obtained from that for the transformed isotropic problem after applying a linear transformation method. The electric field intensity factor for the anisotropic wedge crack is obtained in the closed form. The effects of crack and wedge angles as well as anisotropic parameters on the electric field intensity factor are illustrated. The electric field intensity factor is numerically calculated by using the J integral and finite element analysis to validate the exact solution of the electric field intensity factor.
