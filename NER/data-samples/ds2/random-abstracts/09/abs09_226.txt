Abstract A method for the self-calibration of a remote fiber-optic hydrophone (FOH) providing the maximum sensitivity of the sensor in harsh exploitation conditions is proposed. The method is based on the periodic remote control of the current values of the key parameters characterizing the elastic and mechanical properties of the sensor element-micromembrane and optical properties of the measuring Fabry-Perot interferometer that determine the FOH sensitivity at large.
