Abstract The basic aspects of a damage mechanics approach for composites, capable of simulating complete fracture phenomena, are presented. First, for two material examples, ceramic composites and laminate composites, modelling difficulties and state-of-art modelling are outlined. Damage models with delay effects combined with a dynamic analysis are then introduced. Their possibilities are illustrated on one-dimensional bar problems. More complex examples, computed with a F. E. code specific to laminate damage analysis, are also highligted.
