Abstract. Electrically induced birefringence is studied in photonic bi-oriented crystals in terms of molding lightflow in optical devices. In photonic bi-oriented crystals, misorientation of dielectric anisotropic grains results in a dielectric contrast at the grain boundaries. The translational periodicity of the optical constants depends upon a regular network of twisted dielectrics. Due to the anisotropy of the bicrystalline structure the direction of light propagation determines the dielectric contrast at the grain boundaries. In a specific crystallographic arrangement the optical properties of the bi-oriented crystal can be tuned by the electro-optical effect: the periodic dielectric contrast is electrically induced and photonic bandgaps are generated by applying external electric fields. The geometrical requirements for tunable photonic bicrystals are evaluated based on materials employed for electro-optical applications. Tunable photonic bi-oriented crystals may be candidates for fast optical switches, modulators and multiplexers in the optical communication network.
