Abstract We report on the growth of Ge nanowires on a (111) Si substrate using pre-deposited Ge thin films and indium metal catalyst via metal organic chemical vapor deposition. The indium metal was continuously supplied by a trimethylindium (TMIn) source flow. Transmission electron microscopy and energy disperse spectroscopy results revealed that Ge nanowires grew on the indium droplet/Si substrate and that In metal droplets acted as a catalyst for the growth of Ge nanowires. The possible growth mechanism of Ge nanowires may be supplemented by Ge atoms from a reservoir formed by the eutectic alloy formation due to the reaction of In and Ge.
