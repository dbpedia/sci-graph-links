Abstract Creep behavior of nano-silver paste films has been studied over the tensile stress range from 2 MPa to 7.5 MPa and the temperature range from 100°C to 175°C. In this study, all creep tests were conducted on a micro uniaxial fatigue testing system (MUF-1020). It was observed that, under the above test conditions, the steady-state creep rate of the films, $$ \dot{\varepsilon } $$, could be sufficiently described by a power-law creep equation in which both the tensile stress and the temperature were involved. Creep rupture life was analyzed by the following two methods: the Monkman–Grant relationship and the θ projection concept. Based on accurate measurement of the creep strain rate, the prediction of creep life by the Monkman–Grant relation is very close to the test results. The θ projection concept is not only an effective way to predict the creep life, but also an appropriate approach to determine a precise value of creep strain rate. In addition, the Kachanov damage evolution law was employed to investigate the damage evolution of the films. The study showed that the process of damage evolution of the nano-silver films was temperature independent for all tests performed.
