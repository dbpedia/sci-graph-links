Abstract For evaluation of the rheological and mechanical properties of highly filled wood plastic composites (WPCs), polypropylene/polyethylene (PP/PE) blends were grafted with maleic anhydride (MAH) to enhance the interfacial adhesion between wood fiber and matrix. WPCs were prepared from wood fiber up to 60 wt.% and modified PP/PE was blended by extrusion. The rheological properties were studied by using dynamic measurement. According to the strain sweep test, the linear viscoelastic region of composites in the melt was determined. The result showed that the storage modulus was independent of the strain at low strain region (<0.1%). The frequency sweep results indicated that all composites exhibited shear thinning behavior, and both the storage modulus and complex viscosity of MAH modified composites were decreased comparing to those unmodified. Flexural properties and impact strength of the prepared WPCs were measured according to the relevant standard specifications. The flexural and impact strength of the manufactured composites significantly increased and reached a maximum when MAH dosage was 1.0 wt.%, whereas the flexural modulus after an initial decreased, also increased with MAH dosage. The increase in mechanical properties indicated that the presence of anhydride groups enhanced the interfacial adhesion between wood fiber and PP/PE blends.
