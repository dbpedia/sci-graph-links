Abstract Local mechanical fields at inplane loaded interface corners with discontinuous transitions of anisotropic material properties are of particular interest. This is due to the fact that the structural situation of a corner geometry with different material properties can cause singular behavior of the mechanical inplane fields. The boundary finite element method is employed in this study for the investigation of such structural problems. The results obtained with the boundary finite element method agree excellently with reference results and in addition give a deeper insight into the singular behavior of the problem considered.
