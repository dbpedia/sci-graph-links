Abstract.  Thin films of aluminium oxynitride with diverse composition were prepared by dc-magnetron sputtering of aluminium, utilising sputtering power as well as argon, oxygen and nitrogen gas flows to vary the composition. Since film properties depend mainly on the content of incorporated oxygen and nitrogen, a method for quantitative analysis of the main constituents based on electron probe micro analysis with energy dispersive detection was developed. The excellent precision of the quantitative results for aluminium as well as oxygen and nitrogen are shown. Furthermore, a film layer analysis program was applied for the quantification of several films deposited under the same deposition parameters on silicon wafers, from 520 nm down to 40 nm thickness, showing that electron probe micro analysis with energy dispersive detection is a reliable method for quantitative compositional analysis of thin aluminium oxynitride films down to approximately 20 nm thickness. Since this method of analysis provides only bulk information, expected inhomogeneities of the depth distribution of the film components were checked by secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiles of two thin films and correlated to the EPMA results. The thickness of the films was determined by ellipsometry.
