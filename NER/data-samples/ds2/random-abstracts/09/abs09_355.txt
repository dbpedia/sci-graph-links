Abstract The microencapsulation technology was brought in to solidify corrosion inhibitor in order to prolong the releasing time of it. In this work, thiourea (H2NCSNH2) was used as a corrosion inhibitor and microcapsuled using glutin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), respectively, as protective agent. The re-sealing process was used as a way to prolong the releasing time of the H2NCSNH2 encapsulated in microcapsules. It was found that the H2NCSNH2 microcapsule corrosion inhibitor using PVA as a protective agent had a better releasing time. The releasing times of the H2NCSNH2 microcapsule corrosion inhibitors were prolonged from 18 to 48Â h by re-sealing process and using PVA as a protective agent. Both the use of PVA as a protective agent and the application of the re-sealing process decreased the encapsulation efficiency of the H2NCSNH2. The performance parameters on protecting Q235 carbon steel from corrosion in 0.1-M H2SO4 solution were evaluated by polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectra methods. The results showed that the H2NCSNH2 released into the solution from microcapsules could well protect Q235 carbon steel from corrosion and the corrosion-inhibiting mechanisms of it were the same as that of H2NCSNH2.
