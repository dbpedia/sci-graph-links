Abstract Nanocrystalline Zn1 − x Ag x O y (x = 10− 3 − 50 × 10− 3) thin films evolved through electrodeposition over ITO substrate have been investigated for photoelectrochemical splitting of water. Samples were characterized by XRD, EDX, SEM, AFM, UV–visible optical absorption, and Mössbauer spectral analysis. Ag incorporation led to a decrease in the band gap energy and alterations in microstructural and semiconductor properties. Raising Ag concentration in samples up to 1 % at. caused a significant reduction in density and electrical resistivity, enhanced absorption along with red shift to the band gap energy, anodic shift in flat band potential, and increased charge carrier density, enabling 1 % at. Ag-incorporated ZnO films most photosensitive by yielding highest short-circuit current, photocurrent density, and applied bias photon to current efficiency. Plausible reasons have been offered.
