Abstract Studies were conducted with used frying oils in a flat membrane batch cell using five different types of polymeric membranes to decrease the soluble degradation products. During membrane processing, triglycerides permeated preferentially compared to the majority of the polar compounds including oxidation products, polymers, and color compounds. Two of the composite membranes, NTGS-AX and NTGS-2200, selectively rejected polar compounds and oxidation products to the extent of 25–48% and 24–44% respectively. The reduction in Lovibond color values (5R+Y) was in the range of 83–93%. The viscosity of the used frying oil was reduced to the extent of 22%. The composite membranes were effective in reducing the soluble impurities, as well as insoluble particulates, without causing any undesirable changes to the oil. The membrane process appears to improve the life of used frying oils and does not have the disadvantages associated with the active filtration systems, however, for commercial application the permeate flux needs to be improved considerably.
