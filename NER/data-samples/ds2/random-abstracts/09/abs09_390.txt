Conclusions 1.The supplementary alloying of the titanium VT23 (α+β)-alloy with 2–6% Zr and Sn lowers the recrystallization of the β-phase. Oxygen and carbon additives (0.1% each) suppress this process. Additives of ytterium and erbium (0.02% each) in the grade-composition alloy do not exert a pronounced influence on its tendency to recrystallization.2.The texture of the β-phase in sheets 2 mm thick is nonuniform over the cross section after both rolling and annealing, and contains the (110) shear component in the layer at a distance of 1/4h from the surface, which is intensified as a function of alloying due to either dynamic recrystallization during rolling or static recrystallization during subsequent annealing. After rolling, the amount of (110)[001] texture ranges from 7 to 29% as a result of the nonuniform tendency of alloys with different additives to dynamic recrystallization. After static recrystallization during subsequent annealing, the volume fraction of this texture is equalized in all alloys investigated, and amounts to 20–36%.
