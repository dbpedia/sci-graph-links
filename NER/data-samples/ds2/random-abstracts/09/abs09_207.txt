Abstract In this paper we present improvements in the field of batch fabricated micro grippers with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators or pneumatic drives. In this context we illustrate two methods of structuring SMA foils. Moreover, it is shown how the processed SMA elements can be embedded into monolithic SU-8 grippers. We also describe actuator elements for silicon/SU-8 hybrid micro grippers. Furthermore, we report on the advantages of pneumatic micro grippers and how this alternative actuation principle can be fabricated in batch technology. In this regard, a thermoplastic adhesive electrodepositing process is presented.
