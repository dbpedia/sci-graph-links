Abstract Based on Tresca’s yield criterion and the flow rule associated with it, the distribution of stress and strain in a linearly strain hardening elastic-plastic hollow shaft subject to monotonously increasing angular speed and a negative radial temperature gradient—corresponding to the flow of a hot medium—is investigated. Presupposing circular symmetry and plane strain conditions, the problem is amenable to an analytical treatment. It is found that—depending on the temperature difference between the outer and the inner surface—several qualitatively different types of solutions may occur, and a comprehensive discussion of the admissible maximum angular speeds for elastic behaviour as well as of the elastic-plastic states is performed. Moreover, the residual stresses at stand-still are studied.
