Abstract Results of a study of the content of gases (the content of absorbed hydrogen in the first turn) in alloys of the Mg-REM and Mg-Zn-Zr-REM systems and of its effect on the mechanical an corrosion properties of these alloys are presented. The use of the process of flux-free melting with ultrasonic treatment of the melt during crystallization is recommended as an effective technique for concentrating the elevated content of gases in complexly alloyed alloys of type VMD7 and VMD10.
