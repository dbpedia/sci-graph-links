Summary Laboratory experiments have shown that under natural light conditions conidia are formed at night, subsequent maturation taking place the following morning. Maximum germinative power is attained in the afternoon or evening; thereafter it declines. Under conditions favourable to the fungus, infection mainly occurs in the afternoon, so that, if potentially infective conidial material is present, preventive spray or dust applications should be made before noon Whether conidia attached to sporophores will mature depends on atmospheric humidity; whether the loose conidia will retain their germinative power depends on solar (u.v.) radiation. Whether viable mature conidia become infectious depends on the persistence of a water film on the foliage after noon. Crop infection can be predicted with the help of sunshine and rainfall forecasts.
