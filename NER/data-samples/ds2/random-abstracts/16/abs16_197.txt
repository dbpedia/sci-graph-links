Abstract A homogenization result for a family of integral energies $$\begin{aligned} u_{\varepsilon }\mapsto \int _\Omega f(u_{\varepsilon }(x))\,dx,\quad \varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+, \end{aligned}$$ uε↦∫Ωf(uε(x))dx,ε→0+, is presented, where the fields $$u_{\varepsilon }$$ uε are subjected to periodic first order oscillating differential constraints in divergence form. The work is based on the theory of $$\mathscr {A}$$ A -quasiconvexity with variable coefficients and on two-scale convergence techniques.
