Abstract In this commentary, the author illustrates how a clinical case management approach would address Colletteâ€™s environmental concerns alongside her psychic trauma. Appreciating the agency's function of helping homeless women function independently within a 12 month time frame, a clinical case management approach considers an array of interventions which would address the client's economic concerns alongside her wish to regain custody of her children. While these environmental interventions are undoubtedly impacted by her trauma history, clinical social workers must intervene with both the client's inner and outer worlds.
