Abstract The constructs of social capital, entrepreneurial orientation, and performance have been widely researched over the last decade. There is, however, limited evidence of the interrelation between these constructs in a knowledge-based environment. This research investigated such relationships in academic institutions in Metropolitan Melbourne. As a motive to improve performance of academic staff within universities, we examined the role of social capital in fostering entrepreneurial activities. A quantitative survey methodology is implemented via electronic media, facilitated by empirical analysis using correlation and multiple regression. While it can be concluded that the constructs are all multidimensional, varying relationships were identified when statistically examining the interrelations. Overall, there is a significant relationship between the dimensions of social capital and performance, albeit varying between structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions. Entrepreneurial orientation also portrays such significance, albeit varying between dimensions of autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness. Limitations and further research are cited to enhance the understanding of the interrelation of the constructs.
