Abstract The study undertakes to explain the kuhnian notion of paradigm, in order to work out the methodological frame of re-construction of the theory of literature. It introduces the notion of legitimising community, which, according to the study"s claims, plays a determining role in assigning a theory the status of paradigm. It differentiates the notions of strong and weak paradigm, and supports the former because it considers that the "sociological turn" of the theory of science can only occur by asserting the strong notion of paradigm. Using this theoretical frame, the study seeks an answer to the question whether Siegfried J. Schmidt"s 1983 introduction of the empirical science of literature as a new paradigm was legitimate or not.
