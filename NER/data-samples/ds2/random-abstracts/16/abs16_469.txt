Abstract In this commentary, I consider several theoretical and analytical aspects of Tang Wee Teo and Margery Osborne’s case study. I begin by identifying structuralist and cultural themes in Tang Wee and Margery’s theoretical model of human activity. Next, I offer an alternative interpretation for Tang Wee and Margery’s reported findings in terms of the notion of multiple teacher agencies. After that, I discuss the dramaturgical or theatrical nature of the symbolic interactionist model used by Tang Wee and Margery, focusing specifically on the issues of teacher role-taking and curriculum authorship. The paper then ends with a discussion about the significance of Tang Wee and Margery’s study wherein I emphasize the need for science education researchers to give more careful consideration to teacher agency and the analytical value of theatrical metaphors from the field of social dramatism.
