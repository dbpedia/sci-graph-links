Conclusion and summary In this paper, an attempt to define a criteria or a classification of esophagitis has been done in order to apply to clinical observations.(1)The grade of esophagitis was classified in four grades macroscopically according to the autopsy findings of dogs. Reddening and edema of the esophageal fold were defined as the grade I. The grade II was longitudinal linear erosion or ulceration and the grade III was conjugated erosion or ulceration. Deep ulceration and scar formation with or without esophageal stenosis were the grade IV.(2)The transitional change of esophagitis was discussed.(3)Many different features of esophagitis were understood as one process of inflammatory changes of the esophagus and not qualitative change but quantitative process.(4)A criteria for diagnosis of esophagitis was obtained radiologically, endoscopically and pathologically.
