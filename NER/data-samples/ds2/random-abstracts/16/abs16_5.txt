Abstract The rise of social software and Enterprise 2.0 sees organizations rapidly deploying collaboration technologies. Implementing new technology entails change and challenges, and these aspects of Enterprise 2.0 have not been adequately addressed by research. This study investigates change factors specific to Enterprise 2.0 initiatives to contribute to our understanding of their characteristics and idiosyncrasies. Drawing upon grounded theory, we analyze 16 case studies and integrate the results in the context of socio-technical change. To contrast the findings, similarities and distinctions between Enterprise 2.0 and ERP projects are discussed. We further explore and evaluate the conclusions by conducting expert interviews with senior professionals in the field of Enterprise 2.0. Our results indicate Enterprise 2.0 initiatives involve specific change factors, require distinct management strategies and shape new roles in the organization. The findings can enable practitioners in navigating the pitfalls of transferring and applying change management to a new field. For researchers, the study constitutes a point of departure to empirically examine change in Enterprise 2.0 initiatives.
