Abstract. For integers $1 \le p < n$, we consider $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$-valued Radon measures $\mu = (\mu_{\alpha\beta})$ on an open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$which satisfy $$\int_\Omega \left({\rm div} \phi d\mu_{\alpha\alpha} - p \, \frac{\partial\phi^\alpha}{\partial x^\beta} d\mu_{\alpha\beta}\right) = 0$$ for all $\phi \in C_0^1(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^n)$. We show that under certain conditions, $\mu$]*> has an (n - p)-dimensional density everywhere, and the set of points of positive density is countably (n - p)-rectifiable. This simplifies the proofs of several rectifiability theorems involving varifolds with vanishing first variations, p-harmonic maps, or Yang-Mills connections.
