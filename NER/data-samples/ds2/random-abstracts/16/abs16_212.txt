Abstract Far-reaching global currents have brought extensive changes to the nations of Asia. In addition to dramatic demographic transitions that place Asia among the most rapidly ageing regions in the world, there have been extensive economic and policy challenges affecting familial, social, and cultural relationships. In a region where communal accord and familial interdependence have long been esteemed, far-reaching changes are afoot. To understand the issues looming large on the horizon for many Asian governments and to put change in context, it is essential to recognize both the convergence and divergence of these patterns. The focus will be primarily on Asian-Pacific countries where the demographic transition is further along, with illustrative references to other Asian nations.
