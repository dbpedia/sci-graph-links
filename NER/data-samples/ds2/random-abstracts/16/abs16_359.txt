Abstract A coloring of the vertices of a graph is called perfect if the multiset of colors of all neighbors of a vertex depends only on its own color. We study the possible parameters of perfect 2-colorings of the n-dimensional cube. Some necessary conditions are obtained for existence of such colorings. A new recursive construction of such colorings is found, which produces colorings for all known and infinitely many new parameter sets.
