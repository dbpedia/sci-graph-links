Abstract In the paper we deal with the qualitative behavior of solutions of the following equation: $$\begin{aligned} x_{n+1}=ax_{n-1}-\frac{bx_n^2 + cx_{n - 1}^2}{1 - dx_n+ ex_{n - 1}},\quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots \end{aligned}$$ where the initial values x âˆ’1,x 0 are arbitrary positive numbers and a,b,c,d,e are positive numbers. We also study the positive nonoscillatory solutions of the difference equation $$\begin{aligned} x_{n+1}=ax_{n-1} - \frac{bx_n^2 + ax_{n - 1}^2}{1 - cx_n+ x_{n - 1}},\quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots. \end{aligned}$$
