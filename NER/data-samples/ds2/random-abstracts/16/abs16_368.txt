Abstract After a lapse of almost two decades, US energy and mining companies are once again involving themselves with worker housing. Reinvolvement began in the 1970s. It is in response to a recognition of the fiscal consequences of project delays and an industry responsibility to both workers and project area communities. It differs from the heavy reliance on company towns which were prevalent in the US during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Industry involvement now relies not only on supply, but on stimulation. A greater variety of housing initiatives is being utilised and a company must carefully select the housing initiative best suited to its circumstances. These initiatives need to be guided by the following set of decision guidelines: (1) housing function; (2) housing user; (3) housing type and quantity needs; (4) monetary expectations; (5) role of the industry; (6) housing unit location; (7) responsibilities after housing is completed; and (8) amenities and community sharing. Then, housing involvement must be reviewed in light of past and present industry experiences. Innovative ideas need to be evaluated with respect to proven initiatives, as well as their presumed goal and potential for success.
