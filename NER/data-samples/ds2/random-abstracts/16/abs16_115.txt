Abstract We prove a colorful version of Hadwigerâ€™s transversal line theorem: if a family of colored and numbered convex sets in the plane has the property that any three differently colored members have a transversal line that meet the sets consistently with the numbering, then there exists a color such that all the convex sets of that color have a transversal line.
