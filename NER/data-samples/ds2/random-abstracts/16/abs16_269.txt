Summary This article analyses group work with students from two universities in Stone Town, Zanzibar. The students were invited to participate in Teamshaping, a seminar that aims to create effective teams by adhering to the principles of self-help and autonomy. Whereas the students initially showed limited understanding of team work concepts – largely due to a lack of previous exposure to such methods – they soon acknowledged its benefits. In the course of the seminar, the students ultimately chose to discuss the issue of domestic violence. For four consecutive days they explored the possible links between violence, education, poverty, and family. The seminar concluded in a 15-page report that presented the students' findings and revealed a desire to carry out similar projects in the future.
