Abstract In this article we consider functions f that are meromorphic and univalent in the unit disc $${\mathbb{D}}$$ D with pole at the point $${z = p \in (0, 1)}$$ z=p∈(0,1) and having a Taylor expansion at the origin of the form $$f(z) = z + \sum _{n=2}^{\infty}a_n(f)z^n, \quad |z| < p.$$ f(z)=z+∑n=2∞an(f)zn,|z|<p. The class of functions that satisfy the above conditions and map the unit disc such that $${\overline{\mathbb{C}} \setminus f(\mathbb{D})}$$ C¯\f(D) is starlike with respect to a point w 0 ( ≠ 0, ∞) will be denoted by Σ *(p, w 0). We generalize and sharpen an inequality for a 2(f), $${f \in \Sigma^*(p,w_0)}$$ f∈Σ∗(p,w0) , proved by Miller (Proc Am Math Soc 80:607–613, 1980) by use of the coefficients a n (f), n ≥ 3.
