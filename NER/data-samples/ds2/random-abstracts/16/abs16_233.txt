Abstract PurposeThe aim of the study is to ascertain the views of specialist palliative care professionals on patient self-management of cancer pain in order to inform the development of a new educational intervention to support self-management. MethodsThis is a qualitative research study using focus group interviews. ResultsParticipants viewed self-management of cancer pain as desirable and achievable but also as something that could be problematic. Challenges to self-management were perceived in patient attitudes and behaviours, professionals’ own beliefs and actions and the wider social system. Practitioners showed awareness of potential tension between their espoused views (the desirability that patients manage pain autonomously) and their tacit views (the undesirability of patients managing pain in ways which conflict with professionals’ knowledge and identity). ConclusionsPractitioners espoused patient-centred professional practice which inclined them towards supporting self-management. They showed awareness of factors which might inhibit them from effectively incorporating education and support for self-management into routine practice.
