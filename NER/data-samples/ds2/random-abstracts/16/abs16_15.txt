Abstract We discuss the main features of the field-theoretical approach to neutrino oscillations where one combines neutrino production and detection processes in a single Feynman graph. The ‘oscillating neutrinos’ are represented by inner lines of this graph and appear in the calculation of the cross section of the total process as propagators of the neutrino mass eigenfields. We show that this field-theoretical approach leads to a transparent treatment of neutrino oscillations without ambiguities and provides the correct answer in cases where the standard approach fails.
