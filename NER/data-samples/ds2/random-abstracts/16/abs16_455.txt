Abstract Reactions by consumers to unavailable advertised food specials as well as management responses to specific consumer reactions are explored in this paper. Special attention is given to differential shopper reactions and management behavior with respect to race. Information gathered from 219 food shoppers about their latest unavailability experience comprised the data base for the study. The findings suggest that black and white shoppers are similar with respect to purchasing and response behavior. However, the differential management behavior toward black and white shoppers offers further evidence of the continuing discriminatory marketing practices by some supermarkets. Implications from a public policy perspective are presented.
