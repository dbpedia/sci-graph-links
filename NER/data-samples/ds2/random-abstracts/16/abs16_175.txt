Abstract Some operational properties of cubic sets are first investigated. The notion of cubic $$h$$ h -ideals, cubic $$h$$ h -bi-ideals and cubic $$h$$ h -quasi-ideals are introduced and several properties are provided. The characterizations of $$h$$ h -hemiregular hemirings, $$h$$ h -intra-hemiregular hemirings and of both $$h$$ h -hemiregular and $$h$$ h -intra-hemiregular hemirings are studied.
