Abstract. We have studied inclusive muon events using all the data collected by the TOPAZ detector at $\sqrt{s}=58$GeV with an integrated luminosity of 273pb$^{-1}$. From 1328 inclusive muon events, we measured the ratio $R_{q\bar{q}}$ of the cross section for $q\bar{q}$ production to the total hadronic cross section and forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}^{q}$ for b and c quarks. The obtained results are $R_{b\bar{b}}=0.13\pm0.02(stat)\pm0.01(syst)$, $R_{c\bar c}=0.36\pm0.05(stat)\pm0.05(syst)$, $A_{FB}^{b}=-0.20\pm0.16(stat)\pm0.01(syst)$ and $A_{FB}^ c=-0.17\pm0.14(stat)\pm0.02(syst)$, in fair agreement with a prediction of the standard model.
