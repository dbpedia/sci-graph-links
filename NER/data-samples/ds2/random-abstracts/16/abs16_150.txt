Summary This Tinbergen Lecture begins by reviewing empirical evidence about trends in income inequality in a number of Western countries. There is considerable diversity of experience across countries. The first quarter century after the Second World War was not generally characterised by a steady downward trend in inequality, but by episodes of inequality reduction at different dates. More recently, several OECD countries have seen a rise in inequality, but the rates of increase differed and in around half of the countries shown there was no significant upward trend over the 1980s. The differing experiences, and the episodic nature of changes, have implications for the explanations of inequality considered in Sections 2 and 3 of the Lecture. I begin with the mechanism which Tinbergen described in Chapter 6 of hisIncome Distribution: the race between technological development and education. It is argued that behind the supply and demand model there lie a variety of factors, and that the explanation we give may be important in determining whether what we are observing are wagedifferentials or wageinequality. Moreover, we need to consider non-labour income, and Section 3 examines the determination of state transfers and of capital income. Finally, in Section 4, I consider some of the policy implications, focusing on one particular set of policy proposals in which Jan Tinbergen was interested: the idea of a basic income.
