Abstract Hawaii's multiethnic society is explored as a field for researching the impact of ethnicity on the learning of female sex roles via the life history approach. Life history data collected by the author from women of Hawaii's Chinese and Portuguese communities is drawn on for a comparison of their socialization to sex-related roles in the domestic and selected public domains during their girlhoods in the 1920s and 1930s. Discussion examines six categories of information pertinent to research of the ethnicity/sex-role relationship which the case studies suggest life histories are rich in. Possible future directions for research of the topic via the life history approach are considered.
