Abstract. We prove local higher integrability with large exponents for minimizers and Young measure minimizers of variational integrals of the form $$ \int_{\Omega} \! F(x,\nabla u(x)) dx $$ where F is a Carath√©odory integrand that resembles the p-Dirichlet integrand at infinity. The result yields existence of minimizing sequences with higher equi-integrability properties locally in $\Omega$.
