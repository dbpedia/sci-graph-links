Abstract From a questionnaire study of 56 clergy couples and concurrent in-depth interviews with ten selected couples, findings and conclusions are reported. The difficulties confronting the pastor and his wife are discussed and suggestions offered to remedy them. Ministers' marriages are currently undergoing some stress due to social changes in our culture and to changes in the concept of ministry. Some promising new developments suggest that the necessary readjustments can be made over time.
