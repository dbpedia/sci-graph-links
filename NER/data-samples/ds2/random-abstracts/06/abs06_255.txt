Abstract Analysis of stomach contents of samples of clupeid fishes (Japanese anchovy, half-fin anchovy, zunas' scaled sardine, rednosed glassnose and tapertail anchovy) collected from the catches of a 1982â€“1984 fishery resource survey showed they are zooplanktonivorous. Similar food groups, such as copepoda. Chaetognatha, Amphipoda and Mysidacea were found in the stomach. Dietary similarity coefficients were studied to evaluate the degree of similarity in the dietary species-pairs. Seasonal variation is discussed.
