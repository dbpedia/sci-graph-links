Abstract This study aimed to investigate the sinigrin content and antioxidant properties of Dolsan mustard seeds (DMS) and Dolsan leaf mustard (DLM) extracted with 50% acetonitrile. The extracted substances were fractionated by HPLC using a preparative ODS column and then applied to measure sinigirn, total polyphenol (TP), and total flavonoid (TF) contents and antioxidant activities using 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothizoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), electron donating ability (EDA), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The contents of sinigrin (53.77 mg/g), TP (404.33 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract), TF (395.33 mg quercetin equivalents/g extract) were higher content in DMS than in DLM. Antioxidant activities of DMS were a slightly higher than DLM. ABTS, EDA, and FRAP assays showed that there was a linear correlation between TP and TF contents and antioxidant capacity. These results suggested that the antioxidant effects of DMS and DLM might be mediated through the TP and TF contents, providing potential source of natural antioxidants.
