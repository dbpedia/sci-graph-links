Abstract Prey ingested byMnemiopsis mccradyi collected in Link Port (Indian River, east coast of central Florida) consisted mostly of copepod nauplii, barnacle nauplii, bivalve veligers, and adult copepods (Acartia sp.,Oithona sp.); abundances in that order. Compared to relative in situ densities, there was an increased consumption of barnacle nauplii, bivalve veligers, andAcartia sp., and a decreasesed consumption of copepod nauplii andOithona sp., implying that prey selection had occurred. In situ clearance rates (based on numbers of ingested prey, digestion rates, and in situ prey densities) forM. mccradyi (5 cm mean length) were 0.1 to 1.31 h−1 individual−1, depending on prey taxon. These rates are less than those measured previously in the laboratory; however, it is not possible to state if this difference is statistically significant.
