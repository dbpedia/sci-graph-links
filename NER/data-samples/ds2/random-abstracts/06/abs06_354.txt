Abstract The breeding system of Eichhornia azurea (Pontederiaceae) has been described as being both self- and heteromorphic incompatible based on crossing experiments performed on plants grown in an experimental garden. We studied the breeding system of tristylous E. azurea population under natural conditions in the Pantanal wetlands, Brazil. Controlled pollinations were conducted using 35 individuals of each floral morph. Legitimate pollinations produced more fruits than self- and illegitimate pollinations, except for the mid-styled morph which was highly self- and heteromorphic compatible. The number of seeds per fruit was higher under legitimate pollinations than in the other treatments, but self- and illegitimate pollinations produced more fruits and seeds in the Pantanal than for individuals of E. azurea in other populations. The higher fruit and seed production resulting from legitimate pollinations corroborate previous studies, but self-compatibility of mid-styled plants was not previously reported. Overall results indicate a partially self- and heteromorphic compatible system for this species in the Pantanal.
