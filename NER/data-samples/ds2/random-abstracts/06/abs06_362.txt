Summary In 1997 and 1998, we investigated the habitat use of Red-backed Shrikes breeding on farmland in Carinthia, southern Austria. We devised an objective census technique to obtain relative measures of shrike abundance and habitat coverage along 35 1 km transect belts, 60 m in width, positioned randomly throughout an area of 100 1 km squares. Shrike abundance was related to habitat variables by means of general linear models. Bivariate models suggested that Red-backed Shrikes were positively associated with grassland grazed by livestock, fence-lines and scattered trees and shrubs, but negatively associated with arable land and grassland that was not grazed. A model constructed with the help of forward selection indicated that shrike abundance was most strongly associated with a mixture of grazed grassland and scrub. Shrike abundance increased with grazed grassland cover. When the cover of grazed grassland was kept constant, shrike abundance increased with scrub cover up to between 10 % and 15 % cover, and declined thereafter. We tested the validity of the model using data from a further 20 transects, collected in 1998. The number of shrikes predicted under the model was significantly positively correlated with the number of shrikes recorded.
