Abstract A description of the water quality in Lake Kinneret watershed is given Water of high quality is supplied by the Jordan tributaries. Suspended matter and soluble components are introduced into the water along the intensively cultivated Hula valley. The suspended matter introduced is very high in organic matter and nutrients. A partial purification of the water occurs downstream, in the Jordan canyon. The nutrient contents in the river are highly correlated with the suspended load.
