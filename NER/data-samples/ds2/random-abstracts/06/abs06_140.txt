Abstract Biofouling is an important factor that affects the bivalve farming industry. Fouling organisms may reduce growth and survival rate of the cultured species. Fouler are often filter feeders, so they are potential competitors for food resource with the cultured species. The present study was conducted to measure the impact of fouling on food uptake and nutrient release in April and June, 2006 in Daya Bay near Guangzhou, China. Results showed that fouling organisms had significant effect on food uptake and nutrient release. The chlorophyll a uptake rate of fouled scallops was 7.53Lh−1±1.416Lh−1 and 11.94Lh−1±2.497Lh−1 in April and June, respectively, significantly higher than those of cleaned scallops, i.e., 4.23Lh−1±2.744Lh−1 and 2.57Lh−1±1.832Lh−1 respectively. The consumption of total particulate matter by fouled scallops in April and June was 5.52Lh−1±0.818Lh−1 and 3.07Lh−1±0.971Lh−1, respectively; the corresponding results for cleaned scallops are 2.49Lh−1±0.614Lh−1 and 2.37±1.214Lh−1, respectively. Fouling increased ammonia release significantly. The ammonia release rate of fouled scallops was 33.81Lh−1±7.699Lh−1 and 76.39Lh−1±9.251Lh−1 in April and June, while cleaned scallops released 2.46Lh−1±0.511Lh−1 and 7.23Lh−1±1.026Lh−1 ammonia, respectively. Phosphate release of fouled scallops was 22.72Lh−1±9.978Lh−1 in June and cleaned scallops released phosphate 6.01Lh−1±0.876Lh−1 in April. Therefore, fouling contributed much to food reduction and concentration increase of ammonia and phosphate in water.
