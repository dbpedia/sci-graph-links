Conclusion The following general conclusions can be drawn on the seasonal variations in the chemical composition of mackerels:—1.The weight of fish varies directly as length.2.The tendency of ash and protein content of mackerel is to remain constant.3.Water and fat are the components of fish which are subject to seasonal variation and have a reciprocal relationship.4.The fat contents in mackerel rise to a maximum between September to November and fall thereafter gradually.5.The average composition as revealed by analysis in the years 1947 to 1949 is shown below:— Water 73·45% Protein 20·95% Fat 3·29% Ash 1·66%
