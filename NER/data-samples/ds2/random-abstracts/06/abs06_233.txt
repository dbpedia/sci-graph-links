Summary Transparency reduces the chances of detection of large planktonic animals by visual predators. An important constraint on the transparency of planktonic animals may be ingested food which could be seen through the body, thereby increasing the vulnerability of transparent zooplankton to visual predators. To test this hypothesis, we presented fed and un-fed Chaoborus larvae to juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Overall, the presence of prey in the gut of Chaoborus increased their probability of capture by 68%. Predation risks due to the visibility of ingested food increased in proportion to meal size: larvae with nearly full gut were captured about three times faster on the average than larvae which had little food in their gut. Although Chaoborus larvae may be able to reduce this increased predation risk by migrating downward to low light levels, this behavior would reduce feeding opportunities by removing the larvae from surface waters where prey density is generally high. In this way, visual predators may limit the growth and the maximum size that can be achieved by transparent animals.
