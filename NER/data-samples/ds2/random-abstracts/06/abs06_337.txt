Abstract Eight flavonol glycosides were detected in the three species of theFagonia sinaica complex. They were fully characterized as the 3-glucosides of kaempferol, quercetin and isorhamnetin, 3-rutinoside of quercetin and 3,7-diglucoside of quercetin and isorhamnetin. Two additional glycosides were partially characterized as a kaempferol 3,7-diglycoside and quercetin 3-diglycoside.
