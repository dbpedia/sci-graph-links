Abstract The diversity and community structure of planktonic Actinobacteria in a freshwater river and five fresh/saline/hypersaline lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, China were investigated with a combination of geochemical and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses. A total of 387 actinobacterial 16S rRNA gene clones were sequenced, and they could be classified into Actinobacteridae, Acidimicrobidae, and unclassified Actinobacteria. The Actinobacteridae sequences were distributed into five suborders (e.g., Corynebacterineae, Frankineae, Micrococcineae, Propionibacterineae, and Streptosporangineae) and unclassified Actinobacteridae. Some actinobacterial members (specifically Micrococcineae) were present in a wide range of salinities (from freshwater to NaCl saturation). Statistical analysis showed that salinity and salinity-related environmental variables (such as ions and total nitrogen) significantly (r > 0.5; P < 0.05) influenced the distribution of planktonic actinobacterial community in the investigated aquatic biotopes. Our data have implications for a better understanding of the distribution of Actinobacteria in high-elevation lakes.
