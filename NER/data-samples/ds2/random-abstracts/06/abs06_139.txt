Abstract Two species of Digenea are recorded from the intestine of Percichthys trucha (Percichthydae) from Patagonian water bodies. Polylekithum percai n. sp. (Allocreadiidae) is distinguished by its body size, the relative size of the suckers, the anterior extension of the vitelline fields, the number of eggs in the uterus and the different species of fish host from the two previously described species of Polylekithum. Homalometron (= Austrocreadium) papilliferum (Szidat, 1956) n. comb. is redescribed. Due to its spined tegument and the absence of a cirrus-sac, this species is considered a member of the family Apocreadiidae.
