Abstract. In this study, a whole-lake carbon budget for the oligotrophic, clearwater Lake Eckarfj√§rden was established both on an annual and seasonal basis. For budget calculations, the lake was divided into three habitats (pelagial, littoral and benthic) and the biota into 19 functional groups. In the lake, major parts of biomass (97%) and primary production (91%) are concentrated in benthic and littoral habitats and to a few functional groups. Respiration on the other hand, is focused on benthic and pelagial habitats where 60% and 39%, respectively, of the respiration took place. Our conceptual model indicates strong interactions between habitats. For instance, the pelagial is fed with carbon fixed by primary producers in the benthic and littoral zones. On an annual basis, total primary production exceeds total respiration and the lake is net autotrophic. However, there are clear differences between habitats and between seasons. For instance, the littoral is net autotrophic during spring, summer and autumn, the benthic habitat is net autotrophic only during summer, and the pelagial is always net heterotrophic. Our results demonstrate clear couplings between habitats and organisms and the importance of a holistic view when studying lake ecosystems.
