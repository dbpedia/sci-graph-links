Abstract I examined population traits of eight isolated populations of a tropical forest rodent (Proechimys semispinosus, the Central American spiny rat) for 1 year in central Panam√°. Populations were sampled by monthly live-trapping, and seven traits (density, population growth rate, adult survival, reproductive effort, age structure, sex ratio, and body mass) were compared among populations. I also compared results with published data from nearby mainland populations. Each isolated population showed characteristics typical of island populations when compared with mainland populations, including higher and more stable densities, reduced reproductive effort, and greater body mass. Densities were the highest yet recorded for this species, and biomass of these island populations was among the highest of any tropical rodent yet studied. Population traits varied not only between island and mainland populations but also among island populations. P. semispinosus have traits that allow individuals in a population to rapidly respond to temporal changes in habitat quality or resource abundance. These traits include a high reproductive rate and an ability to adjust reproductive effort to changes in density. P. semispinosus are therefore able to quickly reach and maintain high densities under favorable conditions, thereby allowing close tracking of temporally and spatially varying resources. This flexibility is predicted for habitat generalists and presumably promotes abundance and persistence in temporally and spatially heterogeneous environments. P. semispinosus, often the most abundant and widely distributed species of rodent in forests throughout their geographic range, therefore have traits that are similar to those of generalist rodents in temperate forests.
