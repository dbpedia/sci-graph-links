Summary Diurnal carbon dioxide exchange patterns of three salt marsh succulents, Borrichia frutescens, Batis maritima and Salicornia virginica, were determined on a seasonal basis in the marsh at Sapelo Island, Georgia. Year-round photosynthetic activity was observed in these species though winter rates of CO2 exchange were reduced. Net primary productivity, estimated using gas exchange techniques, agreed with previously reported harvest data. The role of light and temperature in the control of seasonal photosynthetic changes was investigated. A similar variation in light utilization with season was found in all three species, while seasonal temperature acclimation was species dependent. Less than 20% of fixed CO2 was lost through dark respiration in any of the species. Water use in the salt marsh succulents was found to be relatively inefficient. High rates of transpiration were observed both summer and winter in the succulents. The succulents were judged to be C3 plants on the basis of several criteria.
