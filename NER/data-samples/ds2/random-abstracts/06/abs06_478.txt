Abstract The role of seed germination in contributing to species ecological breadth and geographic distribution is still a matter of debate. Here, we attempted to relate seed germination requirements with ecological breadth in 12 bromeliad species from heterogeneous montane vegetation in southeastern Brazil. Seeds were set to germinate under both light and dark conditions at a broad range of temperatures to determine the breadth of the germination niche. We ran a RLQ analysis based on the matrices of species occurrence, environmental parameters and germination traits and found a significant association between germination traits, and the characteristics of sites where adult plants occur. The variation of germination responses to environmental factors was not random with habitat-generalist plants having broader germination niches and habitat-specialist plants having narrower germination niches. The RLQ analysis showed that substrate moisture and light environment were the most important factors correlated with germination traits. Phylogenetic niche conservatism appears to play a role in the patterns found here, especially in the Tillandsioideae. There is an association between the regeneration niche of a species and its ecological range, and this also provides support for the idea that the regeneration niche may help assemble plant species into heterogeneous, species-rich communities.
