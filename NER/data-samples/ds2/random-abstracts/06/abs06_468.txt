Abstract Diurnal and seasonal trends in net photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g), transpiration rate (E), vapour pressure deficit, temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density, and water use efficiency (WUE) were compared in a two-year-old Dalbergia sissoo and Hardwickia binata plantation. Mean daily maximum P N in D. sissoo ranged from 21.40±2.60 µmol m−2 s−1 in rainy season I to 13.21±2.64 µmol m−2 s−1 in summer whereas in H. binata it was 20.04±1.20 µmol m−2 s−1 in summer and 13.64±0.16 µmol m−2 s−1 in winter. There was a linear relationship between daily maximum P N and g s in D. sissoo but there was no strong linear relationship between P N and g s in H. binata. In D. sissoo, the reduction in g s led to a reduction in both P N and E enabling the maintenance of WUE during dry season thereby managing unfavourable environmental conditions efficiently whereas in H. binata, an increase in g s causes an increase of P N and E with a significant moderate WUE.
