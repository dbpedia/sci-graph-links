Abstract Distribution of 238U and 226Ra in soils and plants of an industrially polluted area are considered. The dependence between the biological uptake coefficients (BUCs) for the plant species studied and the radionuclide concentrations in soil can be approximated by a decreasing power function. Species differences in radionuclide uptake are demonstrated.
