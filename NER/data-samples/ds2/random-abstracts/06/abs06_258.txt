Summary The distribution and population density of the mole (Talpa europaea L.) and its main food item, earthworms (Lumbricidae) were determined in relation to physical habitat factors in an upland pasture in southeast Scotland. The results showed that the species distribution and the abundance of earthworms were related to the physical habitat. Moles lived in the areas where earthworms were more abundant, and fewer moles were found in the areas with few earthworms. The distribution of moles was not related to the physical habitat. However, because the physical habitat directly limits the abundance of earthworms, it also indirectly influences the abundance of moles.
