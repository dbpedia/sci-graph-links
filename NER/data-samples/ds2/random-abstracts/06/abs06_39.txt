Summary A colorimetric method for the estimation of tannins in green leaf and black tea is described. The absorbance corresponding to tannins and other oxidizable substances is read at 760 nm, the Folin-Denis reagent being used. The absorbance corresponding to non-tannins is read after precipitation of the tannins with gelatine. The tannin content of the tea is calculated by difference.
