Abstract The blackmargined aphid,Monellia caryella (Fitch), exhibited a seasonal pattern with early and late peaks of the population in pecan orchards at Newe Ya’ar in the Yizre’el Valley. A similar pattern was not observed at Kibbutz Sede Eliyyahu in the Bet She’an Valley, where there was a single peak, late in the season. The occurrence of natural enemies indicated that spiders and lacewing eggs were the predators most commonly associated with population fluctuations of the aphid. In most cases the rate of increase of the blackmargined aphid was highest late in the season.
