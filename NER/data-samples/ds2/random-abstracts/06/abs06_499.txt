Summary The effect of temperature upon the development of large hibernated larvaæ of fourMyrmica species has been tested experimentally. Over the viable temperature range of 15–25°C, it was found that:1.There are no differences between the species in the effect of temperature upon development times. All fit the model log Dev. time=a-b T°C with a common value for b. This gives an effective Q10 of about 3.1 which agrees with respirometrical estimates for worker ants.2.The value for the intercept (a) differs significantly between most species confirming the intrinsic difference that has been demonstrated at a constant 22.5°C in previous work. The development times of larvæ can be ordered from fastest to slowest being:Myrmica ruginodis Nyl.,Myrmica rubra L.,Myrmica scabrinodis Nyl. andMyrmica sabuleti Meinert. At any temperature it takesM. sabuleti about 1.5 times as long asM. ruginodis to grow from a large hibernated larva to a white pupa.3.No large differences in larval survival or gyne production could be detected between the temperature treatments. There was an indication that most species, survived best at about 22°C.4.The results are discussed briefly in terms of the ecological distribution of the four species in the South of England.5.The possible effects of a fluctuating temperature regime are discussed, it is suggested that the amplitude of fluctuations may not have any great effect whereas the periodicity could be more important.
