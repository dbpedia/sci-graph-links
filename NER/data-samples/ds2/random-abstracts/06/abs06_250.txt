Abstract From April 1996 to October 1997, regular samplings were carried out monthly at 8 stations in a macrophytic basin of Baoan Lake. From the water samples, 47 genera, 96 species of ciliata were identified. Stations covered with macrophytes had greater number of ciliate species and higher percentage of sessile species. The mixotrophStrombidium viride bearing algal endosymbionts dominated numerically the whole ciliate communities; most of the other dominants were bactivores. Total ciliate density in Lake Baoan was 6170â€“34310 ind./L. The seasonal density fluctuations of the dominant species populations were also investigated. Maximum abundances were observed in spring and winter during the decay of macrophytes and minimum densities were observed during the summer months of luxuriant macrophytes growth.
