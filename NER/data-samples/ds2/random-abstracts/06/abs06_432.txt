Abstract Modern concepts on structural, physiological, and biochemical aspects of salt tolerance of higher plants were considered. Integral physiological processes, such as growth and photosynthesis of glycophytes and halophytes in the context of their ecological plasticity, variety of their adaptive strategies developed in the course of their evolution, and natural selection, were discussed. Analysis of the known anatomical and morphological adaptations of halophytes (succulence, special salt-excreting structures, features associated with special tissues growth, leaf kranz-anatomy and mesostructure) providing their salt tolerance was conducted. The most important physiological and biochemical adaptations of such plants to salinity related to uptake, accumulation and excretion of Na+ and Clâ€“, peculiarities of membrane composition and the pigment system, and protection against osmotic and oxidative stresses were described. The association of physiological and biochemical peculiarities of halophytes with ecological salt tolerance strategy was discussed.
