Abstract Willow buds and twigs compose the main part of the willow ptarmiganâ€™s (Lagopus lagopus) diet during winter. This study evaluated how position of willow ramets in relation to snow level affects the browsing of willow ptarmigan in NW Finland. Ramet position in relation to snow level affected the browsing intensity of willow ptarmigan: 5% of shoots were cut and more than 8% of buds were eaten by willow ptarmigan when ramet was staked at the maximum snow level, whereas ramets bent down were unbrowsed and browsing of ramets staked upright was negligible. Browsing significantly decreased the number of vegetative buds and catkins. The results show that snow level and ramet characteristics are important determinants of willow ptarmigan foraging.
