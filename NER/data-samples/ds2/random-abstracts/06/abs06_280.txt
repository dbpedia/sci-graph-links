Abstract The dependence of laser beam induced current (LBIC) on the junction structure of $$\text {n}^{+}$$ n+ -on-p HgCdTe photodiode has been numerically investigated. The calculated LBIC profiles varying with the junction depth are in good agreement with the experimental results (Musca et al. in J Electron Mater 28:603â€“610, 1999). It is found that there is a linear relationship between the magnitude of LBIC peak and the size of junction, such as depth and length. In addition, the LBIC shape between two peaks becomes more flat with increasing the junction depth. A competition mechanism of lateral and vertical current flow is proposed to explain the junction size dependence of the LBIC signal. The results help us to better understand the induced current flowing in photodiodes with different junction structures.
