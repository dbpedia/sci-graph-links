Abstract A new myxosporean, Zschokkella egyptica n. sp. was found in the gallbladder of two hosts: the eel catfish Plotosus lineatus and the freckled goat fish Upeneus tragula from the Red Sea at Suez City, Egypt. The plasmodia were polysporic, kidney to elliptical shaped with hairy holdfast projection and measured 109 × 70 μm. Mature spores were fusiform with 9 to 11 longitudinal striations. The mean spore dimensions were 13.0 × 10.5 μm. Spherical polar capsules are 4.8 μm in diameter; the polar filament showed four turns and were arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the capsule.
