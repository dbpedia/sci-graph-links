Abstract Among aquatic organisms suitable for biological monitoring, molluscs occupy a prominent place due to their wide geographic distribution, their abundance and accessibility in the field as well as in aquaculture. Molluscs reflect the degree of environmental contamination and are the most useful bioindicator tools. The study of modulation of immune system or immunomodulation in marine molluscs has become one of the privileged ways for evaluating the physiological effects of environmental factors. Physiological responses of molluscs to environmental stresses could be mediated by haemocytes. These cells are continually exposed to the external environment due to the open circulatory system of molluscs and are affected by pollutants. In fact, several studies showed the effects of different environmental contaminants on haemocyte functions (viability, phagocytosis, ROS production) as well as on proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure maintenance using the in vitro approaches. In ecotoxicology, in vitro approach is an alternative to animal testing due to the reduced use of experimental animals, low cost and rapid performance. Although several studies showed the importance of using in vitro cell models to determine the effects of different environmental contaminants on haemocyte parameters in marine molluscs, a few reviews highlight these effects. The main purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent data on the effect of some xenobiotics on haemocyte parameters in some mollusc species and then suggest future research prospects.
