Abstract. The mechanical frequency selectivity of the cupula located in the supraorbital lateral line canal and the frequency selectivity of the hair cells driven by the cupula were measured simultaneously in vivo. Laser interferometry was used to measure cupular mechanics and extracellular receptor potentials were recorded to determine hair cell frequency selectivity. Results were obtained from two teleost fish species, the ruffe (Acerina cernua L.), a European temperate zone freshwater fish, and the tropical African knife fish (Xenomystus nigri). In both species cupular displacement grows with increasing frequency of canal fluid displacement, reaching a maximum at 115 Hz in the ruffe and at 460 Hz in the African knife fish. Cupular best frequencies were independent of temperature. Cut-off frequencies of hair cell frequency selectivity were found to depend on temperature with a Q 10 of 1.75, ranging from 116 Hz (4°C) to 290 Hz (20°C), as established in the ruffe. At normal habitat temperatures of the two fish species (ruffe, 4°C; African knife fish, 28°C), this results in hair cell cut-off frequencies that match the two different cupular best frequencies remarkably well. This match suggests adjusted signal transfer in these two peripheral stages of canal lateral line transduction.
