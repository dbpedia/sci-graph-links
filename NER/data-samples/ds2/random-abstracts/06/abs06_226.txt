Summary A comparison of rectal morphology and ultrastructure is made between a freshwater (A. aegypti) and salt water (A. campestris) species of mosquito larvae, and between A. campestris larvae producing hyper- and hyposmotic urine. The epithelium of A. aegypti contains one cell type characterized by infolding of both the apical and basal membranes, straight lateral borders, and evenly distributed mitochondria. The rectum of A. campestris contains distinct anterior and posterior regions, each made up of a single cell type. These two regions can be distinguished on the basis of cell thickness, depth of apical infolding and distribution of mitochondria. The anterior region is similar to the rectum of A. aegypti, while the posterior region is considered unique to the salt-water species and hence probably is associated with the formation of hyperosmotic urine. In A. campestris, the apical (rather than lateral or basal) membranes are probably the site of hyperosmotic urine production. Two possible mechanisms for this process are discussed.
