Abstract Recent information is presented on biotic and abiotic stresses that have affected the deciduous forest in southeastern Quebec over the last 10 years as well as on the nature and the extent of nutrient imbalances observed over the last five years. A large part of the forest dieback is thought to have resulted from insect defoliation and adverse climatic conditions, particularly drought, which took place in the early 1980's. However these factors alone do not seem to account for all symptoms of the current forest decline. Repeated samplings and analyses of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) foliage in the Quebec Appalachians since 1983 has revealed the occurrence of severe nutrient imbalances, particularly very low K and P concentrations on several sites. More recently, Mg deficiency was found to be associated with declining sugar maple stands in the Lower Laurentians. Appropriate fertilizer applications have restored adequate nutrition of sugar maple during the first three or four years of observation. Disturbed nutrition is discussed in the context of forest nutrient cycling.
