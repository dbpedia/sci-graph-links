Abstract Replacement of grasslands by forests may result in increased water consumption, and the magnitude of this will depend on stand density. To test this hypotheses and evaluate the impact of pine plantations on hydric resources in Patagonia Argentina, we measured over two seasons (1999–2000 and 2000–2001) and at two densities of ponderosa pine plantations (350 and 500 trees ha−1) the following variables: soil water content, leaf water potential (ψ), individual tree growth, individual sap flow, and response of sap flow density (u) to vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Stand transpiration (T) and whole-plant liquid-phase hydraulic conductance (L) were also estimated. Pre-dawn ψ varied from about –0.5 to –1.0 MPa. No differences were found in midday maximum u (1100–1800 hours) on clear days between the 2 measurement years, throughout each season, or between different densities of plantation. Sapflow density was also not correlated with soil water storage up to 1.4 m soil depth. Sapflow increased until VPD of about 2.3 kPa, and decreased at VPD >4 kPa, describing a hysteresis in the afternoon. Values of L in Patagonian trees were similar to those recalculated from published data for pines of the same height in the USA. Average stand transpiration increased with increased density (2.07 and 3.08 mm day-1 for 350 and 500 pines ha-1, respectively) and size of the trees. We conclude that ponderosa pines in Patagonia Argentina use more water, in a magnitude depending on the density of the trees, than native grasslands. Accordingly, ponderosa pines use deep water to maintain high water potential and transpiration rates even during the dry season.
