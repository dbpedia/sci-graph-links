Abstract In this paper, we suggest new nutrient threshold values and ratios for the major nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) for four main trees species Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus (Q. robur and Q. petraea) statistically derived from the data collection of van den Burgâ€™s literature compilation (1985, 1990), and compare them with widely used central European literature. The comparison is focused on the normal range of nutrition of major elements. We could show that the new critical foliar nutrient concentrations and ratios do not have the imponderabilities of the established reference systems, like restricted calibration range or data gaps for species in general or some major nutrients in particular. Ranges from the new critical foliar nutrient concentrations are generally smaller, except for broadleaves foliar Ca and Mg values, where another reference provides the narrowest ranges. The practicability of the different systems has been exemplary tested on a foliage data set of Norway spruce from the Bavarian soil survey. This application illustrates that an evaluation based on the new nutrient thresholds is in the majority of cases more cautious than the other reference systems. Moreover, evaluations based on the new concentrations and ratios are quite consistent. Comparisons with nutrient ratios related to the susceptibility to parasite attacks show that the thresholds are close to a general optimum range, indicating health and intact resistance mechanisms of these tree species. Uncertainties of the new threshold values as well as the need to further evaluate and develop reference systems for nutrient status of forest trees are discussed.
