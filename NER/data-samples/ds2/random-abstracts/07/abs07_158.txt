Abstract Several models of the effects of silviculture, radial growth, and tree age on wood density have been developed, but they have rarely considered the roles of diverse seed origins and climate. We developed a model to test the effects of radial growth, tree age, climate, and seed-source origins on wood density in 21 diverse populations of jack pine in a common garden in Petawawa, Ontario, Canada over the last 24Â years using a linear mixed-effects model. Although we found significant differences in wood density among diverse seed origins, there were no differences between seed origins having the same ring age and ring width, indicating an indirect effect on wood density of seed-source origin via radial growth. High variation in wood density among trees within the same population and between populations indicated high genetic control of wood density. The climate effect was significant on wood density in all populations, but smaller when radial growth was controlled. Climate effect did not differ significantly among populations. Precipitation in July negatively affected latewood density, whereas precipitation in May in the current year and September of the previous year negatively affected earlywood density. We concluded that a single model of jack pine wood density and radial growth could be used, either controlling for climate effects or not, as the relationship between wood density and radial growth is preserved among the diverse populations, and the climate effect controlling for radial growth in the model was only slight.
