Abstract Initiatives for reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation require transparent and robust methodologies for the estimation of emissions reduction or removal. Although carbon (C) stock change in degradation and devegetation by remote sensing are becoming increasingly powerful, the drivers of degradation, wood collection and harvest dynamics, cannot be understood without “on the ground” sampling. A methodological tool for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of forest degradation is proposed as developed based on a research on the stump history in the black locust degrading stands sampled in southwest Romania. Based on the survey of stumps, the cutting regime and wood extraction is determined over a past period of some 15 years. Stump age classification comprises multiple qualitative criteria (i.e. bark features; adherence of sprouts; cut edge features; etc.). The method allows for a quantitative assessment of wood removal over time, and is suitable for the development of a dynamic baseline and monitoring of degradation avoidance activities.
