Abstract This work investigates the Polylepis-dominated forests in the high Andes of central and southern Bolivia, using both the Braun-Blanquet approach and multivariate analysis. These are among the highest altitude forest types in the world, and the region under study is a center of diversity for the genus, and is located at the confluence of four biogeographical provinces. Nine main plant communities were distinguished. Correspondence Analysis revealed a strong dependence of community composition primarily on biogeographic as well as on bioclimatic features. The greatest forest type diversity is found in the central part of the Cordillera Oriental in the Tropical pluviseasonal bioclimate, within a Supratropical thermotype and a Subhumid ombrotype.
