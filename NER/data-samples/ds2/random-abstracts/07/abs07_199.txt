Abstract Key message Drought caused a decrease of water flux and photosynthesis due to stomata closure, typical of drought-avoiding strategy. No photoinhibitory stress was observed. AbstractDrought represents an important source of disturbance in Mediterranean ecosystems. For long-term forest management, knowledge of tree responses to climate is essential. To investigate the seasonal functioning of Pinus laricio and its tolerance to summer drought in a Mediterranean climate, we carried out a field study in a natural mountainous pine forest over a 2-year period. For the first time for this species, sap flow, chlorophyll fluorescence, and gas exchange were used as indicators of tree vitality. Mild winter did not alter photosynthetic performance while sap flow declined. In spring, increase of sap flow was observed, revealing the end of tree dormancy and the beginning of the growth season. In response to summer drought, stomatal closure caused a reduction of gas exchange and sap flow. At the same time, pines increased their water use efficiency and reduced the limitation of mesophyll conductance. The reduction in CO2 assimilation was associated with photochemical stability, which might cause an imbalance between light energy input and energy used in photochemistry. The stability of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicated the absence of photoinhibitory stress, probably because of the use of photorespiration. The reduction of sap flow and stomatal conductance during drought confirmed the water-saver status of P. laricio species.
