Summary Previous work has suggested that tree stems are structured dimensionally to resist the forces to which they are subjected by the weight of the crown and the action of wind, snow and other loads on the crown. This proposition has been used to develop allometric relationships relating diameter at breast height or height of individual trees growing in even-aged monoculture to their above-ground fresh biomass. These models have practical application as estimators of tree diameters or heights from tree biomass as extensions of mechanistically based models of forest tree growth which predict tree biomasses. The present work applied these models to Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell, E. delegatensis R. Baker, E. nitens (Deane: Maiden) Maiden and E. grandis Hill ex Maiden trees, growing in plantation or regrowth stands, aged between 1.5 and 20 years, at eight geographically diverse sites extending from temperate to sub-tropical regions of Australia. While the models held for the various species at the various sites, their parameter values differed significantly between sites and/or species. This suggested there may be some inadequacy in the models. However, the differences were small and it was found reasonable to fit single models across all species and sites for practical use in estimating diameter or height. The errors about predicted values of height and diameter from these models were quantified. The models were also found to estimate diameter or height with little loss of precision when dry biomass was used in place of fresh biomass.
