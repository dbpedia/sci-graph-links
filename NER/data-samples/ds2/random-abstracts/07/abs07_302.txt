Abstract Radial variations of wood properties (basic density, fiber length, vessel element length, and compression strength) in plantation-grown Casuarina equisetifolia in Bangladesh were investigated for effective utilization of the wood. Samples disks at breast height were randomly collected from trees in a 10-year-old plantation in Coxâ€™s Bazar Forest Division, Bangladesh. The basic density showed a near-constant value up to 30 mm from the pith and then rapidly increased up to 60 mm from the pith. The fiber length and vessel element length gradually increased from the pith to bark. When radial variation of wood properties was determined according to relative distance from the pith, similar radial patterns were observed among the sample trees, indicating that the wood properties in C. equisetifolia may be related to the growth rate. The compression strength parallel to the grain (CS) increased from the pith to bark. A significant positive correlation was found between the air-dried density and the CS. The results obtained indicated that wood around the pith has a relatively low density, and wood outside the pith area has a relatively high density, suggesting that it could be used as structural lumber.
