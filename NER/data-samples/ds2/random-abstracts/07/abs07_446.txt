Abstract Short rotation woody bioenergy crops (SRWC) could contribute a substantial portion of the biomass required to meet federal mandates and offset carbon emissions. One SRWC with strong bioenergy potential is black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), planted extensively for wood and energy applications globally, but under-studied in its native US. This member of the Fabaceae family can fix nitrogen, tolerate stress, and sequester carbon while generating biomass yields up to 14 Mg ha-1 yr-1. This article offers a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of production practices, biomass and energy yield estimates, environmental risks and benefits, and economic considerations for this promising feedstock.
