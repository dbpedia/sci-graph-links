Abstract A factorial experiment was established in a plantation of Eucalyptus nitens in southern Tasmania on a site which had formerly carried native eucalypt forest. Before planting, the site had been cleared of weeds with foliar translocated and pre-emergence herbicides. The first factor of the experiment examined the effects on tree growth of no post-planting weed control, control by hand or with three levels of application of granulated atrazine, 0.9, 1.8 and 8 kg ha−1. The second factor examined the effects of no fertiliser application or the application of nitrogen as urea at 200 kg ha−1 N plus triple superphosphate at 120 kg ha−1 P. Tree growth responses to treatments were examined at 11, 16, 23 and 29 months of age. Fertiliser application increased tree height and diameter growth. Application of atrazine generally reduced height and diameter growth, but this was statistically significant only at the highest rate of application. Growth reduction occurred even though atrazine reduced post-planting weed cover on the site and hence potential competition with the tree crop for site resources. Hand weeding reduced the weed crop on the site even more than atrazine, but this did not increase growth of the tree crop. Given satisfactory establishment practices which include the use of herbicides pre-planting, it was concluded that post-planting weed regeneration was not sufficiently vigorous to warrant post-planting weed control on these sites. The use of atrazine for post-planting weed control could even be deleterious to eucalypts.
