Summary Stemflow inputs of magnesium and potassium were measured from 57 canopy trees representing eight species under heavy rainfall conditions in two tropical forest sites in northeast Queensland, Australia. In the premontane tropical moist forest site on the Atherton Tableland, the stemflow input per unit trunk basal area of 51 canopy trees was found to be 0.46 g m-2 of Mg2+ and 4.22 g m-2 of K+ for an average wet season rainday of 99 mm. In the wetter montane tropical rainforest site on Mount Bellenden Ker, the stemflow input per unit trunk basal area of six canopy trees was 5.55 g m-2 of Mg2+ and 9.12 g m-2 of K+ for a wet season rainday of 38 mm. These stemflow inputs from single raindays are greater than the mean annual rainfall input and are almost of the same order of magnitude as the mean annual throughfall input of these cations to areas equal to the trunk basal area from which the stemflow was collected. Stemflow cation fluxes of this magnitude are mainly attributable to the funnelling of large quantities of rainwater down the trunks of these canopy trees by their thoroughly wetted, upwardly inclined branches.
