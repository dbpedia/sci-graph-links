Abstract Five novel representatives of the yeast genus Candida isolated from advanced stages of wood degradation from fallen trunks of Eucryphia cordifolia Cav., Laurelia sempervirens Weim., Laurelia philippiana Weim., Nothofagus dombeyii (Mirb.) Blume, and Nothofagus obliqua (Mirb.) Blume, in the evergreen rainy Valdivian forest of southern Chile, are described and illustrated. They clearly differ from all accepted Candida species to warrant their establishment as five new species of yeasts: Candida coipomensis sp. nov., Candida ralunensis sp. nov., Candida laureliae sp. nov., Candida osornensis sp. nov., and Candida llanquihuensis sp. nov.
