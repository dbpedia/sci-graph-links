Abstract Plant area index (PAI) measured with a LI-COR LAI-2000 plant canopy analyser (PCA) was calibrated with leaf area index (LAI) in a young stand of Eucalyptus grandis in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. Destructive sampling and allometric equations were used to estimate LAI at 2 and 3 years after planting. Significant correlations (P<0.001) were found between LAI and PAI for each age with different equations being generated for the two ages (LAI=1.0594(PAI)âˆ’0.892 at 2 years of age, and LAI=1.0393(PAI) at 3 years of age). The equations differed from those reported in other eucalypt studies, as the PCA in this study over-predicted LAI at 2 years, and slightly under-predicted at 3 years, of age. It is argued that the stage of growth influenced this calibration, as the canopy and foliar structure may have been different in the young stands, affecting the basic assumptions for the PCA. A broad conversion from PCA derived PAI to LAI may not necessarily be valid for young, short rotation eucalypt plantations.
