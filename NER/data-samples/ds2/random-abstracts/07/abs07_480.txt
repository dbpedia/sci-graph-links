Abstract Three unusual species of yeasts have been isolated from decayed wood ‘palo podrido’ (12) in the evergreen rainy Valdivian forest of southern Chile. According to their morphological characteristics, they were assigned to the genus Candida Berkhout (8). They differ from all recently accepted Candida species, and are described and illustrated with the names of Candida antillancae, Candida bondarzewiae, and Candida castrensis.
