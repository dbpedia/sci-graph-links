Summary An attempt has been made to evaluate the contribution of soil respired CO2 to the total assimilation of a forest tree, by heeding the 13C-concentrations of CO2 from the free atmosphere and from mineralization processes within the soil respectively. An expression has been derived, according to which the assimilated fraction of CO2 from the soil at a particular height of a tree is given by the δ13C-value of the corresponding leaves, δ13C of atmospheric CO2, δ13C of soil respired CO2 and the physiological state of the leaves expressed as the ratio of total respiration over gross photosynthesis and internal over external CO2-concentration. In the particular case investigated, a δ13C-difference of 5‰ has been determined from bottom to top of a beech tree which results in a CO2 contribution from the soil of about 22% for the lower forest strata, while the total contribution of soil respired CO2 accounts for about 5% of the overall assimilation.
