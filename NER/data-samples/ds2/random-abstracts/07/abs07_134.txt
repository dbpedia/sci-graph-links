Abstract This paper provides a synthesis of the three papers published in the series “Ecophysiology of selected tree species in different plant communities at the periphery of the Atlantic forest of SE – Brazil” (Trees, this issue). We reviewed data obtained for seven tree species, belonging to the legume family and the genus Clusia of the Clusiaceae. These groups were chosen because legumes are the most abundant tree species in the Atlantic forest complex (except in the open restingas), and the genus Clusia is reportedly of utmost ecological importance as nurse plants in several habitats of the complex. These species were surveyed along one or more of several forest and open habitats at the margin of the Atlantic rain forest (open restingas, restinga dry forest, inselberg, semideciduous dry forest) and indicated the following general patterns: (1) at the intraspecific level, ecophysiological performance often (but not always) varied largely in both time and space; (2) at the interspecific level, ecophysiological performance was often (but not always) related positively to species dominance in the community; and (3) at both levels, ecophysiological performance was not related to the geographic distribution patterns, i.e., generalists and specialists did not form groups of similarly behaving plants in regard to ecophysiology. We discuss the implications of these findings, compare them with earlier studies, and suggest that ecophysiological research in the Atlantic rain forest complex could enhance its explanatory power by increasing spatial and temporal scales of observation.
