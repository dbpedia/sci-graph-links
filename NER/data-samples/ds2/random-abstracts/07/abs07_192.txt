Abstract This study tests the hypotheses that (1) the above-ground structure of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L] Karst.) is derivable from the functional balance theory, and that (2) crown ratio is a key source of structural variation in trees of different age and social position. Twenty-nine trees were measured in three stands (young, middle-aged, and mature), with three thinning treatments (unthinned, normal, and intensive) in the two older stands. There was a strong linear relationship between the total cross-sectional area of branches and that of stem at crown base. Foliage mass was linearly related with stem basal area at crown base. Also an allometric relationship was found between foliage mass and crown length. The mean length (weighted by basal area) of branches obeyed an exponential function of crown length. The parameters of most of these relationships were independent of slenderness (tree height/breast height diameter) and tree age However, total branch cross-sectional area per stem cross-sectional area in the young trees was greater than in the older trees. The young trees also had slightly shorter branches than predicted by the mean branch length equation. This was probably caused by branch senescence which had not yet started in the young stand. The older trees had a relatively long lower crown segment which was growing slowly and senescing. It was proposed that a segmented crown structure is characteristic of shade tolerant tree species, and that the structural model could be further developed by making the two segments explicit.
