Abstract Biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEF) which convert tree stem volume to whole tree biomass and biomass allocation patterns in young trees were studied in order to estimate tree and stand biomass in naturally regenerated forests. European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were compared. Seven forest stands of each species were chosen to cover their natural distribution in Slovakia. Species-specific BCEF are presented, generally showing a steep decrease in all species in the smallest trees, with the only exception in the case of branch BCEF in beech which grows with increasing tree size. The values of BCEF for all tree compartments stabilise in all species once trees reach about 60â€“70-mm diameter at base. As they grow larger, all species increase their allocation to stem and branches, while decreasing the relative growth of roots and foliage. There are, however, clear differences between species and also between broadleaves and conifers in biomass allocation. This research shows that species-specific coefficients must be used if we are to reduce uncertainties in estimates of carbon stock changes by afforestation and reforestation activities.
