Summary Historically, adhesive development has been a propelling force in the evolution of the forest product industry. The 1973 energy crisis has caused the wood industry to focus its attention on the necessity of adhesive self-sufficiency. Research in the use of bark, pulp waste liquor and foliage for adhesive application is rapidly spreading. In addition, many new adhesives have been proposed by the chemical industry as alternatives for wood bonding. Recently developed physiochemical analytical methods have been successfully applied to this adhesive research area and to durability evaluation. However, there are still enormous difficulties in developing a durable natural product adhesive of low variability as well as a unified international interpretation of bond durability. Phenolic resins have weathered the energy crisis and are gaining importance in the industry. Some examples of recent contributions from phenolic-resin research to panel board and lumber end-joint developments will be discussed in detail.
