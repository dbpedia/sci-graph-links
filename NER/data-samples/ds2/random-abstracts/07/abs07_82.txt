Summary In some parts of Australia, the exotic tree species Pinus radiata is invading native eucalypt forests from adjacent plantations. At one site, measurements have been made in order to determine the dispersal gradient and rate of population increase of the self-sown pines. From these, it is evident that, barring further human interference, a new type of mixed forest community will develop.
