Abstract In this report, the 575 specimens were divided into ten groups based on range of growth ring width. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of 45 × 90 mm specimens of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) plantation dimension lumber were analyzed by average growth ring width and average density of each group. The results showed that the average growth ring width was in inverse proportion to density, MOE, and MOR of the dimension lumber. Furthermore, average density was in direct proportion to MOE and MOR of the dimension lumber. The coefficient of determination (R 2) for all the regression equations ranged from 0.7340 to 0.9207 at a significance level of 0.001. However, without such group classification, there was poor relationship between growth ring width, density, MOE, and MOR with a determination coefficient of 0.0901–0.1855. This finding suggested that it was feasible to predict the flexural properties of Chinese fir plantation dimension lumber by average growth ring width after specimen group classification.
