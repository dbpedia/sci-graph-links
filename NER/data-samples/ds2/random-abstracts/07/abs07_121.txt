Abstract The periodic sways of a group of ten Pinus contorta var. latifolia (lodgepole pine) trees with slender stems from the Two Creeks site (TW) and ten stout trees from the Chickadee site (CH) both in Alberta, Canada were quantified. Tree displacement at TW was measured during periods of consistent wind direction with three mean wind speeds (1.9, 4.6, and 5.4 m/s) and for two mean wind speeds at CH (5.0 and 7.9 m/s). Spectral analysis of sway displacement data showed a decrease in the frequency with wind speed for trees at TW, but remained unchanged for trees at CH. Significant correlations between tree sway frequency and amplitude during high winds at TW indicate a loss of sway energy concomitant with the occurrence of high collision intensity. These observations support the hypothesis that inter-crown collisions have an important influence on the sway frequency of trees and should be incorporated into efforts to model their sway dynamics. We also present a theoretical collision-damped sway model which supports our empirical findings.
