Abstract For 345 stands of deciduous hardwood forest in Hyogo Prefecture, Western Japan, we assessed the decline of shrub-layer vegetation due to sika deer in each stand by using the shrub-layer decline rank (SDR), determined by combining the shrub-layer vegetation cover and the presence of signs of grazing by sika deer in a stand. Since there was a geographical correlation between SDR and sighting per unit effort (SPUE), which is an index of the relative density of sika deer, it appeared that decline of shrub-layer vegetation in a stand can be accurately evaluated by SDR. There were correlations between SDR and several variables that indicate the status of components in forests (presence of saplings of tall trees, occurrence of bark stripping of tall trees, proportion of bark-stripped stems of Clethra barvinervis, decline of subtree-layer vegetation by bark stripping, cover of litter on the ground, and area of soil surface erosion). These results indicate that the status of these components changes with decline of shrub-layer vegetation by sika deer grazing. It is thought that such synchronizations are caused by sika deer grazing or a direct or indirect effect by decline of shrub-layer vegetation due to sika deer. Therefore, it is reasonable to assess decline in physical structure due to sika deer for stands of deciduous hardwood forests according to SDR.
