Abstract The crown densities of 186 trees of five common European tree species (Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) were assessed simultaneously by observation teams from France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Major differences in the scores existed, with the maximum difference on any one tree being 45%. Differences tended to be consistent, with the French team scoring more lightly than the German team and the German team more lightly than the UK team. The differences throw into question the value of international comparisons of forest condition, particularly the use of comparative tables of the extent of “forest decline” in individual European countries.
