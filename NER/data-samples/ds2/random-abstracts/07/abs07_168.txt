Abstract The allocation of carbohydrates from photosynthesis to various plant compartments is a key process in ecophysiology and consequently an important element in process-based ecosystem modeling. In this study, we tested generalized empirical equations in a widely applied partitioning concept based on compartment-specific biomass allometries. For an 88-year chronosequence of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Austria, we used the individual-based hybrid forest model PICUS v1.4 to compare simulations employing foliage biomass functions at different levels of generalization against runs with site-specific parameterization and observations. Sensitivities of the individual tree model were generally in line with the original stand-level partitioning concept and ecological process understanding. While stand-level leaf area increased with increasing allocation to foliage, net primary productivity showed no significant response due to saturated radiation interception in the dense chronosequence stands. Strong sensitivities were revealed at the individual tree level, where favoring allocation to the foliage compartment resulted in increasing asymmetry of competition and heightâ€“diameter relationships. Applying a generalized parameterization based on data from the full range of continental species distribution resulted in a significant overestimation of mean tree height and subsequently standing volume stock at the chronosequence. At a lower hierarchical level of generality, however, simulations with a representative regional parameterization performed satisfactorily compared to model runs using the site-specific allometry. In relation to common accuracy demands, e.g., in forest management decision support, the study suggests the rejection of a generic parameterization while corroborating the use of regional generalizations in ecosystem models.
