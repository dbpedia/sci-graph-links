Abstract Two pine species, Pinus merkusii and Pinus kesiya, native in Thailand were studied for their potential to reconstruct past weather conditions from their tree rings. Altogether, cores from 209 Merkus pines and from 205 Khasi pines were sampled at 16 sites. Standard methods were applied to assemble tree-ring chronologies for each site and tree species. The longest site chronology of Merkus pine and Khasi pine covered 314 and 183Â years, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) illustrated a close clustering of all, except two, site chronologies on the PC1 axis, indicating a strong signal common for both pine species throughout NW Thailand. However, along the PC2 axis, there was a distinct separation between the Merkus pine and the Khasi pine site chronologies, which was possibly due to the species-specific differences in site altitudes. Simple correlations between the PC1 time series and a regionalized climate data set showed a highly negative association with temperature during the pre-monsoon period from March to May. Since, pre-monsoon temperature and rainfall were negatively correlated with each other, we used the PC1 as a direct proxy for pre-monsoon weather conditions (warm/dry vs. cool/wet) back to 1834 AD.
