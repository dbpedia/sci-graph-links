Abstract Routine monitoring of above ground biomass within purpose-grown willow biomass energy production systems is important for timing harvest and other operations to maximize profit and increase plantation productivity. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of an elegant nondestructive mensurative technique for providing reliable estimates of harvestable biomass for six willow varieties during a 3-year rotation. The LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyser was used to measure the stem area index of growing willow and relate it to harvestable biomass at four locations within Saskatchewan, Canada over a 3-year period. Given the highly significant relationship (R 2 = 0.95; P < 0.0001) between measured stem area index and harvestable willow biomass, independent of variety, age, or location, this simple mensurative technique is a promising alternative for estimating above ground biomass in short-rotation willow plantations.
