Summary The grey alder compensates leaf area losses due to insect grazing by continuously producing new leaves throughout the vegetative period. Different degrees of defoliation were attained experimentally by a controlled release of the oligophagous beetle Agelastica alni on arbitrarily selected trees from a homogenous population of young alders. The reduction in leaf area per tree significantly influenced the density of leaf trichomes, assessed 10–30 days later, on newly sprouting leaves only. Cross-correlations between leaf area reduction and trichome density were strongest for leaves which completed unfolding 14–21 days after damage. Dualchoice assays suggested a negative influence of trichomes on oviposition rate of A. alni. Removal of trichomes by shaving demonstrated the highly significant effect of trichomes on feeding behavior of adults and larvae in dual-choice assays. The role of the induced increase in trichome density as a possible short-term defense reaction against herbivorous insects is discussed.
