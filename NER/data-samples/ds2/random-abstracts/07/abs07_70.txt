Abstract Based on the current conditions, a forecast of trends in imports and exports of wood products and their demand and supply is presented in this paper for the years of 2005 and 2015. It is expected that imports will continue to exceed exports but that the trade deficit in wood products will decline. The form of trade will be changed from a condition of unilateral imports to one of exerting mutual advantage through imports and exports. The structure of trade in forest products will alter with changes in the forest resource base and with new developments in the forest industry.
