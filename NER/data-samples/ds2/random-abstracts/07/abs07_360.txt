F on s edges and k disjoint cycles. The main result is the following theorem. Let F be a forest on s edges without isolated vertices and let G be a graph of order at least with minimum degree at least , where k, s are nonnegative integers. Then G contains the disjoint union of the forest F and k disjoint cycles. This theorem provides a common generalization of previous results of Corr√°di & Hajnal [4] and Brandt [3] who considered the cases (cycles only) and (forests only), respectively.
