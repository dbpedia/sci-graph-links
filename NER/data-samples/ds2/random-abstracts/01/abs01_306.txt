Abstract Let xn+1=exp(A+uB)xn be a discrete-time control system which is obtained by discretizing a continuous-time bilinear system. This paper gives sufficient conditions on the matricesA andB for global controllability of this system. These conditions are similar to those of Jurdjevic and Kupka [JK1] for the continuous-time case.
