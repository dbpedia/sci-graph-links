Abstract The existence of positive periodic solutions for a kind of Rayleigh equation with a deviating argument $$ x''(t) + f(x'(t)) + g(t,x(t - \tau (t))) = p(t) $$ is studied. Using the coincidence degree theory, some sufficient conditions on the existence of positive periodic solutions are obtained.
