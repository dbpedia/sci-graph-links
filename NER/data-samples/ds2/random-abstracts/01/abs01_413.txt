Abstract To prove existence and uniqueness (or just existence) of a bounded solution to nonlinear differential equations of higher order, we employ the contraction mapping principle and the Tikhonov Fixed Point Theorem. A quantitative estimate of a nonlinear perturbation preserving basic features of behavior of the corresponding linear equation (asymptotic stability or exponential dichotomy) is important when we pass to a nonlinear equation.
