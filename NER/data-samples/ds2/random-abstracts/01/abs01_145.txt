Abstract This talk reviews relativistic methods used to compute bound and low energy scattering states in field theory, with emphasis on approaches that John Tjon and I discussed (and argued about) together. I compare the Bethe–Salpeter and Covariant Spectator equations, show some applications, and then report on some of the things we have learned from the beautiful Feynman–Schwinger technique for calculating the exact sum of all ladder and crossed ladder diagrams in field theory.
