Abstract We consider a special class of optimization problems that we call Mathematical Programs with Vanishing Constraints, MPVC for short, which serves as a unified framework for several applications in structural and topology optimization. Since an MPVC most often violates stronger standard constraint qualification, first-order necessary optimality conditions, weaker than the standard KKT-conditions, were recently investigated in depth. This paper enlarges the set of optimality criteria by stating first-order sufficient and second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for MPVCs.
