Abstract. Let X and Y be Banach spaces such that each of them is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of the other. In 1996, W. T. Gowers solved the Schroeder-Bernstein Problem for Banach spaces by showing that X is not necessarily isomorphic to Y. In this paper, we give suitable conditions on finite sums of X and Y to yield that X m is isomorphic to Y n for some $$m,n \in \mathbb{N}^{*} .$$ In other words, we obtain some extensions of the well-known Pełczyński decomposition method in Banach spaces. In order to do this, we introduce the notion of Nearly Schroeder-Bernstein Quadruples for Banach spaces and pose a Conjecture to characterise them.
