Summary It is shown that Miyazawa’sSU(6/21) superalgebra for hadrons can be applied to a bilocal quark-antiquark (q $$\bar q$$ ) or quark-diquark (q-D) system resulting in multiplets that include thel=1 mesons in the (35+1) representation ofSU(6) and thel=1 baryons (70−), in addition to thel=0 mesons (35−+1−) andl=0 baryons (56+). Alternatively, a nonsimple algebra that brings together the (35−+1−) mesons and 56+ baryons is also proposed. This minimal scheme does not involve the D- $$\bar D$$ exotic mesons in the lowest hadronic supermultiplet. In both schemes color is incorporated through the algebra of split octonions.
