Abstract. In order to obtain hitting time estimates for the asymmetric zero-range process (AZRP) on ℤ d , in dimensions d≥3, we characterize the principal eigenvalue of the generator of the AZRP with Dirichlet boundary on special domains. We obtain a Donsker-Varadhan variational representation and show that the corresponding eigenfunction is unique in a natural class of functions.
