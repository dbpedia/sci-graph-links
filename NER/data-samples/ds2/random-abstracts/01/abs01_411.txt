Summary In this paper certain theorems of physical interest have been established involving the spacelike FCRC (family of contracted Ricci collineations) symmetry mappings admitted by imperfect magnetofluid space-times for the symmetry vector which is collinear to the fluid vorticity vector. Some of these theorems have also been physically interpreted for the visualization of their implications.
