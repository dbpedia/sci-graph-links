Abstract This paper is concerned with the application of preconditioning techniques to the well known Jacobi iterative method for solving the finite difference equations derived from the discretization of self-adjoint elliptic partial differential equations. The convergence properties of this one parameter preconditioned method are analyzed and the value of the optimum preconditioning parameter and the performance of the method determined for a variety of standard problems.
