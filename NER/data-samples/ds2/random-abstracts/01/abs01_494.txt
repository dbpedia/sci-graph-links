Abstract Some general fixed point theorems are obtained describing methods for preservation of a relation between fixed points or between fixed points and iteratives of related iteration operators. If the relation is especially an order relation or an inclusion relation some useful iteration methods to compute bounds for fixed points are stated. Applications and some practical results are discussed.
