Abstract We describe a calculation of the spectrum of strange and nonstrange hadrons that simultaneously correlates the dressed-quark-core masses of meson and baryon ground- and excited-states within a single framework. The foundation for this analysis is a symmetry-preserving Dyson–Schwinger equation treatment of a vector×vector contact interaction. Our results exemplify and highlight the deep impact of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the hadron spectrum: an accurate description of the meson spectrum entails a similarly successful prediction of the spectrum of baryons, including those with strangeness. The analysis also provides numerous insights into baryon structure. For example, that baryon structure is largely flavour-blind, the first radial excitation of ground-state baryons is constituted almost entirely from axial-vector diquark correlations, and DCSB is the foundation for the ordering of low-lying baryon levels; viz., (1/2)+, (1/2)+, (1/2)−.
