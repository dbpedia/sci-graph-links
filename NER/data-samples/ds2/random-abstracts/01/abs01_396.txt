Abstract A statistical analysis of RHESSI X-ray flares in the 12–25 keV band during the period from February 2002 to June 2005 is presented. We found that a power-law with an index of 1.80± 0.02 can fit well the frequency distribution of the peak count rates. This power-law does not change significantly with time. However, the frequency distribution of the flare durations cannot be fitted well by a single power-law. There is a weak correlation between the peak count rates and the characteristic times like rise times, decay times, or durations. But the correlation between the rise times and decay times seems to be strong. We discuss the results obtained and compare them with previous works. The frequency distribution of rise times for the sub-group events with a similar magnitude of peak count rates is also shown. In particular, we propose a new parameter R a , the growth factor of the count rate, defined as the peak count rate divided by the rise time, to reflect the characteristics of the rising phases of flares. The distribution of R a is shown and discussed.
