Abstract Time-irreversible symmetry is a fundamental property of nonlinear time series. Time-irreversible behaviors of mean temperature measured on 182 stations over China from 1960 to 2012 are analyzed by directed horizontal visibility graph (DHVG for short), and significance of results has been estimated by Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that dominated time irreversibility emerges in nearly all daily temperature anomaly variations over China. Further studies indicate that these time-irreversible behaviors result from asymmetric distributions of persistent daily temperature increments and decrements, and this kind of symmetry can be quantified by distributions of consecutive daily mean temperature increasing or decreasing steps. At the same time, the findings above have been confirmed by artificially generated time series with given value of multiscale asymmetry.
