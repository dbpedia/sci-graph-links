We show that the traveling salesman problem with triangle inequality cannot be approximated with a ratio better than $$ \frac{{117}} {{116}} $$ when the edge lengths are allowed to be asymmetric and $$ \frac{{220}} {{219}} $$ when the edge lengths are symmetric, unless P=NP. The best previous lower bounds were $$ \frac{{2805}} {{2804}} $$ and $$ \frac{{3813}} {{3812}} $$ respectively. The reduction is from Håstad’s maximum satisfiability of linear equations modulo 2, and is nonconstructive.
