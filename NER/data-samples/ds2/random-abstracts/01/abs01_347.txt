Abstract The Generalized Conjugate Gradient (GCG) method of Concus and Golub [1] and Widlund [2] and its adjusted form (AGCG) are considered for the numerical solution of the least squares problems. Some numerical comparisons with the SOR [3] and CG [4] method are also given indicate that the GCG method is always better than the SOR [3] and that the adjusted GCG (AGCG) scheme is preferable to the CG, GCG and SOR methods.
