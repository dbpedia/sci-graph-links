Abstract In this paper we discuss the measurement of regions in the proton where the density of small-x partons is large, called “hot spots”, by means of an associated jet analysis. An analytical estimate of the cross section is presented and the jet kinematics is discussed in the HERA and LEP-LHC frame. A Monte Carlo estimate shows that the number of jets produced in deep inelastic scattering events at HERA, suitable for this analysis, amounts to a few 1000 jcts for a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 10 pb−1.
