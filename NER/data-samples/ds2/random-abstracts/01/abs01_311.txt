Abstract Bridger and Alper (1999) maintain that the nonphysical featuresof the supertasks described by PÃ©rez Laraudogoitia (1996) involving a system containing an infinite number of particles may be avoided by introducing, in a specific way, Hilbert space in classical dynamics. I argue that it is possible to interpret their proposal in two ways, neither of which is acceptable for the purpose for which it was introduced.
