Abstract.  The configuration-space Faddeev equations for the breakup scattering problem are solved using a new method of partial inversion. Unlike other computations this one keeps the incoming wave in the asymptotic condition. Thus all computations otherwise needed to separate the incident wave are avoided and the number of non-zero components of the inhomogeneous term in the algebraic equations is reduced to one. Speed as well as accuracy improves and we are able to solve the algebraic problem with partial inversion only. Using the standard spline-decomposition for the angle variable and the finite-difference approximation for the hyperradius optimizes considerably the inversion due to the sparse block structure of the matrix. We report on calculations of the inelasticities and phase shifts for nucleon-deuteron scattering for laboratory energies 4.0, 14.1, and 42.0 MeV. The results are compared with calculations by other authors.
