Summary The laminar wall jet from a momentum source at the leading edge on a wall which is moving in the same direction with uniform velocity is considered. It is shown that a solution is possible starting at the leading edge and proceeding all the way downstream. For smallx (x measures distance along the wall) we find the solution by using a natural coordinate expansion in powers ofx 1/2. For largex, the asymptotic solution is approached through eigensolutions and the two coordinate expansions are then joined by a numerical solution of the full equations.
