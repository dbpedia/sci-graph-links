Abstract. We extend a celebrated identity by P. Pucci and J. Serrin, concerning C 2 solutions of Euler equations of functionals of the calculus of variations, to the case of C 1 solutions under the only additional assumption of strict convexity in the gradient. Some particular cases in which the mere convexity is sufficient are also considered.
