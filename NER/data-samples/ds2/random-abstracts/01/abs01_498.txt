Abstract In this paper generalized Riesz methods (R, p, M) of summability are considered. We prove that, to each open set O ⊂ ℂ with adequate topological properties and to each sequence {n} ⊂ ℂ tending to infinity, we can associate a corresponding P-regular (R, p, M)-method so that the geometric series and a certain trigonometric series become universal in the sense that its (R, p, M)-transforms approximate any member of certain spaces of holomorphic functions or measurable functions.
