Abstract A graph is equitably k-colorable if G has a proper vertex k-coloring such that the sizes of any two color classes differ by at most one. Chen, Lih and Wu conjectured that any connected graph G with maximum degree $$\Delta $$ Δ distinct from the odd cycle, the complete graph $$K_{\Delta +1}$$ KΔ+1 and the complete bipartite graph $$K_{\Delta ,\Delta }$$ KΔ,Δ are equitably m-colorable for every $$m\ge \Delta $$ m≥Δ . Let $${\mathcal {G}}_k$$ Gk be the class of graphs G such that $$e(G')\le k (v(G')-2)$$ e(G′)≤k(v(G′)-2) for every subgraph $$G'$$ G′ of G with order at least 3. In this paper, it is proved that any graph in $${\mathcal {G}}_4$$ G4 with maximum degree $$\Delta \ge 17$$ Δ≥17 is equitably m-colorable for every $$m\ge \Delta $$ m≥Δ . As corollaries, we confirm Chen–Lih–Wu Conjecture for 1-planar graphs, 3-degenerate graphs and graphs with maximum average degree less than 6, provided that $$\Delta \ge 17$$ Δ≥17 .
