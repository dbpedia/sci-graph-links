Abstract LetX ɛ = {X ɛ (t ; 0 ⩽t ⩽ 1 } (ɛ > 0) be the processes governed by the following stochastic differential equations: $$dX^\varepsilon (t) = \sqrt \varepsilon \sigma (X^\varepsilon (t))dB(t) + b(X^\varepsilon (t),\nu (t))dt,$$ wherev(t) is a random process independent of the Brownian motionB(·). Some large deviation (LD) properties of { (X ɛ, ν(.)); ɛ > 0} are proved. For a particular case, an explicit representation of the rate function is also given, which solves a problem posed by Eizenberg and Freidlin. In the meantime, an abstract LD theorem is obtained.
