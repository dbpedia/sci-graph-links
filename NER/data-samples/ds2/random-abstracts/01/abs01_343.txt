Abstract In this note we expose some results proved in dâ€™Avenia et al. [8] concerning an elliptic problem in $${\mathbb {R}}^{N}$$ RN which involves two nonlocal operators: the fractional Laplacian and a convolution term of Hartree type. This equation has been called fractional Choquard equation. The results obtained concern regularity of weak solutions, existence and properties of ground states, as well as multiplicity and nonexistence of solutions.
