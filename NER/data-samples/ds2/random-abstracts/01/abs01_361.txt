Summary Reasons are given four doubting that irreversible behavior can bederived from mechanics without the various traditional averaging processes. A critical study of theVan Hove-Brout-Prigogine long time-weak coupling theory which dispenses with these averages is made. The two main objections are 1) mathematical inconsistencies in the quantum-mechanical formulation of the «diagonal singularity» of the mixing perturbation, supposedly responsible for the irreversibility, and 2) a physically inadmissible prescription for treating poles in improper energy integrals. Particular consequences are 1) an ambiguous prescription for evaluating the long time-weak coupling limit of improper integrals and 2) violation of the unitarity of the transition operator, respectively. Diagonal singularity in the «continuum limit» is reformulated. The limit transition operator is explicitly evaluated and exhibits only reversible behavior.
