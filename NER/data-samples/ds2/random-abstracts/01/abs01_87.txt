Abstract. The application of the techniques of dimensional scaling, and in particular the 1/D expansion, to higher angular-momentum states of multi-electron atoms requires the generalized Euler angles, which multiply with increasing D to be “factored out” of the wave function. The factorization must be performed in a way that produces from the Schrödinger equation a tractable set of differential equations which admit continuation in the dimension D. In two recent works the authors have achieved the necessary factorization of the wave function by generalizing the Schwartz expansion to N electrons in D dimensions. The present paper applies the N-electron D-dimensional Schwartz expansion to the two-electron problem in D dimensions. The resulting set of coupled differential equations in the internal variables admit continuation in D, enabling the methods of dimensional scaling to be applied to higher-angular-momentum states. In addition, the coupled differential equations clearly show the complete spectrum of exact interdimensional degeneracies of the two-electron system.
