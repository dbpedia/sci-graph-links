Abstract Some real and interval algorithms for the numerical solution of a class of nonlinear algebraic equations are described. These algorithms are based upon the symmetric single-step [2] and Newton [10], [11], [8] methods. Convergence theorems and numerical results which illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms are given.
