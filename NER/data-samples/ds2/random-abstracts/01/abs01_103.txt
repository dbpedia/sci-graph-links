Abstract In this paper we investigate functorial properties of the Segal algebra $$\mathfrak{B}_0 (G)$$ which consists of all functionsf in Wiener's algebra onG with Fourier transform $$\hat f$$ in Wiener's algebra on the dual group $$\hat G$$ . Especially $$\mathfrak{B}_0 (G)$$ may serve as a very large and natural domain for Poisson's formula. Moreover, there is introduced a Segal algebraE 0(G) containing $$\mathfrak{B}_0 (G)$$ as a subspace, but still eachfâˆˆE 0(S) satisfies Poisson's formula.
