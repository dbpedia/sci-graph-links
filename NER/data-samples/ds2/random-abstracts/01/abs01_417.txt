Abstract In this paper, by applying the Pekeris approximation, we present solutions of the Dirac equation for the Morse potential including a Coulomb-like tensor potential with arbitrary spin-orbit coupling number κ under spin and pseudospin symmetry limits. The generalized parametric Nikiforov–Uvarov method is used to obtain energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions in their closed forms. We show that tensor interaction removes degeneracies between spin and pseudospin doublets. Some numerical results are given, too.
