Abstract. Let $f (Z) \in {\Bbb F}[Z]$ be a univariate, separable polynomial of degree n with roots x 1,…,x n in some algebraic closure $\bar{\Bbb F}$ of the ground field ${\Bbb F}$. It is a classical problem of Galois theory to find all the relations between the roots. It is known that the ideal of all such relations is generated by polynomials arising from G-invariant polynomials, where G is the Galois group of f(Z). Namely: The action of G on the ordered set of roots induces an action on ${\Bbb F}^n$ by permutation of the coordinates and each $P \in {\Bbb F}[X_1, \ldots,X_n]^G$ defines a relation P − P(x 1,…,x n ) called a G-invariant relation. These generate the ideal of all relations. In this note we show that the ideal of relations admits an H-basis of G-invariant relations if and only if the algebra of coinvariants ${\Bbb F}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]_G$ has dimension ‖G‖ over ${\Bbb F}$. To complete the picture we then show that the coinvariant algebra of a transitive permutation representation of a finite group G has dimension ‖G‖ if and only if G = Σ n acting via the tautological permutation representation.
