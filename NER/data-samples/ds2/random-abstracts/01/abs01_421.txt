Abstract For a bounded domain Ω ⊂ R n endowed with L ∞-metric g, and a C 5-Riemannian manifold (N, h) ⊂ R k without boundary, let u ∈ W 1,2(Ω, N) be a weakly harmonic map, we prove that (1) u ∈ C α (Ω, N) for n  =  2, and (2) for n ≥ 3, if, in additions, g ∈ VMO(Ω) and u satisfies the quasi-monotonicity inequality (1.5), then there exists a closed set Σ ⊂ Ω, with H n-2(Σ) = 0, such that $${u \in C^\alpha(\Omega{\setminus}\Sigma, N)}$$ for some α ∈ (0, 1).
