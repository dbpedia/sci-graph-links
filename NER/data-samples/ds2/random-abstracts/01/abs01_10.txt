Abstract The aim of this paper is the study of integral formulas and methods for optimal numerical approximation of integrals over the (unit) sphere and coefficients being required in connection with series expansions into spherical harmonics. An explicit estimate of the (absolute) error of exact and approximating integral value is given by use of the theory of Green's (surface) functions on the sphere.
