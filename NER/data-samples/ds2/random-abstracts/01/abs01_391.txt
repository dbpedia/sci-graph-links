Abstract We study the existence of positive solutions for a class of nonlinear Schrödinger equations of the type $$-{\varepsilon}^2\Delta u + Vu = u^p\quad{{\rm in}\,{\mathbb R}^N},$$where N ≥ 3, p > 1 is subcritical and V is a nonnegative continuous potential. Amongst other results, we prove that if V has a positive local minimum, and $${\frac{N}{N-2} < p < \frac{N+2}{N-2}}$$ , then for small ε the problem admits positive solutions which concentrate as ε → 0 around the local minimum point of V. The novelty is that no restriction is imposed on the rate of decay of V. In particular, we cover the case where V is compactly supported.
