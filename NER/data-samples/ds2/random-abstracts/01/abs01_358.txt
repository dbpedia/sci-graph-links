Abstract To obtain the group properties of fuzzy quantities, Mareš introduced an equivalence relation between fuzzy quantities. However, the Mareš’s method used to prove his main theorems demands to limit the investigation to fuzzy quantities with finite support. In this paper, we discuss the properties of symmetric fuzzy numbers, show an equivalent characterization of convex fuzzy sets, and present a way to construct a symmetric convex fuzzy set with a convex fuzzy set. Based on these results, we restrict ourselves to fuzzy numbers and prove Mareš’s results without the limitation to fuzzy numbers with finite support using the refined equivalence relation due to Hong and Do. Our results prove one of Mareš’s open questions in the literature.
