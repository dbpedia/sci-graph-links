Abstract We obtain a characterization of quantum shape-phase transitions in the terms of complexity measures in the two-dimensional limit of the vibron model based on the spectrum generating algebra U(3). Complexity measures (in terms of the RÃ©nyi entropies) have been calculated for different values of the control parameter for the ground state of this model giving sharp signatures of the quantum shape-phase transition from linear to bent molecules.
