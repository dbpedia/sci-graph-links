Abstract We derive a priori $$C^2$$ C2 estimates for a class of complex Monge-Ampère type equations on Hermitian manifolds. As an application we solve the Dirichlet problem for these equations under the assumption of existence of a subsolution; the existence result, as well as the second order boundary estimates, is new even for bounded domains in $${\mathbb {C}}^n$$ Cn .
