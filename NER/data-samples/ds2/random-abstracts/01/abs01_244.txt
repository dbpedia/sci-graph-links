Summary The discussion of the multiperipheral bootstrap model in its one-dimensional version leads one to consider some experimental and theoretical inconsistencies, which are expected to be crucial at very high energies. A statistical generalization of the model is proposed; the new model allows one to separate the multiperipheral and diffractive contributions to then-particle production cross-sections. The general properties of the model are investigated.
