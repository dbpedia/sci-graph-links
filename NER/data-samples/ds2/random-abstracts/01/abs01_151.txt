Summary The field equations of a specific gravitational Lagrangian, being quadratic in curvature and torsion, are solved by means of an ansatz for the curvature. The field equations are thereby reduced to a decoupled system of equations that determines the metric and the torsion. Up to this point, no symmetry conditions have been imposed on the fields. This system of equations is then solved for three special cases in each of which the torsion has a nonvanishing axial vector part.
