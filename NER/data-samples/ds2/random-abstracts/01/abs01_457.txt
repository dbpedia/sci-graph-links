Abstract. â€‚The volume of the symmetric difference of a smooth convex body in and its best approximating polytope with n vertices is asymptotically a constant multiple of . We determine this constant and the similarly defined constant for approximation with a given number of facets by solving two isoperimetric problems for planar tilings.
