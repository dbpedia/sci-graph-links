Abstract We consider a rather general class of infinite-dimensional linear systems, called regular linear systems, for which convenient representations are known to exist both in time and in the frequency domain. We introduce and study the concept of admissible feedback operator for such a system and of well-posedness radius. We show that the closed-loop system obtained from a regular linear system with an admissible feedback operator is again regular and we describe the relationship between the generating operators of the open-loop and closed-loop systems.
