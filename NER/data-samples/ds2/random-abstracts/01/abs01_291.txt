Abstract We consider the field equations at Einstein-Yang-Mills system in 4+d dimensions under the assumption that the metric corresponds to a spacetime configurationM 4Ã—(S/R), withS/R a compact coset space. Imposing a requirement thatM 4 be a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations in 4-dimensions, we see that the Yang-Mills sector takes a form familiar from coset-space dimensional reduction (CSDR) schemes, but with non-trivial field strengths on the coset-space. This indicates that the symmetry groupS of the coset-space must not be isomorphic to a subgroup of the gauge groupG in 4+d dimensions, which corresponds in general to a non-trivial type of CSDR schemes. We then investigate such CSDR schemes and are able to find a new class of solutions, which permit the generation of tachyon-free solutions to the full E-Y-M system in a (large) subclass of cases.
