Abstract The notion of homogeneity in the bi-limit from Andrieu et al. (SIAM J Control Optim 47(4):1814–1850, 2008) is extended to local homogeneity and then to homogeneity in the multi-limit. The converse Lyapunov/Chetaev theorems on (homogeneous) system instability are obtained. The problem of oscillation detection for nonlinear systems is addressed. The sufficient conditions of oscillation existence for systems homogeneous in the multi-limit are formulated. The proposed approach estimates the number of oscillating modes and the regions of their location. Efficiency of the technique is demonstrated on several examples.
