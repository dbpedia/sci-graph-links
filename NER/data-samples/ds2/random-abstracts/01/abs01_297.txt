Abstract This article considers the problem of uncertainty evaluation when there are repeated measurements of a small quantity known to be non-negative. A solution to this problem has recently been put forward by the Analytical Methods Committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry (Accred Qual Assur 13:29â€“32). The Bayesian statistical basis of this solution is explained and discussed. It is shown that the performance of this procedure can be poor in an important subset of measurement situations.
