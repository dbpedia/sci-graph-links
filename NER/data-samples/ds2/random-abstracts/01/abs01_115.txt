Abstract Properties of helical waves of a cylindrical shell described by Kirchhoff-Love equations are considered. The problem is reduced to the case of the propagation of plane waves in an equivalent plate. On the basis of the corresponding dispersion equation and its solution, a conclusion is made about the anisotropy of the shell properties. Dispersion curves are plotted for different angles of propagation of helical waves with respect to the shell axis. Displacements of the shell along and across the direction of wave propagation are calculated.
