Abstract Chaturvedi and Carroll have proposed the SINDCLUS method for fitting the INDCLUS model. It is based on splitting the two appearances of the cluster matrix in the least squares fit function and relying on convergence to a solution where both cluster matrices coincide. Kiers has proposed an alternative method which preserves equality of the cluster matrices throughout. This paper shows that the latter method is generally to be preferred. However, because the method has a serious local minimum problem, alternative approaches should be contemplated.
