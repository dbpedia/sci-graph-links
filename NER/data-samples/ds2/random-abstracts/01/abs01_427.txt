Abstract This paper considers designing an adaptive fuzzy controller to position the yaw and pitch angles of a twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS) in two degrees of freedom. The goal of the controller is to stabilize the TRMS in a desired position or track a specified trajectory. The parameters of the fuzzy controller are updated using the gradient descent algorithm in order to increase its robustness against external disturbances and/or changes in system parameters. Moreover, the stability of the overall closed-loop system is guaranteed based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed controller is applied to a TRMS with heavy cross coupling between its axes. Experimental results show good performance of the proposed controller as compared to the non-adaptive fuzzy and PID controllers, especially when there are system uncertainties and external disturbances.
