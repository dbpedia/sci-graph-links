Summary It is shown that when a point charge is present in an electromagnetic field, the conservation of energy and momentum does not in general lead to conservation of angular momentum for the system as a whole. The conservation laws impose stringent restrictions on the possible equations which may describe the motion of the point charge.If it is required that higher derivatives of the velocity than the second should not appear explicitly in these equations, then the choice is unique and the only possible equations are those originally derived by Lorentz. If the third derivative is allowed to appear explicitly in the equations, but no thigher ones, then it is possible to give one other system of equations for describing the behaviour of a point singularity which can be used without entirely artificial initial and final conditions.
