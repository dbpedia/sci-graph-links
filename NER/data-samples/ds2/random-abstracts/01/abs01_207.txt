Abstract. â€‚Four spectrophotometric methods are described and applied to resolve binary mixtures of the corticosteroid hydrocortisone and the antibacterial polypeptide Zn-Bacitracin. The simultaneous determination of the two compounds was accomplished by means of derivative methods, which were satisfactory used to determine synthetic mixtures of these compounds in different ratios and in pharmaceutical preparations (only for hydrocortisone). Direct absorption spectra of compounds were used to optimise the spectral data set performs the calibration by PLS-1, PLS-2 and PCR algorithms. These calibration models were evaluated through internal validation (prediction of compounds in its own designed training set of calibration), cross-validation (obtaining statistical parameters that show the efficiency for a calibration fit model) and external validation over synthetic and pharmaceutical mixtures. The four described procedures do not require any separation step. Precision studies were achieved over two series of ten standards for each compound showing no significant differences at 95% confidence level in the two spectrophotometric methods. The results found in commercial products were compared with those obtained by means of MEKC method and similar values were found.
