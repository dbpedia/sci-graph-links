Abstract. We prove an apriori estimate in Morrey spaces for both intrinsic and extrinsic biharmonic maps into spheres. As applications, we prove an energy quantization theorem for biharmonic maps from 4-manifolds into spheres and a partial regularity for stationary intrinsic biharmonic maps into spheres.
