Summary The steady two-dimensional incompressible flow of a conducting power-law fluid past a flat plate in the presence of a transverse magnetic field of the formH 0 x(mâˆ’1)/2 and under the influence of a pressure gradient is considered. The resulting similarity equation is first converted into a different form using Crocco variables and then solved by choosing a suitable profile for the dependent variable. The results are compared with those obtained by direct numerical integration of the original differential equation. The energy equation for a special case for which similarity solutions exist is also considered.
