Abstract In this paper we characterize the solvability of nonlinear decoupling problems (static or dynamic) through the notion of structure at infinity. This structure is specified by a list of easily computed integers, which are related to the differential output rank. Our notion of structure at infinity generalizes concepts previously introduced for restricted classes of systems such as those linearizable under feedback.
