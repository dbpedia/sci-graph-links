Abstract In this paper, a stochastic differential equation based on Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck (OU) process has been employed to image enhancement and edge detection processes. The simulation results show that the method is efficient to enhance the color image. In addition, the performance of OU method on edge detection is acceptable in both gray and color images.
