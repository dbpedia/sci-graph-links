Summary Making use of physical considerations, possible forms of direct interaction between baryons and other fields in Gürsey’s equation have been investigated, and a new interpretation of the eight-component spinors as representing for example (p-θ) or (Σ+-Σ) is proposed. It enables us to relate the boson conjugation and the spinor conjugation proposed byBudini, Dallaporta andFonda in an organic way with the single fundamental equation. The most important conservation laws of electric current and baryon number are automatically guaranteed in our formalism, independently from each other.
