Summary In the framework of the minimal extended electroweak models inspired by superstrings, we evaluate the Z1 boson hadronic and total decay widths, the valuesR≡σ(e+e−→hadrons)/σpt andR′≡σ(e+e−→hadrons)/σ(e+e−→ℓ+ℓ− dependences on Z-Z′ mixing parameter and on renormalization scheme parameters. All these values are measured now at LEP. Popular models are discussed for comparison.
