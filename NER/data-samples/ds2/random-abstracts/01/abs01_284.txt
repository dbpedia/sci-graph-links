Abstract For a morphism of smooth schemes over a regular affine base we define functors of derived direct image and extraordinary inverse image on coderived categories of DG-modules over de Rham DG-algebras. Positselski proved that for a smooth algebraic variety $$X$$ X over a field $$k$$ k of characteristic zero the coderived category of DG-modules over $$\Omega ^\bullet _{X/k}$$ ΩX/k∙ is equivalent to the unbounded derived category of quasi-coherent right $${\fancyscript{D}}_X$$ DX -modules. We prove that our functors correspond to the functors of the same name for $${\fancyscript{D}}_X$$ DX -modules under Positselski equivalence.
