Abstract We solved the Dirac equation for the generalized hyperbolical potential including a Coulomb-like tensor potential under spin symmetry with spin-orbit quantum number k. We used the parametric generalization of the Nikiforovâ€“Uvarov method to obtain the energy eigenvalue and the unnormalized wave function.
