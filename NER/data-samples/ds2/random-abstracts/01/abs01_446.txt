Abstract In this paper, a new non-linear fuzzy-set based methodology is proposed to characterize and propagate uncertainty through a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict DO using flow and water temperature as the regressors. The output is depicted as probabilistic rather than deterministic and is used to calculate the risk of low DO concentration. To demonstrate the new method, data from the Bow River in Calgary, Alberta from 2006 to 2008 are used. Low DO concentration has been occasionally observed in the river and correctly predicting, and quantifying the associated uncertainty and variability of DO is of interest to the City of Calgary. Flow, temperature and DO data were used to construct five MLR models, using different combinations of linear and non-linear fuzzy membership functions. The results show that non-linear representation of variance is superior to the linear approach based on model performance. Normal and Gumbel based membership functions produced the best results. The outputs from two non-linear fuzzy membership models were used to calculate risk of low DO. The predicted risk was between 3.9 and 4.9Â %. This is an improvement over the traditional method, which can not indicate a risk of low DO for the same time period. This study demonstrates that water resource managers can adequately use MLR models to predict the risk of low DO using abiotic factors.
