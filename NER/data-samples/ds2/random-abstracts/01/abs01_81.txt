Abstract In this paper, we prove that if $$(\nabla _{X} L_{\xi })Y= (\nabla _{Y} L_{\xi })X$$ (∇XLξ)Y=(∇YLξ)X holds on $$M$$ M , then $$M$$ M is a Hopf hypersurface, where $$L_\xi $$ Lξ denote the induced operator from the Lie derivative with respect to the structure vector field $$\xi $$ ξ . We characterize such Hopf hypersurfaces of $$M_n(c)$$ Mn(c) .
