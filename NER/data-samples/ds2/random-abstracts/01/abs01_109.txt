Abstract We consider two convection-diffusion boundary value problems in conservative form: for an ordinary differential equation and for a parabolic equation. Both the problems are discretized using a four-point second-order upwind space difference operator on arbitrary and layer-adapted space meshes. We give ɛ-uniform maximum norm error estimates O(N −2ln2 N(+τ)) and O(N −2(+τ)), respectively, for the Shishkin and Bakhvalov space meshes, where N is the space meshnodes number, τ is the time meshinterval. The smoothness condition for the Bakhvalov mesh is replaced by a weaker condition.
