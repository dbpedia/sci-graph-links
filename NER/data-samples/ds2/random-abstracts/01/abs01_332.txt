Abstract The paper substantiates the application of a projection-iterative method to the approximate solution of the normal case in the Haseman and Haseman-type problems on the unit circle in spaces of HÃ¶lder-continuous functions. Sufficient conditions for the method to be applicable are derived and bounds are established on the rate at which the approximate solution converges to the exact solution.
