Abstract From the quadratic functional equation ƒ(x + y) + ƒ(x − y) − 2ƒ(x) − 2f(y) = 0 various alternative equations are derived here by grouping in different ways its terms and then equating norms. Some equivalence results are proved in the class of functionals ƒ: X → (ℝ, ¦· ¦). Suitable examples concerning operators ƒ: X → (E,∥· ∥) with values in normed spaces show that in this more general setting such an equivalence can fail to be true.
