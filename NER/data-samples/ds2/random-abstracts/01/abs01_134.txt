Abstract In this paper, we study the existence and concentration of positive solution for the following class of fractional elliptic equation $$\begin{aligned} \epsilon ^{2s} (-\Delta )^{s}{u}+V(z)u=f(u) \quad \text{ in } \; \mathbb {R}^{N}, \end{aligned}$$ ϵ2s(-Δ)su+V(z)u=f(u)inRN, where $$\epsilon $$ ϵ is a positive parameter, f is a continuous function having a subcritical growth, V is a continuous potential possessing a local minimum, $$N > 2s,$$ N>2s, $$s \in (0,1)$$ s∈(0,1) and $$ (-\Delta )^{s}u$$ (-Δ)su is the fractional laplacian.
