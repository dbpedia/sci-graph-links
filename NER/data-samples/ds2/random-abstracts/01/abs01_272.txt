Summary It has been proved that the canonical co-ordinates for a classical «spinning» string in an orthonormal gauge are the canonical co-ordinates for all gauges. These canonical co-ordinates have been shown to be a generalization of the classical analogues of the DDF operators of the Neveu-Schwarz dual model.
