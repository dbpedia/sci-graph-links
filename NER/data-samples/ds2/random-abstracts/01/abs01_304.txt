Abstract PurposeWe give a new interpretation of Koszul cohomology, which is equivalent under the Bridgeland-King-Reid equivalence to Voisinâ€™s Hilbert scheme interpretation in dimensions 1 and 2 but is different in higher dimensions. MethodsWe show that an explicit resolution of a certain S n -equivariant sheaf is equivalent to a resolution appearing in the theory of Koszul cohomology. ResultsOur methods easily show that the dimension Kp,q(B,L) is a polynomial in d for L=d A+P with A ample and d large enough. ConclusionsThis interpretation allows us to extract various pieces of information about asymptotic properties K p,q for fixed p,q.
