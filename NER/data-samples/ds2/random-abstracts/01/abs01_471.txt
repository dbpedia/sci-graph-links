Abstract This paper presents differential evolution with Gaussian mutation to solve the complex non-smooth non-convex combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) problem. Valve-point loading and prohibited operating zones of conventional thermal generators are taken into account. Differential evolution (DE) is a simple yet powerful global optimization technique. It exploits the differences of randomly sampled pairs of objective vectors for its mutation process. This mutation process is not suitable for complex multimodal optimization. This paper proposes Gaussian mutation in DE which improves search efficiency and guarantees a high probability of obtaining the global optimum without significantly impairing the simplicity of the structure of DE. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified on five test problems and three test systems. The results of the proposed approach are compared with those obtained by other evolutionary methods. It is found that the proposed differential evolution with Gaussian mutation-based approach is able to provide better solution.
