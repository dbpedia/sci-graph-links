Abstract A new class of the simplest equilibrium two-parameter distribution functions for spherical stellar systems with a radially anisotropic stellar velocity distribution is investigated. The models under consideration are a less singular counterpart of the so-called generalized polytropes, which in the past were among the most popular models in works on the equilibrium and stability of gravitating systems. In contrast to the well-known generalized polytropes, the proposed models have finite density and potential at the center. The absence of a singularity is necessary for a proper consideration of the radial orbit instability, which is the most important instability of spherical stellar systems. The main observed parameters of the proposed models (potential, density, anisotropy) are compared with those in well-known equilibrium models.
