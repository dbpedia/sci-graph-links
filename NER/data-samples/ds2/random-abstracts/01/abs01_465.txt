Abstract. Properties of the degree of Belyi functions. A famous theorem of Belyi characterizes the curves defined over a number field by the existence of an element of its function field with certain ramification properties. In this article we are interested in the degree of these functions. We define the Belyi degree of a curve defined over a number field and the Belyi degree of a point on such a curve. We prove finiteness results concerning these invariants. We give an explicit upper bound for the Belyi degree of a point on the projective line, depending on the height and on the degree of its field of definition.
