Abstract This study presents an effective procedure for the determination of a biologically inspired, black-box model of cultures of microorganisms (including yeasts, bacteria, plant and animal cells) in bioreactors. This procedure is based on sets of experimental data measuring the time-evolution of a few extracellular species concentrations, and makes use of maximum likelihood principal component analysis to determine, independently of the kinetics, an appropriate number of macroscopic reactions and their stoichiometry. In addition, this paper provides a discussion of the geometric interpretation of a stoichiometric matrix and the potential equivalent reaction schemes. The procedure is carefully evaluated within the stoichiometric identification framework of the growth of the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus on cheese whey. Using Monte Carlo studies, it is also compared with two other previously published approaches.
