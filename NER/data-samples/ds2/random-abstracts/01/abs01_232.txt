Abstract. In this article, we are interested in uniqueness results for viscosity solutions of a general class of quasilinear, possibly degenerate, parabolic equations set in ${\mathbb R}^N$. Using classical viscosity solutions' methods, we obtain a general comparison result for solutions with polynomial growths but with a restriction on the growth of the initial data. The main application is the uniqueness of solutions for the mean curvature equation for graphs which was only known in the class of uniformly continuous functions. An application to the mean curvature flow is given.
