Abstract We define a class ℐ p (M,N) of Sobolev maps from a manifoldM into a manifoldN, in such a way that each mapu∈ ℐ p (M, N) has a well defined [p]-homotopy type, providedN satisfies a topological hypothesis. Using this, we prove the existence of minimizers in [p]-homotopy classes for some polyconvex variational problems.
