Summary. In standard first-passage percolation on ${\Bbb Z}^d$ (with $d\geq 2$), the time-minimizing paths from a point to a plane at distance $L$ are expected to have transverse fluctuations of order $L^\xi$. It has been conjectured that $\xi(d)\geq 1/2$ with the inequality strict (superdiffusivity) at least for low $d$ and with $\xi(2)=2/3$. We prove (versions of) $\xi(d)\geq 1/2$ for all $d$ and $\xi(2)\geq 3/5$.
