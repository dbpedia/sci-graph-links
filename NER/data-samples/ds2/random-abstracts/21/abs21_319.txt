Abstract After presenting the methodological bases of historical phytogeography (paleochorology; Fig. 1), a new paleographic map series is introduced (Fig. 2). They serve for ten examples of paleochorological analyses, in which the major phases of the development of a group in space and time are documented. In addition to purely tropical taxa (Nypa, Ctenolophon), others which originated in the warm and humid N. Tethyan belt (Bombacaceae p.p.,Olacaceae p.p.,Symplocos, Alangium, Nepenthes) or which presently occur as eastern N. American/E. Asian disjuncts (Sarcococca andPachysandra) are discussed (Figs. 3–14). Finally, analyses of two very old angiosperm groups with complicated paleochorological patterns (Restionaceae andAscarina, Chloranthaceae p.p.; Figs. 15–16) are presented.
