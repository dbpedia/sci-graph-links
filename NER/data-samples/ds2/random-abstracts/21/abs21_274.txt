Abstract Aspects of the geodynamic evolution of mainland Southeast Asia and China are discussed in consideration of the Permo-Triassic »Paleotethys« problem. It is shown that all sutures in Thailand, Vietnam and Yunnan already closed during the Paleozoic era and that the entire region must be regarded as part of the northern continents. The Permo-Triassic »Paleotethys« must be expected south of Tibet and in Burma.
