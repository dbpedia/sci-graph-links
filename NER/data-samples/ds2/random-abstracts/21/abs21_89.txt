Abstract Over 200 years of development of modern electrochemistry was divided into five periods. Period I from the beginning up to the end of nineteenth century, Period II from 1901 to 1945, Period III from 1946 to 1965, Period IV from 1966 to 1990, and the last Period V from 1991 till the present. This division is based on (1) use of different research methods in these periods, as well as (2) different intensity and organization of research work. In each period, the main research interests were briefly characterized, followed by short discussion of the main achievements. The expected trends of future development of electrochemistry were also briefly discussed.
