Summary At the 1979 annual meeting of the American Psychological Association a special series of twenty-two symposia and lectures was devoted to the theme of ‘A Century of Psychology as Science: Retrospections and Assessments.’ The speakers in this series, including many major psychologists, were charged with giving historical overviews and critical evaluations of various aspects of the first century of experimental psychology. This article, written by one of the organizers of this centennial program, presents an analysis of and commentary on the views expressed by these speakers.
