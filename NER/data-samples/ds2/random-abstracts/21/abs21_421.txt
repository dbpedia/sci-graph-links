Abstract Two strong heat waves in the summer of 2003 determined elevated heat discomfort conditions all across the Western Europe. In this context, the analysis of hourly Heat Index values in the city of Naples (Southern Italy) showed prolonged heat discomfort conditions during the second half of June 2003 and from the second half of July 2003 up to the first week of September 2003, resulting in highest mortality rate for persons 75Â years or more.
