Abstract Clapeyron is well known in thermodynamics through the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron equation that describes the variation of the vapor pressure with temperature; few are aware that he made his career as a railroad engineer and locomotive designer. Here we give a description of his life and his scientific and professional achievements as an engineer in a turbulent epoch in the history of France and Russia. It is shown that Clapeyron was able to develop his equation without making use of the second law and the concepts of absolute temperature and entropy, ideas unknown in his time.
