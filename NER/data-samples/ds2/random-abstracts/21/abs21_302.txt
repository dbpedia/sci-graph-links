Abstract A 2-year-old boy with a long history of vomiting, dysphagia, and weight loss was found to have a rigid stricture in the proximal esophagus. We performed esophageal repair using a Livaditis circular myotomy technique. The removed section of esophagus contained the inflammatory stricture with a pseudodiverticulum, caused by the unrecognized ingestion of a small, hard plastic sticker.
