Abstract. We study the radiative decays $\omega\rightarrow \eta\pi^{0}\gamma$ and $\rho^{0}\rightarrow \eta\pi^{0}\gamma$ within the framework of a phenomenological approach in which the contributions of the intermediate $a_0$-meson and intermediate vector meson states are considered. We conclude that although the $a_0$-meson intermediate state amplitude makes a small contribution to $\omega\rightarrow \eta\pi^{0}\gamma$ decay, it makes a substantial contribution to $\rho^0\rightarrow \eta\pi^{0}\gamma$ decay.
