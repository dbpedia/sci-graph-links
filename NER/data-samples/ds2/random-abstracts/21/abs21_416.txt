Abstract The ternary system of silver, lithium, and rubidium nitrates has been studied. Five vertical sections were established: AgNO3-Li0.5Rb0.5NO3; Li0.5Rb0.5NO3-Ag0.5Rb0.5NO3; 20 mol% AgNO3; 80 mol% AgNO3; and the section 5 mol% LiNO3. Ten invariant points were found. A schematic representation of ternary equilibria is given. The three binary systems are also reported.
