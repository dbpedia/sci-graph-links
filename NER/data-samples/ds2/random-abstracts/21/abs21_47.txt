Summary We have analysed five Southern European populations (Albanian, Greek, Italian, Spanish and Yugoslavian) for 14 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations. The most frequent mutations, apart from ΔF508, were G542X (6.04%), R1162X (3.61%) and N1303K (3.24%). Each of the other analysed mutations were present at a frequency of less than 1% (R347P, R334W, S549RA, S549I, G551D, R553X and W1282X), and four mutations (D110H, ΔI507, S549RT, and S1255X) were not found in this sample. The data presented here allows the use of mutation analysis in 69.5% of Spanish, 58% of Greek, and 56.5% of Italian CF cases.
