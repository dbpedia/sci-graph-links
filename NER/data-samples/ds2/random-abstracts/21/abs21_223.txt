Summary In the present study the rare occurrence of intramitochondrial crystalloid inclusions in the rat pinealocytes is described. They lie within the mitochondrial matrix and consist of a lattice of moderately electron-dense lines. Intersections at regular intervals form rhomboid-like subunits. The significance of these inclusions is not known.
