Abstract The uprising and military confrontation in Libya that began in February 2011 has led to a disruption of the countryâ€™s gas exports to Europe. An analysis of how Europe has compensated for these missing gas volumes shows that the disruption has not affected security of supply. However, this situation would change if the North African uprising were to spread to Algeria.
