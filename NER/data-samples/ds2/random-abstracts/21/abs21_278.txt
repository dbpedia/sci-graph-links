Abstract A cladistic study of all 44 species of North AmericanCoreopsis was performed using 35 characters. The resulting cladogram indicated that all 11 sections are monophyletic. At the intersectional level, two lineages were revealed, one consisting of six sections occurring almost exclusively in Mexico and California, and another comprising five sections restricted largely to the eastern and southeastern United States. The cladogram is similar to phylogenies produced by less explicit methods but it differs in two major respects: the monotypic sect.Silphidium is placed with other sections from the southeastern United States rather than with Mexican sections, and sect.Anathysana from Mexico is more closely allied with the three California sections than with sect.Electra from Mexico.
