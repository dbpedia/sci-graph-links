Abstract. We deal with all the maps from the exponential family f ε(z) = (e −1 + ε)exp(z), with ε ≥ 0. Let h ε = HD(J r,ε) be the Hausdorff dimension of the radial Julia sets J r,ε. Observing the phenomenon of parabolic implosion, it is shown that the function ε ↦ h ε is not continuous from the right.
