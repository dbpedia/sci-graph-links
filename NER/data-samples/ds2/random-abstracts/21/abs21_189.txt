Summary Mixed-species colonies ofPolyergus lucidus andFórmica schaufussi were studied in New York. Slave raids were conducted in late afternoon, past the peak in diurnal temperature. Multiple raids on differentFormica colonies were common, as were re-raids on the same colony. In laboratory nests, about 75% of the raidedFormica brood was eaten. Of 27 days on which raids occurred in the laboratory, 25 were onFormica nests souted on the day of the raid.Polyergus scouts are among the oldest individuals in the colony, and callows do not participate in scouting during the entire season of their eclosion. The group ofPolyergus workers that circle on the surface near the nest prior to raiding has a dynamic composition. The most frequent behavioral transition was from circling on one day to scouting on the next. The next most common change was from scouting to circling. The first scouting of the spring season occurred only one day after the appearance ofPolyergus larvae. The first slave raid was conducted 4 days later.Formica brood was present in freeliving colonies from 1–4 weeks earlier thanPolyergus brood in mixed nests. Although workers ofPolyergus were usually fed by regurgitation fromFormica, they occasionally drank and ate eggs independently. ThePolyergus queen was surrounded only byFormica workers.Polyergus eggs hatched into larvae in approximately 12 days, with the larval stage lasting an additional 9–12 days. Eclosion of callows took place within 20–23 days after pupation. Newly matedPolyergus queens follow slave raids and attempt adoption into target nests when theFormica are scattered during a slave raid. The process of budding was never observed.
