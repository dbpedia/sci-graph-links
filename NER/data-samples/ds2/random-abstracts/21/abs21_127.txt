Abstract The SPF rabbits were inoculated with oocysts of Eimeria flavescens and the first newly developed oocysts were recovered. They were used for inoculation of other rabbits which conseqeuntly excreted oocysts sooner than in the previous passage. By repeated use of this method, the prepatent period was shortened after 18 passages by more than 60Â h. The endogenous development of this precocious line (PL) differed from that of the original strain (OS). Compared to OS, two asexual generations, second (or third) and fourth, were absent in PL. The first merogony took place in the jejunum and ileum in OS and, in contrast, in the large intestine in PL. Like in other rabbit coccidia, two types of meronts (A and B) were seen in each generation. However, the ratio of B: A meronts in the last (fifth) asexual generation as well as ratio of microgamonts:macrogamonts differs in OS and PL.
