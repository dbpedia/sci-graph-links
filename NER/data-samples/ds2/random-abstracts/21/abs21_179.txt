Summary: Workers of the ponerine ant, Paraponera clavata, grow allometrically, with the head disproportionately larger in larger workers. The anterior (clypeus)-posterior (occiput) dimension of the head capsule is allometric with the lateral (interocular) dimension, so that larger workers have elongate heads. The degree of head capsule allometry varies among colonies; this could result either from differences in colony maturity or from variation in developmental patterns among colonies. These data resolve a previously controversial issue concerning caste in Paraponera clavata.
