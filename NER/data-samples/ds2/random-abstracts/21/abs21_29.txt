Summary The frequencies of alpha-1-antitrypsin alleles were determined for five Chinese national minorities: Uigur, Korean, Mongolian, Chuang, and Li. PI*S and PI*Z alleles are not found in the five populations studied. PI*ETOK allele is present in Korean, Mongolian, and Chuang populations, and Etokyo is a very common alpha-1-antitrypsin variant in Chinese. Other alleles which occur in more than one of the minorities are PI*X (Mongolian and Chuang) and PI*M4 (Korean and Uigur). The high frequency of PI*M4 in the Uigur population suggests a probably Occidental origin of this nationality.
