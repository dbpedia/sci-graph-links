Summary Using bioluminescence of luciferin-luciferase, we showed that ATP leaked out rhythmically from a strand segment ofPhysarum plasmodium made permeable with caffeine-arsenate. With simultaneous measurement of isometric tension rhythm of the strand, it was revealed that the period and phase of oscillation in ATP leakage correspond well with those of tension production. Further, microinjection of luciferin-luciferase into the plasmodial strand indicated that the intracellular luminescence of luciferin-luciferase also oscillates with the same period and in the same phase as the tension rhythm. The free ATP concentration in a homogenate ofPhysarum plasmodium was of the order of 10 μM, but if the homogenate was heated in boiling water, the intensity of luminescence suddenly increased 10–100 fold. ATP available for mechanical workin vivo is thus supposed to be at a much lower level than the total average, which was found in the range of 0.2–0.7 mM.
