Abstract A database and website (http://www.ictvonline.org/taxonomyReleases.asp) have been established where the history of changes in virus taxonomy from 1971 to the present day can easily be traced. Each change is linked to a source document confirming the change or, for most changes since 2002, to the taxonomic proposal approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
