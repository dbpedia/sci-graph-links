Abstract Several examples of the earliest commercial thermal analysis apparatus, the Talabot-Persoz-Rogeat Desiccator, are exhibited in various French museums and there is documentary evidence that at least twelve were exported to the UK in the late 19th Century. This paper describes the search for extant examples in the UK.
