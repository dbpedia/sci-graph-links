Abstract We present a case of an allied soldier who was accidentally shot from a very close range on his right thigh by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). He may be considered lucky as he was closer than 3Â m to RPG-7 and the warhead did not explode, which would otherwise have threatened his life. The patient was operated upon soon after; the grenade was carefully removed from the muscle mass manually and handed over to the bomb squad team member for disposal in a safe place. Military surgeons face many cases of firearm and blast wounded patients in the emergency unit, both in war and in peace conditions. An unusual way of injury with unclear history and unexplained findings must raise the suspicion of a military surgeon. Ignoring the details that signal the clues of an unexploded grenade may risk the medical team. A thorough history and careful physical examination often reveals the diagnosis. Military surgeons equipped with these information would be able to treat unusually injured cases, also taking care of themselves and their team.
