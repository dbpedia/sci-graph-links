Abstract Many animals with rectal prolapse have an antecedent history of dyschezia and tenesmus associated with colonic inflammatory disease. However, it seems that there are no reports of rectal prolapse concurrent with antibiotic-associated colitis in the veterinary literature. A 3-month-old male cross-bred dog presented with a history of recurrent episodes of rectal prolapse following the administration of oral cephalexin. The rectal prolapse was corrected surgically. Based on the dog's recent history of antibiotic use, the sudden onset of bloody diarrhoea, tenesmus and subsequent rectal prolapse, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was considered as the primary cause of rectal prolapse in this case. Clostridium perfringens were isolated from a bacteriological stool culture. The dog was treated with amoxicillin for three consecutive weeks. There were no detectable signs of diarrhoea or a recurrence of rectal prolapse during the 2-month follow-up period.
