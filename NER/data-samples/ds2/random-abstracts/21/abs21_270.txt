Abstract Lebanon’s publishing industry is mainly turned towards export to the Arab market; subsequently, the analysis of the Lebanese book production can provide a fair overview of the state of publishing in the Arab world. And the picture is far from bright; however resourceful and dynamic, Arab trade publishers cannot reach the sales figures one would expect in a region of more than 362 million people. A relatively low purchasing power and the lack of efficient distribution channels, in addition to piracy and censorship, are endemic problems they have to face on a daily basis, not only in marketing their books throughout the region, but also in dealing with foreign publishers and agents. Indeed for many of these, the Arab market remains incomprehensible and not transparent. However, it is only through apprehending its reality that they can adapt their level of expectations to it in order to achieve successful licensing deals and establish sound partnerships in the region.
