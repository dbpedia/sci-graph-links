Abstract An integer is called y-rough if it is composed solely of primes $$> y$$ >y . Let $$\lfloor {.}\rfloor $$ ⌊.⌋ be the floor function. In this paper, we exhibit an asymptotic formula for the counting function of integers $$n \leqslant x$$ n⩽x such that $$\lfloor {n^c}\rfloor $$ ⌊nc⌋ is y-rough uniformly for a range of y that depends on $$1< c < 2229/1949$$ 1<c<2229/1949 .
