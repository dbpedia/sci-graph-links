Summary Excised roots ofPisum sativum were cultured in White's medium supplemented with various concentrations of sucrose or IAA and exposed to3H-TdR for 24 hours, three days after excision. Varying the concentration of sucrose or IAA in the culture medium had no effect on the size of the quiescent centre in the apical meristem of these roots. It is concluded that the existence of a quiescent centre in angiosperm roots is not due to carbohydrate starvation or to the super-abundance, or lack of, IAA.
