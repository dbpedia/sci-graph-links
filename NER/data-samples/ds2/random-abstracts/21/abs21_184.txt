Abstract Allele frequencies for the seven PCR-based loci (LDLR, GYPA, HBGG, D7S8, Gc, HLA-DQA1, and D1S80) were determined in a Black African population from Zimbabwe. All loci are highly polymorphic and meet Hardy-Weinberg expectations. An interclass correlation analysis detected only two significant departures from independence out of 21 pair-wise comparisons of the 7 loci. The Black African allele frequency data are similar to African American data at four of the seven PCR-based loci.
