Summary αI/65 Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) is due to the duplication of TTG codon 1541 (leucine) of α-spectrin and is associated with a constant haplotype. It was encountered exclusively in African and American Blacks, and in North Africans. We assumed that it diffused from the Benin-Togo area to Northern Africa. We now report two South Italian families with αI/65 HE. The phenotype fully conformed to previous descriptions. The mode of transmission was dominant; however, the manifestations were more pronounced when the common, low expression level αV/41 allele occurred in trans to the αI/65 allele, also conforming to previous records. The mutation underlying αI/65 HE turned out to be, again, the duplication of TTG codon 154 and the associated haplotype was the same as that encountered previously (+-+; XbaI, PvuII, MspI). Thus, the αI/65 allele found in Italy must have been introduced from North Africa across the Sicilian channel and would ultimately have originated from the Benin-Togo area. It would witness the same migratory stream as that followed by the Benin type haemoglobin S allele, which is also present in Southern Italy.
