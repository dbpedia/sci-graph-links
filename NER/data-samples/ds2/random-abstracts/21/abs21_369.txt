Summary The trends and the fluctuations in variability of surface air temperature in Italy has been investigated by statistical analysis of historical data covering the recent 100 years. 27 stations were used for the analysis and these were distributed all over the Italian territory divided into two climatically homogeneous zones. The temperature trends are different in each climatic zone and season, while the interannual variability shows a similar seasonal dependence for the North and South of Italy. In particular, summer temperature shows a characteristic pattern with alternating minima and maxima reaching significant values in the period 1940–1970: a maximum for the North between 1940–1960 and a minimum for the South between 1960–1970.
