Abstract Let X be a realcompact space and $${H:C(X)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}}$$ be an identity and order preserving group homomorphism. It is shown that H is an evaluation at some point of X if and only if there is $${\varphi\in C(\mathbb{R})}$$ with $${\varphi(r)>\varphi(0)}$$ for all $${r\in\mathbb{R}-\{0\}}$$ for which $${H\circ\varphi=\varphi\circ H}$$ . This extends (and unifies) classical results by Hewitt and Shirota.
