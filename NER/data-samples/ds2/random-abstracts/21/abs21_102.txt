Abstract We report for the first time the isolation in Europe ofNaegleria fowleri showing a type of restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) usually found in Australia. The presence of this type as well as the European type fluctuated with time in the cooling waters of the nuclear power station investigated. Two possible explanations for the appearance of the AustralianN. fowleri type in Europe are presented.
