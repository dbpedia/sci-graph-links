Summary Potato Research started as the “European Potato Journal”, the official journal of the European Association for Potato Research, in 1958, was re-named “Potato Research” in 1970 (Volume 13) and has published mainly original scientific contributions in 39 volumes. The authorship has become increasingly international and currently writes predominantly in English, although papers are also offered in German or French. Topics covered have seen clear changes over volumes, mainly reflecting trends and break-throughs in (potato) science.
