Summary An overlooked toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may leed to a fatal outcome. In neurosurgery a transsphenoidal approach with post-operative nasal tamponade may promote toxic shock syndrome without signs of local wound infection. By discussing the case history of a patient after hypophysectomy by the transsphenoidal route, we propose that after the appearance of the first signs of toxic shock syndrome, quick removal of the nasal tamponade is a life saving procedure.
