Abstract The authors' experience in 25 cases of craniosynostosis treated within a period of 2 years is described. The morphology of the skull has varied from one case to the other, so that modification of the technique was needed in each case. There was no mortality, but two complications were encountered: CSF subcutaneous collection that resolved spontaneously and an almost complete absorption of the neoforehead and part of the frontal bar due to infection.
