Abstract Opera tends to be an international art. The national operas that emerged towards the middle of the nineteenth century represent a deviation, because they made use of librettos in the vernacular and often employed elements of a native musical tradition. More often than not, they thematized events from the national past in order to strengthen the nation's sense of identity. I argue that national operas ought to be seen as an important element of the national awakening that took place in Europe, especially in its Eastern and Southern parts, and relate its textual, musical, and institutional dimensions to the linguistic and literary awakenings. Yet, paradoxically, national awakenings and national operas often relied on foreign ideas and artistic currents. Ivan Zajc's Croatian national opera, Nikola Šubi h Zrinski (1876), for instance, is based on Theodor Körner's anti-Napoleonic German play Zriny (1812), which, in turn, was inspired by Friedrich Schlegel's Vienna lectures on literary history and Hungarian historical materials. By means of this case study I show that, contrary to their explicit ideology, national awakenings and national operas seized whatever came their way, often reductively adopting hybrid or foreign materials for national purposes.
