Abstract Abstract regular polytopes generalize the classical concept of a regular polytope and regular tessellation to more complicated combinatorial structures with a distinctive geometrical and topological flavour. In this paper the authors give an almost complete classification of the (universal) locally toroidal regular 4-polytopes of Schl√§fli types {4,4,3} and {4,4,4}.
