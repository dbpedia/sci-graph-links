Abstract. We compare distributions of leptons produced in hadronic collisions, by a horizontal neutral gauge boson, $Z^{\prime},$ suggested by the $Sp(6)_{\mathrm{L}}\otimes U(1)_{Y}$ model, to those produced by other theoretically motivated neutral gauge bosons occurring in left–right symmetric models and in superstring-inspired $E_6$ models. Forward–backward asymmetries in the gauge boson leptonic decay are found to be sensitive to specific forms of the couplings. The asymmetries are expected to be maximal for $Z^{\prime},$ distinguishing it from the other Z's.
