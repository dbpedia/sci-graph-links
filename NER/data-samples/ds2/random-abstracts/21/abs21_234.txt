Summary A 38-year-old man presented with a 19-year history of sore throat and an ache radiating from the centre of the anterior neck to the both ears and the occiput. Computed tomography angiography revealed a tortuous submucosal right internal carotid artery, which was causing tonsillar displacement. The diagnosis of carotidynia has a controversial history within the literature and is currently not accepted as a distinct pathological entity by the International Headache Society. In this patient, the clinical and imaging features, in addition to the absence of any other pathology confers support to the diagnosis of carotidynia.
