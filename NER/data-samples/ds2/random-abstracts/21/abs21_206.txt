Abstract The triple-storey façade, one of the most original inventions of the Baroque period in terms of form and proportion, arose in Sicily and quickly spread throughout Italy, to Europe and beyond. Guarini’s design for the façade of Santissima Annunziata in Messina paved the way for its general acceptance. The roots for the concept, however, may be found in the work of Giacomo Del Duca.
