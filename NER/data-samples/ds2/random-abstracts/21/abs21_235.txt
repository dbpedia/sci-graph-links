Abstract The present study analyses the case histories of urinary stone colics recorded at the hospital “Val di Sieve” (Florence) during the period 1962–1971 by comparing the weather conditions of the 353 days during which the cases occurred, with the weather conditions of a sample of “normal” reference days. From the analysis it seems to emerge that a hot and — at the same time — dry weather, as well as wide changes in air pressure, may favour in predisposed individuals the onset of urinary stone colics.
