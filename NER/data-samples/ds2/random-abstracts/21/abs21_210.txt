Abstract. I discuss our replication of the wire-torsion experiments that Charles Augustin Coulomb (1736–1806) reported in a session of the Paris Académie des Sciences in 1784. I first explain the nature and purpose of the replication method and then apply it to an analysis of Coulomb’s experiments. I conclude by placing Coulomb’s presentation of his memoir into its specific historical contest.
