Summary The pathologic-anatomical features of large bowel carcinoma were compared between Japan and the United States in gross as well as histological type using 197 surgical specimens from western Japan during the period of 1963 through 1970. The result together with the materials collected from the literature suggested that there seemed to be definite difference in the anatomical distribution. A relatively high incidence of carcinoma of the rectum and concomitant low incidence of carcinoma of the sigmoid and descending colons in Japan was found to be the major difference when compared with the data published in the American literature. Some difference was also noted in a relatively high incidence of polypoid-type carcinoma and in a relatively low incidence of annular-type carcinoma among Japanese materials in contrast to those of American materials. The reason for these difference is not clearly understood at present and further collection of materials and pertinent data are necessary.
