Abstract The current situation in Russia regarding steel casting using slide valves in Russia is discussed and its main drawbacks are identified. Promising slide valves with elastic elements have been developed by the Shiber JSC (a domestic manufacturer). The advantages of the state-of-the-art valves include a “book-like” opening system, presence of spring elements, durability, and convenience in servicing. Slide valves should be compatible with the drive mechanism (hydraulic stations are recommended for this purpose) and a set of state-of-the-art refractories.
