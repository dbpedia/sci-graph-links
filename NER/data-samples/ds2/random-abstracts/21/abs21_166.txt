Summary Six human dicentric translocations involving the presence of a suppressed centromere were studied: one case of t dic(9;22), one of t dic(13;18), one of t dic(14;15), and three of t dic(13;14). All exhibited chromatid separation at an acrocentric centromere and were demonstrated to have two regions of centromeric constitutive heterochromatin. The four that were available for retrospective study showed a single Cd band, with absence of the Cd band at the suppressed centromere.
