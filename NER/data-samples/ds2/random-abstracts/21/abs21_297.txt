Abstract The little known historical phenomenon of black lynch mobs functioned within a dynamic network of mainstream racial praxis, public discourses, and evolving cultural values. Public narratives about lynch law use vigilantism and lynching as a meme that marks the fluidity of social and discursive power among whites and blacks during the Jim Crow Era. This essay will examine the cultural logic that informed black mobs.
