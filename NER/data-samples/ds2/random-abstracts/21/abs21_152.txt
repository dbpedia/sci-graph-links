Summary The early history of anaesthesia in Newfoundland is described by reference to newspapers and other writings of the time. News of ether first reached Newfoundland in February 1847 with a report from England of Robert Liston’s amputation of a leg on December 21, 1846. Ether was first used in St. John’s some days before July 30, 1847, for an operation to amputate both legs, the surgeon being Edward Keilley. Chloroform was used in St. John’s a few days before May 4, 1848 by Samuel Carson in an obstetrical case, and on May 10, 1848 it was used during the amputation of a leg by Edward Keilley. Also discussed are some other items of anaesthetic interest which occurred during the years following until the appointment of the first (albeit part-time) anaesthetist in St. John’s in 1912.
