Summary The serum of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis contains a chromosome-breaking agent which can be transferred into the lymphocyte cultures of healthy donors. The aberration rate induced by this “breakage factor” is reduced to near normal values, if L-cysteine is added to the culture medium over the entire incubation period in a final concentration of 10-4 mol/l.
