Abstract Historical records of sunspots and aurorae are valuable information to examine variations of solar activity and the terrestrial climate on a long-term scale. We have collected the historical records of Korea during the 11thâ€“18th century. Through a power-spectrum analysis of these data, we have found solar activity cycles, which coincide with the Schwabe cycle and the Gleissberg cycle on short and long-term periods, respectively.
