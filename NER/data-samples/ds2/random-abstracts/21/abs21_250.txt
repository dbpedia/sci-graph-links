Abstract Using the equation for a projection of a state vector, the exponent of a damping factor for a given state, corresponding to the effective decay width $$\overline {\gamma _\alpha (t)} $$ appearing in the case of multiple measured unstable states, is obtained numerically in some models for early time period t → 0. $$\overline {\gamma _\alpha (t)} $$ is found to be nonzero (even for stable states) at this time period; thus, for early times, this damping factor is always smaller than unity. It is shown that at finitet's $$\overline {\gamma _\alpha (t)} $$ may be smaller or greater than the standard decay width γα in Weisskopf-Wigner theory depending on the parameters of a model considered.
