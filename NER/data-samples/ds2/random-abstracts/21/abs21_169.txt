Summary Q-and C-band heteromorphisms were determined by sequentially staining cells from 81 members of an American Black kindred. The incidence of heteromorphs is reported for 14-people who married into the family. Small pericentric inversions of chromosome 3 were found in 23 kindred members, three of whom were homozygous. Six ‘complete’ chromosome 9 inversions and a single ‘partial’ inv9 were detected. There was no apparent phenotypic effect associated with the inversions, nor were duplication-deficiency chromosomes observed. Evidence for preferential segregation of Q-heteromorphs is reported, and comparison with data from other authors points to chromosome 13 as showing the most distortion.
