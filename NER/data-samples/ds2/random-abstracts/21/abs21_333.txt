Summary Links between mycoplasmas and viruses are ancient, multiple and complex, from past confusions during the first decades of the virus era to present realities illustrated by the possible implication of mycoplasms as co-factors in natural infections of AIDS. Mycoplasma viruses (phages) may also be responsible for modifying the pathogenic power of mycoplasmas, at least for plants and insects. In addition, several mycoplasmas are able to act as undesirable cell culture contaminants that induce erroneous results in both applied and general virology. These problems are examined within a historical context.
