Abstract. We report on a measurement of the differential and total cross sections of inclusive production of $\Xi^*$ resonances in $\Sigma^-$-nucleus collisions at 345 GeV/c. The cross section for inclusive $\Xi^0_{1530}$ production is about a factor of 5 below that of $\Xi^-_{1320}$ hyperons. The products of cross section and branching ratio for the observed channels $\Xi^0_{1690} \to \Xi^- \pi^+ \Xi^-_{1820} \to \Xi^0_{1530} \pi^-$ and $\Xi^-_{1950} \to \Xi^0_{1530} \pi^-$ are lower by yet another order of magnitude. The $\Xi^-_{1820}$ and $\Xi^-_{1950}$ resonances show significantly harder $x_F$ and $p_t$ distributions than $\Xi^-$ and $\Xi^0_{1530}$ hyperons. A comparison of the $x_F$-distribution to PYTHIA and QGSM predictions provides only a partial agreement.
