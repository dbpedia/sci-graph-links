Abstract In this article, we prove a finiteness theorem for meromorphic mappings of ℂm $\mathbb {C}^{m}$ into ℙn(ℂ) $\mathbb {P}^{n}(\mathbb {C})$ sharing few moving hyperplanes regardless of multiplicities with a general condition on the intersections of the inverse images of these hyperplanes. In the last section of this paper, we will consider the case where the meromorphic mappings share different families of moving hyperplanes.
