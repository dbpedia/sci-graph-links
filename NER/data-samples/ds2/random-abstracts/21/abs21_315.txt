Abstract Since its foundation in 1870 in Schemnitz the higher educational and research centre of nonferrous metallurgy in Hungary has gone first to Sopron after the First World War and then to Miskolc in the fifties of the last century. During its 135 years existence the Department of Nonferrous (Extractive) Metallurgy as a knowledge base has undergone conceptual transformations in its teaching and research domains before it has now become part of the recently established Department of Metallurgical and Foundry Engineering (Group Nonferrous Metallurgy) at the Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Miskolc. The mission of its staff, however, has not changed much during its long history and geographical transfers, and still the groupâ€™s members are striving hard to serve the intellectual needs of the students and to fulfil basic and applied research activities for the nonferrous primary and secondary industry in Hungary. Moreover, and in parallel to that, the research efforts have always been carried out in view of the international tendencies and often in close collaboration with foreign institutions, e. g. from Leoben/Austria, and Sendai/Japan
