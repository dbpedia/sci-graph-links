Abstract Professor R. F. T. Stepto was listed as being an Emeritus Professor at the University of Manchester in England when he died on 13 th September 2015. To his family, to his friends, to his students and to his colleagues, Bob Stepto was much much much more than can be captured in this all-too-brief academic title.
