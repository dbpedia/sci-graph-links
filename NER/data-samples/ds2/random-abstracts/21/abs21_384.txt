Abstract The literature sources and collection materials providing evidence of the repeated penetration of the land mollusk Cryptomphalus aspersa into the territory of Eastern Europe are analyzed. In the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, mollusks of this species were found in the Crimea (Feodosia), Northern Black Sea coastal region (Odessa, Kherson), and even in the forest-steppe zone of Ukraine (in the vicinity of Vinnitsa). The latter finding is verified by a shell from the malacological collection of the State Museum of Natural History, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Apparently, the intentional or accidental introduction of C. aspersa into the territory of Eastern Europe continued, but there are still no data confirming the formation of stable colonies. The finding of two specimens in the town of Vinogradov (Transcarpathian region of Ukraine) made by one of the authors of this paper in 2014 is an example of unintentional delivery of this species.
