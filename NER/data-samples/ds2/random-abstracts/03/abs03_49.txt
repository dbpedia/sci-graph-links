AbstractThe effects of oxygen (O) termination on the electronic and structural properties of a (6,0) boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All-atomic optimization and calculations of chemical shielding (CS) properties were performed for four models of the investigated BNNT based on different termination of the nanotube by the O atoms: perfect, OB-end, ON-end, and OBN-end models. The results indicate that the Bâ€“N bond lengths are not changed by O-termination but the tubular diameters, dipole moments, and band gaps are substantially changed, especially for the OBN-end model in which both tips are terminated by the O atoms. The CS properties also indicate that the atoms of the models are divided into layers on the basis of similar electronic environment in each atomic layer. In the OB-end model where the atoms of the B-tip are substituted by the O atoms, the results are indicative of attraction between the N and O-terminating atoms but in the ON-end model where the atoms of the N-tip are substituted by the O atoms, strong bonds between the B and O-terminating atoms are detected.
