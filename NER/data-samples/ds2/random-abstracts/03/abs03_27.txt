Abstract We present the results of quantum chemical calculations of the electronic structure and parameters of the Mössbauer spectra for tetracoordinate iron porphyrin (FeP) complexes in different spin states. We compare the results obtained with experimental data and results of other quantum chemical calculations. The calculated values of the quadrupole splitting and the isomer shift in the 3Eg term are close to the experimental values in tetraphenyl-FeP and in octaethyl-FeP. The Mössbauer parameters in the term 5Eg are close to the experimental values in octamethyltetrabenz-FeP.
