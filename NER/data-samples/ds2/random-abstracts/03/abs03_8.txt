Abstract A study was carried out on the electronic energy structure and nature of the chemical bond for a series of crystal modifications (like CaC2, ThC2, CsCl, or CaF2) of metastable titanium dicarbide. The TiC2 phase may be obtained as a film on the CaC2 surface, and a metal-semiconductor heterojunction is formed. The possibilities of altering the electronic properties of this heterosystem are discussed.
