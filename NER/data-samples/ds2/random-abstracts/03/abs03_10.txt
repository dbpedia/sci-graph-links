Abstract 1,5-Diazido-3-nitrazapentane (DANP) and 1,7-diazido-2,4,6-trinitrazaheptane (DATNH) are two energetic plasticizers. To better understand them, a detailed theoretical investigation was carried out using density functional theory and molecular mechanics methods. The crystal structures, spectra, thermodynamic properties, heats of formation, detonation velocity, detonation pressure, specific impulse and thermal stability were estimated. Possible initiation steps of pyrolysis were discussed by considering the bond breaking of N–NO2, C–N3, and N–N2 (via hydrogen transfer) for both compounds and the cyclization of the adjacent nitro and azido groups for DATNH. Results show that the rupture of N–NO2 and N–N2 (via hydrogen transfer) may happen simultaneously as the initial step of pyrolysis. Both crystals have P-1 symmetry as was observed experimentally. DANP has higher stability than DATNH, while DATNH has better detonation performance than DANP. In addition, DANP has a lower while DATNH has a higher specific impulse than RDX, which shows their prospects as propellant components.
