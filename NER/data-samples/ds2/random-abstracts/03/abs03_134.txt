Abstract The aim of this study is to investigate the active components of representative drugs for blood pressure regulation by applying quantum mechanical computer codes and comparison of the same for the sake of obtaining knowledge about the properties associated with the electronic structure of given molecules. The study included three well-known, but not theoretically investigated enough, active components of β-blockers: acebutolol, metoprolol and atenolol. The results are in agreement with the experimental data and were used for initial assumptions concerning the degradation of these compounds. FigureActive components of frequently used β-blockers
