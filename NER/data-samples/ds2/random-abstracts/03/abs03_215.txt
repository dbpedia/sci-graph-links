Abstract The molecular interactions between sulfur ylide (SY) and HX molecules (X = F, CN, and N3) were investigated using the MP2 method at 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set. Three different patterns including non-classical hydrogen bond (HB) H···C and classical HB H···X were found for complex formation between SY and HX molecules. Stability of the H···C type complexes are greater than H···X complexes. Quantum theories of atoms in molecules, natural bond orbitals, and energy decomposition analysis methods have been applied to analyze the intermolecular interactions. Good correlations have been found between the interaction energies (SE), the second-order perturbation energy E (2) and the charge transfer qCT in the studied systems.
