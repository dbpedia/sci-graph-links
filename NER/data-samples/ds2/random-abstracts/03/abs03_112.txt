Abstract The differential elastic scattering cross sections of N2 and O2 for 29 keV electrons have been measured. The experiment was performed using a MÃ¶llenstedt type energy analyzer to isolate the elastically scattered electrons. The difference between the measured results and calculations from molecular Hartree-Fock wave functions reveals the electron correlation in the molecules. Using the previously measured total scattering data, the inelastic scattering cross sections are derived. Several potential energies of the target are evaluated from the cross sections. Results at small angles are analyzed in terms of molecular moments and diamagnetic susceptibilities. The scattering behavior at small angles of the N2 measurement agrees well with several ab initio calculations.
