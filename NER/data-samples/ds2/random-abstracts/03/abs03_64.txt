Abstract The pulsed mode of a negative corona discharge in air has long been known; however, in electropositive gases, this mode has not been previously observed. This paper presents the results from a systematic study of a newly discovered pulsed mode of a negative corona in nitrogen over a wide range of experimental parameters. The conditions under which the pulsed mode is realized are described in detail. The dynamic characteristics of current pulses are determined. The shapes and parameters of current pulses in nitrogen and air are compared.
