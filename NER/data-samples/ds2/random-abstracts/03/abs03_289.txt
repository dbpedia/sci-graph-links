Abstract Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the atomic level were performed on three different substituted banana-shaped compounds derived from 1,3-phenylene bis[4-(4-n-hexyloxyphenyliminomethyl)benzoate] (P-6-O-PIMB). The DFT studies were carried out on the isolated molecules, and in the MD simulations clusters were treated with up to 64 monomers. The effect of polar substituents, such as chlorine and the nitro group, on the central 1,3-phenylene unit of banana-shaped compounds was investigated. In particular, flexibility, polarity, electrostatic potential (ESP) group charge distributions, B-factors, bending angles and molecular lengths were considered. The MD results were analysed by trajectories of significant torsion angles as well as order parameters such as radial atom pair distribution functions g(r), orientational correlation functions g(o), diffusion coefficients (D) and root mean square deviations (RMSD) values. The g(r) and g(o) values show that a certain long range order is generated by the introduction of a NO2 group in the 2-position of the central 1,3-phenylene ring. In contrast, the chlorination at the 4 and 6 positions of the central 1,3-phenylene unit decreases the long range order tendency by its perturbation effect on the conformations in such molecules. Moreover, g(r) and g(o) values, as well as diffusion coefficients, show that in the NO2 substituted compound the formation of microphase areas is preferred. Finally, the aggregation effect in such compounds was studied in a systematic way by a comparison of the conformational properties of the isolated molecules and the monomers in the clusters.
