Abstract. Sequential Monte Carlo/quantum mechanical calculations are performed to study the solvent effects on the electronic absorption spectrum of formamide (FMA) in aqueous solution, varying from hydrogen bonds to the outer solvation shells. Full quantum-mechanical intermediate neglect of differential overlap/singly excited configuration interaction calculations are performed in the supermolecular structures generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The largest calculation involves the ensemble average of 75 statistically uncorrelated quantum mechanical results obtained with the FMA solute surrounded by 150 water solvent molecules. We find that the n → π* transition suffers a blueshift of 1,600 cm−1 upon solvation and the π → π* transition undergoes a redshift of 800 cm−1. On average, 1.5 hydrogen bonds are formed between FMA and water and these contribute with about 20% and about 30% of the total solvation shifts of the n → π* and π → π* transitions, respectively. The autocorrelation function of the energy is used to sample configurations from the Monte Carlo simulation, and the solvation shifts are shown to be converged values.
