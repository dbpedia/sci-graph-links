Abstract Mechanical and thermal properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are characterized and analyzed using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and quantum chemistry calculations. It is found that the carbon peaks—commonly used as the reference for spectroscopic analysis—shift under mechanical and thermal stretching. Results also indicate that, at different temperatures and among the various functional groups present in PVA, the carbon in the C–O group is the most stable. Computational calculations showed that Hartree–Fock/10-31G (d) reproduces the binding energy of core carbon electrons with an accuracy of 95 %, which is enough to characterize bonds, allowing the results of the spectroscopic analysis to be corroborated.
