Abstract The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the functional role of protonation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease complexed with the inhibitor BEA369. Our results demonstrate that protonation of two aspartic acids (Asp25/Asp25′) has a strong influence on the dynamics behavior of the complex, the binding free energy of BEA369, and inhibitor–residue interactions. Relative binding free energies calculated using the MM-PBSA method show that protonation of Asp25 results in the strongest binding of BEA369 to HIV-1 protease. Inhibitor–residue interactions computed by the theory of free energy decomposition also indicate that protonation of Asp25 has the most favorable effect on binding of BEA369. In addition, hydrogen-bond analysis based on the trajectories of the MD simulations shows that protonation of Asp25 strongly influences the water-mediated link of a conserved water molecule, Wat301. We expect that the results of this study will contribute significantly to binding calculations for BEA369, and to the design of high affinity inhibitors.
