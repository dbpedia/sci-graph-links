Abstract We present systematic Density Functional Theory-Local Density Approximation computations for neutral Magnesium clusters Mg n withn≤13. For the smaller sizes the ground state structure is optimized starting from selected symmetries and allowing for relaxation, Jahn-Teller distorsion and spin polarization. For the larger sizes we perform a simulated annealing based on the ab-initio Molecular Dynamics. By the same method, we study the thermal and dynamical properties of Mg10 and Mg16. The general picture emerging from these computations shows that already atn ≈10 these clusters have acquired many characteristic features of metallic Magnesium.
