Abstract Hydrogen is an important defect in semiconductors which can significantly alter the electrical and optical properties of the host. Information on isolated interstitial hydrogen is virtually nonexistent. Fortunately, complementary data can be obtained by studying muonium. In this article, we describe recent experimental examples which illustrate how Î¼SR can be used to investigate the electronic structure and dynamics of muonium in semiconductors and discuss the relevance of these measurements for isolated hydrogen.
