Abstract In this paper we study the role played by substituent effects on reactivity and NLO properties of ortho-, meta- and para- dicarba-closo-dodecarborane derivatives at B3LYP/6−31Gdp $$ \mathrm{B}3\mathrm{LYP}/6-31\mathrm{G}\left(\mathrm{d},\mathrm{p}\right) $$ level of theory. In addition correlations with Hammett parameters of the substituents were established. In accordance with obtained results the reactivity properties of derivatives have not been significantly influenced by the isomer type, however the replaced para isomers were the most sensitive to NLO calculations. Moreover, the push-pull para isomers were found to be the most reactive and displayed the largest values of β tot and dipole moment.
