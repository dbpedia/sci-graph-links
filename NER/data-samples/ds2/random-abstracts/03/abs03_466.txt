Abstract Time decay of the ODMR signals obtained from light irradiated Biphenyl-TCNB crystals has been analyzed varying temperature and microwave power. New information are obtained on the triplet X-trap produced by illumination. It is also shown that time decay measurements are able to evidence in a simple way the cases in which the triplet is born in a non-stationary state.
