Abstract Benzimidazole-based polymer membranes like poly(2,5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) doped with phosphoric acid (PA) are electrolytes that exhibit high proton conductivity in fuel cells at elevated temperatures. The benzimidazole (BI) moiety is an important constituent of these membranes, so the present work was performed in order to achieve a molecular understanding of the BIâ€“PA interactions in the presence of varying levels of the PA dopant, using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The various hydrogen-bonding interactions, as characterized based on structural properties and hydrogen-bond lifetime calculations, show that both BI and PA molecules exhibit dual proton-acceptor/donor functionality. An examination of diffusion coefficients showed that the diffusion of BI decreases with increasing PA uptake, whereas the diffusion of PA slightly increases. The hydrogen-bond lifetime calculations pointed to the existence of competitive hydrogen bonding between various sites in BI and PA.
