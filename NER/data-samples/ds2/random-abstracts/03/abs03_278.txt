Abstract Modelling of conformational changes in biopolymers is one of the greatest challenges of molecular biophysics. Metadynamics is a recently introduced free energy modelling technique that enhances sampling of configurational (e.g. conformational) space within a molecular dynamics simulation. This enhancement is achieved by the addition of a history-dependent bias potential, which drives the system from previously visited regions. Discontinuous metadynamics in the space of essential dynamics eigenvectors (collective motions) has been proposed and tested in conformational change modelling. Here, we present an implementation of two continuous formulations of metadynamics in the essential subspace. The method was performed in a modified version of the molecular dynamics package GROMACS. These implementations were tested on conformational changes in cyclohexane, alanine dipeptide (terminally blocked alanine, Ace-Ala-Nme) and SH3 domain. The results illustrate that metadynamics in the space of essential coordinates can accurately model free energy surfaces associated with conformational changes.
