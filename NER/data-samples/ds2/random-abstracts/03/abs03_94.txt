Abstract Extended HÃ¼ckel crystal orbital (EHCO) calculations on zig-zag planar and helical conformations of regular infinite (model) isotactic polypropylene are reported. Significant changes in the theoretical XPS spectra and comparison with experimental data support the idea of possible detection of conformations in the case of good stereoregular polymers.
