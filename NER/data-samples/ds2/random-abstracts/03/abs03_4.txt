Abstract STO double-zeta SCF wavefunctions for various configurations of the H5O2+associate have been computed. Results are discussed and compared with other authors' similar calculations on gaussian bases. An electrostatic picture of the monosolvation of H3O+ is proposed as a fairly satisfactory one.
