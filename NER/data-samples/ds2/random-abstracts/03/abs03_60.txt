Abstract The configuration superposition method realized in the basis of Hartree-Fock functions and transformed radial orbitals with variable parameters is applied to ab initio calculation of electronic transition probabilities from levels of the 4d 95p configuration of the CdIII ion. Relativistic corrections in the energy spectra are calculated within the framework of the Hartree-Fock-Pauli approximation, i.e., in the second order in the fine structure constant. The inclusion of correlation and relativistic corrections makes it possible to achieve a good coincidence of the values of electric dipole transition probabilities calculated with the use of two forms of the operator—the form of length and the form of velocity—for both strong and weak transitions. Using the transition probabilities obtained, radiative lifetimes of levels of the configuration indicated are determined. They are in a good agreement with the currently available experimental data.
