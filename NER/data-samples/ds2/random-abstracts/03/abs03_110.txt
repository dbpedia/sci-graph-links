Abstract Based on the evanescent-mode analysis, an insightful study of the channel potential is performed for the nanoscale ultra-thin body ultra-thin box SOI MOSFETs with a vertical Gaussian doping. And a two-dimensional (2D) analytical subthreshold current model is presented. The front and the back channel subthreshold currents are effectively derived using the inversion layer current density model which takes the Gaussian doping into account. The accuracy of the model has been verified by 2D numerical device simulations using Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) from Synopsys. The model provides a deep understanding and can be instrumental for the nanoscale ultra-thin body ultra-thin box SOI MOSFETs with a non-uniform doping profile operating in the subthreshold regime.
