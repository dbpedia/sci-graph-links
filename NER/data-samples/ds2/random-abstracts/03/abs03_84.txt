Abstract In this work three illustrative situations are reported of how quantum mechanics can be successfully employed to describe important properties of carbohydrates, a very large and versatile class of compounds found in nature. A proper quantified description of the main stereoelectronic effects that determine the behaviour of such molecules in the biological medium is offered by quantum mechanics better than any other theoretical approach. Such statement is supported by the conformational work discussed for disaccharides, by the rate coefficients found in aqueous solution for the glucose mutarotation process and still for the optical rotation values found for each conformer of glucose in aqueous solution.
