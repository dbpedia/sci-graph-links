Abstract Molecular modeling provides a way to correlate theoretical concepts with experimental data; therefore, we have introduced organic chemistry students to molecular modeling early in the first semester. This approach provides students with additional skills for clarifying chemical and theoretical concepts by means of demonstrations in the classroom and hands-on tutorial modules. In this manner the impact of the active-learning process is increased. In addition, this tool allows us to further enhance laboratory experiments already developed using a guided-inquiry approach and to design new experiments. Chemical concepts such as conformational analysis, stereochemistry, IR spectra, molecular and electronic properties, molecular orbitals, and chemical reactivity are emphasized through this approach.
