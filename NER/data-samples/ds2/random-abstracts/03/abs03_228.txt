Abstract In this paper some topics concerning the possibility of describing phenomena of quantum interference in terms of individual particle spacetime trajectories are reviewed. We focus our attention, on the one hand, on the recent experimental advances in neutron and photon interferometry and, on the other hand, on a theoretical analysis of the description of these experiments allowed by stochastic mechanics. It is argued that, even if no conclusive argument is yet at hand in both the theoretical and the experimental fields, the researches of the last 10 years now seem to favor Einstein's and de Broglie's realistic spacetime description and interpretation of quantum mechanics.
