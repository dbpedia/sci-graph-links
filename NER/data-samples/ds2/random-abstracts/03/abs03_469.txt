Abstract 1-phenyl-2H,6H-imidazo[1,5-c]quinazoline-3,5-dione reacts with ethyl bromoacetate under mild conditions to give 2-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-1-phenyl-6H-imidazo[1,5-c]quinazoline-3,5-dione (MEPIQ) and next 2,6-bis(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-1-phenylimidazo[1,5-c]quinazoline-3,5-dione (BEPIQ). The products were isolated at high yield and identified on the basis of IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR, UV spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Diester (BEPIQ) can be presented by 16 possible pair of enantiomers. Only one pair of them is the most stable and crystallizes which is shown crystallographic research. Based on quantum-mechanical modeling, with the use of DFT method, which conformers of mono- and diester and why they were formed was explained. It was calculated that 99.93% of the monoester (MEPIQ) is formed at position No. 2 and one pair of the monoester conformers, from six possible, has the largest share (51.63%). These results afforded to limit the number of diester conformers to eight. Unfortunately, the quantum-mechanical calculations performed that their shares are similar. Further quantum-mechanical modeling showed that conformers are able to undergo mutual transformations. As a result only one pair of diester conformers forms crystals. These conformers have substituents in trans position and these substituents are located parallel to imidazoquinazoline ring. This allows for the denser packing of the molecules in the unit cell.
