Abstract The autocatalytic Soai reaction gives abundant evidence of the enantioselective adsorption of organic compounds on a variety of crystals. Computational modelling can provide insight into mechanisms of enantioselectivity. Here, we use a combination of simulated annealing, forcefield, and quantum mechanical methods to examine interactions of pyrimidyl-5-carbaldehyde and 2-methylpyrimidyl-5-carbaldehyde with surfaces of Î³-glycine. Using binding energy results, we predict the exposure of the pro-stereogenic S face of pyrimidyl-5-carbaldehyde (~65%) and 2-methylpyrimidyl-5-carbaldehyde (>90%) on the (1 $$ \bar{1} $$ 0) and ($$ \bar{1} $$ 1 0) surfaces. The aim is to develop a robust computational methodology that can be applied to understanding crystal-biased asymmetric synthesis.
