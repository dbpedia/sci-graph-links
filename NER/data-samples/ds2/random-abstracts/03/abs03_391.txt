Summary. DFT calculations predict the existence of three new triplet ground state silylenes: [(imino)-methylene]silylene, [(cyanoimino)methylene]silylene, and [(methoxyimino)methylene]silylene, with CNSiX formula (X = H, CN, and OMe, respectively). Discrepancies are found between DFT and some ab initio results.
