Abstract The enzyme inhibitory activity of a new group of 2-substituted pyrimido[4,5-b][1,4]benzothiazines on soybean 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) was evaluated and compared with those of their 4-methyl analogs using ab initio calculations. The results of these studies showed that the lack of 4-methyl substituent in the pyrimido[4,5-b][1,4] benzothiazine molecules greatly reduces their 15-LO inhibitory activities.
