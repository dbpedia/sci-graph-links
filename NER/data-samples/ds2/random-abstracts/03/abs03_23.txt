Abstract In the study behavior of molecular electrostatic potential, averaged local ionization energy, and reaction electronic flux along the reaction coordinate of hydration process of three representative Ru(II) and Pt(II) complexes were explored using both post-HF and DFT quantum chemical approximations. Previously determined reaction mechanisms were explored by more detailed insight into changes of electronic properties using ωB97XD functional and MP2 method with 6–311++G(2df,2pd) basis set and CCSD/6–31(+)G(d,p) approach. The dependences of all examined properties on reaction coordinate give more detailed understanding of the hydration process. FigureThe ALIE and MEP changes during cisplatin hydration
