Abstract We describe the results of extensiveab initio molecular dynamics calculations of the properties of fullerenes and microtubules. Our finite temperature quantum MD simulations for solid C60 are in excellent agreement with NMR, photoemission and neutron scattering data. The C60 isomer containing two pairs of adjacent five-fold rings has a binding energy only 1.6 eV smaller than that of perfect C60, but the transformation between these two structures is hindered by a 5.4 eV barrier. It thus requires high temperatures and long annealing times. High temperatures are also needed for the transformation of the lowest energy C20 isomer, a dodecahedron, to a corannulene structure, which can be thought of as a fragment of C60. The corannulene structure is a natural precursor for the formation of C60. Simulations of reactions show that C2 can insert into C58, perfect C60, and defect C60 fullerenes without an activation barrier, while C3 attaches only to their surfaces. Evaporative fragmentation of carbon clusters during annealing is unlikely, but atom and fragment exchange during collision favor "locally" most stable structures, such as C60. These results may explain the large increase in the abundance of C60 and C70 when carbon clusters are annealed at high density. We have also carried out calculations for paradigmatic microtubules, both reflection-symmetric and chiral. We find that the optimized geometries of the tubules are close to the ideal ones. It is possible to fabricate tubules with direct band gaps away from the Î“ point by exploiting the similarities between the projected band structure of graphite and that of the tubule. The semiconducting tubules can be doped n- and p-type by substitutional N and B, respectively.
