Summary. Bioactive peptides represent an exciting area of research in the fields of biochemistry and medicine and in particular the VIP/PACAP network appears to be of interest. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a pleiotropic factor that exerts a physiological regulatory influence and is involved in the pathogenesis of several human disorders. In this paper we have reported structural characterization of VIP by experimental and computational methods as well as a comparative analysis of the peptide with its transglutaminase catalyzed analog VIP-Diaminopropane (VIP-DAP).
