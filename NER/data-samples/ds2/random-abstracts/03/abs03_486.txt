Abstract The adsorption of CO onto Ni-doped boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) was investigated using density functional theory at the B3LYP/LanL2DZ level of theory. The structures of the Ni-doped BNNTs and their CO-adsorbed configurations were obtained. It was found that the strength of adsorption of CO onto Ni-doped perfect BNNTs is higher than that on defective BNNTs. The electronic properties of all of the adsorption configurations of CO on Ni-doped BNNTs are reported. FigureThe optimized structures of CO adsorption on Ni-doped BNNTs
