Abstract Pressure broadening and shift coefficients of the T1 6P1/2-7P1/2, 3/2 two-photon line, perturbed by noble gases, are measured by Doppler-free two-photon absorption. The experimental results are compared with theoretical values estimated with the Lindholm approximation using C6 constants calculated as well from the Uns√∂ld formula as from fits to pseudopotentials.
