Abstract We use molecular dynamics simulation to examine the conformational possibilities in solution for the peptide MEHFPGP (Semax) representing the minimal nootropic fragment of MSH, and its versions with N-terminal substitutions of K, G, or R for M. We discuss the possible relationship between molecule structure and physiological activity, considering the influence of Coulomb interactions on the dynamics and the putative stabilization of a certain peptide conformation at pH < 6.
