Abstract The free radical scavenging activity of six 2â€²-hydroxychalcones has been studied in gas phase and solvents using the density functional theory (DFT) method. The three main working mechanisms, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), stepwise electron-transfer-proton-transfer (ET-PT) and sequential-proton-loss-electron-transfer (SPLET) have been considered. The O-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), ionization potential (IP), proton affinity (PA) and electron transfer energy (ETE) parameters have been computed in gas phase and solvents. The theoretical results confirmed the important role of the B ring in the antioxidant properties of hydroxychalcones. In addition, the calculated results matched well with experimental values. The results suggested that HAT would be the most favorable mechanism for explaining the radical-scavenging activity of hydroxychalcone in gas phase, whereas SPLET mechanism is thermodynamically preferred pathway in aqueous solution.
