Abstract B3LYP/6-31G(d) hybrid HF/DFT calculations were carried out to determine the structural and electronic properties of the endohedral complex of a C70 cage with tetrahedrane (C4H4). It was demonstrated that the formation of the complex is endothermic, with a destabilization energy of 72.56 kcal mol−1. C4H4 is seated in the center of the C70 cage and exists in molecular form inside the fullerene. C4H4 endohedral doping slightly perturbs the molecular orbitals of C70. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps, the electron affinity (EA), and the ionization potential (IP) indicate that C4H4@C70 is more chemically reactive than C70. The IR active modes and harmonic vibrational frequencies of C4H4@ C70 are also discussed.
