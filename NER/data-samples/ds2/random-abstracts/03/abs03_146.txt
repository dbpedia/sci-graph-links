Abstract Employing the STO-3G and 4–31 G basis sets within the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method the equilibrium structure of the CCl3 radical was calculated. The calculations predict the radical to be non-planar with both basis sets used. Using the UHF optimized geometries the SWXα calculations have been performed to calculate energy levels, ionization potentials and electron affinities of CCl3.
