Abstract A skew of a paper transferred by rubber rollers in printers is simulated by FEM software. Effects of an imbalance of preload, an imbalance distribution of coefficient of friction and a front tension on the paper skew are investigated and how to determine the skew direction are shown. A simulation model is composed of a feed roller, a preload roller and a paper. The feed roller is rotated forcibly by a certain degree at every calculation step and a deformation, displacement and strain of the paper and rollers are calculated. A series of calculation results is shown as a motion simulation. The results show that the paper skews to the smaller preload side, to the smaller coefficient of friction side, or to the opposite side of the front tension. Further, effects of a skew prevention guide plate is simulated.
