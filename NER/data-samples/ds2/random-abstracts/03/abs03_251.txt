Summary Theoretical molecular geometries of the perylene derivatives 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), N,N′-dimethyl 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (MePTCDI), and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic disulfide (PTCDS) are presented for the electronic statesS 0 andS 1. On this basis, the electronic absorption properties can be interpreted and compared with experimentel data. The vibronic structure ofS 0 →S 1 absorption andS 1 →S 0 fluorescence has been reproduced. The analysis of the active vibrational modes shows a corresponding behaviour of derivatives and perylene.
