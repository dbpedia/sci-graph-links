Abstract Eight H-bonded complexes between serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine) and water/hydrogen peroxide were studied at the B3LYP and HF levels of theory, using the 6-31+G(d) basis set. A thermodynamic analysis was performed in order to find the most stable complex. The calculated bonding parameters showed that the most stable H-bonded complex is formed between serotonin and hydrogen peroxide by means of the intermolecular H-bond –H2N...H–OOH.Fig. aTheoretical study of the hydrogen-bonded supersystems serotonin-water/hydrogen peroxide
