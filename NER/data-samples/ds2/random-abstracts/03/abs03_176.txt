Abstract Two dynamic models of muscle activation and deactivation based on the concepts of ion transport, reaction rates, and muscle mechanics are proposed. Storage release and uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and a two-step chemical reaction of calcium and troponin are included in the first model. This is a concise version of the complex chemical reactions of muscle activation and deactivation in sarcoplasm. The second model is similar to the first, but calcium-troponin reactions are simplified into two nonlinear rates functions. Due to these nonlinear dynamics, the second model can explain the catch-like enhancement of isometric force response. Simulation results which match experimental data are shown. Also, two new phenomena which need further experiment to verify are predicted by the second model.
