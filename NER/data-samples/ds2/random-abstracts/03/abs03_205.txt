Abstract Magic numbers in cluster mass spectra can be caused by either geometric or electronic structure. The study of metallic compound clusters allows the number of atoms and the number of electrons in clusters to be controlled independently. We report magic numbers in the mass spectra of Cs-compound clusters containing up to 700 free electrons.
