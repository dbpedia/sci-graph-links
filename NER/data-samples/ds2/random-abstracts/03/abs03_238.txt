Abstract The agglomeration properties of stereoisomeric 2-phenyl-3-(X’-pyridyl)propenoic acids (X=2, 3 or 4) were studied by the PM3 semiempirical quantum chemical method. Calculations revealed that dimers kept together by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions of the carboxylic groups could be built from both stereoisomers irrespective of the position of the nitrogen heteroatom. The dimers of the Z-isomers could also be built through (aromatic)C–H...N hydrogen bonds between the dimer units. The longest agglomerate was the pentamer of the dimers when the nitrogen was in the 2’ position. Longer hydrogen-bonded agglomerates than dimers could only be constructed from the E-isomer with the nitrogen in position 4’. Here, the trimer of the dimers proved to be the longest hydrogen-bonded entity and similarly to the Z-isomers, the dimer units are kept together by (aromatic)C–H...N intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
