Abstract Chemically speaking, atomic clusters are very rich, allowing their application in a broad range of technological areas such as developing functional materials, heterogeneous catalysis, and building optical devices. In this work, high level computational chemistry methods were used in a systematic manner to improve the characterization of small clusters formed by boron, silicon, germanium, mixed boron/silicon, and mixed boron/germanium. Calculations were carried out with both ab initio [MP2 and CCSD(T)] and density functional (B3LYP) methods with extended basis sets. The CCSD(T) results were then extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. Finally, geometrical parameters, vibrational frequencies, and relative energies were then obtained and compared to data presented in the literature.
