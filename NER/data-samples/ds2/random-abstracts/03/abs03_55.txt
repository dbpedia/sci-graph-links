Summary The C=O stretching frequencies of substituted 2-methylchromones (3a–3j), 2-formylchromones (4a–4j), 3-formylchromones (5a–5j) and 3-acetyl-2-methylchromones (6a–6i) were measured in CCl4 and CHCl3 and correlated with σ+ substituent constants. Using the results of the infrared spectral investigation and the theoretical calculations by the semiempirical AM1 method, the conformation and the transmission of electronic effects in compounds4–6 were studied. For the 2-substituted chromone system the transmission factory γ according to the definition of Charton was determined. The preparation of some new 2-methylchromones (3e–3j) and 3-(2,2-diformyl-chlorovinyl)-6-methylchromone (7) is also described.
