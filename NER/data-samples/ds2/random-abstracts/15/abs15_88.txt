Abstract This paper analyses the impact of size and age on small firms’ export behaviour. A review of the literature reveals that the extant conclusions are fragmented, inconclusive and limited in geographical scope. This study aims to address these limitations by analysing small, locally owned firms’ export behaviour from a novel location that has never been studied in the extant literature. The study draws on data from Jamaica, a small, open Caribbean economy. The statistical analysis revealed that size, not age, has a significant impact on export behaviour. Furthermore, other factors such as the owner’s previous international job experience and foreign travel experience also play an important role. These findings have implications for future research on the export behaviour of small firms, especially those from emerging environments. In addition, they provide export policy makers who are engaged in export stimulation among small, locally owned firms, with profile of firms that have a greater proclivity to export.
