Abstract Companies, which are committed to corporate sustainability, nevertheless often neglect a critical and systematic examination of their products and the social and ecological impacts along their productsâ€™ life cycles. However, in practice, diverse reasons exist to more intensively deal with product responsibility. Legislation, cost reductions, resource constraints, societal demands and moral concepts are analyzed as drivers of product responsibility and assessed according to their level of complexity. Simultaneously, the potential contributions of resulting measures for business success and sustainable development are derived. The analysis shows that the consideration of additional drivers may confront businesses with substantial challenges, however, can simultaneously also increase added value for the company and the corporate contribution to sustainable development.
