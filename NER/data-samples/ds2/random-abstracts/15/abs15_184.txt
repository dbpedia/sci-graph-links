Summary Today we are witnessing the necessity to align Business and Information Technology (IT) as well as a change in the role of IT from an enabler to an industrial sector in its own right. Based on the assumption that businesses in different sectors of the economy will require IT for different reasons and in different ways, this article introduces the EU project plugIT that aspires to develop an IT-Socket that will realize the vision of businesses "plugging-in" to IT. Three demonstration scenarios deal with: (1) "Certification" of IT infrastructure to stay compliant with regulations, (2) "Virtual Organisation" by evolving the current service orientation to a higher and more business driven abstraction as well as, (3) "Governance" of IT infrastructure introducing business context into highly distributed and complex systems. The IT-Socket follows a model-driven approach by introducing graphical modelling languages as mediators between the domain experts and IT. The research challenge is to link human interpretable graphical models – partly semi-formal – with machine interpretable semantic formalisms to enable: (1) a tighter involvement of domain experts when expressing formal knowledge specifying business requirements on IT infrastructure and services, (2) different graphical modelling languages for different views on the IT-Socket to provide modelling languages the domain expert is used to work with as well as, (3) a domain specific notation for semantics by integrating formal concepts of semantics with the graphic notation from modelling languages.
