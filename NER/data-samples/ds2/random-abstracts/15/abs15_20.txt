Abstract Training is an important component of human resource development and is emphasized in the Malaysian economic development process. The Malaysian Government has established the Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) managed by the Human Resource Development Limited (HRDL) to enhance and monitor the aspect of workers’ training. The HRDF has managed to increase the workers’ training activities; nevertheless, the issue raised here is to elucidate whether the training has adversely encouraged the workers’ mobility. This paper aims to analyze this issue based on 817 workers in a selected services sub-sector, namely, the information and communication technology (ICT) and the hotel sub-sector in the Klang Valley, Johor Bahru, and Penang, collected in the period of 2008/2009. The results show that the HRDL training has a positive and significant influence on workers’ mobility.
