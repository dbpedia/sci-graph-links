Abstract The study discussed in this article deals with the effects of strategic and value consensus on the performance of management teams in operating units at a large multinational company. The results showed that diversity of views on objectives, competitive methods, and values are positively related to objective measures of performance but negatively related to manager's own perceptions of their operating units' performance. This suggests that diversity of views may allow managerial employees to fulfill their responsibilities more effectively by improving their units' performance. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the concluding section of this article.
