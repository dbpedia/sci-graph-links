Abstract  This paper reviews the experience of the Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme (FAPAS®) in operating a proficiency testing scheme for the analysis of genetically modified (GM) food. Initial rounds of proficiency testing have shown a tendency for laboratories to over-estimate GM levels, results obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection methods to be significantly different and that data are skewed and not normally distributed until log-transformed. During the initial rounds, it was found that for analysis and quantification of GM material, it was not possible to assign a target value for standard deviation external to the round data, from which performance could be assessed. However, when working in a log scale, the internally derived, robust standard deviation (^σ) was found to be constant and could be used directly to predict a target value (σ) for performance assessment. Results from the first four rounds have provided valuable information and a general overview of laboratory ability. Choosing a target value for standard deviation which reflects current best practice has enabled laboratory performance to be assessed. Issues surrounding the assessment of performance are discussed which highlight some of the implications raised as a result of this initial assessment, regarding the enforcement of European labelling legislation.
