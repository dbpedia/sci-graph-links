Abstract The theorem of Hanani referred to in the title of this note states that, if a partially ordered set has cardinal not exceeding 1/2n(n+3) (n=1,2,...), then it can be expressed as the union ofn sets each of which is either a chain or an antichain. A corresponding result is now obtained for a set equipped with an arbitrary number of partial order relations.
