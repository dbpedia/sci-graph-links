Abstract The high esteem of German managers for the female Chinese staff in German–Chinese economic co-operations during a survey in Sino–German joint ventures in 1998 made us wonder in what ways female employees actually distinguish themselves from their male counterparts. Despite the high esteem, only very few women are working at the higher management levels. This article focuses on the situation of Chinese and German female managers in German invested enterprises in China and probes into the circumstances of their under-representation at the higher management levels by looking into individual and external factors posing as obstacles for career development.
