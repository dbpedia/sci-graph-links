Abstract This paper features the implementation of an extensive insider action research, exhaustively following the framework of Coghlan and Brannick (2010, 2014). It consisted of two action research projects - the thesis action research and the core action research - which were done in a parallel manner, both following the iterative cycles of constructing, planning, taking, and evaluating action. The thesis action research was aimed at developing a theory on building organizational identity from the viewpoint of an organizational founder. On the other hand, the core action research was focused on promoting the specific identity of the Institute for Integrality, Inc. Quality and rigor were observed in the implementation of the action research cycles. In the fieldwork, there were three main cycles undertaken – understanding organizational identity, fine-tuning the practice of this identity, and designing the integration of this identity in organizational culture. Thereafter, significant learnings were derived from meta-learning in the form of content, process, and premise reflections. Finally, through the critical reflection of the project in the light of the experience and theory, A-Founder’s Integrative Theory of Organizational Identity Building was derived.
