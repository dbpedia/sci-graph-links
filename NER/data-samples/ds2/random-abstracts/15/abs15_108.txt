Abstract This article updates and revitalizes the classical concept of organizational equilibrium. First, different equilibrium theories are compared based on a substantial literature review. Second, equilibrium is re-defined through the development of a model comprising 1. internal and 2. external equilibrium dimensions. The construction process and the factors that influence it are described.
