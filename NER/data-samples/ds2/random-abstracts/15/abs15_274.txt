Abstract We determine conditions under which a pure-strategy equilibrium of a mixed Bertrand–Edgeworth oligopoly exists. In addition, we determine its pure-strategy equilibrium whenever it exists and compare the equilibrium outcome with that of the standard Bertrand–Edgeworth oligopoly with only private firms.
