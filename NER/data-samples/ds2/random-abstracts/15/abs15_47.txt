Abstract This text summarizes the PhD thesis of Robert Boute, obtained at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) under supervision of Marc Lambrecht. This doctoral dissertation in the field of Supply Chain Management demonstrates that significant cost reductions can be obtained for both the retailer and the manufacturer when they align their replenishment policy. Such a collaboration strategy goes far beyond “information sharing”. In this summary, we present the research model, the general outline of the thesis and the methodology used. The PhD thesis, written in English, is available from the author upon request.
