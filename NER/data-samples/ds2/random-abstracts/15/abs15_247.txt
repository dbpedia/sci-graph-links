Abstract Accumulative evidence suggests that the implementation of international standard operating procedures, induce, by their virtues, major organizational changes. These changes are both cultural and behavioral including changes in decision-making processes, organizational norms, and values. The decision of any organization to adopt quality assurance, specifically via accreditation, should be regarded as a strategic one. As such, it prerequisites top management commitment, budgeting the process and promoting active inter-collaboration of all organizational members. The accreditation process according to ISO/IECÂ 17025:1999 of the Haifa Public Health Laboratory, will be used as a case study. A number of practical benefits of such organizational changes will be demonstrated and discussed, among them improved quality customer service and handling customer's complaints, establishing multichannel communication, enhanced interlaboratory collaboration and coordination. It is important to note that the accreditation process was accompaniment by extensive training of both management and employees on-site and off-site.
