Abstract This article analyzes six long-term labor-management cooperative relationships, based on lengthy field research, extensive, in-depth interviews with key labor and management officials, and the author's review and evaluation of labor agreements and other documents related to the individual relationships. Key internal and/or external events that helped energize the cooperative relationships are examined and important principles found to be necessary to maintain the relationships are identified and illustrated. Based on this research, conclusions are presented that suggest patterns that practitioners might implement to develop a more mutually beneficial and productive relationship.
