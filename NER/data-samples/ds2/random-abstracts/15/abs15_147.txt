Abstract Neutrino pair creation in bremsstrahlung processes of the type $$l \to l{\text{ }}v{\text{ }}\bar v$$ contains vital information on the number of lepton generations, and is catalyzed by the coherent nuclear Coulomb effect or other forms of intense fields. Of particular interest is the ratio $$R_{v\bar v} = \sigma [1\mathop \to \limits_A l(v\bar v)]/\sigma [1\mathop \to \limits_A l'(v\bar v)]$$ (wherel, lâ€² are distinct charged leptons). It is sensitive to the number of neurino types and their couplings in the same way that the ratio $$R_{q\bar q} = \sigma [e^ + e^ - \to {\text{hadrons}}]/\sigma [e^ + e^ - \to \mu ^ + \mu ^ - ]$$ is to those of quarks. In the Weinberg-Salam model withN lepton generations, the ratio $$R_{v\bar v}$$ is approximately given by $$[(N + 4) + 4(1 - 4\sin ^2 \theta _W )]/8$$ .
