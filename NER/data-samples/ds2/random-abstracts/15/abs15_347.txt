This article provides an overview of the ADA with a particular emphasis on employment issues under Title I of the Act affecting the rights and responsibilities of disabled employees and employers. Permitted and prohibited actions by employers are discussed, as well as factors used to determine the definition and application of key terms under the Act. Some potential impacts of the ADA on the interests of disabled individuals and employers are discussed. Recommendations for effective management policies to comply with the employment provisions of the ADA are also included.
