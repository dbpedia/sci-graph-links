Summary Comfronting strong output fluctuations, companies are in no position to adjust their labour volume instantly to the technically efficient level. Because of that, they may find themselves with an internal labour reserve at one moment, and be short of labour at another. This phenomenon is called ‘labour hoarding.’ In this article we propose a new method for the measurement of labour hoarding and apply it to the Dutch manufacturing industry. The results suggest that in the period 1972 to 1982, labour surpluses in that sector varied between five and fifteen percent of employment. Labour shortages appear to have been minor in the same period. Output uncertainty and real wage costs are supposed to be the main causes of the discrepancy between actual and technically efficient employment. Under this assumption an employment function is derived and fitted. The results are in accordance with the theoretical model on which the employment function was based.
