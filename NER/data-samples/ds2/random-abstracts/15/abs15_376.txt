Abstract Over the past ten years, Shanghai has experienced a period of industrial restructuring and the economic development. The proportion of tertiary industry output in Shanghai’s gross domestic production (GDP) is continuously rising. However, the rapid growth of tertiary industry has caused some adverse environmental effects, which, to a certain extent, have become the main reasons responsible for urban environmental deterioration and resident’s complaints of their ambient environment. Based on the current investigation on the wide variety of business pollution in Shanghai, this paper analyzes the major problems existing in the environmental management of the tertiary industry, and discusses the factors and methods of assessment, and the ways of management and control.
