Abstract We present a uniformization of Reeken’s macroscopic differentiability (see [5]), discuss its relations to uniform differentiability (see [6]) and classical continuous differentiability, prove the corresponding chain rule, Taylor’s theorem, mean value theorem, and inverse mapping theorem. An attempt to compare it with the observability (see [1, 4]) is made too.
