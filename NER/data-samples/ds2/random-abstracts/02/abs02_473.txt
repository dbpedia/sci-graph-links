Abstract Quarkonium spectral functions at finite temperature are studied, making use of a recently developed method of analyzing QCD sum rules by the maximum entropy method. This approach enables us to directly obtain the spectral function from the sum rules, without having to introduce any specific assumption about its functional form. QCD sum rules for heavy quarkonia incorporate finite temperature effects in form of changing values of the various gluonic condensates that appear in the operator product expansion. These changes depend on the energy density and pressure at finite temperature, which we extract from quenched lattice QCD calculations. As a result, it is found that the charmonium ground states of both S-wave and P-wave channels dissolve into the continuum already at temperatures around or slightly above the critical temperature T c , while the bottomonium states are less influenced by temperature effects, surviving up to about 2.5 T c or higher for S-wave and about 2.0 T c for P-wave states.
