Abstract For a number of important questions in VHE/UHE cosmic ray physics wide angle air Cerenkov detectors offer superior performance compared to scintillator arrays or air Cerenkov telescopes. On hand of the HEGRA air Cerenkov detector AIROBICC the general principle and performance will be discussed. Ideas and prospects for a detector with an energy threshold around 1 to 3 TeV will be presented.
