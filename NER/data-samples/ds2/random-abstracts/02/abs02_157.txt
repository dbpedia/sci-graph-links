Abstract We investigate the short-range correlations in light nuclei. The highly correlated many-body states are obtained with an explicitly correlated basis which enables us to get a precise solution of a many-body Schr√∂dinger equation for a realistic interaction. We show two-body density distributions for the different spin-isospin channels calculated from three- and four-body states to investigate the short-range correlations between nucleon pairs. At distances below 1 fm a universal behavior is found which does not depend on the many-body states. The universality is also seen in high momentum components of the two-body momentum distributions.
