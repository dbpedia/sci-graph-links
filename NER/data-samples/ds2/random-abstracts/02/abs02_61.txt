Abstract In this paper, the radial diffusion of energetic electrons in the Jovian radiation belts is considered. It is noted that the influence of global resonance in the electron radiation belts on the ring current provides original electrical pulses in the middle magnetosphere. The values of the random transfer of energetic electrons across the magnetic shells, which are associated with electrical pulses, are determined. An expression for radial diffusion is obtained. The functional form and radial diffusion coefficient are compared with those known from Jovian magnetosphere experimental data.
