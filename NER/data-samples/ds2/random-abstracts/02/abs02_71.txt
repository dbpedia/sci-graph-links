Abstract A prominent effect of ethanol is on rectal body temperature. The use of a rectal probe to measure temperature can be stressful to the subject, especially when used repeatedly. We now present data on the hypothermic effect of ethanol (0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 g/kg) on surface body temperature in rats as detected by infrared radiation. Ethanol produced significant decreases in nasal temperature that were significantly correlated with changes in rectal temperature. Ethanol (3.5 g/kg) also produced a significant reversal in nasal hypothermia 15 min postinjection that was detected only with the infrared method. This new method is very rapid, accurate, requires minimal handling and may, therefore, be less stressful than rectal measurement to the subject.
