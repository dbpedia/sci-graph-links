Summary We examine the stability of the extra-dimensional compactified spaces necessary for,e.g., the string theory. The analysis of a simplified model indicates that these spaces collapse classically and quantum-mechanically. To resolve this serious problem, we propose a new Planckian-scale physics which suggests the non-commutative nature of the space-time.
