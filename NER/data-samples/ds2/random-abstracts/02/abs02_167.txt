Summary A calculation of the magnetic susceptibility of a coupled local (d) electron spin-itinerant (s) electron spin system is presented. The frequency and wave-vector-dependent susceptibility are derived using the generalized self-consistent field method. This method is quite suitable for the study of the present problem when used in conjunction with the Schrieffer-Wolff alternative form of Anderson’s Hamiltonian. A comparison with Hasegawa’s phenomenological theory, as well as a brief discussion on the origin of spin diffusion terms is given.
