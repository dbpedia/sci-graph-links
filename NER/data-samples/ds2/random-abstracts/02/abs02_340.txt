Abstract It is shown that, under certain conditions, two inhomogeneous s-polarized electromagnetic waves can be simultaneously excited in a nonlinear dipole monolayer. These waves propagate along the monolayer at the same phase velocity and exponentially decay with increasing distance from this layer in both directions.
