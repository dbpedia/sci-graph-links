Abstract Newly in vitro excysted tapeworms ofHymenolepis diminuta (Cestoda, Cyclophyllidea), 1- to 3-day-old worms and destrobilated worms from rat intestines were investigated by means of light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the scolex of 1- and 2-day-old worms had shallow suckers with smooth brims, while 3-day-old and older worms, including destrobilated worms, had deep suckers with puckered brims. The posterior end of 1- and 2-day-old worms had a central cone-shaped structure not present in 3-day-old and older, or destrobilated worms. The repairing of the posterior end and the protonephridial system after excystation or destrobilation was much the same. Tissue remnants moved into the centre of the posterior end, resulting in an indentation with a pore to the exterior. The indentation and its pore became connected to the emptying canals of the protonephridial system, i.e. they developed into the excretory bladder and pore respectively.
