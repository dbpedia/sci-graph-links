Summary Peculiar features of the recent global analyses of data on the nucleon electromagnetic structure are discussed in detail in order to reconsider the reliability of the predicted result that the electron-positron annihilation into a neutron-antineutron cross-section is considerably larger than the cross-section of the electron-positron annihilation into a proton-antiproton pair.
