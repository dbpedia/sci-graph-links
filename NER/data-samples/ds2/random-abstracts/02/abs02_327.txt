Abstract S-(+)-carvone (C10H14O, 5-isopropenyl-2-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one) and R-(+)-limonene (C10H16, 4-isopropenyl-1-methylcyclohexene) have been characterized in the gas phase using a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer coupled to a supersonic molecular beam. Two conformers—with the isopropenyl group in the equatorial position—have been detected for each compound and described by a set of molecular parameters including the principal rotational constants and the quartic centrifugal distortion parameters. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that a third conformer might not be observed due to relaxation processes in the jet. The gas phase results are compared with the liquid phase IR-Raman-VCD spectra.
