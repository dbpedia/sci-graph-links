Abstract The Wilcox Solar Observatory at Stanford University houses one of the International Research on the Interior of the Sun (IRIS) network observing stations. The instrument has observed the global oscillations of the Sun continually since it was installed in August 1987. Each site and instrument are different; here we report the details unique to the Stanford site.
