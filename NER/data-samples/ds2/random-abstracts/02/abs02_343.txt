Abstract We study quantitatively a model for the EMC effect. Here theA dependence of structure functions is computed using the evolution equations. The model has been tested by computing both the structure function and the EMC ratio. TheQ 2 andA dependence of the ratio, reported recently, are explained. However at lowx an extra intrinsic component to the nuclear structure function is indicated. The model also implies anA dependent QCD scale parameter Î›, which seems to be borne out by the data.
