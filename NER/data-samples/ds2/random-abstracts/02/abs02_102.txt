Abstract. Optimal-control-based numerical algorithms make it possible to explore the physical limits of dynamic nuclear polarization. Examples of time-optimal and relaxation-optimized electron–nuclear polarization transfer experiments are presented for simple model systems consisting of an isolated electron–nuclear spin pair in the absence and presence of relaxation. The optimized pulse sequences are compared with conventional transfer schemes, such as electron–nuclear cross polarization and selective population inversion.
