Abstract In [1, 2] it was demonstrated that the total cross section of the scattering of two light particles (zero modes of the Kaluza-Klein tower) in the six-dimensional λφ 4 model differs significantly from the cross section of the same process in the conventional λφ 4 theory in four space-time dimensions even for the energies below the threshold of the first heavy particle. In the present article the analytical structure of the cross section in the same model with torus compactification for arbitrary radii of the two-dimensional torus is studied. Also, further amplification of the total cross section due to interaction of the scalar field with constant background Abelian gauge potential in the space of extra dimensions is shown.
