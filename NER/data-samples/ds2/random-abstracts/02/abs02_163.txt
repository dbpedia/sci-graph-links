Abstract The formation, the binding energy and the structure of biexcitons and triexcitons in a strong magnetic field are studied within the method of hyperspherical harmonics. The magnetic field confines the excitons in quantum dots and results in formation of Wigner-crystal-like states of 4- and 6-particles.
