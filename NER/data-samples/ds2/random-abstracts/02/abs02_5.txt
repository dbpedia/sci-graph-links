Abstract Diffusion and interaction have been examined in the deposition of titanium on chromium disilicide as affected by substrate temperature. Electron Auger spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and titanium-film etching have been used along with data on the resistance changes in the CrSi2 films to establish that diffusion and solid-state reaction occur during the deposition of titanium on chromium disilicide, with the processes very much dependent on the substrate temperature. The results enable one to optimize the technology of making multilayer thin-film structures.
