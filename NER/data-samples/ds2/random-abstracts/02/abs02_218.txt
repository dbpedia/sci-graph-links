Abstract Here, the role played by Lagrangian points and the Oort clouds of planets in the evolution and structure of the Solar System has been discussed. It is revealed that the Lagrangian points are not mere isolated points in space associated with the orbit of a planet at which the resultant gravitational force of the system of three bodies is zero as thought previously to be, but their existence has much deeper physical significance as regards the origin of the Solar System and those of satellite systems of planets.
