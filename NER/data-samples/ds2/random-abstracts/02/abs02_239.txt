Abstract We verify the causality principle for the relativistic theory of gravity in the linear approximation. We show that the contribution of weak gravitational waves is considerably less than the contributions of the static part of the solution and the cosmological background. Therefore, the presence of weak gravitational waves does not violate the causality principle for the relativistic theory of gravity.
