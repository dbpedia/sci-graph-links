Abstract We study Drell-Yan process in proton–proton collisions through the exchange of vector mesons using the holographic hard wall model to describe the dynamics and interactions of vector mesons and baryons. We estimate the angular parameters λ, μ, ν of the produced dileptons in a region of $${q_{T}^2 << Q^{2}}$$, where the effective coupling of perturbative QCD is large due to logarithm corrections.
