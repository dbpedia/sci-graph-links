Abstract Femtosecond (fs) laser pulses at variable delay times allowed us to track the fast non-radiative transitions between the manifold of highly excited $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}}^{**}$ states to the lower lying fluorescent $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}}^{*}$ state in CaF2. Two distinct $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}}^{**}$ states of the manifold at 3.16 eV ($\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}2}^{**}$) and 4.73 eV ($\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}3}^{**}$) were populated using the second (SH) and third harmonics (TH) of fs laser light at 785 nm. The population kinetics of the fluorescent $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}}^{*}$ state in the 2 eV excitation energy range was revealed by depleting its fluorescence centered at 740 nm using fundamental near infrared (NIR) fs laser pulses. The related time constants for $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}2,3}^{**}{\sim}{>} \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{Na}}^{*}$ relaxation amounted to 1.0±0.14 ps and 3.0±0.3 ps upon SH and TH excitation, respectively.
