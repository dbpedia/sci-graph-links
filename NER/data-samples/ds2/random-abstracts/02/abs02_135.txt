Abstract A method of classifying quark operators in QCD sum rules is suggested. The expansion coefficients of all thed≦8 bilinear quark condensates in gluon condensates are calculated. The coefficient functions at the gluon operators withd≦8 in the polarization operator ∏(q 2) of the light-quark vector current are obtained. A comparison is performed with the calculations in the covariantly constant fields and self-dual fields. The results obtained can be used in the sum rules for the ρ, ω and ϕ families.
