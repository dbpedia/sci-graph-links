Abstract This work manifests the use of microstructures made in Apex™ photosensitive glass for in-plane investigation of microfluidic systems by demonstrating the ability to detect chemical fluids through etched glass sidewalls. Absorption spectra of liquid ethanol in the near infrared (NIR) region and Raman spectroscopy of dimethyl sulfoxide in microcuvettes made in Apex™ photosensitive glass demonstrate the high potential of photosensitive glass processing in microfluidic applications in which stacks of microfluidic systems are analyzed from the sidewalls. This eliminates the need for non-planar observation of microfluidic systems.
