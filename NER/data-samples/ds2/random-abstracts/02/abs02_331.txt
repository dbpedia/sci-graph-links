Summary The dynamics of strong binding of heavy scalar particles (quarks) are discussed with the help of the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a smooth ladder-type kernel. For this purpose, the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes are expanded intoO 4 spherical functions and the remaining « hyper-radial » equation is solved by a variational method. These calculations are considered as a model of mesons as bound states of heavy quarks. The low-lying mesons form linear trajectories with a slope of 1 (GeV)−2. The modification of the vector-meson dominance form factor by the bound-state wave functions is calculated and found to be in good agreement with experiment.
