Abstract The calculation of the resonance frequencies from experimental cross-sectional areas of a vocal tract under the assumption that its walls are perfectly rigid provides values that noticeably differ from the measured resonance frequencies. The compliance of the walls affects the first resonance and almost does not affect the higher-order resonances. The presence of branching in the tract at the level of the larynx affects the second and third resonances stronger than the first resonance. The parameters of the wall impedance (the loss, mass, and elasticity) and the length and cross-sectional area of the branchings are determined by minimizing the rms discrepancy between the measured and calculated resonance frequencies. The error in the frequency calculation with allowance for the wall compliance and branching in the tract proves to be within the accuracy of the formant estimation.
