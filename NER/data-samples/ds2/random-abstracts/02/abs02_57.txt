Abstract The conductivity of two-dimensional electron systems with low carrier concentration is considered on the basis of the previously suggested model (Fermi liquid with a soft mode) under the assumption that the equilibrium in each of the (fermion and boson) subsystems is established faster than the impurity relaxation and the relaxation between the subsystems (hydrodynamic approximation). The conductivity of the system depends on three characteristic times: τ1(τ2) is determined by the fermion (boson) impurity scattering and τ12 is determined by the friction between the subsystems; the respective temperature dependences are obtained. The conductivity is related to the relaxation time τ in the usual way, and τ obeys the relationship τ−1=τ 1−1+(τ2+τ12)−1. It follows from the results obtained that the resistivity of pure samples should increase with temperature and tend towards saturation.
