Abstract We study the (2+1) dimensional BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) rotating Black Hole. Along with the scalar field it obeys the Klein-Gordon equation of motion. We use the dragging coordinate system to isolate the râ€“t sector from the metric. By considering the massless particle and scalar field, we calculate the corrected Hawking temperature with the help of tunneling method.
