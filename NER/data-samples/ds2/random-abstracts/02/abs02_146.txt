Abstract Making use of currently available theory of wave absorption, an attempt has been made to estimate the refractive indices and absorption coefficients for different wave frequencies during day and night times in the Jovian ionosphere. The results obtained have striking similarity with the corresponding results in the case of the Earth's ionosphere. It is concluded that VLF signals can be observed more easily during night times.
