Abstract The effect a generalZ→3γ vertex in the reactione + e −→3γ is studied with a particular attention to LEP searches. We give exact analytical expressions including realistic cuts for the signal and present a detailed analysis based on a Monte Carlo that includes the effect of the irreducible 3γ QED cross section. As special applications we discuss the effect of heavy scalars, fermions and gauge bosons.
