Abstract 6-Nitroazolopyrimidines react with the acetonyl anion to give 6-nitro-7-acetonyl-4,7-dihydroazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines. The reactivity of this class of compounds with respect to charged and uncharged nucleophiles is determined by their aromatic character and the deficit of electron density in the pyrimidine ring, while the direction of attack is determined by the overall charge on fragments of the valence-bonded atoms.
