Summary In a former work, by means of a stochastic method we obtained a set of two kinetic equations governing, in the first order, the interaction of an electron plasma with a strong electromagnetic wave. The solution of this set of equations leads to the computation of the friction and diffusion terms of the evolution equation for the one-particle distribution function. This evolution equation turns into the BalescuLenard equation when the external field is set equal to zero.
