Abstract We report the results of our calculation of γ(r), the radially dependent antishielding factor of Sc3+ ion in the crytalline environment. Watson sphere model is used to approximately represent the crystal potential. Differential equations resulting from non-orthogonal Hartree-Fock perturbation theory are solved to obtain perturbations to core electron states. Contribution to γ(r) from electron self-consistency effect has been evaluated by using the latter wave-functions in the many-body expression of Schmidtet al.
