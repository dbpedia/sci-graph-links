Abstract The vibrational representation is expanded in terms of irreducible representations at the principal symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Selection rules are found for single-phonon IR absorption, Raman scattering, and Mandel'shtam-Brillouin scattering of light. In IR absorption, a single frequency is active for light polarized parallel to the sixth order axis and a single frequency for perpendicular polarization. Five frequencies are active in Raman scattering of light. Expansions of the direct product of irreducible representations (selection rules) are found.
