Abstract Here, we report on impulsive solar radio bursts observed for the first time with high time/spectral resolution in the range 18 to 23 GHz. Using observational parameters and assuming nonthermal gyrosynchrotron emission from energetic electrons in a loop structure, we have estimated the density of nonthermal electrons, magnetic field, and dimension of the source along the line of sight.
