Abstract We consider the scalar form factor inτ →K πν τ decays. It receives contributions both from the scalar resonanceK*0(1430) and from the scalar projection of off-shell vector resonances. We construct a model for the hadronic current which includes the vector resonancesK*(892) andK*(1410) and the scalar resonanceK*0(1430). The parameters of the model are fixed by matching to theO(p 4) predictions of chiral perturbation theory. Suitable angular correlations of theKπ system allow for a model independent separation of the vector and scalar form factor. Numerical results for the relevant structure functions are presented.
