Abstract The thermal contribution to nonlinear optical activity in a BSO crystal was studied at 514.5 nm. The results show that the effect is only weakly dependent on laser intensity for constant beam power. By varying the laser spot size in the sample the electronic and thermal contributions to nonlinear optical activity may be separated.
