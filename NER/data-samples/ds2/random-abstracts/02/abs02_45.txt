Abstract This paper presents a numerical study on the frictional contact between two crossed fibers subject to both normal and tangential oscillation. The results from simulation using the method of dimensionality reduction show that the frictional energy dissipation increases firstly with coefficient of friction, and then almost symmetrically decreases to a constant. The fiber aspect ratio has an important effect on the energy dissipation and this effect becomes more significant for larger coefficient of friction. The simulation results for very large coefficient of friction show a good agreement with the analytical solution for the case of infinite coefficient of friction.
