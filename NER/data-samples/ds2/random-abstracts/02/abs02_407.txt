Abstract Atomic force microscopy-based single virus particle force spectroscopy was developed using dielectrophoresis for fixing virions at the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe. Electron microscopic visualization was found to be necessary to prove the deposition of virus particles on the tip of the AFM probe, while fixation of single virions by incubating the tip with a virus suspension proved impossible. Force spectroscopy measurements were performed for the vaccinia virus, influenza virus, and bacteriophage AP22. ForceReader special software was designed for analyzing the forceâ€“distance curves.
