Summary The determination of the safe temperature increase in the rails of a continuously welded track, to prevent lateral buckling is presented. The criterion used is based on the post-buckling equilibrium branches of the track. The range of safe temperature increases is defined asT 0<T L , whereT L is the smallest value of the temperature rise at which a deformed state of equilibrium (thus, a buckled state) becomes possible. The post-buckling equilibrium states are determined analytically. To obtain a consistent formulation of the problem use is made of the principle of virtual displacements and the variational calculus for variable matching points. The obtained formulations are nonlinear, but can be solved exactly. Solutions are presented for four buckled configurations. The results are presented graphically for a typical railroad track presently in use on main lines. The obtained results are compared with the corresponding results of other investigators.
