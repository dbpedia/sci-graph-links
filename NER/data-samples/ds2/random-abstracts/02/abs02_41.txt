Abstract In the semi-classical regime we study the resonances of the operatorP t =h 2Δ+V+t·δV in some small neighborhood of the first spectral band ofP 0. HereV is a periodic potential, δV a compactly supported potential andt a small coupling constant. We construct a meromorphic multivalued continuation of the resolvent ofP t , and define the resonances to be the poles of this continuation. We compute these resonances and study the way they turn into eigenvalues whent crosses a certain threshold.
