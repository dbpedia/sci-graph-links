Abstract An eventual theory of auroral arcs must explain the source(s) of their distinct yet variable spatial structure, the electron acceleration within them, and the enhanced energy flux they carry. This paper reviews ideal, inertial, and stationary Alfvén waves, emphasizing physical descriptions of their properties, and comments on their potential roles in explaining key properties of auroral arcs. Particular attention is given to the recent theory of inertial stationary Alfvén waves, which can produce steady-state electron acceleration within multiple parallel sheets, reminiscent of the conditions necessary for the production of multiple auroral arcs.
