Abstract We report from a study of the elastic electromagnetic and axial form factors of all lowest baryon states with flavors up, down, and strange along relativistic constituent-quark models. We consider the baryons as relativistic bound states of three constituent quarks and solve the eigenvalue problem of the invariant mass operator. The corresponding eigenstates are employed to calculate manifestly covariant form factors within the point form of Poincaré-invariant quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic and axial current operators are constructed along the spectator model in point-form relativistic dynamics. We have thus obtained covariant predictions for the electroweak form factors, for momentum transfers up to Q 2 ~ 4 GeV2, as well as the electric radii, magnetic moments, and axial charges. The theoretical results in general agree very well with existing phenomenological data. In cases, where no experimental information is yet available, the results are well compatible with data from lattice quantum chromodynamics.
