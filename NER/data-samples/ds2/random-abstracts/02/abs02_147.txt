Modification of the transmission spectrum and wave field distribution in a one-dimensional photonic crystal with single or double defect of inversion type is investigated. It is demonstrated that in the presence of the defect, a narrow transmission miniband is formed in the non-transmission band gap of the defectless crystal. In this case, the field is strongly localized in the defect region depending on the defect type, its position, and the number of complete periods in the structure. The formation of the double defect of inversion type leads to the formation of two defect minibands in the spectrum and the redistribution of the wave field in the structure.
