We derive the asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic field on the surface of a layered Earth allowing for the effect of the ionosphere. The analysis of the fields enables us to estimate the distance over which the ionosphere has a substantial effect. We show that the ratio of the tangential field components is independent of the effect of the ionosphere.
