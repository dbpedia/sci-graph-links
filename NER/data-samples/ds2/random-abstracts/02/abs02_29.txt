Abstract The ultrasound experiments in superfluid 3He are practically stopped now while a lot of very interesting features of the collective mode (CM) spectrum still remain unexplored by experiment. We analyze the cause of this situation and discuss some old and new effects in CM in superfliud 3He which should be studied experimentally. The purpose of this paper is to call experimentalists to renew the ultrasound experiments in superfluid 3He.
