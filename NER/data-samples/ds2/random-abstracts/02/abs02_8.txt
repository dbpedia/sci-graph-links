Abstract â€‚Various kinds of precipitates can influence the mechanical properties of Ti-stabilized steels. The qualitative composition of the Ti inclusions can be characterized microscopically, whereas for quantitative information to be obtained time-consuming selective dissolution must be used. The present study aims at chemical speciation of the isolated precipitates as a solid phase with the help of soft-X-ray spectrometry. Whether the method is capable of giving both qualitative and quantitative information on the composition of Ti-mixtures is discussed. The precipitates in Ti-stabilized steels are investigated after chemical dissolution of the steel matrix with a bromine/methanol mixture (1:10). By combination of soft-X-ray spectrometry with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) both qualitative and quantitative characterization of the precipitates can be performed. They were found to consist mainly of TiC and TiN.
