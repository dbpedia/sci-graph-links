Abstract We investigated the quantum entanglement in spin-1 Heisenberg XY chain for two-spin-qutrit and multi-particle systems. As a measure of the entanglement, the negativity of this state was analyzed as a function of the temperature and the magnetic field. We gave some numerical results and discussed them in detail. We found that the negativity increases monotonously with the coupling constants |J 1| and |J 2|, and it showed a symmetry with respect to the point of J 1 = 0 and J 2 = 0. In addition to the above features, there is evidence that the critical temperature is independent of the length of the chain.
