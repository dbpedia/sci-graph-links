Abstract The operation of a membrane capacitive pressure transducer with electrostatic compensation of the membrane deformation has been mathematically simulated. It is shown that the theory describing these instruments is incorrect and the error in measuring pressure by them may be as high as 25â€“29% of the measured value, which makes them inappropriate for use in pressure metrology.
