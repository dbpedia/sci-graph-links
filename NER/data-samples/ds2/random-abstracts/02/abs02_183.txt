Abstract Temperature-dependent emission spectra and fluorescence dynamics profiles have been investigated in Pr3+:Y4Al2O9 crystals in order to better understand the processes responsible for quenching of the praseodymium 3P0 emissions. The cross-relaxation transfer rates were experimentally determined as a function of temperature. Using the rate equations formalism, the dynamics of the observed emissions were modeled. Basing on comparison between the measured and calculated decays, the energy transfer rates between Pr3+ ions were evaluated. The role of the backward process in explanation of the complicated character of 3P0 decays and its temperature dependence, especially its unexpectedly slow decaying component, were established.
