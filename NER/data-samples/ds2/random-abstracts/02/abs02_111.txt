Abstract The zero-energy universal properties of scattering between a particle and a dimer that involves an identical particle are investigated for arbitrary scattering angular momenta. For this purpose, we derive an integral equation that generalises the Skorniakovâ€“Ter-Martirosian equation to the case of non-zero angular momentum. As the mass ratio between the particles is varied, we find various scattering resonances that can be attributed to the appearance of universal trimers and Efimov trimers at the collisional threshold.
