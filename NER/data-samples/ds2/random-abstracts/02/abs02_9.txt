Abstract Opportunities of the use of an XMD-300 diffractometer in three mapping schemes have been considered, namely, grazing primary beam, grazing diffracted beam, and the θ-2θ scheme, for the study of crystal perfection of semiconductor heterostructures (silicon-on-sapphire, silicon-on-insulator, ion-doped silica layers, and AlGaN/GaN/Si structures). It has been shown that the measurements with the use of three schemes in scattered radiation and in the exact performance of Bragg diffraction condition enable one to obtain a fringe pattern of diffraction simultaneously from crystal lattices of several layers of the heterostructure and interference peaks of maximum intensity for each individual layer.
