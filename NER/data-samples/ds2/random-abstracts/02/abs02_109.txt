Abstract It is shown experimentally that the exciton luminescence λ=172 nm) quantum yield excited by excess electrons drifting through solid xenon at 77 K in fields of 10 kV/cm amounts to 20±5 per electron and that luminescence takes place during the entire drift process. A CW bulky discharge through solid xenon (with a current up to 20 A/cm2) is realized, and intense visible luminescence due to excitation of impurities by electron impacts is observed. The prospects for using solid rare gases as matrices for studying processes in low-temperature plasmas and for creating effective electric energy converters in the vacuum ultraviolet range are discussed.
