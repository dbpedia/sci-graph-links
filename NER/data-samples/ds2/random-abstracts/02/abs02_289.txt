Abstract Preliminary resuts of interferometric observations of 4C 21.53 and PSR 1937+214 at 25 and 20 MHz are presented. The observations were obtained using the URAN-1 and URAN-2 interferometers, with baselines of 42.4 and 152.3 km. In addition to the pulsar radiation, which provides about 70% of the total flux of the object, radio emission from extended components with dimensions of several tens arcseconds has been detected for the first time. The angular size of the pulsar is 3″ at 25 MHz and 4″.8 at 20 MHz. The pulsar’s low-frequency spectrum deviates appreciably from the power law derived at higher frequencies.
