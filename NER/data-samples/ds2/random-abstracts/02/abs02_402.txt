Abstract The energy dependence of the alignment of42Mo,47AgL 3 shell and79Au,90ThM 3 shell following impact ionization by ions with atomic numberZ 1=2 (helium) toZ 1=18 (argon) was studied with a 5 in Johansson crystal spectrometer analyzing the degree of X-ray polarization. Experimental information about the amount of multiple ionization was obtained. The observed small negative alignment is concerned to be due to dealignment by couplings between the created vacancies. Large positive values of the alignment parameter as previously reported for the79AuL 3 shell is slow heavy ion collisions were not observed.
