Abstract The radiation force on a three-level atom exerted by two laser fields is calculated semiclassically. If the system is spatially confined by a harmonic potential one or more stable orbits can be found for certain conditions (frequencies, field strengths). As a consequence, variation of the laser frequencies leads to hysteresis effects.
