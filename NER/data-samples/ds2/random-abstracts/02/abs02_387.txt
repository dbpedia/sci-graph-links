Abstract Data from ACE and GOES have been used to measure Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) fluence spectra for H, He, O, and Fe, over the period from October 1997 to December 2005. The measurements were made by four instruments on ACE and the EPS sensor on three GOES satellites and extend in energy from ∼0.1 MeV/nuc to ∼100 MeV/nuc. Fluence spectra for each species were fit by conventional forms and used to investigate how the intensities, composition, and spectral shapes vary from year to year.
