Summary The particle-particle angular-correlation method is applied to the reaction12C(6Li, d)16O→α+12C. Deuterons were detected at Φ1=0°. Spin and parity of some highly excited16O states are deduced. Analysis of the correlation patterns indicates that a direct transfer is a dominant mechanism. The angular correlation corresponding to the16O21.8→α+12C4.43 is specially analysed and interference effects due to the differentl values involved in the decay are discussed.
