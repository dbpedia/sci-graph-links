Abstract Basic mechanisms of the hydrodynamic shock wave formation in the solar atmosphere during flares are considered. Hydrodynamic plasma flows during flares arise due to fast energy release which is accumulated in the magnetic field of currents in the solar atmosphere. Shock waves arise as a result of rapid heating of the chromospheric upper layers from accelerated particles or heat fluxes. Powerful hydrodynamic phenomena can also arise due to explosive current sheet disruption in the region of strong magnetic field reconnection. Fundamental questions of shock wave formation and propagation in a non-homogeneous emitting solar atmosphere are discussed.
