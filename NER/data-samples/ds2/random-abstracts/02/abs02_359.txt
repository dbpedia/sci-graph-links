Abstract Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a rapidly developing non-invasive imaging method that can depict the biliopancreatic ducts. Compared to direct methods such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP is not painful, does not require contrast media, and its success does not depend, to any great extent, on the operator's skill. It uses three-dimensional data sets for projection images, as well as arbitrary cross-sectional iamges. Faster data acquisition techniques are expanding its indications as a diagnostic tool. MRCP is undoubtedly the method of choice when ERCP is contraindicated or fails. Imaging after the injection of secretin improves pancreatic duct delineation, and may also add functional information to MRCP. Adequate diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, and mucinous ductal ectasia may also be feasible. Further development and optimization of MRCP will substantially limit the indications for diagnostic endoscopic pancreatography.
