Abstract Two metastable states of a multilayer Ge/p-Ge1−x Six heterosystem with wide (∼ 35 nm) potential wells (Ge) are observed in strong magnetic fields B at low temperatures. In the first state, the Hall resistivity exhibits an inflection near the value ρxy=h/e 2 scaled to one Ge layer. The longitudinal magnetoresistivity ρxx(B) possesses a minimum in the range of fields where this inflection occurs. The temperature evolution of the inflection in ρxy(B), the minimum of ρ xx(B), and the value of ρxy at the inflection indicates a weakly expressed state of the quantum Hall effect with a uniform current distribution over the layers. In the second metastable state, an unusually wide plateau near h/2e 2 with a very weak field dependence is observed in ρxy(B). Estimates show that in these samples the Fermi level lies below but close to the top of the inflection in the bottom of the well. For this reason, the second state can be explained by separation of a hole gas in the Ge layers into two sublayers, and the saturation of ρxy(B) near h/2e 2 can be explained by the formation of a quantum Hall insulator state.
