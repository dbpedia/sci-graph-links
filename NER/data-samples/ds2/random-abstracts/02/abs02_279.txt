Abstract Magnetic structure of Pr6Fe13Ge at room temperature has been investigated by magnetic measurement, MÃ¶ssbauer effect and neutron diffraction. Magnetic atoms are closely packed up and down the mirror planes atz = 0 and 1/2 and separated by the non-magnetic atoms located on the planes atz= 1/4 and 3/4, which constructs an M/NM/M sandwich structure (M: magnetic, NM: non-magnetic). The intralayer magnetic moments couple ferromagnetically and are out ofab plane at a small angle so as to form a component alongc-axis. The interlayer coupling is antiferromagnetic for theab component while ferromagnetic for thec component.
