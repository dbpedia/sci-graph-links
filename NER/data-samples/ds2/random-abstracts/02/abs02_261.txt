Abstract We present high and low dispersion UV spectra of HDE 245770, which is the optical counterpart of the recurrent transient X-ray pulsar A 0535+26,during a decay of an X-ray flare. UBV photometric measurements and medium dispersion optical spectra were simultaneously obtained. The energy distribution of the star in the 12 â€“ 10 micron range is compared with the models of Kurucz and Poeckert and Marlborough. In this phase, HDE 245770 does not show evaluable variations with respect to the quiescent X-ray phase.
