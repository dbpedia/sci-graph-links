Abstract It has been recently shown that the resonances among the mean motions of an asteroid, Jupiter and Saturn are very important for the origin of chaos in the asteroid belt. We develop an analytic model for these three-body resonances which allows quantitative predictions on their amplitude and libration timescale. We also discuss why these resonances are chaotic.
