Abstract As an application of our extensive calculations of energies and intensities of atomic lines in very intense magnetic fields of the order of 1011-1013 G we discuss the possibility of observing magnetically strongly shifted iron lines in the spectra of pulsating X-ray sources. Careful estimates of the relevant parameters lead us to the conclusion that it would be profitable to look for magnetically shifted iron line enission in magnetic neutron stars of low luminosity using spectrometers working in the energy range 10 – 100 keV with sensitivities of 10−4 cm−2 s−1 and energy resolutions E/ΔE ∼ 10 – 100.
