Summary Dynamical aspects associated with the binary dissipative collisions induced by heavy ions at intermediate energies are reviewed. A particular attention is paid to the mid-rapidity emission which is proved to enlight the reaction mechanism. Recent experimental data obtained by the INDRA and DEMON Collaborations as well as new Landau-Vlasov calculations are presented. Consequences on the energy dissipation, on the excitation energy sharing between the partners and on the temperature of the equilibrated fragments are discussed.
