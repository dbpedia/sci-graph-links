Abstract An analytic expression of the two-frequency mutual coherence function (MCF) was derived for a two-dimensional random rough surface. The scattered field was calculated by the Kirchhoff approximation, which is valid in the case that the radius of curvature of the surface is much larger than the incident wave length. The scattering problem of narrowband pulse was investigated to simplify the analytic expression of the two-frequency MCF. Numerical simulations show that the two-frequency MCF is greatly dependent on the root-mean-square (RMS) height, while less dependent on the correlation length. The analytic solutions were compared with the results of Monte Carlo simulation to assess the accuracy and computational efficiency.
