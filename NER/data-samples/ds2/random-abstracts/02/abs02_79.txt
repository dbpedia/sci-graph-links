Abstract This paper reports on the particularities designing and controlling micro motors fabricated using thin-film techniques and the progress within the iterative development process derived by the results of the characterisations of the active parts. Presented are selected results derived from finite-element method simulations and measurements belonging to the domain of force and optical magnetic field measurements. Furthermore a control concept for micro linear motors is presented. A sliding mode controller is modified with regard to the dynamic which is substantiated by simulations and measurements.
