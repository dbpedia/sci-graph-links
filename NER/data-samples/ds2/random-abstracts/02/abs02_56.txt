Abstract The inertia of a liquid flowing through a porous medium is normally ignored, but if the acceleration is great, it may be important. The relaxation time, defined so that it alone accounts for the inertia, has been determined experimentally with a simple oscillator. A U-Tube is provided with a porous plug and filled with a liquid. During pendulation of the liquid, the frequency and the damping define the relaxation time. The measured value of the relaxation time is about 10 times the theoretical estimate derived from Navier-Stokes equation.
