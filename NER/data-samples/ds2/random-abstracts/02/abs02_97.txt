Abstract The ability to characterize individual microscopic particles is important in many areas of science and technology. A variety of microbeam analysis methods are capable of providing information on microscopic particles. With electron probe X-ray microanalysis quantitative analysis is possible under well controlled conditions. Using computer controlled electron microscopes it is feasible to characterize a large number of individual particles. The application of this technique requires the use of multivariate data analysis procedures for the interpretation of the large amount of data obtained.
