Abstract We calculate the resonant transition radiation (RTR) using the most general formulas and obtain approximate analytical expressions describing the RTR dependence on the fast-particle velocity and magnetic-field intensity. Dependence of the RTR on the angle between the wave vector and the magnetic-field direction and also on the thermal velocity of background-plasma electrons is considered on the basis of approximate expressions for RTR, in which the longitudinal dielectric permittivity of the plasma is written neglecting the wave vector of transverse electromagnetic waves. The obtained dependences are combined into unified expressions for RTR coefficients. Comparison with the earlier found RTR coefficients is performed. It is shown that the obtained coefficients correspond better to the nature of the resonant transition radiation. Finally, the obtained RTR coefficients are used for interpretation of the radio emission of the solar burst of December 24, 1991.
