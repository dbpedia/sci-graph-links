Abstract The Bogolyubov-Mitropol'skii method of averaging is used to obtain averaged equations of relativistic motion of a charged particle in the first approximation in a strong magnetic field in the presence of an arbitrary quasimonochromatic wave in resonance regions. The conditions for the existence of resonances are noted.
