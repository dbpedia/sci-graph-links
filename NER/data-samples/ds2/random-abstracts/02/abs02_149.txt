Abstract Deuteron induced quasi-free scattering and reactions have been extensively investigated in the past few decades. This was done not only for the study of the nuclear structure and processes but also for the important astrophysical implication (Trojan Horse Method, THM). In particular the width of the neutron momentum distribution in deuteron will be studied as a function of the transferred momentum. THM applications will also be discussed because the momentum distribution of the spectator particle inside the Trojan horse nucleus is a necessary input for this method. The impact of the width variation on the extraction of the astrophysical S(E)-factor is discussed as well as the relevance of the s and d wave component in the deuteron wave function.
