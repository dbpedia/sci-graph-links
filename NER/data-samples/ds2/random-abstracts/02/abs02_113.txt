Abstract Approximate analytical solutions of the Dirac equation with Tietz–Hua (TH) potential are obtained for arbitrary spin–orbit quantum number κ using the Pekeris approximation scheme to deal with the spin–orbit coupling terms κ(κ ± 1)r −2. In the presence of exact spin and pseudo-spin symmetric limitation, the bound state energy eigenvalues and associated two-component wave functions of the Dirac particle moving in the field of attractive and repulsive TH potential are obtained using the parametric generalization of the Nikiforov–Uvarov method. The cases of the Morse potential, the generalized Morse potential and non-relativistic limits are studied.
