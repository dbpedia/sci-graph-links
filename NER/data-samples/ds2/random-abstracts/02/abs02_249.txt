Abstract A new quantum image encryption scheme is suggested by using the iterative generalized Arnold transforms and the quantum image cycle shift operations. The times of the quantum image cycle shift operations are controlled by a hyper-chaotic sequence generated by a new 4D hyper-chaotic system. The image pixels are scrambled by the iterative generalized Arnold transform, and the values of the pixels are altered by the quantum image cycle shift operations. The four initial conditions of the new 4D hyper-chaotic system are exploited to control the two parameters, the iterative rounds of the generalized Arnold transform and the times of the quantum image cycle shift operations, respectively. Thus, the main keys of the proposed quantum image encryption scheme are the four initial conditions of the new 4D hyper-chaotic system and the key space is relatively large enough. Simulation results and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the proposed quantum image encryption scheme outperforms its classical counterparts apparently.
