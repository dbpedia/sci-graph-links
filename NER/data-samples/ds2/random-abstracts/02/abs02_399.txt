Abstract In this paper we explore the role of muon spin rotation (μSR) techniques in the characterization and classification of superconducting materials. In particular we focus upon the Uemura classification scheme which considers the correlation between the superconducting transition temperature,T c, and the effective Fermi temperature,T F, determined from μSR measurements of the penetration depth. Within this scheme strongly correlated “exotic” superconductors, i.e, hightT C cuprates, heavy fermions, Chevrel phases and the organic superconductors, form a common but distinct group, characterized by a universal scaling ofT C withT F such that 1/100 <T C/T F<1/10. For conventional BCS superconductorsT C/T F<1/1000. The results of new μSR measurements of the penetration depth in superconducting Y(Ni1−x Co x )2B2C and YB6 are also presented. In Y(Ni1−x Co x )2B2C the decrease ofT C with increasing Co concentration is linked to a marked decrease in the carrier density from 2.9·1028 m−3 atx=0 to 0.6·1028 m−3, atx=0.1, while the carrier mass enhancement remains almost constant at approximately 10. For YB6 we find evidence of a modest enhancement of the carrier mass (m */m=3), and a relatively low carrier density of 0.24·1028 m−3. These results are discussed within the Uemura classification scheme. It is found that neither Y(Ni1−x Co x )2B2C withT c/T F>>1/250 nor YB6 withT C/T F>>1/340 can be definitively classified as either “exttic” or “conventional”, but instead the compounds display behavior which interpolates between the two regimes.
