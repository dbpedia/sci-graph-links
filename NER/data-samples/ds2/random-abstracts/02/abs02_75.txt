Abstract A new method is proposed for setting a lower or upper limit a α n * on the neutron electric polarizability α an . It is based on the fact that the real part of the s-wave scattering amplitude changes sign near the s-wave neutron resonance at E=E*. The methods consist of the observation of the energy behavior of the forward-backward scattering asymmetry ω 1 which experiences a jump at E=E*. If the jump is such that dω 1/dE>0, then α n >α n *, while if dω 1/dE<0, then α n <α n *, and if dω 1/dE∼0, then α n ∼α n *. Seven even-even nuclei are found with α n * from 0.5 to 3.1 in 10−3 fm3. Some details of a possible experiment with 182W are described.
