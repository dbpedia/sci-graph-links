Abstract Expressions are obtained for the cross section of photoproduction of an electron-positron pair on a nucleus and on an electron in the field of a weak electromagnetic wave in the resonance region corresponding to the virtual electron (positron) being on the mass shell. The magnitude of these cross sections relative to ordinary pair production by a photon on a nucleus and on an electron is estimated. It is shown that this mechanism can enhance pair production by a photon on a nucleus and on an electron in the resonance region with simultaneous detection of the electron (positron) at a large angle.
