Abstract. The relaxation oscillations of Zeeman and dipole magnetizations in the spin system of a solid paramagnet are theoretically analyzed in conditions of intermediate saturation of magnetic resonance and deep low-frequency modulation of the external magnetic field. Features of the lock-in detection signals in the relaxation oscillations regime are considered.
