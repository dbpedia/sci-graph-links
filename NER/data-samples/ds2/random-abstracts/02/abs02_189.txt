Summary We study the electromagnetic corrections to the induced pseudoscalar term in nuclear muon capture. The effects of the static nuclear magnetic field are shown to be very small. We calculate the effects of the nuclear Coulomb field by constructing the Green’s function appropriate for pions moving in the Coulomb field of an extended nucleus and using realistic muon wave functions. Consideration of finite nuclear size is shown to be imperative in order to obtain accurate results. The Coulomb corrections are not large enough to play any significant role in understanding the discrepancy of the theory with the recent measurement of the photon spectrum following radiative muon capture in40Ca of the rate of the reaction16O(μ−,νμ)16N(0−). Two approximate methods of obtaining the results are also presented.
