Abstract Conditions for the formation in photonic crystals of spatially ordered optical structures with ultrasound-modulated refractive indices are considered. It is shown that when standing ultrasound waves are excited in a medium, a structure consisting of trajectories of separate light beams, which is a superlattice of the dynamic photonic crystal, is created. Possible application areas of these structures are discussed.
