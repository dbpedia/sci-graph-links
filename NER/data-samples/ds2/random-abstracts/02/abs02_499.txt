Summary A cryofibrinogen complex was detected in the plasma of cattle infected withOesophagostomum radiatum. Its formation coincided with the development of hypofibrinogenaemia and it consisted basically of fibrinogen and soluble noncross-linked fibrin in both monomer and high molecular forms. Also present in the complex, albeit in trace amounts, were cold insoluble globulin, IgG, and plasminogen. It is suggested that the complex results from thrombin activation in vivo and its role is to maintain fibrin in solution thus preventing its deposition in the vascular system.
