Abstract The collision operator of relativistic electrons with a cold gas of atomic particles is derived consistently taking into account elastic interactions, excitation of electron shells, and ionization. The creation of secondary electrons is described accurately. In the range of energies exceeding the binding energy of atomic electrons, the operator implicates only the angular scattering by nuclei and the ionization integral that automatically allows for scattering by atomic electrons. The collision operator used earlier for studying the kinetics of avalanches of relativistic runaway electrons is analyzed. A more exact operator derived in the present study is simpler in form and saves time in computer calculations.
