Abstract The precise gamma-ray intensities of the transitions following the decay of 160Â·9 day isomeric state in177Lu have been determined from the gamma-ray spectra measured with three different Ge(Li) detectors. The consistency of the obtained data has been verified by the detailed analysis of the intensity balance on the excited levels of the177Lu and177Hf nuclei. In order to describe the experimental values of reduced probabilities of E1 transitions connecting the states of 9/2+ +[624] and 7/2-[514] rotational bands in177Hf, the necessity to introduce the second order corrections to Alaga rules has been established.
