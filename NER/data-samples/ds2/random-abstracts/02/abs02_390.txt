Abstract The optical, magnetooptical, and magnetic properties of polycrystalline (Fe5Si3/SiO2/Si(100)) and epitaxial Fe3Si/Si(111) films are investigated by spectral magnetoellipsometry. The dispersion of the complex refractive index of Fe5Si3 is measured using multiangle spectral ellipsometry in the range of 250–1000 nm. The dispersion of complex Voigt magnetooptical parameters Q is determined for Fe5Si3 and Fe3Si in the range of 1.6–4.9 eV. The spectral dependence of magnetic circular dichroism for both silicides has revealed a series of resonance peaks. The energies of the detected peaks correspond to interband electron transitions for spin-polarized densities of electron states (DOS) calculated from first principles for bulk Fe5Si3 and Fe3Si crystals.
