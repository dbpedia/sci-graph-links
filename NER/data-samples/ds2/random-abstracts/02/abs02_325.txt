Abstract A mononuclear iron(III) complex with 2,6-bis(3,4,5-trimethyl-N-pyrazolyl)pyridine (btmpp) has been synthesized, and characterized by X-ray crystallography, IR, UV–Vis and TGA–DTA methods. The Fe(III/II) couple was characterized by way of cyclic voltammetry using DMF solvent, where the complex was observed to have an irreversible behaviour.
