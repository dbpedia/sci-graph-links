Abstract The interaction of the quantum register with a noisy environment that leads to phase and bit errors is considered. Modeling of 5-qubit and 9-qubit error-correction algorithms for various environments is performed. It is shown that the use of the quantum correction leads to a quadratic decrease in the error probability. The efficiency of applying the 5-qubit algorithm of error correction for a silicon double-dot qubit is shown.
