Abstract Values of silica activity have been calculated for Bushveld rocks from an extension of the mafic layered sequence north of the town of Bethal in the south-eastern Transvaal as well as the Roossenekal area in the eastern limb of the Complex. The samples examined contain the coexisting assemblage olivine, Ca-poor pyroxene, Ca-rich pyroxene and plagioclase. This enabled silica activities to be calculated from the following reactions: (Mg, Fe)2SiO4+SiO2⇆2(Mg, Fe)SiO3, CaAl2SiO6+SiO2⇆CaAl2Si2O8. Parallel curves of increasing silica activity with fractionation were established 0.20 log units apart. This represented a pressure of emplacement for the top of the layered zone in the Bethal area of 2.72±0.79 kbars. A value of 1.47±0.62 kbars was obtained for the Roossenekal area. These values are equivalent to 9.1±2.6 km and 4.9±2.1 km respectively, the latter figure being consistent with the minimum thickness of 4550 m of felsite and granophyre originally overlying the layered sequence and still preserved in the area west of Roossenekal.
