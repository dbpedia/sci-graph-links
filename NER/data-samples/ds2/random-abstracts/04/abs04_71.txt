Abstract A comprehensive study of paleobotanical materials collected in the northern part of the Eastern Sayan was performed, including botanical analysis of peat, palynological and carpological analysis, and radiocarbon dating. The results provided a basis for reconstructing in detail the spatiotemporal distribution of ecocenotic complexes and corresponding paleoclimate types and calculating quantitative gradients of heat and moisture supply in the Late Holocene, beginning from 3500 ka.
