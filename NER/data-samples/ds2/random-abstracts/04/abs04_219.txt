Abstract The morphological evolution of the Sciara del Fuoco, Stromboli, is described from a time series dataset formed by Digital Elevation Models and orthophotos derived by digitising historical contour maps compiled in 1868 and 1937 and by processing data from aerial surveys carried out between 1954 and 2009. All maps were co-registered in the same reference system and used to build a quantitative reconstruction of the morphological changes of the Sciara del Fuoco slope. The changes mainly relate to the emplacement of many lava flows and their successive erosion. A comparative quantitative analysis yields estimates of areas and volumes of the lava fields formed on the sub-aerial part of the Sciara del Fuoco during a number of effusive events between 1937 and 2001, some of them never assessed before. The results of the analysis constrain the interpretation of the evolution and the magnitude of the recent effusive activity at the Stromboli volcano. Despite some uncertainties due to widely spaced observation periods, the results integrate all available topographic knowledge and contribute to an understanding of the main characteristics of the recent effusive eruptive styles at Stromboli volcano.
