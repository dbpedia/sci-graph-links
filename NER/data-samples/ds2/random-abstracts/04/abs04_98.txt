Abstract Chromian spinels from the Staré Ransko gabbro-peridotite, Czech Republic, display a distinct development trend: from primary Cr-rich spinels towards ferro-ferri (Ti-enriched magnetite) and magnesio-alumina (spinel sensu stricto) spinels. Zoning in the spinels is thought to be the result of a combination of exsolution, postdepositional diffusion and replacement processes. Multiphase, globular silicate inclusions — mainly biotite and amphibole, also orthopyroxene, serpentine and chlorite — are present in euhedral, largely homogeneous chromian spinels which occur in a matrix of poikilitic amphibole. The enclosed minerals have similar compositions to the minerals in the host rock. These silicate inclusions are interpreted as being due to a late magmatic introduction of a hydrous K-Ca-rich melt phase, contaminated by wall-rock interaction, into a semi-solidified olivine (± pyroxenes) cumulate. The composition of the chromian spinel may be used as an indicator for sulfide mineralization conditions (Johan 1979). The data reported in this paper are compatible with Johan's model.
