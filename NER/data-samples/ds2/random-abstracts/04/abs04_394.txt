Abstract SR-XRF studies are performed on samples of altered and unaltered fresh host rocks and bottom sediments from mud pots collected at the Mutnovsky volcano. Four groups of elements are identified according to their mobility: inert (Ga, Ge, and Sr); partially mobilized into the altered rocks (Cs, Rb, Mo, Nb, Cd, and Pb); partially leached during alteration of the host rocks (Cu, Zn, Sn, Ag, and Ni); and transitional (I, Br, As, Sb, Se, and Te). It is shown that the movement of thermal fluids through the host rock alters both. The concentrations of Rb, Cu, Zn, and V in the solution could partly be due to leaching from the host rocks.
