Summary A numerical model for wind-induced circulation in the Baltic is presented. It is a one-layer model of Hansen type with grid resolution of 0.5° on the longitude and 0.25° on the latitude. The open boundary of the model is in the Danish Straits. At the boundary water elevations are computed from a regression model containing the hydrostatic approximation. Also tidal effects are included in the open boundary elevations. The wind stress is calculated from atmospheric pressures given by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The pressures are in 150 km grid, from which they are interpolated using bicubic splines down into the grid size of the circulation model. The effect of different wind stress models is discussed in connection with the two computed periods December 1975 and 1 to 17 September 1977.
