Abstract The Manipur ophiolite belt within the Western Ophiolite Belt of the Indo-Myanmar Ranges (IMR), consists of tectonised to massive serpentinised peridotite, dunite pods, chromitite pods/lenses, cumulates, dykes, volcanic rocks and pelagic sediments. Chromitite pods and lenses hosted in peridotitic mantle rocks show magmatic textures, post magmatic brecciation and ferritchromitisation. Electron microprobe analyses show two types of massive chromitite, with one group having high-Cr (Cr# 75–76), medium-Al (Al2O3 12.2–12.4 wt%) chromites (Sirohi-type) and the other group (Gamnom-type) having a wide range of compositions with generally lower Cr and higher Al (Cr# 65–71, Al2O3 15.7–19 wt%). Accessory chromites in peridotitic mantle rocks have consistently low Cr (Cr# 38–39) and high Al (Al2O3 34–35 wt%), whereas chromites in dunite pods have intermediate compositions (Cr# ~60; Al2O3 20.7–21.2 wt%). The chromite chemistry suggests moderate (20 %) partial melting of the tectonised mantle harzburgite. The estimated Al2O3melt, (FeO/MgO)melt and TiO2melt for the Sirohi-type chromites indicate boninitic parentage, whereas chromite compositions from the Gamnom area suggest mixed boninitic—island arc tholeiitic magmas. The compositions of magmatic chromites suggest that the Manipur ophiolite was formed in a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) setting.
