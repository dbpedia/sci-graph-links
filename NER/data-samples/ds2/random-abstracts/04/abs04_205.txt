Abstract Increasing public awareness, stricter measures and promulgation of new laws in the area of water resources have made the use of advanced technologies indispensable. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are an effective tool for storing, managing, and displaying spatial data often encountered in water resources management. The application of GIS in water resources is constantly on the rise. In order to stress the importance of GIS in water resources management, applications related to this area are addressed and evaluated for efficient future research and development. Fundamentals of GIS are summarized and the history of the GIS evolution in water resources is discussed. Current GIS applications are presented including surface hydrologic and groundwater modeling, water supply and sewer system modeling, stormwater and nonpoint source pollution modeling for urban and agricultural areas, and other related applications. Future research and development needs are presented, based on these reviews.
