Summary Near solidus equilibria in the system mantle peridotite-carbonate-phosphate doped with Ce and Yb have been studied at 20 kbar and 950Â°C. Carbonatitic melts in this system may be quenched into homogeneous glasses. Such melts intensely extract REE from rock-forming mantle minerals, and their migration may cause processes of mantle metasomatism.
