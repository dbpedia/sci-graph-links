Abstract Late Quaternary sapropels of the eastern Mediterranean differ from normal sediments in their clay mineral composition. Clay minerals in the sapropels studied here are only slightly affected, or are not affected at all by diagenetic alteration. This permits the observation of primary differences. During stagnation periods, the contribution of remote or accessory sources was reduced or even absent. Different circulation patterns and, particularly, a general decline in deeper water currents activity might be held responsible for the observed differences in the clay mineral composition of sapropels and normal sediments.
