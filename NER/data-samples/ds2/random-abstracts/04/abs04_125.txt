Summary 25 representative karstic and lateritic bauxite samples from Europe, Asia and Africa were studied by a JEOL-JXA-5 electron-probe X-ray microanalyser. The main directions of the investigation were: determination of the microtextures and the distribution of the main elements in bauxite (Al, Fe, Ti, Si). Conclusions on the genesis of the textural constitution and on bauxitization are given. Further possibilities of using the electron-probe in solving different problems connected with bauxites are enumerated.
