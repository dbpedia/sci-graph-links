Abstract A formula for the effective fetch of micrometeorological evaporation measurements is derived by application of diffusion theory, using Calder's approximation of a uniform wind field and neutral atmospheric stability. This simplification allows estimation of the likely sampling error, which would result from an upwind step-change in evaporation rate, without change in roughness.
