Abstract On the basis of Digital Elevation Model data, the raster flow vectors, watershed delineation, and spatial topological relationship are generated by the Martz and Garbrecht method for the upper area of Huangnizhuang station in the Shihe Catchment with 805 km2 of area, an intensified observation field for the HUBEX/GAME Project. Then, the Xinâ€™anjiang Model is applied for runoff production in each grid element where rain data measured by radar at Fuyang station is utilized as the input of the hydrological model. The elements are connected by flow vectors to the outlet of the drainage catchment where runoff is routed by the Muskingum method from each grid element to the outlet according to the length between each grid and the outlet. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is 92.41% from 31 May to 3 August 1998, and 85.64%, 86.62%, 92.57%, and 83.91%, respectively for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th flood events during the whole computational period. As compared with the case where rain-gauge data are used in simulating the hourly hydrograph at Huangnizhuang station in the Shihe Catchment, the index of model efficiency improvement is positive, ranging from 27.56% to 69.39%. This justifies the claim that radar-measured data are superior to rain-gauge data as inputs to hydrological modeling. As a result, the grid-based hydrological model provides a good platform for runoff computation when radar-measured rain data with highly spatiotemporal resolution are taken as the input of the hydrological model.
