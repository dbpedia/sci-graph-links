Abstract The Dalat zone in southern Vietnam comprises a Cretaceous Andean-type magmatic arc with voluminous granitoids and contemporary volcanic rocks. On the basis of petrographical and mineralogical studies, the granitoids were subdivided into three suites: Dinhquan, Deoca and Cana. Rocks of the Dinhquan suite are hornblende–biotite diorites, granodiorites and minor granites. The Cana suite encompasses mainly leucocratic biotite-bearing granites with scarce hornblende. The Deoca suite is made up of granodiorites, monzogranites and granites. Geochemically, the granitoids are of subalkaline affinity, belong to the high-K, calc-alkaline series, and most of them display typical features of I-type granites. This paper presents the new Rb–Sr mineral and U–Pb zircon and titanite age data for the granitoids, which establish the ages of the plutonic suites as: the Dinhquan at ~112–100 Ma, Cana at ~96–93 Ma and Deoca at ~92–88 Ma. These ages are significantly different from earlier publications, and indicate that the earliest magmatism in the Dalat zone began at ~112 Ma ago, that is ~30–50 Ma later than previously thought. Our geochronological data are also support the continuation of an Andean-type arc running from SE China via southern Vietnam to SW Borneo.
