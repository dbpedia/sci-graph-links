Summary The wiborgite and dark wiborgite rapakivi granite phases of the Wiborg batholith in southeastern Finland compose about 80% of the total batholith area. A new study of the dominant mafic silicate minerals, in comparison with mafic silicates from more evolved granite phases, hybridized granite and mafic magmatic enclaves provide insights into the overall petrogenesis of the Wiborg batholith. All of the mafic silicate minerals are iron-rich, reflective of the whole rock compositions. Biotite is annitic, calcic amphibole is ferro-edenite to hastingsite, and subsolidus Fe-Mg amphibole is found as accessory grunerite. Temperatures derived from amphibole-plagioclase thermometry suggest crystallization at about ∼ 740 °C. Pressure estimates derived from Al in amphibole barometry range between 2.5 and 5.4 kilobars. This is noticeably higher than the previous estimates of 1 kbar for the Wiborg batholith. Oxygen fugacity estimates from biotite suggest low fO2 initial values and increase from FMQ to above NNO for late stage granite phases.
