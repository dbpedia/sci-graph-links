Abstract How to model the permeability evolution of rock subjected to liquid nitrogen cooling is a key issue. This paper proposes a simple but practical method to study the permeability evolution of rocks subject to liquid nitrogen cooling. FLAC with FISH function was employed to numerically model the rock behavior under cooling. The enhanced permeability of the volumetric strain was defined, and the permeability was directly evaluated based on elementâ€™s volumetric strain. Detailed procedures for implementing the evolution model of permeability in this paper were presented. A case study was carried out to simulate a coal bed where liquid nitrogen was injected in the bore hole. And a semi-submerged test of liquid nitrogen was performed. The method to model the permeability evolution of rocks subject to liquid nitrogen shock in this paper was proved to be right by the test results. This simulation results are discussed with the hope to provide some insight into understanding the nitrogen cooling practice.
