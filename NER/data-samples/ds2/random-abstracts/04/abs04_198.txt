Summary Rats were injected with35S-sulphate and killed after 24 hours. Frozen sections of the epiphysial plates were prepared, and the radioactivity in the sections was determined. They were then treated with a number of histotechnical procedures used to prepare tissues for electron microscopy. After each step in these procedures the radioactivity of the sections was again determined. From earlier investigations it was concluded that the incorporation of35S in the tissue investigated represented sulphated glycosaminoglycans. In the epiphysial plate chondroitin sulphate and possibly small amounts of keratan sulphate were found. Conventional glutaraldehyde fixation, followed by immersion in cacodylate buffer, by post-fixation in buffered osmium tetroxide, by immersion in Tyrodeâ€™s solution, by dehydration in ethanol or acetone, and in the case of dehydration with ethanol, by subsequent immersion in propylene oxide, resulted in a total loss of 70% of35S from the sections, the main part being lost in the osmium tetroxide solution. When buffered glutaraldehyde solution containing 0.5% cetylpyridinium chloride was used as a fixative in the first step, a total of only 7% of35S was lost.
