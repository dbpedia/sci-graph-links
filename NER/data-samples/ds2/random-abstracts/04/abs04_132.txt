Abstract The Guevgueli Ophiolite Complex near Demir Kapija (Eastern Vardar Ophiolitic Unit) was studied for the age and facies of the overlying sediments. Cherts in direct contact with basalts are dated to late Bathonianâ€“early Callovian with radiolarians. The post-obduction sequence, here informally named the Demir Kapija group, is composed of polymictic conglomerate, probably Kimmeridgian in age, and a more than 350-m thick carbonate succession. The carbonate succession consists of hemipelagic, slope and platform margin facies and contains algae and benthic foraminifers indicative of the Tithonian age. These new data support the previously proposed palaeogeographical connection between the Guevgueli and South Apuseni ophiolite complexes.
