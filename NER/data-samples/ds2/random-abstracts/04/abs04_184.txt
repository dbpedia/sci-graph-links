Abstract At Montagna della Maiella and at Gola del Furlo (central Apennines) two discrete layers of bentonic clay are intercalated within the pelagic (Furlo) and turbiditic/pelagic limestones (Maiella) of the Upper Cretaceous basinal succession of the Umbrian basin (Scaglia facies). The bentonite layers are dated by planktonic foraminifera to the Globotruncanita elevata zone, early Campanian, and by calcareous nannofossils to the Aspidolithus parcus zone (CC 18); they fall into the reversed interval of chron 33. Detailed correlation shows the layers to be of exactly the same age. The upper layer is dated by U/Pb on magmatic zircons to 81.67±0.21 Ma, an age compatible with the Cretaceous time-scale of Obradovich. The mineralogy of the bentonitic clays is almost pure montmorillonite and contrasts sharply with the clay mineral assemblage of the enclosing pelagic and turbiditic limestones, which is dominated by soil-derived smectite and illite in different proportions. The bentonite seams are interpreted as the submarine alteration products of wind-borne volcanic ashes. They can be followed with only minor changes in thickness over 200 km and must be derived from distant volcanic sources and related to extreme volcanic events. A possible source area is present in the Dinarides where Upper Cretaceous subduction-related magmatic rocks are widespread.
