Summary The mineral composition of leaves and fruits of two myrtle genotypes with yellowish-white and purple-black fruits from Çandır village (Isparta) and a genotype with yellowish-white fruits from Serik (Antalya), all of which had high fruit quality, was determined in this study. The results of the study showed that both leaves and fruits of myrtle were rich in K, Ca, Mg, and P contents. No significant correlation could be found between the fruit colors (purple-black and yellowish-white) and mineral contents of the genotypes. The highest total minerals were obtained from Genotype 11 (with purple-black fruits) for the leaf samples but from Genotype 17 (with yellowish-white fruits) for the fruit samples.
