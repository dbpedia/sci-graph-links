Summary ¶The rare earth, major and trace element geochemistry of Jurassic deep marine manganese shales allow insight into their environment of deposition. We present data of 24 samples from the Northern Calcareous Alps (Eastern Alps), collected from Late Jurassic strata of the Tennengebirge and from Early Jurassic strata of the Karwendel Mts. Whereas major and trace element geochemistry is controlled by the detrital input, rare earth element data and the relationship between total organic carbon and (pyritic) sulfur can be used to constrain the origin of the manganese accumulation. The data of this study are compatible with a hydrogenous precipitation of manganese by strongly varying redox-conditions at the sediment–water interface of a slope basin.
