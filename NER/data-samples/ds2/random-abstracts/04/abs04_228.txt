Abstract Volumetric air sampling via the Burkard pollen and spore trap is described. The influence of meteorological factors on the occurrence of airborne pollen was investigated; the concentration of pollen grains is increased in strata of reduced vertical air exchange. A pollen flight information service has been developed since 1989 for Erfurt and other areas in the former German Democratic Republic.
