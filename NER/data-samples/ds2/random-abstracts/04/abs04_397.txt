Abstract A first quasi-successive paleosecular variation data since âˆ¼5.5 kya, including magnetic inclination and relative geomagnetic field intensity variation were obtained from a 55 m-long sediment core in the Nakdong River delta, southeastern Korean Peninsula. Both magnetic inclination curves and relative paleointensity data showed similar trends with those from Lake Biwa, Japan. They also showed close correlation with continuous global geomagnetic field models. For instance, the present study confirms the existence of archeomagnetic jerks. In addition, the present study supports the evidence of globally high geomagnetic intensity circa 3 kya.
