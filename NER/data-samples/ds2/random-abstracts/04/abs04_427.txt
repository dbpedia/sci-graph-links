Abstract â€‚Derelict land is a wasted resource and has a blighting effect on the surrounding area hence its restoration is highly desirable. Four case histories involving different aspects of dereliction and restoration are outlined. The first example considers two old colliery spoil heaps in South Yorkshire, England, which were restored, part of the site being developed for a bakery whilst the rest became a parkland. Such restoration work is essentially a large-scale exercise in earthmoving in order to achieve an acceptable contoured landform. After regrading, installation of drainage and harrowing, the spoil was treated with lime and covered with soil. Fertilizers were applied prior to seeding and planting. The next example describes an abandoned sand and gravel pit in West Yorkshire which was converted to a marina. The old workings were flooded and were separated by two berms into three large ponds. The berms were moved to form a lake with islands. Some regrading of the sides of the lake was necessary which involved cut- and -fill. Access was provided from the lake to an adjacent canal and the site was landscaped. The two remaining examples are from the heavily industrialized district of the Ruhr in Germany. Both were sites of former coal mining and associated industries and were contaminated as well as having old heavy foundation structures in the ground. The site investigations and rehabilitation of both areas are described.
