Abstract An attempt is made to work out the sequence stratigraphic frame work of Infra and Intertrappean beds exposed in Soma quarry section, near Gowripatnam, Rajahmundry area to understand the mode of depositional process in the basin by integrating litho and biostratigraphic data. The study documents the field data to recognize some of sequence parameters in the field. The sequence stratigraphic study shows the Sequence Boundary, Transgressive Systems Tract (TST), three shallowing upward sequence, Maximum Flooding Surface (MFS) and Highstand Systems Tract (HST) deposits got exposed as a result of basinal rise and fall.
