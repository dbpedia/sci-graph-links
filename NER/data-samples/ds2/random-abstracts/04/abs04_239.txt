Summary A rare variety of Fe-Al-rich xenolith, tridymite-hercynite rock, was entrained in the Cenozoic basalt from Niutoushan, southeastern China. The tridymite-hercynite rock consists of hercynite (40–50%), tridymite (35–45%), ilmenite (≈2%), and glass (10–20%). Mineral grains are smaller than 0.05 mm with a granular texture. Compared to “normal” igneous rocks, this tridymite-hercynite rock has higher FeO, Al2O3, and lower SiO2 CaO, MgO, and alkalis (Na2O + K2O). The origin of this type of xenolith is problematical. Based upon the available mineralogical and chemical data, three possible origins have been evaluated:(1)The product of an extreme tholeiitic fractionation under low oxidation conditions; but the major element geochemistry appears to negate this model.(2)The Fe-rich (Si-poor portion of silicate-immiscible liquids from an extremely fractionated residual tholeiite magma; however, the corresponding Si-rich end-member fraction is missing, and the composition of the tridymite-hercynite rock is different from that of any Si-poor melt phase of known immiscible silicate liquids.(3)The product of metamorphism, including partial to complete melting, of a sedimentary protolith. An Fe-Al-rich shale (quartz 5%, kaolinite 75%, hematite 20%) has the approximate composition of the tridymitehercynite rock. The trace-element abundances of the xenoliths suggest that the source rock for the Fe-Al-rich sedimentary protolith was an undifferentiated volcanic rock at the active continental margin.
