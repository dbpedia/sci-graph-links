Abstract The Late Proterozoic Katangan basic rocks (dolerites and basalts) outcropping at Kibambale in central Shaba (Zaire) are classified as extension-related tholeiites. The concentrations of immobile major and trace elements resemble those encountered in Phanerozoic enriched oceanic ridge basalts (E-MORB) emplaced in incipient oceanic rifts such as Red Sea and Tadjura Gulf troughs. This conclusion is also sustained by: elemental ratios which are MORB-like; multielement chondrite- and MORB-normalized patterns; sedimentological data, especially the shallow water conditions which prevailed during the deposition of lower Kundelungu tillite in which these basic rocks are interstratified; and the geological and structural framework, notably the emplacement of these igneous rocks in a basin not distant from the Kibaran continental land mass. In this area the geological units containing the igneous rocks are not affected by significant tangential tectonism and so the present structural relationships are relatively undisturbed compared with those which prevailed during the emplacement of the igneous rocks.
