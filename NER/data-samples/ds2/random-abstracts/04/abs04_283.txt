Abstract The extraction of chelate and ion-association complexes formed by various metal ions and two new organic reagents (derivatives of benzoxazolylacrolein) has been investigated in order to evaluate the possibilities for analytical application. The composition of the extracted species and their conditional extraction constants are given. Two simple extraction procedures for flame atomic absorption analysis of high purity lead salts have been developed. The proposed methods permit determination of (a) 1 × 10−5% Co, Fe and Ni and 5 × 10−6% Cu and Zn and (b) 1 × 10−5% Pd and 5 × 10−6% Ag and Au, with relative standard deviations in the range 4–8%.
