Abstract Samples from the mineralized micrite, the bottom part of the 1–5 lens were investigated. They contain Zn and Fe bearing low Mg-calcite, dolomite, Fedolomite, minrecordite-CaZn (CO3)2, sphalerite, pyrite, melnikovite and overgrown quartz. — Zn-dolomite consists probably of CaMg (CO3)2 and CaZn (CO3)2 domains about 10×35 nm in size. Zn-dolomite is sulfidized (replaced by ZnS) which is demonstrated by both reflected light and electron microscope methods. — CaZn (CO3)2 from the Navan ore has cell parameters: a0=0.484±0.004 and c0=1.608±0.012 nm and is rhombohedral. It forms close, tiny intergrowths with calcite. — Base metals at Navan were exhaled to form at least partly carbonate minerals which subsequently reverted to sulfides in the diagenetic environment. The reversion of base metals carbonates to sulfides is connected with reduction in volume. The reduction in volume allowed the ore zone to retain its permeability after lithification of the host rock. It allowed lateral flow of hydrothermal solutions, which deposited further generations of sulfides and increased the base metal content producing a high grade ore.
