Abstract Cyclonic storms having maximum winds of 34 knots and above that had genesis in north Indian Ocean have been studied with respect to the eastward passage of Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO). In the three decades (1979–2008), there were a total of 118 cyclones reported in which 96 formed in the region chosen (0–15oN, 60oE–100oE) for the study. Although the percentage of MJO days inducing cyclogenesis is small, it is found that tropical cyclone genesis preferentially occurred during the convective phase of MJO. This accounted for 44 cyclones of the total 54 cyclones (i.e., 81.5%) formed under MJO amplitude 1 and above. The study has shown that, when the enhanced convection of MJO is over the maritime continent and the adjoining eastern Indian Ocean, it creates the highest favorable environment for cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal. During this phase, westerlies at 850 hPa are strong in the equatorial region south of Bay of Bengal creating strong cyclonic vorticity in the lower troposphere along with the low vertical wind shear.
