Abstract In this study, the mineralogical characterizations of the sediments have been carried out using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic and XRD technique. The extinction co-efficient and crystallinity index are calculated to know the relative distribution of major minerals and crystalline nature of quartz, respectively. From the FTIR and XRD techniques, the minerals, such as quartz, microcline feldspar, orthoclase feldspar, kaolinite, calcite, gibbsite, montmorillonite, smectite, palygorskite, organic carbon, zircon, monazite, montmorillonite, and hornblende are identified. Thermoluminescence (TL) behavior of the sediments has been studied through the measurements of both Natural Thermoluminescence (NTL) and Artificial Thermoluminescence (ATL). Correlation analysis has been carried out among the parameters obtained from both mineral and TL analyses to know the existing interrelations. The obtained correlations are discussed, and it is suggested that the NTL and ATL measurements of the sediments show the valuable information about the sedimentation process. Thus, we conclude that the TL is the easiest tool to find out the sedimentation of the river.
