Abstract A dacite sample from a nuée ardente deposit at Pitons du Carbet, Martinique, contained cummingtonite, orthopyroxene, quartz, magnetite, and ilmenite as phenocrysts, and thus was suitable for evaluation of the $$T - f_{{\text{O}}_{\text{2}} } - P_{{\text{total}}} - P_{{\text{H}}_{\text{2}} {\text{O}}} $$ conditions of crystallization of nuée ardente materials according to the method of Ewart et al. (1971). The estimations were obtained with the aid of a Fortran IV program, which permitted the operation of all the arrangements between the available microprobe analyses. The results indicated that the phenocrystic association crystallized at moderate temperatures (ca. 750° C), under high oxygen fugacities (> NNO) and total pressures (2.3–4.5 Kb, with a maximal density of points at about 3.5 Kb), and water pressures approximating total pressures. The groundmass Fe-Ti oxides equilibrated at lower temperatures and under relatively increasing oxygen fugacities, the variation of which is tentatively ascribed to the aerial emplacement of the nuée ardente materials. The phenocryst data imply that in the case studied the high fluid pressures characterizing the nuée ardente eruptions were not acquired at a shallow level because of the deep intratelluric stage of crystallization of these differentiated calcalkalic magmas.
