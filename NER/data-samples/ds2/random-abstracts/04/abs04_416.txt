Summary Several specimens of early diagenetically altered siliceous sponges were recovered during the cruise of the German research vessel ‘Sonne’ in the Tyrrhenian sea. The samples have been dredged from the Vavilov (−1375 m water depth) and Ventotene seamounts (−2125 m water depth). The sponge-bearing strata correspond to the nannoplankton zone 21 (Emiliania huxleyi zone: Upper Pleistocene—Holocene). Various pathsways in the diagenetic alteration of the siliceous skeleton can be observed: In all cases the diagenetic history starts with sediment infill and lithification with high Mg-calcite (HMC) in the space between the spicules, where organic matter of the living sponge previously was present. In some cases the axial canal may be cemented by micritic HMC as well. The next stage is characterized by silica dissolution leading to moldic porosity. These molds may (1) remain open or (2) exhibit various kinds of manganese infillings and coatings. (3) The most conspicuous diagenetic stage is characterized by HMC cements growing within these molds. These submarine cements exhibit in some cases morphologies, predominantly known from the meteoric diagnetic environment. This HMC cement occurs also in molds with thin Mn-coatings outlining the former morphology of the spicules, as well as in molds where the axial canal has been filled by micritic HMC cement.
