Abstract. The absence of second class currents together with the assumption of the factorization for non-leptonic B decays provide new constraints on CP observables in the decay $B \rightarrow a_0(980)(\rightarrow \eta\pi)\pi$. The kinematics of this decay does not allow for interference between the oppositely charged resonances in the Dalitz plot as in $B^0 \rightarrow \rho(770)\pi $. Nonetheless, under the assumption of factorization, the $B \rightarrow a_0\pi$ two-body time-dependent isospin analysis leads to a more robust extraction of the angle $\alpha$ than in the $B \rightarrow \rho\pi$ isospin-pentagon analysis. The absence of second class currents might lead to enhanced direct CP violation and/or allows for a test of some assumptions made in the $\alpha$ analysis in other decays like $B \to a_0 \rho, B \rightarrow b_1(1235)\pi, B\to a_0 a_0$, $B\to \eta(\eta')\pi\pi$ and $B\to b_1 a_0$. The effects from non-factorizable contributions on the determination of $\alpha$ are estimated by means of a numerical study.
