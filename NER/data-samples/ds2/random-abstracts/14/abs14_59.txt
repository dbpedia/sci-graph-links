Abstract. Using $J/\psi$ and open charm photoproduction data, we apply the vector meson dominance model to obtain constraints on the energy dependence of the inelastic $J/\psi$-nucleon cross section. Predictions of short distance QCD are in accord with these constraints, while recently proposed hadronic models for $J/\psi$ dissociation strongly violate them.
