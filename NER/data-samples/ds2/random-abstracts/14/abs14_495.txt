Abstract The Gini concentration coefficient is considered to be the best synthetic inequality measure and is widely used in economic research. In this paper, we present its decomposition by factor components with an application to income distributions in Poland. Income inequality measures proposed by Gini, Zenga and Bonferroni are calculated for different socio-economic groups based on their exclusive or primary source of maintenance. For theoretical income distribution, the Dagum type-I model was used. The basis for the calculations was the individual data coming from the Household Budgets Survey conducted quarterly by the Polish Central Statistical Office. Using the decomposition of inequality by source, we were able to examine how changes in particular income components affected overall inequality.
