Abstract This paper examines the optimal environmental and monetary policy mix in a New Keynesian model embodying pollutant emissions, abatement technology and environmental damage. The optimal response of the economy to productivity shocks is shown to depend crucially on the instruments policy makers have available, the intensity of the distortions they have to address (i.e. imperfect competition, costly price adjustment and negative environmental externality) and the way they interact.
