Abstract An integer partition {λ1,λ2,...,λ v } is said to be graphical if there exists a graph with degree sequence 〈λ i 〉. We give some results corcerning the problem of deciding whether or not almost all partitions of even integer are non-graphical. We also give asymptotic estimates for the number of partitions with given rank.
