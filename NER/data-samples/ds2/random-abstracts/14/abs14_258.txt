Abstract We propose quantile regression (QR) in the Bayesian framework for a class of nonlinear mixed effects models with a known, parametric model form for longitudinal data. Estimation of the regression quantiles is based on a likelihood-based approach using the asymmetric Laplace density. Posterior computations are carried out via Gibbs sampling and the adaptive rejection Metropolis algorithm. To assess the performance of the Bayesian QR estimator, we compare it with the mean regression estimator using real and simulated data. Results show that the Bayesian QR estimator provides a fuller examination of the shape of the conditional distribution of the response variable. Our approach is proposed for parametric nonlinear mixed effects models, and therefore may not be generalized to models without a given model form.
