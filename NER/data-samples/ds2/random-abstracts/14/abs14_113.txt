Abstract Asymptotic estimates for the error of the Gauss-Jacobi quadrature formula are given for analytic functions. Our estimates for entire and meromorphic functions include those of Chawla and Jain [2]; for functions having branch-point and logarithmic singularities on the real axis we obtain improved estimates which, for the Gauss-Legendre case also, are better than those of Chawla and Jain. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the estimates obtained.
