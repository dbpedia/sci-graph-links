Abstract A dynamical model of optimal economic growth is used for the comparison of catalogs of real econometric data and synthetic growth scenarios. The model is calibrated on a database of the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Special attention is paid to the aggregated data of the Japanese manufacturing industry in the period 1960â€“92. A description of an algorithm modeling optimal trends in the technological dynamics is given.
