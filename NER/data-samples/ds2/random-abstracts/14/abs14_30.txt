Abstract Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is an important input parameter for most crop models. Unfortunately, a worldwide routine PAR measurement network has not been established, nor does one exist in China. In this study, the relationship between PAR and broadband solar radiation (R s) was investigated. Based on this analysis, three empirical models were developed for estimating PAR. These three models include parameters based on in situ measured R s and parameters obtained from R s. Model A uses only R s, whereas model B uses R s and the clearness index (K s, the ratio of R s to the extraterrestrial irradiance flux), and model C uses attenuation factors under clear skies (ρclear) and K s. Evaluating these estimation models revealed a strong correlation with low relative error between the observed and modeled PAR in Northeast China. The slope a and intercept b of the linear regression between the observed PAR and the modeled PAR are approximately 1 and 0, respectively. The relative error between the observed PAR and the modeled PAR is less than 10.7 %. Model C provides satisfactory estimates of the PAR values for locations where the model is developed. However, model B is more convenient for modeling PAR than model C because K s can be more easily determined than the transmissivity of PAR under clear sky conditions.
