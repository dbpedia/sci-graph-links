Abstract Neural network time series forecasting error comprises autocorrelation error, due to an imperfect model, and random noise, inherent in the data. Both problems are addressed here, the first using a two stage training, growth-network neuron: the autocorrelation error (ACE) neuron. The second is considered as a post-processing noise filtering problem. These techniques are applied in forecasting the sunspot time series, with comparison of stochastic, BFGS and conjugate gradient solvers.
