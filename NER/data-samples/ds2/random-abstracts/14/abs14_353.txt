Abstract By applying the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, even with all the limitations where error could cause significant problems, this paper attempts to investigate the efficiency of 35 Microfinance institutions in the Mediterranean zone during the period of 2004â€“2005. The estimated results prove that eight institutions are relatively efficient, and have a notable level of average efficiency and a potential of evolution while being referent to their technical efficiency. The survey also reveals that the size of the MFIs has a negative effect on their efficiency since the MFIs of medium size are more efficient than the eminent.
