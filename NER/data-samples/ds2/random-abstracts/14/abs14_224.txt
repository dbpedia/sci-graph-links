Abstract This paper considers externalities and investigates which general properties and respectively their magnitudes induce complex behavior like thresholds and indeterminacy (and cycles). The objective is to obtain general mechanisms within a general setting in order to complement the much advanced but model specific literature. It turns out that these arithmetic and simultaneously economic conditions for thresholds or indeterminacy require complementarity and non-moderate dynamic social influence. In other words, complexities can be related (necessary and sufficient) to a familiar static property that social interactions turn the (stationary) demand for the private stock into a Giffen good. Indeterminacy requires in addition ‘low’ subjective discounting and proper interactions between control, stock and externality. These conditions provide an easy way to construct models that allow for the targeted outcome, stability, thresholds or indeterminacy.
