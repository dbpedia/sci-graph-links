Abstract The role of recommended prices, especially when used as a basis from which traders may claim price reductions, has received unfavourable comment from several sources in Britain in recent years. It has been claimed that they are likely to cause economic detriment to consumers. Proposals have been made to prohibit the use of recommended prices either generally or on specific products. This paper reviews the general issues concerning the role of recommended prices and the major official reports produced on this question. The author argues that, contrary to the proposals at present under consideration, the economic interests of consumers are, on balance, more likely to be enhanced by the continuation of the use of recommended prices rather than their prohibition. However some controls on the use of recommended prices may be required and suggestions for policy developments are made.
