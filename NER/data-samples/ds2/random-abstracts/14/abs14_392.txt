Abstract The R / S statistic is used to detect long-range dependence in a time series and to estimate its intensity. One of its virtues is robustness against different distributions. We show here that the R / S statistic continues to be robust if the time series is a moving average with long-range dependence with innovations that are in the domain of attraction of an infinite variance stable process.
