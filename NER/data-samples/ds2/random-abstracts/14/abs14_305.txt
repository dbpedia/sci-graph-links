Summary In this paper the absolute and relative versions of purchasing power parity (ppp) are tested using annual data (over the period 1973â€“1985) for 5 countries. In contrast to much of the literature on ppp, evidence in favour of the ppp hypothesis is reported, particularly when a wholesale price index is used. A novel feature of the approach is the use of a pooled cross section-time series analysis.
