Abstract A beef strip loins (Musculus longissimus lumborum) freshness determination method utilizing electronic nose (e-nose) was investigated in this paper. Fresh beef strip loins samples were stored at 4°C continuously for 10 days. Total viable count (TVC) index, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) index, and e-nose responses to beef strip loins samples were measured every day. TVC and TVB-N index rose with the increase of storage time. Principal component analysis (PCA) only partially discriminated beef samples under different storage days. Stochastic resonance (SR) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) spectrum discriminated all beef samples successfully. Beef strip loins freshness discrimination model was developed using SR SNR maximums (SNRmax) linear fitting regression. The proposed method forecasted beef freshness with high accuracy. It is holds promise in meat freshness determination applications.
