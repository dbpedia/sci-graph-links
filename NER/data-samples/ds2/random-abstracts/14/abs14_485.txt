Abstract For the investigation of the chatter modes, the power spectrum of the parametric time series model was adopted and analyzed at several mixed conditions of different revolution. This paper describes a methodology for an application of several time series such asAR (forward-backward, burg, least square, Yule Walker, geometric lattice, instrumental variable),ARX (least square, instrumental variable),ARMAX, ARMA, Box Jenkins, Output Error. To estimate the chatter mode using their spectral analysis their results were compared with one another. As a result, it was proven that several time series methods can be used for chatter mode estimation. Among them, theARX, ARMAX and instrumental variable methods (iv4) are more desirable and reliable than the other algorithm for the exact calculation of the chatter mode in endmilling. Among three cutting forces, the z direction cutting force,Fz, has more powerful characteristics of chatter occurring than the cutting forces,Fx andFy, in the sense that weak mode is calculated exactly and there is no shifted or pseudo mode in the estimated power spectra of endmilling forces.
