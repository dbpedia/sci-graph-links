Abstract The paper discusses the effects of parasitic quality-factor modulation in a tuned circuit arising on parametric modulation and influencing a capacitance-sensor analyzer. Varicaps may be used for parametric modulation of a semiconductor capacitance in order to improve not only the reliability but also the accuracy of a dielcometric analyzer.
