Abstract A detailed analysis of the inclusive production of the vector mesonsφ,K *+,0(892) $$\bar K*^0 (892),\rho ^{ + ,0} ,\omega $$ and the tensor mesonsK 2*0)(1430) andf 2(1270) inK + p interactions at 250 GeV/c is presented The data are compared with results at lower energies and with various quark-parton models. The production ofρ 0,K *0(892) and $$\bar K*^0 (892)$$ increases at the same rate as a function ofs, is concentrated in the central region and is not reproduced by the models. Production of the tensor mesonsf 2(1270) andK 2*0(1340) is suppressed relative toρ 0 andK *0(892) by a factor of about 3.
