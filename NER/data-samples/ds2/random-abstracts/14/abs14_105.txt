Summary This paper deals with minimum distance (MD) estimators and minimum penalized distance (MPD) estimators which are based on the L p distance. Rates of strong consistency of MPD density estimators are established within the family of density functions which have a bounded m-th derivative. For the case p=2, it is also proved that the MPD density estimator achieves the optimum rate of decrease of the mean integrated square error and the L 1 error. Estimation of derivatives of the density is considered as well. In a class parametrized by entire functions, it is proved that the rate of convergence of the MD density estimator (and its derivatives) to the unknown density (its derivatives) is of order $$1{\text{/}}\sqrt n$$ in expected L 1 and L 2 distances. In the same class of distributions, MD estimators of unknown density and its derivatives are proved to achieve an extraordinary rate (log log n/n)1/2 of strong consistency.
