Summary The use of beef serum as an essential ingredient in a medium for the cultivation of the Noguchi strain ofTreponema pallidum is described. A proportion of 8% v/v of beef serum can replace the addition of 10% of rabbit serum, under the condition that also basal medium itself is optimal for the cultivation of Noguchi strain. With beef serum employed in this manner, quantitatively the same growth as with rabbit serum has been obtained, with the only difference that maximum is reached somewhat later. Growth curves of Noguchi strain in a medium supplement with 8% of beef serum (medium “61BS8”) are presented and also the correlation of turbidimetric and numeric values between which a linear relationship has been established.
