Abstract Basic statistics of a nonstationary time series are estimated from its single realization. The estimates are represented in the form of a recurrent procedure forming residual time series and smoothing them with the help of effective models of digital data filtering or a locally weighted polynomial regression. The concept of local time weighting and robust weighting of residual series is generalized on the basis of a rational combination of models of distance-weighted least squares and an exponentially weighted regression. The estimation of trends, volatility, and autocorrelation for time series of companiesâ€™ sales volumes and the price dynamics of stock assets is simulated, and the results of simulation are presented.
