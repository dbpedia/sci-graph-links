Abstract We present a method based on integro-differential equations describing the13Câˆ’1H dipolar dephasing behaviour of carbon magnetization which results from monoprotonated carbons, non-protonated carbons as well as rapidly rotating methyl groups. Good agreement with theoretical calculations and experiment is obtained in ammonium tartrate and durene. The frequently applied empirical methods for determination the ratio of protonated and non-protonated carbons are analyzed. The dipolar dephasing time constants of non-protonated carbons vary substantially as a result, of variation in their heteronuclear second moments and thus in structure. Two different methods are performed for determination heteronuclear second moments from dipolar dephasing data.
