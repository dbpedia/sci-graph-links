Abstract This manuscript will provide some food for thought. The major intention is to arm metrologically oriented chemists with a few arguments underpinning the importance of the seemingly exaggerated efforts spent on the lofty concept of objectivity and the fata morgana of true values. In fact, the intention of truth and objectivity, both utopian concepts, are the fundament of modern science. Objectivity demands to evaluate an estimate of uncertainty with each measurement result. It is not only a personal attitude towards an observation, but it also refers to the language used to communicate about this observation. The uniqueness of science as an approach to explain the physical world surrounding us is based on logic, objectivity and experiment. The importance of and the problem with spoken language as a tool to communicate about experiments is difficult to overestimate. Logical reasoning alone is not capable of generating insight in a similar way to what science has achieved. Measurement and objectivity are the decisive components of turning philosophy into a scientific process.
