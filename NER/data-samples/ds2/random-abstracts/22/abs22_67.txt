Abstract In this paper we are proposing a novel fuzzy method that can handle imperfect knowledge in a broader way than Intuitionistic (in the sense of Atanassov) fuzzy logic does (IFL). This fuzzy method can manage non- contradictory, doubtful, and contradictory information provided by experts, providing a mediated solution, so we called it Mediative Fuzzy Logic (MFL). We are comparing results of MFL, with IFL and traditional Fuzzy logic (FL).
