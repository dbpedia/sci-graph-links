Abstract Despite the fact that semistructured interviewing in business research can trace its roots all the way back to the Hawthorne studies, the guidance for practitioners in the literature remains sparse. This article deals with what responsibilities a researcher ought to shoulder in carrying out this unpredictable exploration in the field. The tradeoffs and the dilemmas that must be confronted in this research design are discussed, and four cases are used as illustrations. Based on the author's nine years of field experience, ethical procedures are put forth with regard to gaining both organizational and individual consent, establishing respondents' positions and their justifications, and responsibly reporting the results. The analysis reveals that these ethical procedures are not just passive safeguards; rather, they serve an integral role in the process of producing valid and useful research.
