Summary This paper describes how Soranus of Ephesus, who practiced as a physician almost 2,000 years ago, employed “moral” methods in his treatment of insane patients. With the idea of a philosophy of history in mind, sociological, legal and historical factors which served as the context for a particular practice of psychiatry are examined. Soranus respected his patients a good deal and avoided doing anything harmful to them as he applied his psychological, rehabilitative and physical methods of treatment. It is interesting to note that family, friends and slaves were the chief agents of the therapeutic procedures, which were carried out in the homes of the patients. These were probably of the wealthier classes, since airy, quiet, well-lighted homes were required for proper application of Soranus' treatment. These conditions existed on the hills of Rome where the wealthy lived, but not in the rest of the city where conditions were noisy and crowded. In anticipating “moral psychiatry” as postulated by Pinel, Soranus qualifies as an eminent practitioner.
