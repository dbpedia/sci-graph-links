Abstract The class of extensions is completely described of the logic obtained by adding Dummettâ€™s axiom to the paraconsistent Nelson logic. Moreover, we prove that every extension of this logic is finitely axiomatizable and decidable and, given a formula, it is possible to determine which extension is axiomatized by this formula.
