Abstract The very idea of informative analysis gives rise to a well-known paradox. Yet a parallel puzzle, herein called the ‘paradox of synonymy’, arises for statements which do not express analyses. The paradox of synonymy has a straightforward metalinguistic solution: certain words are referring to themselves. Likewise, the paradox of analysis can be solved by recognizing that certain expressions in an analysis statement are referring to their own semantic structures.
