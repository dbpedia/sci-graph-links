Abstract This paper examines some of the figures through which ambivalence is transposed into ambiguity. It raises the following questions: How has work on ambivalence shifted from the philosophy and anthropology of religion to individual psychology to group psychology, and then, across some ruptures, to poetics—and how has it been able to slide between them? How is it possible that it is devalued as primitive, pre-rational thinking on the one hand, and valued as evincing the highest cognitive, imaginative, and aesthetic faculties on the other? I will approach these questions from primarily two sites: firstly, from psychoanalysis encompassing both the ontogenetic history individual psychic formation, and the phylogenetic history of cultural-societal formations, and, secondly, from aesthetic theory. The complex transcriptions mediating between these distinct sites belie a the simple charge of the “psychologisation of religious experience” in late modernity (Agamben).
