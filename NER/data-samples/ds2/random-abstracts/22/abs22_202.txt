Abstract. We consider the possibility that photons of noncommutative U(1) gauge theory can make bound states. Using the potential model, developed based on the constituent gluon picture of QCD glue-balls, arguments are presented in favor of the existence of these bound states. The basic ingredient of the potential model is that the self-interacting massless gauge particles may get mass by the inclusion of non-perturbative effects. PACS. 02.40.Gh, 11.10.Nx, 12.20.-m
