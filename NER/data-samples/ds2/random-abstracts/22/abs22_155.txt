Abstract A contextual and comparative analysis shows that Dedekind and Frege do not understand the terms “logic” and “arithmetic” in the same way. More specifically the meaning and the scope of the corresponding concepts are essentially different for them. Consequently Dedekind and Frege have different conceptions of the relationship between arithmetic and logic.
