Abstract Where does Finnish science education come from? Where will it go? The following outside view reflects on relations, which Finns consider “normal” (and thus unrecognizable in introspection) in science education. But what is “normal” in Finnish culture cannot be considered “normal” for science education in other cultures, for example in Germany. The following article will trace the central ideas, which had a larger influence in the development of this difference. The question is, if and why the Finnish uniqueness in the philosophy of science education is empirically important. This puts Finnish science education into the perspective of a more general epistemological debate around Ernst Mach’s Erkenntnistheorie (a German term similar to the meaning of history and philosophy of science, though more general; literally translated “cognition/knowledge theory”). From this perspective, an outlook will be given on open questions within the epistemology of Finnish science education. Following such questions could lead to the adaptation of the “successful” ideas in Finnish science education (indicated by empirical studies, such as the OECD PISA study) as well as the further development of the central ideas of Finnish science education.
