Summary The extent to which PS(PS) meson theory is compatible with the almost conserved current hypothesis is examined. It is shown that a well-behaved almost conserved axial current cannot be constructed for PS(PS) theory. Nonlocal almost conserved currents are introduced which appear to satisfy the almost conserved current hypothesis for matrix elements not diagonal in the energy momentum.
