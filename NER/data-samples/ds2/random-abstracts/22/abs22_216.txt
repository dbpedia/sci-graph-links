Abstract Confucianism, Daoism, and the Art of War present pragmatic and strategic philosophies. These philosophies are predicated upon a synthetic concept of person in-the-world. More specifically, these philosophies present prescriptions and methodologies for how one ought to conduct oneself as a person-in-the-world. To be a person-in-the-world is to be an ecological self. Accordingly, the philosophies of Confucianism, Daoism, and the Art of War contain and express an ecological self understanding. The intention of this essay is to disclose this ecological selfÂ understanding in the context of classical Confucianism, Daoism, and the Art of War.
