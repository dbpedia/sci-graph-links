Abstract This essay will contrast two forms of intellectual dishonesty where cultural and ethical decisions are made, but there may be problems and challenges. Academic (or intellectual) dishonesty presents ethical challenges for the disciplines of psychology and social psychology. Further challenges are implied for the teaching of pastoral psychology, where ontological judgments about human nature are inferred. The making of academic, cultural, and ethical decisions, whether wittingly or unwittingly is a serious intellectual task that helps to determine character, thought, behavior, value, meaning, and destiny of emerging selves in community.
