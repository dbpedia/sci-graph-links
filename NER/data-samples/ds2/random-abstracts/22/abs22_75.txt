Abstract In this paper we consider the expansions of logics of a left-continuous t-norm with truth-constants from a subalgebra of the rational unit interval. From known results on standard semantics, we study completeness for these propositional logics with respect to chains defined over the rational unit interval with a special attention to the completeness with respect to the canonical chain, i.e. the algebra over $$[0,1] \cap {{\mathbb{Q}}}$$ where each truth-constant is interpreted in its corresponding rational truth-value. Finally, we study rational completeness results when we restrict ourselves to deductions between the so-called evaluated formulae.
