Summary A number of constant features can be ascribed to patients who have a ring 14 chromosome. Recent publications have described pigmentation of the retinal/macular area of the eye and suggested that it may also be a constant feature of the syndrome. We describe a patient who has a ring 14 with a terminal delection but no retinal pigmentation and compare our case with other informative cases. We suggest that a region on chromosome 14 proximal to q32.2 may be involved in controlling these changes.
