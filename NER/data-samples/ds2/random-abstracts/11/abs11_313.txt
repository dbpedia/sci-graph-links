Abstract A 5-year-old girl was admitted with pallor, hypopigmented sparse hair, tongue ulcers, atrophic nail changes, hypoplastic anemia and bilateral exudative retinopathy. A diagnosis of Revesz syndrome was made. She had the additional features of retinal detachment and retinitis pigmentosa, which are hitherto unreported in this syndrome.
