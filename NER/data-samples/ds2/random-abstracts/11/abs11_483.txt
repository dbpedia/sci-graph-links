Abstract PurposeThe purpose of the study was to determine factors correlated with the progression of irreversible visual disturbance in Behcet's disease (BD) with ocular involvement. MethodsForty-seven BD patients with ocular inflammation, who presented with the first ocular episode, and who had been followed continuously for 5–10 years in our hospital, were studied. Charts were reviewed for gender, onset age of uveitis, complete or incomplete type BD, HLA-B51 status, final visual acuity at the last remission period, mean number of ocular attacks per year, and clinical findings of iridocyclitis with profuse hypopyon, strong vitreous opacity blocking the observation of retinal vessels, diffuse retinal vasculitis, and exudates with hemorrhage within the retinal vascular arcade. ResultsPatients with a visual acuity of ≤20/200 and those with >20/200 differed significantly in the mean number of ocular attacks per year and clinical findings of strong vitreous opacity and exudates within the retinal vascular arcade, but not with regard to the other factors. In addition, the frequency of ocular attacks showed a significant negative correlation with the outcome of visual acuity. Logistic regression analysis indicated a significant association of an average of more than three ocular attacks per year, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates within the retinal vascular arcade with poor visual outcome. ConclusionsThis study indicates that more than three ocular attacks per year, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates within the retinal vascular arcade are the risk and prognostic factors for a poor outcome of visual acuity in BD patients.
