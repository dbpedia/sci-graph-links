Abstract The cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis has been considered as a potential source of several therapeutic compounds including antioxidant molecules such as phenolics. Several studies have demonstrated that the exposure to a particular stress factor, such as UV-light, is able to modify the quality and the quantity of polyphenols produced by A. platensis. In this study, we compare the effects of polyphenol extracts from A. platensis (PEAP) and from UV-stressed A. platensis (PEAPUV) on endothelial cells exposed to TNFα by evaluating the expression of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and key markers of endothelial dysfunction. MMP-9 activity was measured by gel zymography. Western Blot analysis was performed to analyze eNOS, iNOS and VCAM-1 expression and signal transduction. The major evidence of this study is that PEAPUV is more efficient than PEAP in counteracting the TNFα-induced endothelial activation. Treatment with PEAPUV (0.10 mgGAE/ml) restored to basal levels the TNFα-induced expression of eNOS, iNOS, VCAM-1 and MMP-9 and the TNFα- triggered activation of Akt. The use of an Akt inhibitor mimicked the inhibitory effects of PEAPUV on eNOS and MMP-9 expression, suggesting that eNOS and MMP-9 induction by TNFα depends on Akt activation and that PEAPUV exerts its vaso-protective effect through Akt signalling inhibition. HPLC analysis confirmed a different composition both in polyphenols’ quality and in quantity of the two extracts. In conclusion, this study shows that a stress factor such as UV-light exposure leads to the production by A. platensis of molecules to potentially be used against the onset and progression of vascular diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction.
