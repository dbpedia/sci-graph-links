Abstract The relationship between overall plasma antioxidant activity and senile cataract was examined in 148 subjects aged 37â€“90 years. Antioxidant activity of plasma from 52 control and 96 patients with senile cataract was determined by a method which measures the capacity of plasma to inhibit auto-oxidation of bovine brain homogenate. In contrast to previous studies which demonstrated a relationship between decreased levels of antioxidant components in blood and the occurrence of lens opacities, the present study does not show any significant difference between subjects with and without senile cataract.
