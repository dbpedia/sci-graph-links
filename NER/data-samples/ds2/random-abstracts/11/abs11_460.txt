Abstract We evaluated neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser posterior capsulotomy procedure with or without anesthesia in 35 pediatric eyes and 51 adult eyes. We concluded that Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomies in children are similar to adults in general aspects and that Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy can be performed safely and effectively in children under topical or no anesthesia.
