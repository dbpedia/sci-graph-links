Summary PurposeIntravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab are the most used drugs for treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Repeated intravitreal injections represent an economic burden and may be associated with serious complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the number of needed injections within 1 year of treatment. Methods55 patients over 50 years of age with nAMD and visual acuity (VA) between 20/40 and 20/320 were included. Scheduled visits and treatment were performed monthly for 1 year. After a loading dose of three intravitreal injections (either ranibizumab = group 1 or bevacizumab = group 2), an “as needed” regimen was performed. Primary endpoint was a difference in the injection frequencies of ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Secondary endpoints were best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT). ResultsDifference in number of injections was not significant (5.00 ± 1.67 (ranibizumab group) vs. 5.80 ± 2.28 (bevacizumab group), p = 0.084). Mean BCVA was 59.12 ± 16.64 letters after 12 months if patients received ranibizumab (p = 0.001) and 64.75 ± 17.03 letters if patients received bevacizumab (p = 0.037). There was no statistical significance between the two groups (p = 0.631). The mean CRT did not differ significantly between groups after 12 months (315.67 ± 65.86 µm for ranibizumab, 350.47 ± 102.84 µm for bevacizumab, p = 0.088). ConclusionThere was no difference in number of treatment, BCVA and CRT after 1 year between ranibizumab and bevacizumab in patients with nAMD.
