Abstract Rosai–Dorfman disease (sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, SHML) is a rare, non-hereditary, benign histiocytic proliferative disorder, presenting as painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, with systemic symptoms. Extra nodal manifestations have been reported in 28–43 % cases with rare ocular involvement. We report a case of a 57 year old female presenting with gradual progressive decrease of vision OU since 8 months associated with epistaxis. Fundus examination revealed established optic atrophy in right eye with features of chronic papilloedema in left eye suggestive of compressive lesion. CT of brain, paranasal sinuses confirmed the presence of homogenously enhancing mass in left ethmoid sinus, left sphenoid sinus extending into suprasellar region. The biopsy of this mass revealed extra nodal SHML with tissue sections being S100 and CD68 positive with emperipolesis noted. Here we describe this atypical ocular presentation of extra nodal SHML to highlight that this rare disease can manifest as an aggressive sight threatening entity, even in older age group.
