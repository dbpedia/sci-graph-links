Abstract A simple technique is described whereby view-factors can be estimated for a person at locations where the building geometry is complex. Procedures are outlined for the construction of a polar diagram whose grid cells give equal person view-factors: the diagram is designed to overlay a fish-eye lens photograph, enabling the estimation of view-factors of distinctive surfaces in the photograph image for standing and seated people.
