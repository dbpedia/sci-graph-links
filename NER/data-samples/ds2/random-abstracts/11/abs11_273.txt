Summary Only three of the five types of monopolar cells which are present in each cartridge of the lamina have synaptic connections with receptor endings (R1â€“R6). Due to the distribution of their dendrites two of these (L1 and L2) contact the whole length of the six receptor endings of their cartridge whereas the third type (L3) contacts only their outer 2/3rds. Although these three cells may function as the second order neurons of the neurosuperposition eye, their anatomical relationship imply functional differences between them.
