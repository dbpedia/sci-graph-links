Summary The fine structure of the retina of Haliotis discus has been studied by means of electron microscopy. The visual cell has an apical projection which protrudes beyond the retinal surface into the ocellar cavity. The surface of this projection shows elaborate in- and outfoldings. Besides, two apposed laminae of the folded plasma membrane contact each other to form a quintuple-layered compound membrane. The analogy of this compound membrane system to the rhabdomere of the visual cell of Cephalopoda has been discussed. Subsurface endoplasmic reticulum and giant multivesicular bodies are also notable structures in Haliotis visual cells. The observations include the fine structure of supporting cells, plexiform layer, optic nerve and transitional zone of retina to epidermis.
