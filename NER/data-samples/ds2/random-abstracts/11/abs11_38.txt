Abstract PurposeTo estimate the presence and variability of retinal hypoxia in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). MethodHemoglobin oxygen saturation was measured in retinal vessels of both eyes in 14 patients with unilateral CRVO. The noninvasive spectrophotometric retinal oximeter is based on a fundus camera and simultaneously captures two images at 570 nm and 600 nm wavelengths. Five of the patients were followed with repeated retinal oximetry images over time. ResultsThe mean oxygen saturation in retinal venules was 31 % ±12 % in CRVO eyes and 52 % ±11 % in unaffected fellow eyes (mean ±SD, n = 14, p < 0.0001). The arteriovenous difference was 63 % ±11 % in eyes with CRVO and 43 % ±7 % in fellow eyes (p < 0.0001). The variability of retinal venous oxygen saturation was substantial within and between eyes affected by CRVO. Venular oxygen saturation improved with treatment and over time in all five patients that were followed. ConclusionCRVO eyes are hypoxic compared to fellow eyes and arteriovenous difference in hemoglobin oxygen saturation is increased. This is consistent with tissue hypoxia resulting from reduced blood flow. Further studies are needed to understand the correlation between hypoxia, severity of disease and prognosis.
