Summary BACKGROUND: A new surgical method of intravitreal tamponade with silicone oil suspended with acetylsalicylic acid (AS) was investigated for safety and efficiency in the treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathie. The study was designed as a prospective randomized, controlled double-blind Multicentre Study. METHODS: A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 29 eyes of 29 patients. In case a natural lens was present simultaneous phacoemulsification was obligatory. The control group received standard therapy vitreous tamponade with pure 5000centistoke silicone oil while the silicone oil was suspended with AS to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the study group. After 6 months follow up the tamponade was removed in all eyes. RESULTS: The safety of AS SiO could be demonstrated: the AS SiO was well tolerated and stayed clear during the study period of 6 months. The clinical examination revealed no signs of local or systemic adverse effects in the study eyes. The visual acuities were well matched before inclusion into the study and there was no evidence of significant differences during the follow up period and in final visual outcome between the two groups. The rate of redetachments defined as the primary outcome parameter was the same for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acetylsalicylic acid delivery by intravitreal silicone oil in the human eye was shown a safe method that may offer a delivery route for other antiproliferative agents into the posterior pole.
