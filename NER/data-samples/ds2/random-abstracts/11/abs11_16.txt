Abstract The collagen type Ι alpha Ι (COL1A1) gene encodes the extracellular matrix component, collagen, and resides in candidate MYP5 for high myopia on the chromosome 17q22–q23.3. This locus has recently been implicated in playing an important role in the pathogenesis of experimental myopia. We investigated the association of disruptions of COL1A1 gene with high myopia by analyzing the frequency of ten SNPs in a Japanese population of 330 subjects with high myopia of −9.25 D or less and 330 randomized controls without high myopia. Two SNPs (rs2075555 and rs2269336) were significantly associated with high myopia (P < 0.05, Pc < 0.1). Two different haplotype blocks in COL1A1 were observed by the pair-wise linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs. The frequency of GGC/GGC diplotype constructed by the three SNPs (rs2075555, rs2269336, rs1107946) was significantly high (OR = 1.6) and associated with high myopia (P = 0.028, Pc< 0.084). Together our results provide the first evidence for COL1A1 as a gene associated with high myopia.
