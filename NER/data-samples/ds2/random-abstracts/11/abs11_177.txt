Abstract Oxidative stress is implicated in various pathological conditions of the retina and optic nerve. Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) comprise a recently characterized family of antioxidant enzymes. To date, little information exists regarding the distribution of Prdxs in the eye. Herein, we employed a combination of qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to determine the level of expression and distribution of the six Prdx isoforms in the retina and optic nerve of the rat. In addition, we performed some parallel analyses on the common marmoset (Callithrix Jacchus). In the rat, all of the Prdx transcripts were expressed in relatively high amounts in both retina and optic nerve, with abundances ranging from approximately 3–50 % of the level of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin. With regard to protein expression, each isoform was detected in the retina and optic nerve by either Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry. Excepting Prdx4, there was a good correspondence between the rodent and primate results. In the retina, Prdx1 and Prdx2 were principally localized to neurons in the inner nuclear layer and cone photoreceptors, Prdx3 and Prdx5 displayed characteristic mitochondrial immunolabeling, while Prdx6 was associated with astrocytes and Müller cells. In the optic nerve, Prdx1 was robustly expressed by oligodendrocytes, Prdx3 and Prdx5 were observed in axons, and Prdx6 was restricted to astrocytes. The present findings augment our understanding of the distribution and expression of the Prdxs in the retina and optic nerve of rodents and primates and lay the foundation for subsequent analysis of their involvement in relevant blinding diseases.
