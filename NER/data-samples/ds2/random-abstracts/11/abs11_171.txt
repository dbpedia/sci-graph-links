Summary Each sessile eye comprises about 60 ommatidia with large lenses (diameter 100–150 μm), spherical crystalline cones, and hypertrophied rhabdoms (diameter about 100 μm). The cones are formed by two main cone cells, and in addition two accessory cone cells are present. Seven retinula cells contribute to the rhabdom, which is fused distally and open proximally (separated rhabdomeres). A special cell type, previously designated ‘hyaline cells’ are shown to be reflecting pigment cells. These cells form a well-developed tapetal layer. Distal pigment cells screen neighbouring ommatidia. Further, the eye is delimited by two membranes homologous to the fenestrated and eye capsule membranes present in several other isopod groups. The hypertrophied rhabdoms and the elaborate tapetal layer separate the morphology of the Cirolana eye from that of other isopod eyes. These structural features makes the Cirolana eye a case of convergent development with several other deep water living crustaceans.
