Abstract The three-dimensional architecture of the collagen fibrillar network forming the lamina cribrosa of the optic disc and the associated septal plates of the anterior part of the optic nerve was investigated using monkey eyeballs treated by the NaOH cell-maceration procedure and scanning electron microscopy. Arising from the scleral collagen fibrils branches joined together to form thick bundles of collagen in lamina plates encompassing hundreds of pores. More than ten plates were observed stacked on top of each other forming the pore channels. Adjacent piled up plates were interconnected with branching collagen fibrils. Septal plates derived from pia mater collagen fibrils were formed by radially and obliquely arranged thick bundles of collagen piled up longitudinally in the optic nerve and merging into the most posterior lamina plate. In the septal plates many ovally shaped windows were observed, suggesting branching and regional irregularity in the shape of the myelinated nerve fiber bundle. Pia mater and dura mater collagen fibrils of the optic nerve merged into the outer layer of the scleral collagen fibris. The present results suggest that the observed three-dimensional network of collagen fibrils constitutes the skeletal framework of these tissues maintaining their morphological specificity and providing a suitable microenvironment for their physiological functions.
