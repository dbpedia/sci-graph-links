Summary The early morphogenesis of the eye-antennal disc ofDrosophila in response to 20-hydroxy ecdysone involves the curling of the eye anlagen dorsally over the antenna. During this process, the area of the peripodial membrane is substantially reduced. The peripodial membrane is taut at this stage, and if it is cut the curling of the disc cannot continue, and the eye anlagen returns to its original position within one minute of the operation. In contrast, cutting the columnar epithelium between the eye and antennal anlagen does not disrupt curling, but actually facilitates it. During curling, the cells of the peripodial membrane appear healthy, and exhibit basal extensions. We suggest that the curling of the eye is mediated by the conversion of cuboidal peripodial membrane cells into pseudostratified columnar epithelium at the edges of the peripodial membrane. Subsequently, cells of the peripodial membrane secrete first a pupal cuticle, and then an imaginal cuticle.
