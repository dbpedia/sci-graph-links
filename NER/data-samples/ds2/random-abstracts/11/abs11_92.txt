Abstract We report a clinicopathological correlation of a 12-year-old female child who manifested as retinoblastoma clinically and radiologically but turned out to have acute panopthalmitis on histopathological examination. The authors feel that there is significant clinical implication in sharing the knowledge of this clinicopathological correlation. A 12-year-old female child born out of a consanguineous marriage reported to us with bilateral blindness. She was evaluated clinically. Ultrasound B mode and computerized tomogram (CT) examination were done. Based on all the inputs, right eye enucleation was performed, and the same was subjected to a histopathology examination. The patient had proptosis of the right eye with (LE) calcification of the lens. CT scan revealed irregular thickening of the right globe with heterogeneous uveoscleral enhancement. The vitreous showed irregular hyperdense thickening with multiple calcifications. There was mild thickening of the retrobulbar optic nerve and tendinous insertions of extraocular muscles. The right eye was enucleated, and its histopathology examination revealed panophthalmitis with intraocular ossification. The right globe revealed no evidence of malignancy. Painful blind eye is a major therapeutic dilemma for an ophthalmologist. Radiological findings of irregular thickening of sclera, vitreous with calcifications, and optic nerve thickening are highly suggestive of retinoblastoma. In our patient, we wanted to share the differential diagnosis of acute panopthalmitis which masqueraded as retinoblastoma.
