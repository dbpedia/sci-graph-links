Abstract This present study aimed to evaluate the corneal endothelium after implantation of angle-fixed anterior chamber lenses in myopic phakic eyes. Twelve eyes (9 patients) with high myopia (more than −14 diopters) were implanted with ZB5M lenses (Domilens, France). The corneal endothelium was studied by fluorophotometry (endothelial transfer coefficient: kc.ca), specular microscopy and ultrasonic pachimetry. Tests were performed prior to and 3 and 6 months after the surgery. The Wilcoxon rank test was used for the statistical analysis of the data. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the preoperative kc.ca (4.15 ± 0.72 × 10−3 min−1) and the kc.ca three months after the implantation (4.43 ± 0.87 × 10−3 min−1). A statistically significant difference (p<0.01) was also found between the three and six months postoperative kc.ca (5.31 ± 0.81 × 10−3 min−1). There was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the preoperative central endothelial cell density (2533 ± 219 cells/mm2) and the six months postoperative central endothelial cell density (2385 ± 191 cells/mm2). No significant differences were found in relation to the central corneal thickness. In conclusion, three months after the implantation of ZB5M lenses to correct high myopia in phakic eyes, the corneal endothelial function was altered and continued to be so six months after the operation.
