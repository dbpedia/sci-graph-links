Summary The ommatidia in the dorsal eye of male Bibio marci (March flies) are comprised of eight retinula cells (R1–8). In the distal region, the open rhabdomeres of retinula cells 1–6 are arranged in a symmetrically circular pattern with their microvilli directed radially. Immediately beneath the crystalline cone, cell 7 forms a rhabdomere that is about 1 μm long and lies in the center of the circle formed by the rhabdomeres of cells 1–6. For the remaining length of an ommatidium it is replaced by the rhabdomere of retinula cell 8. The cell body of this retinula cell almost encloses its own rhabdomere by forming a deep invagination. Consequently, no ommatidial cavity is present. In the left eye rhabdomeres R 3, 5 and 6 first twist clockwise along their longitudinal axes, while rhabdomeres R1, 2, 4 and 8 twist counterclockwise. Opposite twisting is observed in the right eye. The twist rate varies along the length of the rhabdomeres. In a middle region of 60 μm, within which the direction of twist does not change, the maximal twist rates are approximately 2°–5°/μm in R1–6 and even higher in R 8. In a proximal region, the direction of twist is reversed, but the initial orientation of the microvilli not reestablished. Both the cross-sectional shape of the rhabdomeres and their geometric arrangement in the retinula change along with the twisting. It is substantiated that the rhabdomeric twist is not due to artifactual deformation.
