Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is the common cause of optic neuritis. Fingolimod, an immunosuppressive agent, is used in MS to prevent acute exacerbations. We report a case of relapsingâ€“remitting MS treated with fingolimod. The patient presented with an acute decrease in vision in the left eye. Eye examination showed clinical macular edema (ME) in the left eye, which was confirmed on fluorescein angiogram and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After discontinuation of fingolimod and treatment with topical corticosteroid medication, there was complete resolution of the ME. The ME as a side-effect of fingolimod is reversible after discontinuing, which was seen on OCT.
