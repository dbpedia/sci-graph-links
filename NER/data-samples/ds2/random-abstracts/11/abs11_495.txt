Abstract We examined the effects of age on RNA and lipid formation by whole retina and optic nerve in vitro. Male Wistar rats, aged 4, 12, and 24 mo, were used. From the results obtained the following conclusions may be drawn:1.In assaying the lipid biosynthesis during aging, a striking difference between the retina and optic nerve clearly emerged;2.In isolated retina, [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA was relatively constant at the three ages, whereas both [14C]palmitate and [3H]choline incorporation into lipids showed a substantial increase in rats at 24 mo of age compared with those at 4 mo;3.In contrast, in the optic nerve of the oldest rats, compared with the youngest, a significant decrease of [14C]acetate and [14C]palmitate incorporation into acylglycerols, cerebrosides, and phospholipids was found. Each fatty acid precursor label was incorporated to a proportion that reflected the typical acyl group composition of individual lipids;4.Following labeling of the optic nerve with [3H]choline, the specific radioactivity of choline-containing phospholipids was drastically decreased with increasing rat age; and5.The incorporation of [2-3H]glycerol into optic nerve diacylglycerols, PtdEtn, and PtdIns declined with age, whereas no significant change took place in the incorporation into PtdCho. The results strongly support the concept that RNA metabolism of rat retina (most likely photoreceptor cell layer) is not altered during aging; on the contrary, phospholipid synthesis is stimulated in comparison with that of the optic nerve, for which a serious impairment was concomitantly observed. The physiological significance of these responses, and the mechanism by which retinal tissue is spared from the general age derangement of the nervous system, remain to be defined.
