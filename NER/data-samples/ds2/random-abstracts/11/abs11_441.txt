Abstract Autonomic nerve function in the anterior segment of the eye was assessed by measurement of the pupil cycle time in 189 patients with ocular hypertension and 70 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Parasympathetic dysfunction was significantly present in ocular hypertensive patients with narrow irido-corneal angles, though not in wide-angle subjects. The results are discussed, with particular reference to the accumulating evidence implicating autonomic dysfunction as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of the primary glaucomas.
