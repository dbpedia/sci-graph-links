Abstract The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical outcomes and safety of intracameral bevacizumab during trabeculectomy in eyes with neovascular glaucoma. Pilot study included four eyes (four patients) with refractory neovascular glaucoma submitted to fornix-based trabeculectomy with adjunctive use of bevacizumab in the anterior chamber during the procedure. Patients were previously treated with panretinal photocoagulation as standard therapy. Variables evaluated were intraocular pressure, bleb appearance, iris neovascularization, intraoperative/postoperative complications, and visual outcomes. No intraoperative complication was observed. The mean follow-up period was 12.75 (range, 12–15 months). All eyes showed significant intraocular pressure control postoperatively. Iris neovascularization reduced significantly within 1 month after surgery. Mild anterior chamber inflammation was observed during follow-up in all eyes. No significant postoperative complication was observed, and no patient presented visual acuity deterioration. Intracameral bevacizumab may be used as an adjunctive therapy during trabeculectomy in eyes with neovascular glaucoma.
