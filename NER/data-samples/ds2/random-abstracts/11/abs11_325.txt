Summary BackgroundThe aim of this study was to evaluate the rates of post-cataract-surgery endophthalmitis after prophylactic intracameral moxifloxacin administration. MethodsIn this retrospective descriptive study, 1013 uncomplicated cataract surgeries with intraocular lens implantation were performed between March 2009 and November 2013 by one surgeon (AP). Each patient received an intracameral injection of 0.05 ml undiluted 0.5% moxifloxacin for prophylaxis of postoperative infection. ResultsThe mean follow-up of patients was 1 year (range: 2 months to 4 years), and the mean age of the patients was 64.2 years (range: 38–99 years). Of the 1013 patients, 617 (58.6%) were women. No case of endophthalmitis occurred. ConclusionNo postoperative endophthalmitis was observed after the intracameral injection of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution during routine cataract surgery.
