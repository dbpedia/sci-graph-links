Abstract We conducted a prospective study on 35 consecutive eyes undergoing cataract extraction to compare the Guyton-Minkowski Potential Acuity Meter (PAM) and the Laser Interferometer (LI) in determining potential visual acuity. The eyes were divided into: group A, which had good visualization of optic disc details, and group B, whose media allowed only disc outline or less to be seen. We found that in group A eyes, both instruments were reliable (with accuracies of 94% for the PAM and 88% for the LI). However, in group B eyes (advanced cataracts), both instruments were unreliable (accuracies of 33% for the PAM and 53% for the LI). Interestingly, in a subgroup of high myopes (axial length >29 mm) with moderate cataracts and poor visual acuties, both instruments were very reliable and helpful in determining how much of the vision loss was due to the cataracts. We therefore strongly recommend potential acuity testing in high myopes with moderate cataracts and poor visual acuity.
