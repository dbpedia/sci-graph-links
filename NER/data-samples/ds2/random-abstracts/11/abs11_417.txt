Abstract Aspergillus terreus was isolated from a case of Keratomycosis. The patient, a 50 year old, female presented with a large corneal ulcer with hypopyon. The direct microscopic examination of the scrapings revealed hyaline, thin, septate and branched hyphae. In vitro some antimycotics (amphotericin B,5-fluorocytosine, oxiconazole, amorolfine and ketoconazole) were tested against A. terreus by agar dilution method. Ketoconazole with MIC of 3 gmg/ml after 7 days of incubation was most effective followed by oxiconazole (10μg/ml). Experimental corneal ulcer was produced by injecting intralamellary 0.1 ml of the spore suspension containing 10×106 cfu/ml into the eyes of previously immunocompressed albino rabbits. Histopathologic examination showed infiltration and large destruction of the corneal stroma. Subconjunctival oxiconazole therapy exhibited complete cure. Based on our findings, a clinical evaluation of oxiconazole in human keratomycosis seems to be justified.
