Abstract A 45-year-old-man, the product of a first-cousin relationship, complained of night blindness. His right eye has signs of early-stage retinitis pigmentosa. His left eye, which had suffered a corneal infection in childhood, had poor visual acuity, corneal opacity, corneoiridal adhesion, normal retina, and a normal electroretinographic response. The retinitis pigmentosa is likely an autosomal recessive trait, and the retinal lesion in the left eye may have been delayed by light deprivation produced by the corneal abnormalities.
