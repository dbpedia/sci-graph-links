Abstract A 4-year-old, female Pakistani goat was referred to the veterinary teaching hospital for first pregnancy check up. At the time of presentation, the case was apparently healthy. Incidentally, the clinicians noticed the abnormality in the left eye. A precise ophthalmic examination revealed ptosis, entropion, nictitating membrane prolapse, enophthalmos, and miosis in the left eye, whereas the eyelids and pupil were normal on the right side. The left eye lacked palpebral reflex, and the menace response seemed to be decreased. Pupillary light reflex was present in both eyes. The eyes did not show any evidence of trauma and irritation. The cornea appears to be healthy and transparent. On direct ophthalmoscopy, no gross abnormality was found in the eyeball. Unilateral facial palsy of the left side was prominently noticed, as the muzzle was deviated toward the contralateral side. A careful otoscopic examination revealed no evidence of otitis externa. Moreover, results of complete hematological and serum biochemical profiles were normal. In this goat, no other significant abnormalities were detected in physical examination. Detailed history delineated normal vision in both eyes, normal posture, and normal behavior. According to the clinical signs, a diagnosis of unilateral facial nerve paralysis as well as concurrent Hornerâ€™s syndrome was made. However, the exact etiology of these conditions remained unknown. The case was discharged without any treatment, and it was recommended to apply lubricating eye drops to prevent moisture from leaving the cornea.
