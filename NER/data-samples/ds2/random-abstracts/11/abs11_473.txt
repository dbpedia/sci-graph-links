Abstract BackgroundWe are reporting a case of granulomatous panuveitis in the right eye following penetrating injury to the left eye. FindingsA 34-year-old female was diagnosed to have sympathetic ophthalmia on treatment with systemic steroids. Vision did not improve in spite of aggressive systemic steroid therapy. On examination, patient had large retinal pigment epithelial rip nasal to the disc with exudative retinal detachment which was documented with FFA, ICG, and OCT. RPE rip is responsible for the persistent exudative retinal detachment in the right eye. ConclusionsRPE rip can cause decreased vision due to persistence of retinal detachment in a case of sympathetic ophthalmia.
