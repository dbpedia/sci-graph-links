Abstract The band-legged ground cricket Pteronemobius nigrofasciatus shows a clear photoperiodic response at 25°C with respect to the control of the induction of embryonic diapause. When crickets were reared under a short-day (LD 12 ∶ 12) photoperiod and then transferred to a long-day (LD 16 ∶ 8) photoperiod upon adult emergence, the adults mainly laid nondiapause eggs. However, adults maintained continuously under short-day conditions laid dispause eggs. When compound eyes were bilaterally removed after adult emergence, the crickets mainly laid nondiapause eggs, irrespective of the photoperiod. Thus, the adults completely lost their sensitivity to photoperiod after bilateral removal of their compound eyes. Unilateral removal of the compound eye also affected the crickets under a short-day photoperiod, and the incidence of diapause eggs was intermediate between that laid by intact adults and that laid by adults after the bilateral removal of compound eyes. The incidence of diapause eggs in sham-operated crickets was not significantly different from that in intact crickets under both sets of photoperiodic conditions. These results show that P. nigrofasciatus perceives the photoperiod through its compound eyes.
