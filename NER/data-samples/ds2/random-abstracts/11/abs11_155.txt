Abstract A new in vitro test was developed to assess the trypanocidal activity of compounds against axenically grownTrypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms. Trypanosomes from continuous culture were exposed to series of drug dilutions in a microtiter plate. After an incubation time of 72 h at 37° C, the pH indicator of the medium had changed its colour in non-inhibited cultures due to the production of pyruvate. Inhibited cultures showed less, if any, colour changes. Plates could be read by eye or using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader. Within the pH range of 7.0–7.5, the extinction values of phenol red at 560 nm showed a linear correlation with both the pH of the medium and the pyruvate concentration in the medium. By comparison of the decreases in extinction in test cultures with those in control cultures, IC50 values (drug concentrations causing 50% inhibition) could be determined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) could be read by eye. The photometric test evaluation was compared with evaluation according to growth inhibition or to incorporation of radiolabelled hypoxanthine. The three methods of evaluation gave similar results.
