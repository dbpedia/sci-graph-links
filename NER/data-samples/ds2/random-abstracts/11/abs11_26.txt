Summary The optic tracts and centres of optic terminals of Rana temporaria have been investigated with silver impregnation techniques after unilaterally cutting the optic nerve and autoradiographically after injection of a mixture of tritiated amino acids into the vitreous body of the left eye. The observations on the course of the optic tracts and on the optic terminals in the thalamus and optic tectum are to a great extent in agreement with those of other authors. The probability of a retino-preoptic pathway is supported by the detection of fibres running in dorsal direction in front of the place where the optic nerve penetrates the brain. In horizontal sections these fibres can be seen deviating from the optic tract, covering a short distance in frontal direction and then turning upward under an angle of about 90 degrees. They disappear between the ventral aldehyde-fuchsin positive cells of the preoptic nucleus. The ventral and median parts of the ipsilateral preoptic nucleus contain fragments of degenerated fibres. Autoradiographic data are also in favour of the presence of an ipsilateral retino-preoptic tract. After carefully counting the number of grains over left and right preoptic nucleus, it appeared that over the ventral and median parts of the left preoptic nucleus more grains occur than over the identical areas of the right one.
