Summary The pigmented eyes of the oncomiracidium of the monogenean skin parasite Entobdella soleae are rhabdomeric in nature, the smaller anterior eyes each containing a single rhabdomere and the larger posterior eyes each containing two rhabdomeres. Each eye has a lens and a single cup-shaped pigment cell. There are differences in the arrangement of the microvilli in the rhabdomeres of the anterior and posterior eyes. Microvilli from each side of the anterior retinular cell are convergent. In each rhabdomere of the posterior eyes most of the microvilli lie parallel to each other but their direction is perpendicular to that of the microvilli of the adjacent posterior rhabdomere. The retinular cell leaves the eye between the pigment cell and the lens, and the retinular cell nucleus lies outside the eye. The darkbrown pigment in the pigment cell was identified as melanin. The lens contains carbohydrate and possibly protein but tests for fat were negative.
