Summary The architecture of normal and regenerating nerve fiber bundles in the optic nerve of the goldfish and the Crucian carp was compared to that of the axonal fascicles in the optic tectum of these teleost species with the use of ultrathin sections and freeze-fracture replicas. The fascicles in the optic nerve are clearly demarcated by astrocytic processes, in contrast to the fascicles in the tectum. No astrocytes could be identified in the tectum; in this region processes of astrocytes or of radial glial cells do not form channeling structures reminiscent of those in the optic nerve. Furthermore, tectal blood vessels lack complete investments of glial processes. It can be assumed that at least in lower vertebrates a framework of astrocytic processes might be important for growth of optic fibers over large distances, i.e., from the eye to the tectum, but may be dispensable in the target region itself.
