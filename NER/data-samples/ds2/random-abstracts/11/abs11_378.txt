Abstract Health care professionals perform ophthalmoscopic examinations to detect pathologies of the eye, as well as to evaluate the effects of other diseases, such as high-blood pressure and diabetes. The ophthalmoscopic examination is given using an ophthalmoscope, a hand-held instrument consisting of an adjustable lens and a focused beam of light. The difficulty of the procedure lies in positioning the ophthalmoscope accurately and then correctly identifying the ocular disease symptoms â€” skills that improve with experience. To improve and accelerate the training of the student, we developed aVirtual Ophthalmoscopic Examination, a three-dimensional real-time computer simulation of the ophthalmoscopic procedure using virtual reality techniques. By navigating and manipulating the virtual ophthalmoscope in the simulation environment, the student learns how to position the instrument properly. Unlike other training aids that use photographic slides to show the full retina, theVirtual Opthalmoscopic Examination programme simulates an accurate view of the retina. By increasing the realism of the training, the transition from the training programme to live examination of patients will become less difficult. The programme was evaluated by graduate nursing students and was shown to be a promising training aid.
