Abstract The objective of the study was to determine the effect of oral fluoxetine on intraocular pressure (IOP) in ocular normotensive dogs. Fifteen crossbreed dogs were used in this study. Dogs were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 8) and control (n = 7) groups. The dogs in the treatment group received fluoxetine orally at dosage of 1 mg/kg, and dogs in the control group received placebo orally once daily for 14 days. Applanation tonometry was performed on both eyes of all dogs prior to treatment, and then on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 during fluoxetine treatment. Mean IOP was not significantly altered in any eye at any time point during the treatment period compared with baseline evaluations. In conclusion, orally administered fluoxetine does not significantly increase IOP in nonglaucomatous dogs when administered over a 2-week period.
