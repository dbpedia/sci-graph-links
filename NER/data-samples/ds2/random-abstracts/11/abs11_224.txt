Abstract  Background: To investigate retinal capillary blood flow characteristics in patients with age-related maculopathy (ARM). Methods: Retinal capillary blood volume (VOL), blood flow (FLOW), and velocity (VEL) were measured in four macular sectors (I, II, III, IV) and in two areas beyond the temporal superior and inferior major vessel arcades (V and VI) in: 10 eyes with early ARM (drusen ≥63 µm and/or atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, RPE, <175 µm and/or proliferation of RPE), 13 with late ARM (exudative), 10 with late ARM (fibrotic), 14 normal eyes of 14 children of patients with ARM, and in 4 age- and sex-matched control groups using the Heidelberg retinal flowmeter (HRF). Statistical analysis was performed with the exact Wilcoxon test using an additional adjustment procedure by Bonferroni-Holm. Results: As compared to the control group, there was no significant change of VOL, FLOW, and VEL in patients with early ARM. In patients with late ARM (exudative), there was a significant higher FLOW in sectors I, II, and IV and a higher VOL and VEL in sectors III and IV. The group with late ARM (fibrotic) showed a reduction of VOL and FLOW in sectors I–IV and of VEL in sectors II and IV. In children of ARM patients, VOL, FLOW, and VEL of sectors I–VI did not differ from the control group. Conclusion: HRF measurements in patients with ARM indicate an increased macular retinal capillary blood flow in patients with the exudative form of late ARM and a decreased macular perfusion in those with the fibrotic form.
