Summary The eye of the slugAthoracophorus bitentaculatus has a singular feature, namely, unusually long receptoral processes, bearing thousands of microvilli, that extend from the distal ends of the type I sensory cells toward the lens. It is concluded that this hypertrophy of the photoreceptoral apparatus is useful to this nocturnal mollusk that nightly ascends trees to forage and returns “home” at dawn to hide from the light of day. Other ultrastructural features of the eye are described, some of which are similar to and some unlike those of other gastropod eyes.
