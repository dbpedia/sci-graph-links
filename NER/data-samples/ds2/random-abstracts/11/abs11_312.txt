Abstract The paper describes the study carried out on a sample of 27 coronary artery disease patients, aiming to determine a correlation between coronary artery disease and anomalies in the retinal circulation. Patients underwent selective coronary arteriography and fundus fluorescein angiography that allowed us to investigate the dye dynamics and to detect abnormalities of time evolution, vessel walls, and flux. During the fluorescein angiography we measured time events as the choroidal flush (ta) the start of the laminar phase (tb), and the end of the laminar phase (tc) and we took pictures that were digitally processed in order to compute the ROI1/ROI2 value, assumed as a numerical index of ischemia of the optic disc. In the examined sample we found ta=61±109, tb=65±107, tc=159±155, and ROI1/ROI2=0.968±0.300. Normal ranges for these parameters were determined by the fundus fluorescein angiography of a control group of 10 patients, unaffected by coronary artery disease and ischemic pathology of the retinal network; we found ta=12±4, tb=16±8.5, tc=44±9.3, and ROI1/ROI2=0.735±0.086. Eighty-five percent of coronaropatic patients showed ischemia of the optic disc, 89% anomalies of the epi-peripapillar network, 70% anomalies of the papillo-macular network, and 89% evidence of at least two findings of ischemia; 85% of patients showed a value of ROI1/ROI2 out of the normal range. The unpaired Student'st-test between the coronaropatic and the control group does not show significant differences between ta and tb; on the contrary, those with coronary disease and the control group were statistically different for tc (p≤0.02). Moreover, we have found a correlation between the numerical index of optic disc ischemia and the severity of coronary artery disease (r=0.68,p≤0.01). Hence, the vascular abnormalities shown by the fluorescein angiography can constitute valid noninvasive markers and can advise further cardiological tests for a coronary artery disease not yet diagnosed.
