Summary An area of cell death is apparent in the lens vesicle margin and the lens stalk during closure and detachment of the lens anlage from the cephalic ectoderm. Free phagocytic cells closely associated with this area of cell death have been interpreted as cells migrating from the lens epithelium. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, light-microscopic histochemical staining for acid phosphatase and immunostaining using MB1 (a monoclonal antibody specific for quail endothelial and hemopoietic cells) of chimeras of chick embryo and quail yolk sac were used to analyze these lens vesicle-associated free phagocytic cells. The cells have morphological features identical to those of macrophages in other embryonic tissues. In contrast to epithelial cells phagocytosing cell debris, they exhibit strong acid phosphatase activity, a feature typical of macrophages. In addition, free phagocytic cells are MB1 positive in chick embryo-quail yolk sac chimeras, hence they proceed from cells of hemangioblastic lineage originating in the yolk sac. These results indicate that the lens vesicle-associated free phagocytic cells are macrophages. Observations of MB1 positive amoeboid cells in the juxta-retinal mesenchyme and on the borders of the optic cup suggest that these macrophages migrate through the mesenchyme surrounding the eye primordium. Macrophages are seen in both the interspace between lens vesicle and ectoderm and in the lumen of the lens as well as within both the ectoderm and the lens epithelium. In these locations they remove cell debris, and thereby contribute to the complete disappearance of the area of cell death. Macrophages remain in the lens vesicle-ectoderm interspace until developmental stages at which it is invaded by corneal endothelial cells.
