Summary Cebus monkeys were infected withHerpesvirus hominis type 1 or 2 by the corneal route in the right eye. The type 1 animals developed a keratoconjunctivitis approximately a week earlier than the type 2 animals. Although the duration of the type 1 lesions was more prolonged, there was no difference in the severity of the lesions between the two types. Lesions in the contralateral eye developed in all the animals although virus was not isolated. Virus was recovered from the lacrimal secretions of the infected eye and throat swabs. The animals exhibited a rise in serum neutralizing antibody to the homologous virus.
