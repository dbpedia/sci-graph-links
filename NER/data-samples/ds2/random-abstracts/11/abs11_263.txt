Summary Immuno-gold labeling at the electron-microscopy level was used to investigate the distribution of tropoelastin in the chick eye. Intense staining was found in the amorphous part of mature elastic fibers in different regions of the organ. In elaunin fibers, both the amorphous core and the surrounding microfibrils were clearly labeled. In addition, reactive sites were detected in the oxitalan fibers of the stroma of the cornea and in Descemet's membrane, which showed a gradient of reactive sites increasing from the center toward the periphery. Oxitalan fibers of the stroma often fused with Descemet's membrane; the pattern of immunological staining suggested a continuity between the two structures. In the ciliary zonule, labeling for tropoelastin was observed in discrete areas on the bundles of microfibrils. The results show a complex structural organization of elastic tissue; this may be important in endowing the various parts of the eye with different mechanical properties.
