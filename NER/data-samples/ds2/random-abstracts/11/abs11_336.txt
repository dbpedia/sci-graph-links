Abstract Taurine and zinc exert neurotrophic effects. Zinc modulates Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters. This study examined the effect of zinc (ZnSO4) ex vivo and zinc chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) in vivo on [3H]taurine transport in goldfish retina. The effect of TPEN in vivo on taurine and zinc levels was determined. Isolated cells were incubated in Ringer with zinc (0.1–100 μM). Taurine transport was done with taurine (0.001–1 mM) and 50 nM [3H]taurine. Zinc (100 μM) noncompetitively inhibited taurine transport. TPEN was administered intraocularly and retinas extracted 3, 5 and 10 days later. Taurine was determined by HPLC (nmol/mg protein) and zinc by spectrophotometry ICP (mg/mg protein). Taurine and zinc levels decreased at 3 days and increased at 10 days after TPEN administration. At 10 days after intraocular TPEN, taurine transport affinity increased (K s = 0.018 ± 0.006 vs. 0.028 ± 0.008 mM). Apparently, zinc deficiency affects the taurine–zinc complex and taurine availability. The increased taurine uptake affinity by TPEN was possibly associated with a response to maximize retinal taurine content at low zinc concentration.
