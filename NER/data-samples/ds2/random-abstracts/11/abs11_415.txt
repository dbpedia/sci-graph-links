Abstract Keratitis due to Auerswaldia lignicola in a 32-year-old Indian male carpenter is described. At presentation, the patient reported persistent pain and tearing (left eye) in spite of topical antimicrobial therapy for more than 3 weeks. Clinically, mycotic keratitis was suspected, and direct microscopy of corneal scrapings stained by lactophenol cotton blue and Gram stains revealed broad septate hyphae. Intensive topical antifungal therapy was then given for 15 days. The keratitis continued to progress, necessitating therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. Following the keratoplasty, there was rapid reduction in inflammation and gradual quietening of the eye. Brown–black fungal colonies resembling Lasiodiplodia theobromae were isolated from corneal scrape and corneal button (post-surgery) material on Sabouraud glucose–neopeptone agar; however, sporulation did not occur, so the morphological identification could not be confirmed. Sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA region of extracted fungal genomic DNA yielded an identification of A. lignicola Ariyawansa, J.K. Liu & K.D. Hyde; the sequence data have been deposited in GenBank (A. lignicola strain DK/V4, accession number KC866317.1). Medical management of keratitis due to such rarely reported fungal species may be difficult, necessitating surgical procedures.
