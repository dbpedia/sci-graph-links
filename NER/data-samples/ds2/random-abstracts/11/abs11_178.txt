Summary 1.The anatomy and geometrical optics of the principal eyes of some neotropical jumping spiders are examined, with particular reference to the receptors of Layer I of the tiered retina. The consequence of small size and of low habitat illuminances for spatial acuity are assessed.2.In all phylogenetically advanced salticids examined in the present study, a foveal Layer I receptor contains a single rhabdomere organised as a light-guide. The following sections discuss Layer I:3.For open-space species, small size minimally prejudices spatial acuities: for the very largePhiale magnifica, optimal spatial acuity is estimated to be 2.3 arc min for adults, and 4.6 arc min for second-instar spiderlings. For adults of the small speciesJollas geniculatus (only slightly larger than second-instarPhiale) we obtain 5.2 arc min.4.For species occupying habitats in the forest understory, low illuminances appear to prejudice spatial acuity. For adults of the large speciesItata completa which lives beneath broad foliage, we obtain 5.8 arc min; for the small ant-mimicFluda princeps which inhabits the litter layer, we estimate 16.8 arc min.5.The results indicate that habitat illuminance only constrains retinal design when it is extremely low. Impaired spatial acuities in such dark habitats are predicted to limit behavioural repertoires, and, as a secondary consequence, the number of species that can co-exist in a given forest microhabitat.6.Receptor illuminances could, in principle, be modulated by adjustments to four factors: (i) focal lengths of the corneal lenses; (ii) the extent, or absence of the pigment stops that lie directly behind them; (iii) the magnification factors afforded by the diverging components of the telephoto lens systems; (iv) the tip diameters of foveal Layer I rhabdomeres. The first parameter is not manipulated: all corneal lenses have roughly the sameF-number (≃ 1.80). Forest species usually lack a pigment stop behind the corneal lens, the power of the diverging component is reduced or virtually absent, and rhabdomere diameters are large.7.The interface between the retinal matrix and the anterior chamber of the eye is irregularly convexiclivate in advanced salticids, two convexiclivate surfaces forming “saddles” that overlie the narrow dorsal and ventral arms of the retinal mosaics. It is confirmed that inPortia andLyssomanes, both from “primitive” subfamilies, the interfaces are not convexiclivate, as Williams and McIntyre (1980) noted.
