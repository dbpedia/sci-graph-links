Abstract Experimental studies of ocular inflammation induced by endotoxin have been performed almost exclusively in rabbits. Although the rat has been considered refractory to both the systemic and local effects of endotoxin, the present study has shown that intravitreal injection of endotoxin evoked a characteristic acute inflammatory response which was reproducible and dose-dependent. In addition, a consensual ocular response in the control eye occurred which was less severe but also dose-dependent. Preliminary investigations support the view that consensual responses of this nature may be mediated by a nervous reflex arc mechanism. Sequential histological analysis revealed a marked polymorphonuclear cell infiltration of most ocular tissues in the early stages, while mononuclear cells predominated after 3 days. Widespread intravascular microthrombi were also observed, particularly in the ciliary vessels. Recovery, however, was usually complete by 7 days.
