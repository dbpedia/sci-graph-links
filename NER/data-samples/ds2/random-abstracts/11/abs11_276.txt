Abstract A 4-year-old, 14.5-kg doe with primary complaint of abortion and blindness was presented to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UNVTH). Clinical examination revealed ocular (bilateral keratoconjunctivitis, corneal opacity, mucopurulent ocular discharge and blindness) and oral (erosive stomatitis, lingual vesicles and dental attrition) lesions. Neither intracellular parasites nor inclusion bodies were found in the stained impression smears. Rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT) was negative for brucellosis. Haematology showed normal packed cell volume (PCV), while serum biochemical assay revealed normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), slightly increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and markedly increased alkaline phophatase (ALP). Diagnosis of moraxellosis was based on isolation and identification of pure cultures of beta-haemolytic Moraxella bovis strain from cultured samples following standard protocols. Antibiotic sensitivity result showed that the isolate was resistant to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and perfloxacin, but susceptible to gentamicin, orfloxacin and tetracycline. Intramuscular injection of 5 % oxytetracycline short-acting and multivitamin for 5 days was very effective. This report indicates that extraocular manifestations could possibly occur in caprine moraxellosis.
