Summary Each pigment-cup eye of Polycystis naegelii consists of two retinal clubs and a single pigmented cell. The latter is divided into two cavities by a septum. Under bright illumination the photoreceptor process appears as a disk containing membranous laminar whorls; under faint illumination the latter are replaced by numerous straight, closely packed, microvilli. This morphological variation is correlated with the intensity of the photoreceptor's exposure to light. The lenticular structures described by previous light microscopists have not been observed.
