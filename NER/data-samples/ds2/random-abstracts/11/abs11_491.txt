Abstract Gas chromatography was used to study the pharmacokinetics of Proxodolol eye drops, a new Russian hybrid beta-alpha adrenergic blocking agent, in an experiment involving 21 rabbits. After instillation, the Proxodolol rapidly penetrates into the aqueous humor and remains there up to 120 min. It virtually does not penetrate into the blood plasma.
