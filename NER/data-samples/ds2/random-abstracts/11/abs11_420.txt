Abstract The aim of the present work was to perform a comparative immunohistochemical study of the ocular lens in normal conditions and after formation of various type of age-related cataract in humans. The control group consisted of lenses from young men dying from accidents and serving as corneal donors (n = 10, not more than one hour after death). Lenses from patients (aged 60–70 years) undergoing surgery for cortical (n = 20) and nuclear (n = 20) cataracts were studied. The investigations demonstrated plasticity in the phenotype of lens cells in age-related cataract. Changes in the phenotype of lens cells were found to depend on the type of age-related cataract. Development of the cortical variant of age-related cataract was associated with positive reactions with monoclonal antibodies to neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, and vimentin only within the lens cortex. Formation of age-related nuclear cataract was associated with positive reactions with antibodies to α-smooth muscle actin and pancytokeratin, which were detected only in the lens nucleus. This provides evidence of the need to develop a differential approach to the treatment of different types of age-related cataract.
