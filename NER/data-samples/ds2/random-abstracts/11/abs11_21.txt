Abstract Many researchers have employed cryopreserved amniotic membrane (CAM) in the treatment of a severely damaged cornea, using corneal epithelial cells cultured on an amniotic membrane (AM). In this study, two Teflon rings were made for culturing the cells on the LAM and CAM, and were then used to support the AM, which is referred to in this paper as an Ahnâ€™s AM supporter. The primary corneal epithelial cells were obtained from the limbus, using an explantation method. The corneal epithelium could be reconstructed by culturing the third-passage corneal epithelial cells on the AM. A lyophilized amniotic membrane (LAM) has a higher rate of graft take, a longer shelf life, is easier to store, and safer, due to gamma irradiation, than a CAM. The corneal epithelium reconstructed on the LAM and CAM, supported by the two-Teflon rings, was similar to normal corneal epithelium. However, the advantages of the LAM over that of the CAM make the former more useful. The reconstruction model of the corneal epithelium, using AM, is considered as a goodin vitro model for transplantation of cornel epithelium into patients with a severely damaged cornea.
