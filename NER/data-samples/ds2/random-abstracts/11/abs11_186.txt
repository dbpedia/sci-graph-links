Abstract Visual field information obtained with the automatic Computer-Perimeter (‘Competer’) can be condensed into a single numerical value. This performance measure was applied to a normal population to determine the physiologic decay of retinal sensitivity with aging. Further, the development of this performance measure was followed in 54 glaucoma eyes which were divided into three groups: Untreated, treated with satisfactory intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation, and treated with unsatisfactory IOP regulation. All eyes were examined perimetrically on at least three separate occasions. Decaying performance measures were found in the preponderance of glaucoma eyes. Therapy aimed at lowering the IOP did not offer a protective effect. Papillary hemorrhage and a significant decay in performance are usually found in the same eye.
