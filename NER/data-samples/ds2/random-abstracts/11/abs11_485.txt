Summary 1. The progress of the retinopathy after pituitary implantation has been followed for 1–7 years (mean 2 years) in 60 diabetic patients and assessed from gradings of the retinal photographs and visual acuity measurements. — 2. The degree of hypopituitarism induced (by three different yttrium90 dosages) had varied and has been assessed by tests of thyroid and adrenal function into three grades of ablation, “maximal”, “intermediate” and “slight”. — 3. In the whole group, while exudates, retinitis proliferans and visual acuity did not improve, haemorrhages and microaneurysms, new vessels and venous irregularities had improved after 1 year, and these continued improving up to the latest assessment. — 4. On comparing the outcome at either 1 year or the final assessment, the effects of “maximal” or “intermediate” pituitary ablation appeared equivalent, but clearly superior to “slight” ablation. In particular, haemorrhages and microaneurysms showed equal improvement postimplant in all three ablation categories. New vessels improved in the “maximal” and “intermediate” ablation categories equally, but not in the “slight” category. Venous irregularities improved discernibly only after “maximal” ablation. Retinitis proliferans deteriorated in all three ablation categories, although “maximal” was more effective than “slight” in preventing new lesions. Visual acuity declined only in the “slight” category.
