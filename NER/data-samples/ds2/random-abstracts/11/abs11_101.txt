Summary Efferent projections of the optic tectum of zebra finches were investigated by injection of the radioactive anterograde tracer 3H-proline. In addition to a variety of ipsilateral projections, some contralateral connections were found. Quantitative evaluation of the recrossing tecto-rotundal and nucleus subpraetectalis/nucleus interstitio-praetecto-subpraetectalis projection revealed that these connections are much stronger than previously believed. In contrast, the tecto-tectal projection is very weak, as has been shown previously. Further support for this comes from results obtained using injections of retrograde tracers. The role of the different projections in conveying information from the ipsilateral eye to the ectostriatum, the telencephalic end-station of the tectofugal pathway, is discussed.
