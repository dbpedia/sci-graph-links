Abstract The cerebrally innervated eyes of metamorphically competent larvae, newly metamorphosed larvae, and adults ofAporrhais pespelecani are ultrastructurally investigated and compared. The eyes are composed of a lens, a cornea, and an everse retina. In adults, a humour is located behind the lens. The retina consists of two different types of cells: sensory cells and supportive cells. The present study confirms earlier results and demonstrates that the distal part of the sensory cells is altered during ontogenesis. In metamorphically competent larvae, the sensory cells are exclusively ciliary. In newly metamorphosed larvae and in adults, however, the sensory cells are of the mixed type, bearing both cilia and microvilli. Furthermore, the findings confirm that both the supportive and corneal cells, as well as the distal supportive cell processes which are restricted to the eyes of adults are involved in lens formation.
