Abstract β-Carotene, canthaxanthin, and β-carotene plus canthaxanthin were administered to “chinchilla bastard” pigmented rabbits in their rabbit diet (approximately 200 ppm carotenoid per group). The effect of the carotenoids on retinal function and morphology was tested against a control group in the course of 11 months. Electroretinography showed that in contrast to the control animals, β-carotene-treated rabbits produced increasing peak latencies of the scotopicb-waves. In the canthaxanthin-treated rabbits,a- andb-waves showed hypernormal amplitudes at low cumulative dosages (approximately 0.5–2 g) and reduced amplitudes at higher dosages (about 5 g). The peak latencies of the scotopica- andb-waves increased remarkably. This effect was still stronger in the carotenoid combination. Histology and electron microscopy indicated that in contrast to the control animals, canthaxanthin-treated rabbits showed a reduction in retinal thickness in some samples. In particular, they exhibited alterations in the granular layers and a marked diminuation of the photoreceptor outer segments and morphological alterations of the photoreceptor inner segments with massive deposition of electron-dense material. In all animals treated with carotenoids, lipid droplets of the retinal pigment epithelium were enlarged in size and number.
