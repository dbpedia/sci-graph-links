Abstract PurposeSeveral preclinical imaging systems are commercially available, but their purchase and maintenance costs make them unaffordable for the majority of small- and medium-sized groups. Taking into account the needs of average users, we developed “γ-eye”, a mouse-sized, benchtop γ-camera suitable for in vivo scintigraphic imaging. ProceduresThe γ-eye is based on two position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes, coupled to a CsI(Na) pixelated scintillator and a low-energy lead collimator with parallel hexagonal holes. ResultsThe spatial resolution of the system is 2 mm at 0 mm. The energy resolution is 26 % at 140 keV and the maximum recorded sensitivity 210 cps/MBq. The system was evaluated in a proof-of-concept animal study, using three different clinical Tc-99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals. Phantom and animal studies demonstrate its ability to provide semiquantitative results even for short scans. ConclusionsSystems’ performance, dimensions, and cost make γ-eye a unique solution for efficient whole-body mouse nuclear imaging.
