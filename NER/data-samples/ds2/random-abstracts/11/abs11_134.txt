Summary 1.A red eyed mutation appeared in a wild strain ofEphestia which was shown to be located at thea-locus. Animals of the new red eyed strain NC have darker eyes than those of the originalaa strain R1.2.The F1 between NC and R1 shows higher variability than the parental strains. The mode of its distribution is identical with NC.3.F2 and the backcrosses F1×R1 segregate into two classes, one of which corresponds to R1, the other to F1 and NC. It is concluded that NC and R1 differ in one major pair of alleles determining the brightness of the eye.4.Outcrosses of NC and R1 to a wild type strain BII indicate that the difference between NC and R1 is not due to different alleles at thea-locus, but to a pair of major modifiers, calledM-a andm-a.5.Minor modifiers in R1 may shift the heterozygotes in the lighter direction. A significant maternal influence was demonstrated in F2; but it is of doubtful significance in F1.6.R1 and NC differ in the proportion of males having colored testes. The proportion of males with pigmented testes in crosses between NC and R1 corresponds in general to the eye color, except that the backcross F1×NC shows a significantly higher percentage of males with pigmented testes than strain NC.7.No reduced viability ofaa animals was indicated in the F2s from the crosses to BII.
