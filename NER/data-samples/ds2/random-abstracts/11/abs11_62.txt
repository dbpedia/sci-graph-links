Abstract The capacity of amputated early and late limbs of larval Xenopus laevis to promote lens-forming transformations of corneal implants in the absence of a limb regeneration blastema has been tested by implanting outer cornea fragments from donor larvae at stage 48 (according to Nieuwkoop and Faber 1956), into limb stumps of larvae at stage 52 and 57. Blastema formation has been prevented either by covering the amputation surface with the skin or by reconnecting the amputated part to the limb stump. Results show that stage 52 non-regenerating limbs could promote lens formation from corneal implants not only when innervated but also when denervated. A similar result was observed in stage 57 limbs where blastema formation was prevented by reconnecting the amputated part to the stump. In this case, relevant tissue dedifferentiation was observed in the boundary region between the stump and the autografted part of the limb. However, stage 57 limbs, where blastema formation was prevented by covering the amputation surface with skin, could promote lens formation from the outer cornea only when innervated. In this case, no relevant dedifferentiation of the stump tissues was observed. These results indicate that blastema formation is not a prerequisite for lens-forming transformations of corneal fragments implanted into amputated hindlimbs of larval X. laevis and that lens formation can be promoted by factors delivered by the nerve fibres or produced by populations of undifferentiated or dedifferentiated limb cells.
