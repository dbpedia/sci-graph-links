Abstract The examination findings of the fellow eye of 534 patients affected by a unilateral retinal detachment are reported. Nearly 90% of these eyes showed degenerative areas and about 20% showed one or more retinal breaks. These findings are quite different from those reported in examinations of ‘random eyes’ and suggest that fellow eyes are ‘high risks’ that often need prompt prophylactic treatment.
