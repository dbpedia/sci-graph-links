Abstract PurposeTo evaluate the outcomes of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) in the management of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) secondary to steroid use for macular edema in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). MethodsA total of nine eyes of five patients were evaluated retrospectively. Complete success was defined as IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without glaucoma medications, while qualified success was defined as IOP ≤ 21 mmHg with glaucoma medications. ResultsMean age at surgery was 25.0 ± 8.3 years, and mean follow-up time was 38.4 ± 13.2 months. Mean IOP was 41.0 ± 8.3 mmHg preoperatively, 9.4 ± 3.5 mmHg at first week (p = 0.008), 13.1 ± 3.6 mmHg at first month (p = 0.008), 14.8 ± 4.1 mmHg at 6th month (p = 0.008), 11.7 ± 2.6 mmHg at 12th month (p = 0.008), 12.4 ± 2.9 mmHg at 24th month (p = 0.008), 12.6 ± 3.6 mmHg at 36th month (p = 0.043) and 12.8 ± 4.2 mmHg at 48th month (p = 0.068) postoperatively. The mean number of topical anti-glaucomatous medications decreased from 2.8 ± 0.4 preoperatively to 0.4 ± 0.9 postoperatively (p = 0.007). Complete success was obtained in 7 (77%) eyes, and qualified success in 2 (23%) eyes. No failure was detected. ConclusionsAGV implantation can be considered as an alternative and safe option in the management of resistant, elevated IOP secondary to steroid treatment for macular edema in patients with RP.
