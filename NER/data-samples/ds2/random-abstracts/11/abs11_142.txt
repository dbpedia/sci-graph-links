Summary A conus-like structure, the hyaloid conus, located on the optic nerve head of the mesopelagic deep-sea teleost Radiicephalus elongatus is described. The hyaloid conus consists of a tapering sheath of unpigmented, vascularized connective tissue enveloping the proximal part of the hyaloid artery which proceeds from the optic nerve head through the vitreous body to the ventrally located falciform process and lens muscles. The hyaloid artery passes through the hyaloid conus without giving off any branches. The conus vessels encircling the hyaloid artery receive arterial blood from the choroid via small arteries and are drained to the choroid by a single vein. The hyaloid conus is compared with the lacertilian conus papillaris. The function of the hyaloid conus is unknown. Because of its small dimensions relative to those of the eyeball and its few capillaries, it is unlikely that the hyaloid conus is a supplemental nutritive device for the retina.
