Abstract An acquired diffuse elastic tissue defect that resembles inherited pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) has been noticed with a significant age-related frequency in hemoglobin disorders, especially β-thalassemia and has been held responsible for a number of complications observed in these cases, some of which are quite severe. We report here two patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, who presented with severe visual acuity impairment associated with angioid streaks, the typical ocular manifestation of PXE.
