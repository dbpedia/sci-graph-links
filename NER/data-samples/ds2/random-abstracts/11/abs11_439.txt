Abstract In a study of 15 eyes with optic pits fluorescein angiography revealed that only pits associated with serous detachment of the macular retina showed fluorescence in the late venous phase, while the pits uncomplicated by detachment remained hypofluorescent throughout the test. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that the subretinal fluid producing the macular detachment originates from leakage of vessels located in the floor of the pit. In addition a high incidence of anomalies was found to be associated with optic pits. Therefore the author suggests to call the association between optic pit and large optic disc, parapapillary chorioretinal changes, cilioretinal vessels, situs inversus and eventual other vessel abnormalities, the ‘optic pit syndrome’.
