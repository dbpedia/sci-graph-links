Abstract Covering and surgical removal of the compound eyes were performed to localize photoreceptors for photoperiodic responses in the blow fly Protophormia terraenovae (Diptera, Calliphoridae). Adult females showed a long-day photoperiodic response to control reproductive diapause. When the compound eyes were bilaterally covered with silver paint, diapause incidence increased under diapause-preventing conditions, i.e., a long-day photoperiod and constant light, as though flies were kept under constant darkness. Neither silver painting on a medial region of the head capsule nor control painting in which both compound eyes were painted in a clear solvent caused significant effects on diapause incidence. Unilateral painting of the compound eye caused an increment of diapause incidence under constant light but no effects under a long-day photoperiod. When the compound eyes were bilaterally removed, all the flies developed their ovaries both under a long-day and a short-day photoperiod. Unilateral removal of the compound eye also caused ovarian development under a short-day photoperiod, whereas removal of one antennal lobe or all ocelli caused no effects on diapause incidence. Since P. terraenovae completely lost responsiveness to photoperiod after blinding of the compound eyes, it is likely that this fly perceives photoperiod through its compound eyes.
