Abstract The ultrastructural organization of connective tissue microfibrils was studied in the mouse eye and also by means of in vitro experiments for reconstituting microfibrils. In the posterior chamber of the eye of the C57BL/6J mouse, 3 nm-wide ribbon-like double-tracked structures were present and were periodically associated on either side with 3.5 nm-wide particulate structures identified as pentosomes, the subunits of amyloid P component (AP). At certain sites, such composite structures were observed in various stages of helical winding, and in these helices, pentosomes were preferentially localized internally. In helices in the final stages of winding, the resulting rods appeared increasingly similar to those of microfibrils. In experiments in vitro, incubation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in TRIS buffer, pH 7.4, at 35Â°C for 1 h produced random aggregates of 3 nm-wide double-tracked structures similar to those observed in the eye. Co-incubation of CSPG and AP resulted in the formation of rod-like structures arranged parallel to one another in approximately 50 nm-thick sheet-like layers. These rods were ultrastructurally similar to microfibrils and were made up of helically wound, 3 nm-wide double-tracked structures containing pentosomes within their core. The results of in vivo as well as in vitro experiments suggest the possibility that the connective tissue microfibril is composed of helically wound, CSPG-containing, 3 nm-wide double-tracked structures periodically associated with pentosomes which, as the helix becomes progressively tighter, fit with one another at the core of the helix to form successive 8.5 nm-wide disks of AP segments.
