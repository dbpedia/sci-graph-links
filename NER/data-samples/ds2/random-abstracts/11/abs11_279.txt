Abstract Adult stemmata are distinctive insect photoreceptors located on the posterior surfaces of the optic lobes. They originate as larval eyes that migrate inward during metamorphosis. We used a combination of light microscopy and in situ hybridization to examine their anatomical organization in the butterfly Vanessa cardui and to test for the presence of visual pigments, the light sensitive components of the visual transduction pathway. The bilateral cluster of six internal stemmata is located near the ventral edge of the lamina. They retain the dark screening pigment and overlying crystalline cones of the larval stemmata. We found two opsin mRNAs expressed in the stemmata that are also expressed, respectively, in UV-sensitive and green-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the compound eye. A third mRNA that is expressed in blue-sensitive photoreceptor cells of the compound eye was not expressed in the stemmata. Our results reinforce the idea that the adult stemmata are not merely developmental remnants of larval eyes, but remain functional, possibly as components of the circadian input channel.
