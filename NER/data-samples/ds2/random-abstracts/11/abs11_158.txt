Summary The amphipod species Haploops tubicola has an unusual compound eye that is divided into three separate parts, each with one common cuticular lens. The dorso-frontal eyepair has, in addition to the lens, a so-called vitreous body, which is constructed like a dioptric lens and is inserted in the ray-path. The ‘vitreous body’ is actually — and for which evidence is presented — a secretory product formed in the intercellular spaces of the organ of Bellonci. Histochemical analysis has shown that the secretion is strongly PAS-positive and lacks glycogen.
