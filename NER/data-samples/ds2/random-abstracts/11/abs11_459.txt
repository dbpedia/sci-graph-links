Abstract Central serous retinopathy is traditionally thought to be a self-limited disease entity that tends to spontaneously heal, with minimal residual visual complications. An episode of central serous retinopathy in a 30-year-old man that had been observed resulted in permanent visual loss despite eventual laser treatment in the affected eye.
