Abstract Retinal ganglion cells represent the output neurons of the retina. They are responsible for integrating electrical signals that originate with the photoreceptors and, via their axons that comprise the optic nerve, transmit that information to higher visual centers of the brain. The retinal ganglion cells reside on the inner surface of the retina and their axons course across the inner surface to exit at the back of the eye through a region known as the optic nerve head. Within this region, initiation of the degenerative processes associated with glaucoma are thought to occur, leading to degeneration of not only the optic nerve but also the retinal ganglion cells themselves. Studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind glaucoma have identified diverse cellular components and molecular events that occur in response to nerve injury. The challenge to date has been to identify and promote pro-survival events while suppressing those that support further degradation and loss of vision. Complicating this process is the fact that the cells and molecules involved can play multiple roles. An understanding of the players and their complex relationships is central to the development of a successful treatment strategy.
