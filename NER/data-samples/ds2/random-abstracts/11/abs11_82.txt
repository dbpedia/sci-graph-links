Summary Cobaltous-lysine is transported anterogradely from the optic nerve of the teleost, Lethrinus chrysostomus (Lethrinidae, Perciformes). The marginal optic tract is labelled in longtitudinal bands of light and dark staining fibres which persists caudally within the ventral division but not in the dorsal division. This species possesses multiple central targets in the contralateral preoptic, diencephalic, pretectal, periventricular and tectal regions of the brain. In addition, a greater subdivision of the marginal optic tract is found to project to various nuclei. Ipsilateral projections are found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and in the region of the horizontal commissure. Projections are also found in the telencephalic region of the nucleus olfactoretinalis and the thalamic region of the nucleus thalamoretinalis. The retinotopicity of some of these nuclei, found in previous studies, is discussed in relation to the possibility of specific sub-populations of retinal ganglion cells having different central targets.
