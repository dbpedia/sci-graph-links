Abstract â€‚Irreversible stretching (creep) of the eye sclera, considered as a cause of the high myopia, has been studied experimentally. Both dramatic acceleration and significant deceleration of the sclera creep have been observed in the presence of some enzymes. Creep of various connective tissues caused by static and cyclic mechanical stresses (gravity, blood pressure, etc.) can manifest in many age and pathological changes in human body. Authors express the hope that investigations in this area and finding appropriate inhibitors may replace surgery (eye, cosmetic) by prophylactic therapy.
