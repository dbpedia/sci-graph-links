Summary The retinal projections in 2-year-old salmon smolt (Oncorhynchus nerka) are significantly different from those observed in other teleosts examined to date in that the projections are more extensive. Very noticeable are extensive projections to most of the dorsal thalamus, to all layers of the optic tectum, and into the periaqueductal gray of the torus semicircularis. The salmon smolt has bilateral retinal projections to the diencephalon and pretectum. A small retinal projection to the lateral habenular nucleus has not been described previously. Although these findings suggest striking differences in retinal projections among teleosts, this variation may relate to age differences since the previously studied teleosts were adults.
