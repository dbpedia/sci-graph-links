Abstract Use of spherical rigid and spherical soft contact lenses prescribed in a “piggyback” modality has generally failed in the past. A new technique uses a back surface toric soft contact lens, which becomes bitoric when placed on the highly astigmatic keratoconus cornea, and a bitoric rigid gas-permeable contact lens worn in tandem. The lessening of rubbing and the good contact lens centration appear to be an improvement over the rigid contact lens alone.
