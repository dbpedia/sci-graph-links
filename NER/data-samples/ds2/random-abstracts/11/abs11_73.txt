Abstract Ocular ultrasonography is a valid and non-invasive diagnostic method used to evaluate ocular and retrobulbar structures, especially when opacity of the anterior segments precludes ophthalmic examination of deeper structures of the eye or when exophthalmos is present. This study describes the B-mode ultrasonographic findings of the globe in 10 rabbits with experimental glaucoma. Ultrasonography of the eyes, using Titan TM machine and 7Â MHz linear array transducer, was performed transpalpebrally. Ocular ultrasonographic findings revealed two cases of increased corneal thickness, seven cases of change in the anterior chamber depth, one case of increased echogenicity in the anterior chamber, three cases of retinal detachment, one case of increased iris and ciliary body thickness and six cases of change in axial globe length. Increased echogenicity of the capsule, cortex and nucleus was found in two cases. Six cases showed change in lens diameter. Increased echogenicity and altered lens diameter are typical of cataract. Two cases of point-like lesions, mass and/or linear echodensities in mild extent were observed within the vitreous representing haemorrhage, vitreous degeneration or detachment. The B-mode ultrasonographic imaging technique has become an essential diagnostic tool in most ocular disease. This method provides additional information allowing the clinician to offer more accurate diagnosis, treatment and prognosis in glaucoma.
