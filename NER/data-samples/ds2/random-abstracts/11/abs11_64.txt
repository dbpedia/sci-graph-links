Summary The fine structure of the cornea in an anatomically and functionally specialized part of the honey bee's compound eye (dorsal rim area) was examined by light microscopy, transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy. Under incident illumination the cornea appears grey and cloudy, leaving only the centers of the corneal lenses clear. This is due to numerous pore canals that penetrate the cornea from the inside, ending a few Î¼m below the outer surface. They consist of (1) a small cylindrical cellular evagination of a pigment cell (proximal), and (2) a rugged-walled, pinetree-shaped extracellular part (distal). The functional significance of these pore canals is discussed. It is concluded that their light scattering properties cause the wide visual fields of the photoreceptor cells measured electrophysiologically in the dorsal rim area, and that this is related to the way this eye region detects polarization in skylight.
