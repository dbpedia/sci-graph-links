Abstract Accuracy of the eye-position signal (EPS) in successive-saccade conditions was examined by analyzing the subject’s performance in tracking his gaze by pointing with his unobservable hand in the dark. The size of constant error in manual pointing was found to increase with the number of the component saccades and to be inversely proportional to the size of the largest component saccade. The results are interpreted as showing that, in successive-saccade conditions, subjects are not able to use the sum of EPSs from each component saccade, but rather use only the EPS from the largest component saccade.
