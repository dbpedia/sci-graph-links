Abstract PurposeTo report surgical excision, cryotherapy, autologous conjunctival–limbal transplantation and topical mitomycin C (MMC) in the patient with extensive conjunctival–corneal intraepithelial neoplasia. MethodsCase report and literature review. ResultsA 75-year-old woman was referred to our department with the diagnosis of conjunctival–corneal neoplasia. Slit-lamp microscopic examination revealed an extensive papilliform tumoral mass invading the limbus at 360-degrees, and bulbar conjunctiva and cornea. Visual acuity was finger counting from 2 m in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. We performed total surgical excision, cryotherapy and autologous conjunctival–limbal transplantation in the right eye. Mitomycin-C 0.02% eye drops four times a day were prescribed for 4 weeks after the surgery. After the treatment, the visual acuity increased to 0.7 in the right eye. Corneal epithelium completely healed within 1 week after the surgery. No corneal epithelium-related problem or neoplasia recurrence were noted during the 2-year follow-up period. ConclusionsThis technique may be useful in reconstruction of eyes with extensive neoplastic involvement of the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea. In addition, mitomycin C drops may be useful in preventing postoperative recurrence of conjunctival–corneal intraepithelial neoplasia.
