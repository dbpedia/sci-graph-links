Abstract The film flow down a curved surface is analysed by an orthogonal curvilinear system and a perturbation in the small ratio of film thickness to minimum radius of curvature. General solutions are obtained to second order. The results are applied to plates with exponential curvature and sinusoidal curvature. Separation is most likely to occur on the upstream sides of a wavy plate.
