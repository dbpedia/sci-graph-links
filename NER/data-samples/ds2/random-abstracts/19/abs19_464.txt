Abstract A simplified mathematical model of two-dimensionally(2D) periodic thin-film wavegmide is proposed and the characteristics of wave propagation are shown to be governed by a five-term recurrence relation with dyadic admittance coefficients. The generalized transverse resonance method can be used to analyze any complicated 2D periodic thin-film waveguide. The dispersion characteristics are described by both approximation analysis and numerical calculation. The theoretical explanation and physical understanding of the effecis of 2D periodic modulation provided by our analysis and resulis can give sound support to the engineering applications.
