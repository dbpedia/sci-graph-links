AbstractA novel film consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was produced by means of a flexographic printing process on polycarbonate substrate. The electrochemical response of this MWCNT-PC film towards oxidation of dopamine to dopamine-o-quinone was investigated in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) by means of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The findings demonstrate that the MWCNT-PC film possesses good performance for the electrochemical oxidation of dopamine. Namely, the fabricated MWCNT-PC film having a detection limit and sensitivity of 4.06 μM and 0.823 A M−1 cm−2, respectively, seems to have greater detection ability towards dopamine/dopamine-o-quinone compared to other novel electrodes reported in the literature. The results of the present work are very promising and demonstrate that the MWCNT-PC film could be suitable for the electrochemical analysis of molecules with biological interest. Graphical abstract
