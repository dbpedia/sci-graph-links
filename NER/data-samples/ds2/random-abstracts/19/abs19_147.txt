Summary. This paper reports an efficient protoplast culture technique, the “extra thin alginate film” technique. The development of this improved method of protoplast culture was an outcome of an assessment of the efficiency and shortcomings of various protoplast culture techniques. The efficiency of this technique was evaluated with two model plant systems, viz., Nicotiana tabacum and Lotus corniculatus, and a comparison was made with the “thin alginate layer” technique, another efficient protoplast culture system. Results indicate that the culture technique with extra thin alginate film is as efficient as the technique with thin alginate layer, with many additional advantages. The present innovation overcomes most of the limitations of protoplast culture techniques described so far and can now be applied to a wide variety of crops to check its general applicability.
