Summary The anterior cornea epithelium of the house-hen consists of 5 layers. The outermost layer has a villus border. The 0.2 μ long microvilli are 0.04–0.05 μ thick and are not more than 0.1 μ apart. A film of ruthenium red stainable glycosamine Glycans of 0.26–0.3 μ thickness lies on the free surface. The microvilli protrude into this film. This film is responsible for the reflecting shine of the cornea. The tear secretion can be kept at a low level as a part of the fluid is bound to the acid mucopolysaccharides. The molecules for this film are probably synthesized in the outermost cell layer.
