Abstract Our objective was to compare the accuracy and practicality in use of three available imaging receptors for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) imaging; namely, two computer-assisted and one traditional analog x-ray film system. A standardized tissue-equivalent encased human skull specimen was imaged using lateral and posteroanterior (PA) pantomographic projections with the Orthopantomograph OP 100 (Instrumentarium Imaging, Tuusula, Finland) and three different receptor modalities: (1) Ektavision film with Ektavision screens (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY); (2) DenOptix photostimulable phosphor screens (Dentsply/Gendex, Chicago, IL); and (3) the charge-coupled device (CCD) receptor, DigiPan (TREX/Trophy Radiology, Marne-la-Vall√©e, France). The effective focal trough was found for each receptor using lead resolution grids placed at fractional millimeter distances along empirically determined beam projection angulations. The time to acquire and process images was also established. We found that the CCD system permitted real-time display, whereas the use of traditional film took 2 minutes to load the cassette in a darkroom and perform the exposure, and then a further 2 minutes to unload and process. The storage phosphor took 3 minutes to unload the cassette and process the image and a further 20 seconds to clear the plate following laser scanning. Film produced the greatest maximum resolution followed by the storage phosphor and the CCD. In conclusion, CCD-based TMJ pantomography provided an instant image. The photostimulable phosphor system used was the least satisfactory in terms of the time expended to obtain an image, but provided better spatial resolution than the CCD. Ektavision film/screens provided the best spatial resolution in this investigation.
