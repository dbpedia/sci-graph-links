Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the perceived clinical efficacy of a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector for panoramic radiography by comparing the images produced to conventional film/screen radiographs using the same machine and patient population. For clinical evaluation, 18 criteria were selected. These included overall assessment of the area of coverage, clarity of dental structures, clarity of bony outlines, specific anatomic details such as the maxillary sinus floor, mandibular canal and mandibular condyle, and region-by-region assessment of the dentition. Observers acted independently using identical optimal viewing conditions. Film and digital radiographs were evaluated separately. A five interval Likert rating scale was used. Digital images were rated superior to the conventional film radiographs for 14 criteria. Film radiographs marginally outperformed digital images for three criteria. For one criterion (periodontal bone status) the two modalities showed no difference in terms of the mean ratings. It was concluded that digital images are clinically equivalent to conventional film/screen images for panoramic dental radiography.
