Abstract This paper is an in-depth case study of a child engaged in music composition using novel music composition software. It examines the child’s and the teacher’s behaviour, process and strategies while using the software. It seeks to explore how the software enables the child to engage in certain musical processes commonly associated with adult or professional composers and notes which features of the interface seem particularly useful in this regard. It outlines certain teaching strategies that seem to have been effective in this technology mediated music-learning context. Finally, it briefly points to the effectiveness of digital video technology in tandem with graphical computer interfaces as a medium for the examination of children’s creative process in music composition.
