Abstract The film-forming capacity of binary systems containing Sb2O3, SnO2, CeO2, Y2O3, Nd2O3, Bi2O3, V2O5, ZnO, CuO, CdO, and Al2O3 are investigated. The best film-formers are Sb2O3 and SnO2, whereas ZnO, CuO, CdO, and Al2O3 cannot produce films of optical quality. The rest of considered oxides do not impair the clarity of coatings when their molding content is 20 â€“ 50%. A proportional dependence is established between the refractive index and the reflection coefficient of a film and the refractive indexes of oxides making parts of this film, as well as between the concentration of deposited FFS, the film-forming capacity of oxides, and the film thickness.
