A method has been developed for forecasting stress relaxation in polypropylene film filaments, which is based on linear viscoelasticity. The elastic recovery has been examined for polypropylene (PP) film filaments, which is related to stress relaxation processes of various durations. The recovery curves in semilogarithmic coordinates are characterized by initial and final asymptotic levels, and also by an S-shaped elastic component of the process, an important characteristic of which is the relaxation time. The recovery parameters are complicated and are nonlinearly dependent on the given level of strain and the duration of the direct relaxation. A method is proposed for the analytic description and forecasting of elastic recovery in PP film filaments on the basis of the parameters of the preceding stress relaxation: in accordance with the duration of the direct relaxation and the given level of stretching.
