Abstract Weaving together multiple strands of Carolyn Grant Fay’s life and work, publication of the 2008 Marian Chace Foundation Lecture is predominantly a transcription of the documentary film “At the Threshold.” The film begins with a moving image of Carolyn Fay in her studio, her eyes are closed with inner-directed attention as she symbolically enacts a dream. We see her move and at the same time hear her voice-over telling a dream. She turns then to art materials and draws a picture of that dream. As she draws and moves again, she reflects on the dream’s meaning and purpose. Building on the foundation of her inner work, there is a shift to Carolyn Fay’s work with others. Potent sequences from three individual psychotherapy sessions are shown, as well as with a group. Fay’s approach to dance therapy invites movement, sand play, art, clay, music, self-reflection, dialogue and exchange, guided by individual preferences and held by a trusting therapeutic relationship. In addition to the work itself, there is an added dimension of the issue of aging and how Carolyn Fay responds to it through her own self-understanding.
