Abstract The present work is trying to explain a discrepancy between experimental observations of the drainage of foam films from aqueous solutions of sodium dodecylsulfate and the theoretical DLVO-accomplished Reynolds model. It is shown that, due to overlap of the film adsorption layers, an adsorption component of the disjoining pressure is important for the present system. The pre-exponential factor of this adsorption component was obtained by fitting to the experimental drainage curves. It corresponds to a slight repulsion, which reduces not only the thinning velocity as observed experimentally but corrects also the film equilibrium thickness.
