Abstract A theoretically obtained relationship between specific reflux density and film thickness in an ascending cocurrent flow (laminar wave-free flow of liquid over a vertical plane) is examined. A diagram for determination of the film thickness in constant-diameter tubes for a water-air system, and correction curves for this diagram are presented. A diagram is constructed for determination of the film thickness in variable-diameter tubes, which is more general — not constrained by specific properties of the liquid and gaseous phases. Examples of the use of the diagram are presented.
