Abstract Dance therapy is a new discipline, a product of the twentieth century. Its recent methodological and theoretical development has led to the proliferation of various dance therapy models. This study focuses on the founding and development of dance therapy as an applied discipline. Particular emphasis is given to dance therapy from an anthropological perspective. A critical analysis of two prevailing models, Dance/Movement Therapy and Expression Primitive, is articulated. Such analysis indicates that their development closely relates to issues of collective identity of the group in relation to their dancing cultures. From an anthropological point of view, then, issues of identity are paramount for an effective practice of dance/movement therapy.
