Abstract The temperature dependence of the Debye-Waller factor of very thin undisturbed films is studied. It is found that if interaction between the substrate and the film does not exist the Debye-Waller factor diverges, with the exception of the case of zero absolute temperature, so that under these conditions resonance recoilless absorption and emission of X- andÎ³-rays or neutrons by the nucleus of the film cannot occur. In the presence of interaction between the film and substrate the Debye-Waller factor is finite; its temperature dependence was determined.
