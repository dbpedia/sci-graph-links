Abstract The study of the kinetics of an electrode coated with a redox polymer film has been carried out using an impedance technique. A theoretical model is proposed which takes into account the diffusion of the active centres. Experimental results are presented for a glassy carbon electrode coated with a [Ru(bpy)2 poly(4â€²-vinylpyridine)Cl]Cl film. There is good agreement between these results and the model.
