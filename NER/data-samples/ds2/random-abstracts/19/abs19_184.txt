Abstract The electrode impedance spectroscopy technique was used to study the process of formation of a conducting polyporphyrin film on a Pt electrode from a 10âˆ’3 M solution of tetrakis(p-aminophenyl)porphin in dichloromethane. An equivalent circuit is suggested for simulation of interface impedance in a wide range of working electrode potentials. It is shown that regions with a different mechanism of film formation are observed at an increase in potential from 0.0 to +1.0 V. The kinetics of film formation are studied at the potentials of +0.40, +0.60, and +0.80 V. It is found that good agreement is observed between the model and experimental data when the growing film is simulated using a Warburg element with a finite diffusion length. Conductivity and the diffusion coefficient of charge carriers in it are estimated on the basis of the suggested model for a film obtained at the potential of +0.40 V. It is shown that conductivity of a polyporphyrin film grows by more than an order of magnitude at an increase in deposition potential from +0.40 to +0.80 V.
