Abstract Bragg angle mismatch by tangential and radial tilts is a critical problem in holographic digital data storage. Generally, tangential tilt can be easily compensated for in holographic digital data storage. However, radial tilt is not easily compensated for. In this paper, we propose a new method of radial tilt compensation. The proposed method can compensate for Bragg angle mismatch caused by radial tilt.
