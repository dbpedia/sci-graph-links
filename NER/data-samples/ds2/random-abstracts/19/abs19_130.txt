Abstract A non-linear theory for the plastic deformation of prismatic bodies is constructed which interpolates between Prandtl’s linear soap-film approximation and Nádai’s sand-pile model. Geometrically Prandtl’s soap film and Nádai’s wavefront are unified into a single smooth surface of constant mean curvature in three-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
