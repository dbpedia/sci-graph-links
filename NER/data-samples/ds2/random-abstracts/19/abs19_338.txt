Abstract Dawning at the onset of the twenty first century, social networking has emerged as a catalyst of global significance that, if embraced strategically, may fuel the growth of dance/movement therapy (DMT) in exponential ways. In the few years that the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) has utilized social media for public relations and advocacy purposes, both ADTA membership and the general publicâ€™s awareness of DMT have already increased markedly. Inherent within the social networking paradigm is the essential role of relationship and reciprocity. These tenets encourage a cross-promotion, not only of dance/movement therapists by dance/movement therapists but of all creative arts therapists by all creative arts therapists. Fully maximizing the growth potential for the field of DMT demands a shift from a twentieth century mindset of isolationism to the social media inspired, twenty first century paradigm of collaboration and mutual support among all creative arts therapists. Fully committing to this paradigm will produce greater awareness of DMT in the general public, a deeper understanding of DMT by allied professionals, an increased consumer demand for our services, a more diverse pool of dance/movement therapists, and a visibility worthy of a profession beginning its second half century.
