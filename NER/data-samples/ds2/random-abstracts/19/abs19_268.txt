Abstract Even with the advent of CT, the plain film should not be neglected for the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum. However, supine views must encompass the entirety of the peritoneal cavity, especially its uppermost areas, because those are the most likely sites of free air deposition. In actuality, the recumbent plain film so positioned is exquisitely sensitive, approaching CT in its diagnostic incisiveness.
