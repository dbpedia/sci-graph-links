Abstract The theory of transverse elasticity of thin foam films is formulated under the conditions when the action of Gibbs elasticity is excluded. The theory predicts the presence of maxima of the modulus of transverse elasticity and film thickness near the critical micellization concentration as functions of the content of surfactant at a given disjoining pressure. Theoretical conclusions are confirmed experimentally by measuring film thickness at various heights of equilibrium foam column.
