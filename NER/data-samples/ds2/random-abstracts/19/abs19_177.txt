Abstract The buckling design of micro-films has various potential applications to engineering. The substrate prestrain, interconnector buckling amplitude and critical strain are important parameters for the buckling design. In the presented analysis, the buckled film shape was described approximately by a trigonometric function and the buckled film amplitude was obtained by minimizing the total strain energy. However, this method only generates the first-order approximate solution for the nonlinear buckling. In the present paper, an asymptotic analysis based on the rigorous nonlinear differential equation for the buckled micro-film deformations is proposed to obtain more accurate relationship of the buckling amplitude and critical strain to prestrain. The obtained results reveal the nonlinear relation and are significant to accurate buckling design of micro-films.
