Abstract Paradigmatic change is driving aesthetic change in cinema. This restructuring is not only transforming what is on the screen, but the means of production that put it there. The interplay of technology and culture, along with their dynamics has made this so. Marshall McLuhan's Laws of Media provide an effective lens with which to examine this change. Some preliminary observations on the shape of digital cinema are offered. However to paraphrase Al Jolson, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
