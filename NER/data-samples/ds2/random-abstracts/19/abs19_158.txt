 Using a combination of the superfluid 4He film model of Rutledge et al. and the layered model of Guyer and Miller we have investigated the nonlinear excitations in a film of a mixture of 3He and superfluid 4He. We have shown that such a system allows one-dimensional soliton excitations. These solitons, however, are not stable with respect to transverse perturbations. In that case the system allows two-dimensional lump solutions.
