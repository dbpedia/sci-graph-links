Abstract In this paper, we explore a heuristic method called the bee waggle dance to construct cryptographically strong S-boxes. The S-boxes exhibit good cryptographic properties such as high nonlinearity, low differential uniformity and high algebraic degree. The method involves the use of a trinomial power function as the initial S-box. The elements in the S-box are then permuted using the bee waggle dance algorithm. The S-boxes produced using this method are found to compare reasonably well with other existing S-boxes constructed using alternative heuristic methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to construct cryptographically strong S-boxes using the bee waggle dance algorithm.
