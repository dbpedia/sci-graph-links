Abstract A wind tunnel experiment was carried out to investigate the structure, thickness and velocity profiles of a shear force driven liquid film. The local, time resolved film thickness was measured by means of a fluorescence technique, and a dedicated LDA system enabled the measurement of velocity profiles inside the thin and wavy film. The application of both techniques is briefly described.
