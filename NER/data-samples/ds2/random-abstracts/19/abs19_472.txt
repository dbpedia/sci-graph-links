Conclusions 1.The experience of constructing watertight film facings on the first stage of the Great Stavropol Canal showed the expediency of their use on large canals for repair works.2.On-site observations confirmed the high seepage-control effectiveness of film facings on damaged stretches of the canal. The effect of the repair measures were expressed in a reduction of the specific volume of drainage flow within 17â€“30%.3.The length of the reconstructed stretch when performing works under the protection of temporary cofferdams should be set from 100 to 500 m. With a greater length of the section, repair costs increase, the draining process is complicated, and the fulfillment of works in the time alloted for repair is hampered.
