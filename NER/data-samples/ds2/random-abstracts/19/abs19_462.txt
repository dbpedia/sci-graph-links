Conclusions It has been shown that there is a close connection between the change in spinning speed of hydrocellulose films and their acoustical characteristics: rate of propagation of ultrasound and damping cellulose of ultrasound, which permits one to use a nondestructive control method in the technological practice of hydrocellulose film preparation. A close connection has been found between the strength of hydrocellulose film and the propagation rate and damping coefficient of ultrasonic waves.
