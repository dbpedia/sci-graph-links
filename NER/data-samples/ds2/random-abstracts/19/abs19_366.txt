Summary A combination of microporous and a relatively impermeable film was used to overwrap mushrooms. The modified atmosphere created by respiration could be controlled by adjusting the area of microporous film which in turn reduced the loss of mushroom quality assessed by developmental stage, colour, weight loss and disease incidence.
