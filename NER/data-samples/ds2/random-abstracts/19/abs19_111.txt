Abstract Creating non-linear interactive media is a challenging task. In this paper, we summarise our findings with non-linear, interactive movie productions. We carry out this discussion based on experiences gathered during the development and evaluation of an authoring suite enabling the creation and testing of non-linear narratives. The paper shows how our workflow can be understood in terms of the canonical model of media production.
