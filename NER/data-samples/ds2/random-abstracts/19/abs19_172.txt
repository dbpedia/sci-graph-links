Abstract The use of liquid-crystal (LC) cells for the visualization of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film structure is described. Images appearing in LC cells upon LB film application are presented. The images are analyzed in relation to the LB film structure (application conditions) and to the relief formed by indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.
