Abstract The C60-p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene inclusion complex film has been directly formed on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode, and its electrochemical behavior in acetonitrile containing tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte studied. The film has a two-electron reduction wave at −1.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl), but limits to the first cathodic potential scan.
