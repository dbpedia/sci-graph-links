Abstract Literature suggests that dance/movement therapy is still relatively unknown in the healthcare profession and that marketing, when used effectively, can increase job opportunities for dance/movement therapists. This heuristic study is based on the assumption that holistic marketing, as described in Andrea Adlerâ€™s books The Science of Spiritual Marketing and Creating an Abundant Practice, reflect the integrity and values of dance/movement therapy. By focusing on the experience of being initiated into the holistic marketing paradigm as a dance/movement therapist, the following themes were revealed that allow for insight into the relationship between holistic marketing and dance/movement therapy: awareness of core values, connection, and communication. Recommendations are made for future research to expand the presence of dance/movement therapy in healthcare.
