Abstract The linear sizes of thin-film structures, which are used in various microelectronic devices, reach tens of millimeters. In this case, the homogeneity of structures over the area becomes an essential factor. Ferromagnetic resonance as a physical effect, the signal parameters of which are associated with many physical characteristics of the object under study (magnetization, anisotropy constants, etc.), makes it possible to create a highly convenient method for determining these characteristics in various segments of the object under study.
