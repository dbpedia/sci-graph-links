Abstract The effects of ferrofluid on the curved squeeze film between two annular plates, when the upper plate approaches the lower one normally, are studied including the rotation of the magnetic particles and their magnetic moments. The aim is to study the effects of rotation of the magnetic particles on the characteristics of the squeeze film. The main equation is derived in the Appendix A. Expressions for the pressure, load capacity and response time are obtained. Load capacity and response time are found to increase when the volume concentration of the solid phase, Langevinâ€™s parameter or the curvature of the upper plate are increased.
