Abstract This article is based upon thesis research investigating the psychophysical effects experienced by dance/movement therapists who work closely with patients diagnosed “schizophrenic.” This particular patient population was chosen because of the severe level of regression in ego boundaries and because of the emotional intensity cited in such therapist-patient relationships. The research entailed interviewing nine dance/movement therapists with varying degrees of experience. A phenomenological approach was used. Interviews include an overview of the therapist's work background, dance or movement background, attitudes about kinesthetic empathy, and discussions of experiences in weakened ego boundary states while engaged in a dance/movement therapy session. Additionally, the therapists discussed preparatory and/or recuperative measures taken before or after sessions, as well as interventions in weakened ego states.
