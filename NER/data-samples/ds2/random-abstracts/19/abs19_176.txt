Abstract An analytical calculation of the high-frequency capacitance-voltage characteristic of a GaAs thin-film structure is carried out. It is shown that the peculiarities of this characteristic, namely an abrupt drop followed by a falloff to zero, are due to the merging of the depletion regions of the Schottky barrier and the film-substrate junction and to a lag in the recharging of deep centers in the substrate.
