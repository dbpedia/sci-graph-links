Abstract The nonlinear dynamics of a thin axisymmetric liquid film subjected to axial forcing of a horizontal cylindrical surface for initial conditions obtained from various states of a corresponding unforced system on its path to rupture, including near-rupture film configurations, is investigated in this paper. We exploit a nonlinear evolution equation describing the long-wave spatiotemporal dynamics of the film thickness derived in our earlier work and studied there for small-amplitude initial conditions. In this case, the existence of a critical curve separating between the domains of ruptured and contiguous states in the forcing amplitudeâ€“frequency space was shown. We find that near-rupture configurations of the film may be healed by applying harmonic forcing of the substrate with a sufficiently large forcing amplitude. We also reveal that for large forcing delay times the critical forcing amplitude is determined from a constant value of a linear combination of the maximal velocity and acceleration imparted by the forcing on the system when the rest of the problem parameters remains fixed. In the long-range limit, the dynamics of healed films reproduces the long-time dynamics of the films evolving from small-amplitude initial conditions for the same parameter set. It is found that local axial movement of the satellite drop in the near-rupture zone leads to a substantial slow-down of an increase in the critical amplitude in the intermediate range of the forcing delay time when the forcing frequency is fixed.
