Abstract Phosphorus was detected with XPS and AES on the electropolished copper obtained in different hydroxyethylidene-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) concentrations, at different pH values and in various solutions (H3PO4, HEDP, and HEDP+H3PO4). The results show that no phosphorus appears on the copper surface, so that the viscous liquid film formed can be easily removed by washing. The viscous liquid film obtained from H3PO4+HEDP solution possesses very good film-forming characteristics. The composition of the viscous film can be established from the constant composition region of the depth profile curve and may be considered to be a polynuclear coordination polymeric compound with a structural unit of approximately [Cu4(PO)4) (HEDP)] n .
