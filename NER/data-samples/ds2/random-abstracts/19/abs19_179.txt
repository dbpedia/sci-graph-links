Abstract The micropolar theory for fluids is adopted to probe the effect of the microstructure and microrotation on lubrication features in thin film lubrication. Micropolarity will give rise to an increase in the equivalent viscosity that subsequently leads to a better lubrication. The effective viscosity grown with micro polarity is very close to that of experiment in a preceding work.
