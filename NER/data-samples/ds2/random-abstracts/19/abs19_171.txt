Film digitizers are used to transfer hardcopy x-ray transmission films into a PACS environment. Variability between digitizers is primarily due to a lack of an acquisition standard. By utilizing the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Part 14 Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF) as basis from which to judge and modify digitizer output, a methodology using Just Noticeable Differences (JND) can be established that will create custom lookup tables for film digitizers. These modified images can then be judged against the original films using the GSDF to determine if the original films' contrast is preserved. Results based on JND indicated that relative contrast of the original image is preserved.
