Abstract This paper looks at children’s approaches to music composition using advanced music software. The data indicate that the software allowed children different ways of looking at their compositions: visually, musically and aurally. The paper explores the notion of the computer as a scaffold with reference to the Swanwick and Tillman (1986) stages of musical development, seeking to investigate different ways of demonstrating children’s musical development. The paper also discusses the way the software can be used as an analysis and data collection tool.
