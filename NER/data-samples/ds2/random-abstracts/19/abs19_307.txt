Abstract The authors explore the use of touch within the cultural context of Japanese society, psychotherapy and a dance therapy session. The assumption is that touch stimulates a variety of responses, and, that to understand the feelings that it evokes, it is essential to view its meaning within a cultural context. They discuss implications for using touch in a dance therapy session in Japan, held with schizophrenic patients in psychiatric care. To frame how interventions in a dance therapy session are affected by cultural ideas about the body and touch, the authors focus on the following: Japanese conceptualizations of the mind and body; how touch is viewed in Japan in contrast to in Western cultures; and the use of touch in psychoanalysis, psychotherapy and dance therapy. A description of a dance therapy session draws on the material presented to suggest how the natural and open use of touch in Japanese society, coupled with rhythmic touching, can lead patients toward more healthy and supportive interactions in ways that are consistent with their culture.
