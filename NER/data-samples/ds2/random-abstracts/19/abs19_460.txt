Abstract This case study examines parent–carer perceptions of music in storytelling sessions provided in a public library to children under the age of 5, including what music activities and ideas parent–carers implemented in the home as a result of the sessions. Data were collected from parent–carer focus groups, along with interviews with the storyteller and observations by the researcher. Following a description of the storytelling sessions four themes that emerged from the focus group data are discussed: (1) music in storytelling sessions enhanced social interaction for children; (2) music focuses the children in storytelling sessions; (3) music is embedded in storytelling; and (4) sessions provided new ideas for music in the home and beyond.
