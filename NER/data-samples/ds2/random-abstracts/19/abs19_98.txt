Abstract. Since the tetraktys is the most important symbol of the Pythagorean school and system, its prominence in the form and decoration of the Capitol Theatre, Melbourne (Australia), suggests that this building was designed in the Pythagorean spirit. The tetraktys encodes the fundamental proportions or harmonies of the musical scale (1:2, 2:3, 3:4) and so one would expect to find these same proportions used in the form and decoration of the Capitol as well as evidence of relevant musical thought and inspiration in the writings of its designers, Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin. Graham Pont explains the significance of the tetraktys in the Pythagorean tradition, identifies the Capitol as a “secular temple” in form and ethos, and indicates possible contemporary influences on the theatre’s remarkable motif of the “Crystal Tetraktys” and other symbolism.
