Abstract We have investigated theoretically the influence of interlayer exchange coupling on the electromagnetic microwave response of a thin bilayer metal film composed of layers with different values of an uniaxial anisotropy, conductivity and thickness. The excitation of spin waves by passing an alternating current along the film is considered. We analyzed the dependence of the response function of such a structure on the interlayer exchange coupling parameter J and found that the film response is affected by this coupling the most strongly when J is comparable with the layers' thickness.
