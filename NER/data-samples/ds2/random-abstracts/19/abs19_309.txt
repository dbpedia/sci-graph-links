Abstract Several interesting ideas emerge from this study. To begin with, a large amount of information can be gleaned from quantifying and graphing a session. From this study a developmental pattern emerged; methods for comparative leadership styles suggested themselves; relationships between touch and movement came out; and synchronous activity and its developmental analog were manifested. As studies of this nature increase, the development of a simple replicable descriptive system for observing and analyzing group dance therapy can be evolved. Information gleaned from the findings can serve to examine validate or refute existing theories and open the doors for the beginning of a researched body of knowledge concerning dance therapy groups.
