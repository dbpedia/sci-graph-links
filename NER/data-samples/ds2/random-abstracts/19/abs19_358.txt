Abstract Over the last decade psychotherapists have improved their clinical competence to better meet the needs and goals of marginalized populations by reforming guidelines, implementing educational requirements, and shedding a spotlight on potential areas of bias within the therapist-client relationship. The role of nonverbally orientated cultural competence, however, has remained under-researched. Therefore, this qualitative study is designed to better understand dance/movement therapyâ€™s approach toward multicultural diversity competence and to discern and acknowledge the skills, both verbal and nonverbal, currently used by experienced therapists. Several therapeutic skills and considerations for improvements in the field are highlighted, including the need for continued research.
