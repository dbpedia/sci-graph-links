Abstract Sputter depth profiles of an Rh/C microscopically modulated thin film (double layer thickness 7 nm) were obtained by low energy SIMS and SNMS. The depth resolution was obtained using the linear superposition of error functions at the interfaces. In optimal cases the depth resolution was shown to be of the order of 1â€“2 nm for both techniques.
