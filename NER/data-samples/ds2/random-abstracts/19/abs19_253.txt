Abstract Listening to digital music on a computer has led to a loss of part of the physical experience associated with earlier media formats such as CDs and LPs. This paper presents a series of steps and decisions that led to the design of MusicCube, a tangible user interface that allows users to control digitally stored music on a computer by means of gestures and positioning. Interaction with the MusicCube is enriched by offering feedback through multi-coloured light effects and clicking sounds together with computer-generated speech. Despite some ergonomic shortcomings, when comparing to the iPod, users appreciated the design and enjoyed using it.
