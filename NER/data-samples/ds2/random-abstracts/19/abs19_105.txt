Abstract This paper deals with the combined effect of pressure and geometric imperfection on buckling of stressed thin films on a semi-infinite rigid substrate. Analytical approximate solutions are proposed by using the total potential energy of the system and the Rayleigh–Ritz’s method, and their stabilities are also determined. The present analytical approximate solutions agree very well with the numerical solutions obtained via the improved shooting method. The effect of pressure mismatch together with imperfection on the critical stress (above which the film buckles) and on the film-center deflection is characterized. It is found that, compared with the classical case of the Euler column buckling, the equilibrium solutions and critical stress of the film are strongly dependent on the linear combination of the pressure mismatch and imperfection amplitude.
