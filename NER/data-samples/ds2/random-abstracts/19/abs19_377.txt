Abstract The switching curves are studied of a double layer film consisting of two uniaxial ferromagnetic thin films. In this coupled film system the magnetization state is investigated assuming the model of uniform rotation. The coupling between the films is described by a magnetic interface cosine coupling. Numerical results are given for the case of ferromagnetic films with different magnetic parameters coupled together by a ferromagnetic interface cosine coupling.
