Abstract The step-like dependence of the magnetoresistance observed when measuring a structure consisting of series-connected Josephson junctions and a film is investigated. Estimates show that the effect may be due to Abrikosov vortices entering stepwise into the film. They can influence the critical current of a Josephson junction under nonequilibrium and nonlocality conditions.
