Abstract Conversion of potassium iodide in polyvinyl alcohol film by its treatment in the (NH4)2S2O8- CuSO4-KI-KCl-H2SO4-H2O oxidizing solution, leading to coloring of the film with molecular iodine, was studied. The conversion mechanism was analyzed as influenced by each component of the oxidizing solution.
