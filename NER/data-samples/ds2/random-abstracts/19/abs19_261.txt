Abstract. The current dependence of the excess conductivity is measured up to ≃3Tc for a Bi2Sr2CuO6+δ thin film, as a function of doping. It is found to be anomalously sensitive to the transport current and to behave as a universal function of T/Tc in the whole doping range. We discuss these results in the perspective of a granular superconductor with a gapless-like behavior.
