Abstract This article gives an overview of the programme TrainMiC®, a European programme for Life-Long Learning in metrology in chemistry. It explains its raison d’être and puts it into perspective to other European and EU member states initiatives. The TrainMiC® system (http://www.trainmic.org) is described in detail. It is explained how it has developed into a truly unique system which is operational across many parts of Europe (19 countries) via national teams. These teams use shareware pedagogic tools. The learning content has been harmonised at the European level by a joint effort of many experts across Europe working via an Editorial Board. The material has been translated in ten different languages. Possible future evolution of this Life Long Learning programme is discussed.
