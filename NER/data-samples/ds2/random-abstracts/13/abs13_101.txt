Abstract The threshold degree of a function f: {0,1} n → {−1,+1} is the least degree of a real polynomial p with f(x) ≡ sgnp(x). We prove that the intersection of two halfspaces on {0,1} n has threshold degree Ω(n), which matches the trivial upper bound and solves an open problem due to Klivans (2002). The best previous lower bound was Ω({ie73-1}). Our result shows that the intersection of two halfspaces on {0,1} n only admits a trivial {ie73-2}-time learning algorithm based on sign-representation by polynomials, unlike the advances achieved in PAC learning DNF formulas and read-once Boolean formulas.
