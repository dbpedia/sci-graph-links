Abstract Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is the signature teaching/learning strategy for training young physicians. This study reports on a PAL program held during the third-year pediatric clerkship. Respondents felt PAL was useful. A senior elective incorporating PAL is now an official course. PAL is an effective adjunct to traditional teaching methods.
