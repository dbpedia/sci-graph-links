Abstract The popular mnemonic techniques are defined, classified, and described. Empirical evidence is cited supporting the effectiveness of mnemonic techniques in a variety of learning contexts. It is explained why mnemonics are effective. Then, a particular mnemonic technique, the first letter mnemonic, is selected to illustrate how the topic of questionnaire design can be taught using mnemonics. The use of mnemonics in classroom teaching is discussed with specific reference to teaching marketing research and other marketing courses.
