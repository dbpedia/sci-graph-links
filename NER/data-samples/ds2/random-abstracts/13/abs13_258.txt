This paper presents the development process of a web-based educational environment, named "Integrated Professor Oriented Educational Environment for Medical Education (IPOEE-MED)", using the approach of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and the Rational Unified Process (RUP), which is a modern, object-oriented software development methodology. The IPOEE-MED addresses mainly to the faculty members who are novices in computer use and programming and gives them the ability to compose and develop lessons and learning applications through reusing pre-development components and multimedia information, setting the professor in the centre of the teaching process using the new technology. The solution proposed in this paper is a complementary educational method and gives emphasis on the reinforcement of learning in medical education. A pilot demonstration is currently running, for biology and pathology courses at the Medical School of Athens in Greece.
