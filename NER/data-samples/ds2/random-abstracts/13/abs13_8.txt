Abstract Public universities reflect the aspirations a state or society has for its young people and for itself. In this study we examine the level of public funding for universities and its relation to quality. We analyze funding data for British universities and a sample for American universities. Additionally, we examine data on the production of science by faculty at the institutions in our American sample. The data permit an analysis of the relation between investment in higher education and quality. We compare these data with the recent efforts to fund British universities based on measures of scholarship and scientific achievement. We conclude by examining the nature of the relationship between funding and research quality at British universities.
