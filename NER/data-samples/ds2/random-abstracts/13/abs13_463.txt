Abstract An empirical study was undertaken to evaluate second language learning with a videodisc named Vi-Conte. The 78 subjects were post-secondary students and adults and belonged either to a control group, a video-control group or an experimental group. The research methodology is presented as well as analyses of learners' navigational patterns, strategies, gains in vocabulary items, changes in attitude and global evaluation of the videodisc. Suggestions for the development of adaptive learning environments are made based on these findings.
