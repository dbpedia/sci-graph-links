Abstract The article re-examined Lane's (1980) conclusion that there is no clear learning disabilities/juvenile delinquency relationship, in light of the research published primarily since 1980. Reviewing prevalence data and hypotheses related to a learning disabilities/juvenile delinquency connection, the paper surveyed recent studies exploring similarities in characteristics between LD and JD youth, delinquent behaviors in both groups, and research related to remediation of learning disabilities and incidence of delinquent behavior.
