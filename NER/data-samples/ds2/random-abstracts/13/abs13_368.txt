Abstract In this study, 74 masterâ€™s-level counseling students from various programs completed a questionnaire inquiring about their perceived program environment in relation to the topics of spirituality and religion (S/R), program emphasis on nine specific S/R competencies, as well as their outcome expectations toward being S/R competent through training. The results of hierarchical regression analysis supported the impact of both learning environment and specific S/R competencies on student outcome expectations. Implications for counselor educators are considered.
