Abstract In this paper, we explored how engagement developed over time during a proportional reasoning unit for a group of US bilingual Latino/a students, with particular attention to aspects of social and cultural activity that supported students’ engagement. Our findings suggest that student mathematical engagement developed primarily as a relational process characterized by students’ social relations across time, their understandings about their relationships with mathematics, and the important relations emerging across proportional reasoning ideas.
