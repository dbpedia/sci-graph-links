Abstract The aim of this study is to determine the extent to which principals’ self-ratings of leadership effectiveness coincide with their teachers’ perceptions of their leadership effectiveness. Furthermore, we explore several characteristics of teachers and principals in an attempt to identify the factors that may predict congruence in perceptions of leadership. This study draws from survey data of 76 principals and over 2100 teachers who completed parallel forms of a 72-item Learning-Centered Leadership survey (VAL-ED©) in the USA. Teacher and principal characteristics are incorporated into a multivariate regression analysis. Although there is zero difference in the overall sample, teachers and principals within any given school seldom share the same perspective. Principals’ self-efficacy was a strong predictor of principals rating themselves higher than the teachers. Interestingly, the more time a teacher spent with a principal, the less congruence they shared. This research has identified rather large disparities in perceptions of leadership between teachers and their principals. Such a gap suggests that teachers have information and perspectives on school leadership distinct from the principals’ information and perspectives. This research provides evidence that structured teacher feedback may provide a useful avenue for principals seeking additional perspectives on their leadership effectiveness.
