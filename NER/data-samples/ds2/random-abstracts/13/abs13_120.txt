Abstract In this paper, 3D printing of police whistles and its sound frequency researches are presented as a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education for high school students. We consider the 3D printing education is comprehensively suitable for STEM education. As an example for STEM education using 3D printer, we design police whistle using CAD and print it out by 3D printer. We rescale its length of mouthpiece, width and radius of body to examine frequency. We find that the frequency is proportional to the radius of the whistles. Also, we rescale sizes of the whistles and make musical scales and play music. From this activity, we conclude the study using 3D printer is useful for STEM education.
