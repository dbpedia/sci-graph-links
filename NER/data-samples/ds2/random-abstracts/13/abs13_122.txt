Abstract This study examined the impact of the order of two teaching approaches on students’ abilities and on-task behaviors while learning how to solve percentage problems. Two treatment groups were compared. MR first received multiple representation instruction followed by traditional algorithmic instruction and TA first received these teaching approaches in reverse order. Participants included 43 seventh grade students from an urban middle school in Midwestern USA. Results indicated gains in knowledge from both treatment groups; however, the differences between groups were nonsignificant. Comparisons of effect size however, indicated larger growths in abilities to solve among students who received multiple representation instruction first. In addition, statistical differences between on-task behaviors were found in favor of the traditional algorithmic approach.
