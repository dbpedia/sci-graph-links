Abstract This paper examines how an elementary curriculum can be impacted by flow theory and current pedagogical perceptions of arts integration. Specifically, the purpose of this study was to explore how ‘aesthetic flow activities’ affect first-graders’ engagement in the language arts learning process. These activities were used to compare with current curriculum activities, all designed to conform to the same academic goals. The sample consisted of 80 children in four first-grade classrooms, two of which functioned as the experimental groups and the other two as the control groups. Data collecting process The data were collected through participant observation. In addition, the children filled in a five-scale smileyometer, so that they could register their level of satisfaction in participating. From the analysis of the data there were indications that ‘aesthetic flow activities’ can raise pupils’ engagement. The indicators of pupils’ engagement which were measured were the verbal participation of the children in the sample, their multimodal/arts involvement in the taught subject, their creative responses to the taught subject, their multifaceted/holistic activation during the lesson and their satisfaction at participating in the lesson.
