Abstract Many digital library topics may be taught using digital library applications, in the context of project-based digital library courses. Several digital library applications exist, and these applications are used as teaching tools to illustrate the functionality of digital libraries as well as the design decisions that go into them. Using digital library applications as teaching tools provides a valuable learning experience for students, and may provide useful feedback to the developers of DL applications. This paper identifies and explores DL topics that may most effectively be taught using DL applications, in the context of project-based DL courses.
