Abstract PurposeIn this paper, the psychosocial oncology-themed Cross Cancer Institute Multidisciplinary Summer Studentship in Palliative and Supportive Care in Oncology is described from the perspective of the first participants and supervising faculty. MethodsThis 6-week inter-professional elective exposed pre-licensure students to issues facing patients and their families following a diagnosis of cancer, through treatment, recovery, recurrence, palliation, and end-of-life. ResultsParticipants gained experience in team-based skills and compassionate care, were introduced to other disciplines, and formed collaborative partnerships. The Studentship encompasses the features of best practice cooperative learning through clinical experience, facilitated weekly discussion, an exploratory investigation and presentation.The authors’ backgrounds and interest in this area are discussed, as well as pre-existing expectations and goals, reflections on their interactions, challenges faced, and lasting impressions from their experiences seeing through patients’ eyes, framed by the essential tenets of psycho-oncology practice. ConclusionsOur multidisciplinary placement is feasible, successful, and potentially transferable to other academic settings.
