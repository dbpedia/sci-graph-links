Summary OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the authors describe the design, development and evaluation of specific simulation software for Cytogenetics training in order to demonstrate the usefulness of computer simulations for both teaching and learning of complex educational content. BACKGROUND: Simulations have a long tradition in medicine and can be very helpful for learning complex content, for example Cytogenetics, which is an integral part of diagnostics in dysmorphology, syndromology, prenatal and developmental diagnosis, reproductive medicine, neuropediatrics, hematology and oncology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The simulation software was developed as an Interactive Learning Object (ILO) in Java2, following a user-centered approach. The simulation was tested on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac-OSX, HP-UX) without any limitations; the evaluation was based on questionnaires and interviews amongst 600 students in 15 groups. CONCLUSION: This simulation has proved its worth in daily teaching since 2002 and further demonstrates that computer simulations can be helpful for both teaching and learning of complex content in Cytogenetics.
