Abstract BackgroundThere is a perception among surgeons that performing laparoscopic suturing is unduly difficult. The purpose of this study is to document a program which aides in learning laparoscopic suturing. MethodsFourteen volunteer medical students without prior experience were taught laparoscopic suturing. Videoscopic pelvitrainers were utilized for a 2-h training session. Extracorporeal and intracorporeal knot tying was demonstrated utilizing a three-throw square knot. After a 2-h practice session each studentâ€™s time to complete an extracorporeal and intracorporeal suture was recorded. ResultsThe average times required for completion were: extracorporeal suture and knot 1 min 54 s; intracorporeal suture and knot 3 min 12 s. ConclusionsNovice students were able to perform at extra and intracorporeal suturing with 2 h of practice, utilizing a systematic program of teaching basic video skills.
