Abstract Landscape architects design the environment, which is an organic part, an outdoor extension of the building, according to the various functions of buildings. One of the most important objectives in design is to create a strong organization which forms a whole by combining different parts. While creating this organization, it is essential to establish relationships, make the designed elements related and obtain a unique design product. This relationship can be established only with the systems approach. It is a difficult process. For this reason, it was aimed in this study to teach Landscape Architecture students how to achieve designs meeting both creative and user needs. Thus, students will learn how to create successful open spaces with the high level of use which is one of the most important problems nowadays. In this respect, this article has two purposes. The first purpose is to create a study diagram by suggesting the systems approach theoretically. Student works will be evaluated according to this study diagram. The second purpose is to investigate the contribution of the course conducted with the systems approach to the design education. In this study, the systems approach was explained to the students of the Department of Landscape Architecture at Karadeniz Technical University and they were made to design the residence and its immediate surroundings within the scope of the 3rd semester. Then, the effect of the systems approach on the creative and applicable designs of the students was determined with the survey study conducted. The results of this study reveal the importance of the systems approach for both design education and urban designers.
