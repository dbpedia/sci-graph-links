Abstract Consideration was given to operation of the public transport on intraurban routes. Competition between enterprises and the possibility of using cars for conveyance stimulate improvements in the public services. Each enterprise runs a set of routes with the aim of maximizing its revenue by varying the route intervals. The Markov chain was used to model the passenger servicing. Monopoly and coalition-free game of n persons where equilibrium plays the role of solution were considered as the models of the optimization problem. The organizational characteristics of the public transport in the view of the urban interests were studied by way of a numerical example.
