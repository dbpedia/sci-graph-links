Abstract In the field of product design and development, product experience has started attracting a great deal of attention. However, assisting product designers to understand the concept of product experience, what sort of experiences they want for their products and how to include these into their design are topics that still need to be addressed. The aim of this study is to propose a design approach that begins with the use of narration and collects narration cases of product use for a specific product experience. This design approach guides designers through a four-step process, to develop a design model that fits in with the product experience. In order to better understand how this design approach works, this study takes the concept of analepsis as an example of product experience to demonstrate the process. The definition of analepsis, a term used in narratology, is “an event that took place earlier than the point in the story where we are at any given moment.” When the term is used in the product design field, it refers to use past experiences to solve current problems. This study explores the conceptual framework of the topic and proposes a product experience-orientated design model for product design, an issue that has rarely been discussed before. Directions for future research are also discussed.
