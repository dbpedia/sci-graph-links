Abstract How can a large building with many occupants be evacuated in minimum time, and where are the bottlenecks likely to occur in such an evacuation? In order to address this question, three network building evacuation models have been presented. It is believed that the models provide useful new tools for the analysis of building evacuability, and have the potential to facilitate the study of the interrelationships with building design, building redesign, and building evacuability.
