Abstract For the natural two-parameter filtration $$\left( {\mathcal {F}_\lambda }: {\lambda \in P}\right) $$ Fλ:λ∈P on the boundary of a triangle building, we define a maximal function and a square function and show their boundedness on $$L^p(\Omega _0)$$ Lp(Ω0) for $$p \in (1, \infty )$$ p∈(1,∞) . At the end, we consider $$L^p(\Omega _0)$$ Lp(Ω0) boundedness of martingale transforms. If the building is of $${\text {GL}}(3, \mathbb {Q}_p)$$ GL(3,Qp) , then $$\Omega _0$$ Ω0 can be identified with p-adic Heisenberg group.
