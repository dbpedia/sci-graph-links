Summary A human energy balance model is calculated using the homogeneous data set of Vienna, Austria (48°N and 16° E). Variations in the different stages of comfort since 1873 are discussed. The historical data are then used to generate scenarios of a changing climate and calculate the impact of these variations on thermal comfort.
