Abstract If a group Γ acts simply transitively on the vertices of an affine building Δ with connected diagram, then Δ must be of typeÃ n−1 for somen⩾2, and Γ must have a presentation of a simple type. The casen=2, when Δ is a tree, has been studied in detail. We consider the casen=3, motivated particularly by the case when Δ is the building ofG=PGL(3,K),K a local field, and when Γ⩽G. We exhibit such a group Γ whenK=F q ((X)),q any prime power. Our study leads to combinatorial objects which we calltriangle presentations. These triangle presentations give rise to some new buildings of typeÃ 2.
