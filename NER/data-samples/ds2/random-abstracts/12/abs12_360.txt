Abstract This paper generalizes the notion of a blueprint as defined by M. Ronan and J. Tits in 1987. These more generalized blueprints can be used to achieve purely combinatorial constructions of affine buildings over p-adics field, depending only on the associated affine diagrams and the structure of the integers inside the appropriate fields.
