Abstract Most old buildings in Korea are wood framed and, with age, deterioration is found in all wood components of antique buildings. Insects and rapid changes in humidity are among the main causes of deterioration. To preserve antique wooden buildings, nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are required. Various methods of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) such as X-ray, stress wave, drilling resistance test, and ultrasound are used to inspect the safety of wooden antique buildings. The ultrasonic method is relatively simple, inexpensive, and accurate. The rafters are one of the main components of antique buildings and are seriously affected by deterioration. This study aimed to develop a nondestructive ultrasonic technique for evaluation of wooden rafter deterioration. Regression models describing the relationship between the artificial deterioration of the specimen and ultrasonic parameters were proposed. The method was found to be reliable for evaluating wooden rafter deterioration.
