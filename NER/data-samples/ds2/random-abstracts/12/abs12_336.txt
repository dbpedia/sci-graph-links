Summary The author presents a personal view of the role and functions of both the Australian Heritage Commission and the Australian Register of the National Estate. Operational problems are highlighted, and a critique of the Commission and difficulties encountered in working within both national and federal political confines, are outlined. In a decade, the Commission has achieved much towards the preservation of the Australian environment: important in the Commission's current activity is the task of explaining to the lay public precisely what heritage conservation entails and why it is an essential activity.
