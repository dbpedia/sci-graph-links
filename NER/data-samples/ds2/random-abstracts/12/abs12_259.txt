Abstract With a large amount of data (e.g., ratings and feedbacks) obtained from social media (e.g., TripAdvisor), smart tourism applications and services have been studied to understand the contexts of users. More particularly, in this work, we have been focusing on “cultural tourism” service by automatically identifying and ranking cultural things (e.g., historical places). The main aims of this research are (1) to identify useful cultural heritage resources from geotagged social media (more precisely, spatial folksonomy), and (2) to rank them, with respect to the user context (e.g., location). Thus, the smart cultural tourism service can deliver smart interactions between the visitors of smart tourism environments by collecting and analyzing geotagged multimedia data (e.g., photos, tags, and comments) from available social media. In order to evaluate the proposed service, the system has been implemented with the real-world datasets related to cultural heritage sites (e.g., Hue, Hoi An, My Son in Vietnam, and Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Gyeongju in Korea).
