Abstract The construction of Bays and deWeck [1] of a SteinerQuadruple System SQS(14) was generalized by Piotrowskiin his dissertation ([7], p. 34) to an SQS(2p), p â‰¡ 7 mod 12 with a group transitive on thepoints. However he gave no proof of his construction and hispresesntation was open to misinterpretation. So Hanfried Lenzsuggested to analyse Piotrowski's construction and to supplyit with a proof. In the following we will present Piotrowski'sideas somewhat differently and will furnish a proof of the construction.
