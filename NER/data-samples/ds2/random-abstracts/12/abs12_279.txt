Summary Saha [6] has shown the equivalence between a ‘tactical system’ (or at-design) and a 2-symbol balanced array (BA) of strengtht. The implicit method of construction of BA in that paper has been generalized herein to that of ans-symbol BA of strengtht. Some BIB and PBIB designs are also constructed from these arrays. Majindar [2], Vanstone [8] and Saha [6] have all shown that the existence of a symmetrical BIBD forv treatments implies the existence of six more BIBD's forv treatments in (v/2) blocks. An analogue of this result has been obtained for a large class of PBIB designs in this paper.
