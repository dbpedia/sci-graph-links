Abstract Demands for increased energy production have initiated several new high-voltage power line projects, of which hundreds of km will traverse reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) habitat in central and northern parts of Scandinavia. We investigated area use of semidomesticated reindeer in the Essand reindeer district’s summer range (Norway) in connection with a new 420 kV power line built in 2008/2009 to replace an existing 300 kV line. We used 6 years (2008–2013) of GPS telemetry data from 5 to 22 female reindeer per season. During the construction period compared to the period before and after construction, predicted probability of use decreased on average 10 % within areas 6 km from the central infrastructure for the calving period, about 12 % within 3.5 km in summer and close to 13 % within 3.5 km in autumn. In the calving period prior to construction, as well as the calving period, summer and autumn for the years after construction, use of areas close to the infrastructure did not deviate from random. Resource selection functions showed significant effects of construction work, habitat quality, elevation and aspect on the area use of reindeer. We found no support for the hypothesis that power lines have negative effects on reindeer area use, independent of associated human activity during construction. Mitigation measures should focus on both the construction period of power lines, minimizing construction work when adjacent areas are utilized by reindeer, as well as keeping human activity to a minimum during operative years.
