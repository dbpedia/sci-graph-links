Abstract Condominium maintenance is a critical issue in Albania. After the fall of communism, the ownership and maintenance responsibilities of hundreds of thousands of flats that were constructed and owned by the state was transferred to their occupants. In the capital, Tirana, there was also a huge wave of new condominium construction after 1990. A new law on the management and maintenance of condominium building was recently adopted and is in the early stages of implementation. This article discusses how residents of condominiums actually manage the maintenance of their buildings in Tirana. It reveals that condominium laws have had little impact and that the performance of maintenance tasks is based on informal and often ad-hoc agreements, in keeping with the cultural norms of the society and the actual financial situation of the residents.
