Abstract The group of simplicial automorphisms of a Tits–Kac–Moody infinite building of thickness q associated to a cocompact reflexion group with fundamental domain a simplex, is Kazhdan for q sufficiently large. Thus we obtain families of new Kazhdan groups: two in dimension 3 and one in dimension 4. The proof uses continuous cohomology, in particular a lemma of Casselman–Wigner, and Garland's vanishing method.
