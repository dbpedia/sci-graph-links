Abstract Changes in transport are likely to produce changes in land use, and these long-term effects of transport policy may be of considerable potential importance. There is a growing movement, “The New Urbanism”, which seeks to reconnect transport with land use and in particular to establish transitoriented development where higher-density, mixed-use areas are built around high-quality transit systems. Based on analysis on development and pattern of urban transport in Guangzhou, this paper researches composition of urban transportation and structure of travel pattern. The urban transport system development and change in urban form as well as change in land use are closely related. The urban transport system required and promoted by the high-density land-use pattern. There are many problems in the urban transportation and land-use, one of the resolving is integration of urban transport planning and land-use planning.
