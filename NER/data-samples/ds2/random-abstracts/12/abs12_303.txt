Abstract. Nancy Wu examines the architectsâ€™ instruments carved next to the effigy of Hugues Libergier, the thirteenth century designer of the Abbey of Saint-Nicaise in Reims, sheddinglight on tools of the trade, uses of geometry in architectural design, proportional relationships and the stature of medieval men along the way.
