Abstract This article focuses on the recent development of energy efficiency strategies in Chinese archives and library buildings. Since architectural design and construction have a significant impact on interior temperature and humidity, many approaches have been used to meet temperature and humidity standards and to increase energy efficiency. These approaches include, but are not limited to, the use of thermal insulation and heat preservation composite materials, and the strategic design of doors and windows. This article describes the application of energy-efficient techniques including exterior wall thermal insulation systems, energy efficiency doors and windows, the double-pane windows technique, house thermal insulation and heat preservation techniques, solar energy systems, as well as air-conditioning systems with ground or water source heat pumps. This article also discusses comprehensive ways to increase energy efficiency in archives and library buildings, such as ventilation, greenhouse techniques, and the utilization of the surrounding environment.
