Abstract The comprehensive application of fire safety engineering in modern buildings makes the quality of fire safety equipment a very important aspect of the achievement of fire safety. With its direct relevance to the safety of human life and property, the quality of fire safety engineering in buildings is of concern not only to builders and their clients, but also to various social groups and organizations, ranging from government bodies and business organizations to the individual users of the buildings. Results of the recent research by the authors indicate that the government, insurers, quality certification bodies, building authorities, fire authorities, and trade and professional bodies significantly influence the development of quality assurance in the fire protection industry in the United Kingdom. In this article, the authors explore how these social groups and organizations play their roles in the development of a macro system for quality assurance in the fire protection industry in the U.K.
