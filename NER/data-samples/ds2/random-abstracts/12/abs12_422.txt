Summary The design for a steady-state gradient environment to be used in conjunction with a plankton capable of directed movement is given. A dilution of partially digested human waste produced the gradient. The steady-state apparatus is composed of three distinct units: the agent flow system, the dilutant flow system, and the gradient chamber.
