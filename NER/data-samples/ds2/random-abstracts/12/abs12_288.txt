Summary By modifying the restrictions imposed on the levels of the factors in a second order rotatable design, an alternative series of response surface designs has been obtained. Thev factors of the design have been split into two groups, and the design is rotatable for each group of factors when the levels of the factors in the other group are held constant. As such, the designs have been called ‘group-divisible rotatable designs’. Several methods of their construction, analysis and also some methods of blocking have been discussed.
