Abstract The present paper applies the distance equilibrium model in analysis of environmental planning in the areas of architecture, travel, and telecommunication. Travel is viewed as essential for therestoration of face-to-face contact lost through decentralized (sociofugal) architecture. Telecommunication is seen as a substitute for travel. While telecommunication cannot restore face-to-face interaction in its entirety, it can through compensation along available modalities (i.e., proxemic, kinesic, paralinguistic, and/or linguistic) allow functionally equivalent interaction distances. Finally, we define crowding across multiple modalities and multiple dyad terms. Contrary to convention, we argue that one can be crowded by PicturephoneÂ®, telephone, or letter as well as by face-to-face interaction, and is by one other person as well as by many.
