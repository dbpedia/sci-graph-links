Abstract Deep foundation construction projects are quite risky, so it has to be checked by supervisors for code compliance and reviewed by a committee of experts for risk identification before the construction begins. The quality of code compliance checking directly affects the safety of deep foundation construction. Because of the limitations of manual checking by even the best supervisors, the goal of this research is to achieve an approach of BIM-based code compliance checking for deep foundation construction presented in BIM models, as well as a system based on the proposed approach. This research abides by the principles of four stages in rule-based system, and emphasizes the development of the library of checking knowledge and the standard of required information which are the key problems in achieving the BIM-based code compliance checking. Decision tables, production representation and a developing process similar to IDM development are used to solve the problems. Furthermore, a case study is provided to investigate the effect of the BIM-based code compliance checking process. It is proved that the BIM-based checking improves the efficiency and precision in code compliance checking and facilitates the risk identification at the next stage. It ensures the safety of deep foundation and reduces personal injury and property loss.
