Abstract The aim of this paper is to introduce the soft systemic approach to medical information system design, called metaparadigm. The metaparadigm is a metadesign paradigm. Using it we first design an IS design paradigm and it is our deep belief that metaparadigms employment can enhance many conventional IS design weaknesses and result in successful information system design and use. In the paper we show the applicability of the metaparadigm in MIS design and introduce a new personal MIS design paradigm.
