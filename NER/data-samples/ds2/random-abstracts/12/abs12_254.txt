Abstract Sub-hourly electricity consumption data is being routinely collected from non-domestic buildings in European countries, yet there is little published guidance on how to analyse this data. A new analysis technique is described that produces electricity load profile indicators to help identify potential electricity savings from 81 municipal buildings of six different types: commercial and public offices, libraries and museums, sport centres, schools, community centres and care homes/hostels. This approach is different from conventional energy management analysis techniques since it uses total electricity consumption data in half-hourly periods rather than annual or monthly data. The analysis enabled the detection of buildings with consumption profiles that differ significantly from the typical profile for that building type. This provided a systematic and rapid procedure to identify potential energy saving opportunities in multiple buildings. The new approach introduces a standard statistical technique, independent of energy manager judgement, to help identify energy saving opportunities in buildings.
