Abstract This work is an attempt to give a complete survey of all known results about “pseudo (v, k, λ)-designs.” In doing this, the author hopes to bring more attention to his conjecture given in Section 6; an affirmative answer to this conjecture would settle completely the existence and construction problem for a pseudo (v, k, λ)-design in terms of the existence of an appropriate (v′, k′, λ′)-design.
