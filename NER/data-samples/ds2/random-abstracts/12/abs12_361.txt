Abstract We introduce a new notion of valuations on planar ternary rings(PTRs), which allows us to extend some results concerning the relations between orderings and valuations of fields to PTRs. Our concept generalizes van Maldeghem's notion of PTRs with valuation, coordinatizing the buildings at infinity of discrete triangle buildings.
