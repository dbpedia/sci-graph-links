Abstract In 1987, Teirlinckproved that if t and υ are two integers such that v ≡ t(mod(t + 1)!(2t+1) and v ≥ t + 1 >0, then there exists a t - (v, t + 1, (t + 1)!(2t+1)) design. We prove that if there exists a (t+1)-(v,k,λ)design and a t-(v-1,k-2,λ (k-t-1)/(v-k+1))design with t ≥ 2, then there exists a t-(v+1,k,λ (v-t+1)(v-t)/ (v-k+1)(k-t))design. Using this recursive construction, we prove that forany pair (t,n) of integers (t ≥ 2and n ≥ 0), there exists a simple non trivial t-(v,k,λ) design having an automorphism groupisomorphic to ℤn 2.
