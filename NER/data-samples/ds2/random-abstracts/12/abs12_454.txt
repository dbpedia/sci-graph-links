Abstract Using a mixed-method, case study research design, the present study explores four Toronto high-rise residential buildings in order to produce feedback about how occupants experience and behave in these buildings. The primary dataset is 700 comments received on 165 questionnaires. Content analysis was performed on the data, identifying envelope, heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC), hot water, indoor environmental quality, and layout and design as the primary themes. The comments revealed important feedback for the designers and managers of these buildings; including important insights into the HVAC system, envelope, balcony, hot water delivery system, and noise control strategies. Though subjective in nature, the comments received from occupants are revelatory and have implications for the amount of energy consumed by the buildings, as well as the level of occupant satisfaction. Though not a substitute for quantitative problem solving, they are a complimentary strategy in the pursuit to improve the satisfaction and sustainability of the built environment.
