Abstract Discussed in this paper are the issues underlying the mechanical design of a seven-axes isotropic manipulator. The kinematic design of this manipulator was made based on one main criterion, namely, accuracy. Thus, the main issue determining the underlying architecture, defined by its Hartenbergâ€”Denavit (HD) parameters, was the optimization of its kinematic conditioning. This main criterion led not to one set of HD parameters, but rather to a manifold of these sets, which allowed the incorporation of further requirements, such as structural behavior, workspace considerations and functionality properties. These requirements in turn allowed the determination of the link shapes and the selection of actuators. The detailed mechanical design led to heuristic rules that helped in the decision-making process in defining issues such as link sub-assemblies and motor location along the joint axes.
