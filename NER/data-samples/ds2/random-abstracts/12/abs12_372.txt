Abstract A recent study on the environmental impact of automatic fire sprinklers is documented in a two part series. The current paper provides a background on residential sprinkler technology from its inception until the present, and analyzes the contribution of risk factors, such as fire, on the total lifecycle carbon emissions of one- and two-family dwellings and the reduction to that contribution achieved via the use of automatic fire sprinklers. The analysis shows that the risk of fire increases the carbon emissions of a building over itsâ€™ lifecycle. The results illustrate that sound risk management is necessary to achieving sustainability and avoiding unintended consequences. These findings are especially important as society seeks to design and build more energy- and resource-efficient, environmentally sustainable buildings.
