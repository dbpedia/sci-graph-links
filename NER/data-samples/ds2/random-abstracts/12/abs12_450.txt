Abstract This paper introduces SArch, an environmental impact assessment tool developed in Thailand. SArch can be used to assess the environmental impact of construction materials throughout the lifecycle of buildings. The assessment starts with the raw materials and follows their preparation, transportation, utilization and maintenance to post-utilization or destruction. Five categories of impact are considered: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, ecological toxicity and smog. SArch can be used to assess the environmental impact of materials in the building design phase as well as the impact of existing buildings. An example of using SArch for the assessment of a residential house in Thailand is provided.
