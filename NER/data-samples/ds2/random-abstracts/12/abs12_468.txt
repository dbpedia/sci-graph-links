Abstract China has introduced a series of policies and laws to promote green building since 2000. Energy efficiency is the central issue, partly due to China’s energy structure. As advocated by these policies and laws, more and more green buildings are being built. The overall aim of this paper is to explore a more sustainable framework for green residential buildings, from energy efficiency to integrated sustainability. A critical case study is presented of the Landsea Housing Project in Nanjing, a hot-summer/cold-winter zone. The analysis suggests applying a systematic approach—covering all aspects of green housing development, including technical, economic, social and environmental—in China, arguing that this is a more effective way to meet the sustainability goals.
