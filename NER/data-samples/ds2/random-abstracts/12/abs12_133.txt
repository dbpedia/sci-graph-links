Abstract A new “COMECON” standard for thermal comfort within residential and civic buildings (Table 1) is based on the “Complex System of Evaluation of Hygro-Thermal Microclimate” (Jokl, 1972) starting from an exact mathematical model of the indoor environment (Jokl, 1981). Not only optimal parameters are predicted but also admissible values and their ranges, i.e. their possible changes — also the requirements for the sensitivity of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls.
