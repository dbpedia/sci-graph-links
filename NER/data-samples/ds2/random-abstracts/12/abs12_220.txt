Abstract In this study, the past investigations of the design criteria of vortex tubes were overviewed and the detailed information was presented on the design of them. Vortex tubes were classified and the type of them was described. All criteria on the design of vortex tubes were given in detail using experimental and theoretical results from the past until now. Finally, the criteria on the design of them are summarized.
