        nif:isString    "Abstract Cooperative conflict research supports the value of the right to dissent and self-expression as contributing significantly to organizational effectiveness. Through conflict, problems are identified, and solutions created and accepted, and a sense of justice and fairness established. Research also proposes a corresponding responsibility that employees and employers should establish a strong cooperative context for managing conflict. Structuring a conflict-positive organization is a powerful way to capture the benefits of conflict and support the right of dissent.\n" .
