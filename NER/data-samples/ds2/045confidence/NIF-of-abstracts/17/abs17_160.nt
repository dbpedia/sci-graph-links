        nif:isString    "Abstract Decision making is a task that individuals face on a daily basis. The process of making a decision differs from one person to another. The processes involved in making a decision are defined as decision making styles, which can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Children and adolescents’ decision making, however, often is thought to be associated with parenting. This review examines and describes previous studies examining the associations between decision making styles and parenting approaches. It suggests that maladaptive decision making styles are the most prevalent, and that they often are associated with detrimental outcomes for children and adolescents’ development. Maladaptive decision making styles also are associated with negative parenting approaches. The review reveals that western and non-western societies play an important role in shaping these associations; however, it also finds that age and gender do not play a significant role. The review highlights gaps in literature focusing on decision making and parenting, and the continents where little research has examined the associations presented. The review adds to current debates and knowledge on youth development by providing an understanding of decision making styles from an international perspective as well as from the important role that parents play.\n" .
