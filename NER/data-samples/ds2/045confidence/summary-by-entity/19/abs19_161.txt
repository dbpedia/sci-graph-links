Abstract A new model of an X-ray reflection experiment is proposed for studying the structure of a film on a substrate. The experimental data are processed to yield the density distribution across the film, and an appropriate approximation produces numerical values of the parameters { δi, βi, σi, d 1} for each of the n layers in a multilayer film model. So far there has been no method for determining the film structure from experimental data and the problem has been usually solved by trial and error.
