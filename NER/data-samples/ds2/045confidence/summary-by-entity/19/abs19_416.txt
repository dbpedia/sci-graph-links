Abstract The goal of this paper is to show that in large samples the variances of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates provided by the element-space MUSIC (i.e., MUSIC applied directly to the sensor output data) are always less than the corresponding variances associated with the beam-space MUSIC (i.e., MUSIC applied to spatially filtered sensor data).
