Abstract Stamps convey important visible messages about a state’s heritage and worldview. They are images or official visible products seen by those living within the state’s borders and those beyond. They also can be considered as “imagined communities,” as like festivals, holidays, or WWW pages, they represent attachments to and images of place. We investigate stamps as elements of visual culture by examining salient music themes and topics from several countries and then focus on the music stamps of Brazil, Hungary, and Senegal. In each case, we examine the number and variety of issues, the importance they place on musical instruments, composers and performers, and musical events.
