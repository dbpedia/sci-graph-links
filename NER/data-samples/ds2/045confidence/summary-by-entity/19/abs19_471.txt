Abstract The spatial and temporal distribution of nematodes in two low rate percolating filter bed sewage treatment plants at Carnforth and Caton, Lancashire, were investigated. Nematodes were abundant reaching densities up to 900 cmâˆ’2 of media surface. Numbers decreased down the bed and species composition displayed spatial differences with bed depth. Eight orders of nematode were represented, members of the sub-family Diplogasterinae and Rhabditinae were particularly common. A seasonal pattern of abundance was clearly apparent; two peaks occurred, one in May and a second during the winter months. Lowest numbers corresponded with periods of highest temperature. The demise of the nematodes in the spring was related to the sloughing of the surface film on the media.
