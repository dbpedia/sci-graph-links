Summary Wall-coated, open-tubular (capillary) columns prepared from different diameter tubing, with different liquid phase film thickness, are compared with each other and with packed and support-coated open-tubular columns. The comparison is based on the variation of the phase ratio and the capacity factor, and includes column efficiency (HETP, theoretical plate number), resolution, retention time, and sample capacity. Problems associated with the evaluation of the sample capacity are outlined. The influence of temperature on column performance is discussed in detail. Finally, the possibilities of short, wide-bore open-tubular columns prepared with a thick liquid-phase film are demonstrated.
