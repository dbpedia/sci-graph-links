Abstract This study investigates the use of the creative arts therapies to effect cognition, achievement, motivation, and self-concept in elementary school students. The literature review covers creative thinking, self-concept, competence motivation, and the use of creative arts therapies in the classroom. Creative arts therapies sessions utilizing movement, music, and art therapy conducted by trained dance, music, and art therapists working together, were conducted twice weekly over a three month period with normal second and fourth grade classes. Pre- and post-test measures utilized were: theTorrance Test of Creative Thinking; What I Am Like, a self-concept scale expressing competence perceptions;In The Classroom, a self-support scale of intrinsic/extrinsic motivation toward learning; and theWoodcock measure of reading comprehension. A multivariant analysis of variance suggests positive growth in creative thinking and reading comprehension. Correlational analysis suggests relationships between self-concept, motivation, and creativity. Finally, principle component analysis suggests that the children's resultant thinking had a more original style. The use of creative arts therapies as affective education is discussed.
