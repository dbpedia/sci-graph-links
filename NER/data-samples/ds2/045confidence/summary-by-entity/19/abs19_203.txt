Abstract The new media-arts revolution which combines art and design with innovative technology has made the shift of social and cultural texts into computer-mediated forms of production, distribution and communication. The invention of digital devices and contents has also revolutionized the quality of sound, image, and data, the way in which they are contemplated and served as the forms of art in relation to the convergence of multiple professions. Within this study, the social context and scenery are visualized and transcoded into design objects. The researcher delves further into the use of new electronic media-FleXpeaker™, which was invented by the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan. The researcher put specific images printed on both sides of the surface of FleXpeaker™, as well as with sound effects far-distance monitored by a Bluetooth receiver to call out one’s imagination of the events, the time and the underlying environment encoded in the new media. Therefore, the devices viewed as design objects do help users to converge diverse elements in relation to artistic expression and cultural representation. As the result, this particular case of media convergence leads to a new hyper-real experience for the viewers and audience.
