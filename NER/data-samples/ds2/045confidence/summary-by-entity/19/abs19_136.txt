Abstract Gravimetry experiments in a well-controlled environment have been performed to investigate aging for a glassy PMMA/toluene film. The temperature is constant and the control parameter is the solvent vapor pressure above the film (i.e. the activity). Several experimental protocols have been used, starting from a high activity where the film is swollen and rubbery and then aging the film at different activities below the glass transition. Desorption and resorption curves have been compared for the different protocols, in particular in terms of the softening time, i.e. the time needed by the sample to recover an equilibrium state at high activity. Non-trivial behaviors have been observed, especially at small activities (deep quench). A model is proposed, extending the Leibler-Sekimoto approach to take into account the structural relaxation in the glassy state, using the Tool formalism. This model well captures some of the observed phenomena, but fails in describing the specific kinetics observed when aging is followed by a short but deep quench.
