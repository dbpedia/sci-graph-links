Abstract  Retrieving relevant information is a crucial component of cased-based reasoning systems for Internet applications such as search engines. The task is to use user-defined queries to retrieve useful information according to certain measures. Even though techniques exist for locating exact matches, finding relevant partial matches might be a problem. It may not be also easy to specify query requests precisely and completely â€“ resulting in a situation known as a fuzzy-querying. It is usually not a problem for small domains, but for large repositories such as World Wide Web, a request specification becomes a bottleneck. Thus, a flexible retrieval algorithm is required, allowing for imprecise or fuzzy query specification or search.
