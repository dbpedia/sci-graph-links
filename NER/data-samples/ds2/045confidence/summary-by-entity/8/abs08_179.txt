Abstract. The relative simplicity of access to digital communications nowadays and the simultaneous increase in the available bandwidth are leading to the definition of new telematic services, mainly oriented towards multimedia applications and interactivity with the user. In the near future, a decisive role will be played in this scenario by the providers of interactive multimedia services of the on-demand type, which will guarantee the end user a high degree of flexibility, speed and efficiency. In this paper, some of the technical aspects regarding these service providers are dealt with, paying particular attention to the problems of storing information and managing service requests. More specifically, the paper presents and evaluates a new storage technique based on the use of disk array technology, which can manage both typical multimedia connections and traditional requests. The proposed architecture is based on the joint use of the partial dynamic declustering and the information dispersal algorithm, which are employed for the allocation and retrieval of the data stored on the disk array. We also define efficient strategies for request management in such a way as to meet the time constraints imposed by multimedia sessions and guarantee good response times for the rest of the traffic. The system proposed is then analyzed using a simulation approach.
