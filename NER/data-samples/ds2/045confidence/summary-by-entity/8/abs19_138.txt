Abstract Digital imaging is rapidly becoming modern radiology practice, resulting in the gradual replacement of conventional radiographs. At present high-quality digital mammography has been available for several years and is increasingly used for diagnostic and screening mammography. Some different digital mammography systems exist, which all have their advantages and disadvantages. Diagnostic accuracy of digital mammography has been shown to be at least equivalent to screen-film mammography (SFM). Digital mammography offers some potential advantages over SFM. This article describes the current state of digital mammography and presents data from clinical trials that support the use of digital mammography technology.
