Abstract Signcryption is a cryptographic primitive that fulfills both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption simultaneously, at a cost significantly lower than that required by the traditional signature-then-encryption approach. In this paper, we propose a hybrid signcryption scheme in the certificateless setting, its security and performance were analyzed. As a result, its provable security has been verified to achieve the confidentiality and unforgeability. Comparative analysis shows that the new scheme has lower computation cost and communication overhead. Generally speaking, it is very suitable for secure communication protocols of key management and secure routing in the wireless sensor networks.
