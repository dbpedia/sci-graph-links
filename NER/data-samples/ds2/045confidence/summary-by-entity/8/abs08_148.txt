Abstract This work proposes an efficient and secure color and grayscale image encryption scheme that utilizes a chaining of skew tent maps as its pseudorandom number generator. The proposed scheme convolves the shuffling and mixing operations into several rounds for enhanced security. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the high performance of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the scheme shows superior performance over existing image encryption schemes with regard to differential attacks.
