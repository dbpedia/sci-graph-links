Abstract With the prosperity of cloud computing, many mobile nodes choose to deliver their certificate by service AP nodes, where each service AP node as a broker is responsible for authenticating virtual resource access with mobile users who are likely to be malicious in the underlying service requests. However, this access control system requires mobile usersâ€™ certificate information and may fail due to their privacy. In light of the growing privacy concerns, this paper proposes a certificate-aware framework for online access control system in mobile computing, where users are compensated for their privacy certificate and operation disclosure and are motivated to present more certificate information. In this framework, a broker pays a trust degree to users and virtual authentication coordinators for disclosing more certificate information. This paper models the interactions among virtual authentication coordinators, the authentication broker and mobile users as a three-stage game, where every player aims at maximizing its own utility, and the trust allocation is achieved by G value learning. Numerical results have shown that the proposed certificate-aware framework is effective, as it enables all players to maximize their utilities and improve the degree of the trust of mobile computing systems.
