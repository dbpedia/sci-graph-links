Abstract The stress relaxation-time behaviour of processed cheese has been studied after compression by 5–20�Data were corrected for surface friction effects, since it is only that part of the registered force which actually compresses the samples that relaxes exponentially. The method of successive residuals and an empirical normalization linearization procedures were used to analyse the data. In both cases it was found that several of the calculated rheological parameters, at any selected compression, were significantly higher after correcting for surface friction. The initial compression also influenced the magnitude of the rheological parameters.
