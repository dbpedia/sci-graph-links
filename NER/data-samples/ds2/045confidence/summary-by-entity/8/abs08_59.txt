Abstract Privacy and its related variables are important determinants of customer behavior in the electronic market. This paper aims to examine the concern for customer privacy on the Internet, mainly with regard to disclosing personal information online. Furthermore, by establishing an experimental situation, we will analyze how this behavior is influenced by familiarity with the website sponsor, the level of control over the information the customer has and the sensitivity of the information requested. The results indicate that all the above-mentioned variables (except familiarity) have a significant impact on consumer online behavior.
