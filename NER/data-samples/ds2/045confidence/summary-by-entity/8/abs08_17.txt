Abstract A code is n-deletion correcting if it is possible to correct any n deletion of symbols having occurred in transmission of codewords. In this paper, we present explicit constructions of n-deletion correcting codes for arbitrary values of n using generalized Reed–Solomon codes and their subcodes.
