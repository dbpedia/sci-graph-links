Abstract Trust is one of the most important security requirements in the design and implementation of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. In an environment where peers’ identity privacy is important, it may conflict with trustworthiness that is based on the knowledge related to the peer’s identity, while identity privacy is usually achieved by hiding such knowledge. A trust model based on trusted computing (TC) technology was proposed to enhance the identity privacy of peers during the trustworthiness evaluation process between peers from different groups. The simulation results show that, the model can be implemented in an efficient way, and when the degree of anonymity within group (DAWG) is up to 0.6 and the percentage of malicious peers is up to 70�the service selection failure rate is less than 0.15.
