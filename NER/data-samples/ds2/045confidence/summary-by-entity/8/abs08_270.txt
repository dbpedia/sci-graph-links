Abstract Given the growing number of group applications in many existing and evolving domains recent attention has been focused on secure multicasting over the Internet. When such systems are required to manage large groups that undergo frequent fluctuations in group membership, the need for efficient encryption key management becomes critical. This paper presents a new key management framework based on a combinatorial formulation of the group multicast key management problem that is applicable to the general problem of managing keys for any type of trusted group communication, regardless of the underlying transmission method between group participants. Specifically, we describe Exclusion Basis Systems and show exactly when they exist. In addition, the framework separates key management from encrypted message transmission, resulting in a more efficient implementation of key management.
