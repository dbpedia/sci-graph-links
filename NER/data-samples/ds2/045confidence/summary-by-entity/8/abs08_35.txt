Abstract Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET) are infrastructureless networks where self-configuring mobile nodes are connected by wireless links. Because of its decentralized operation, these nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Video transmission over MANETs is more challenging than over conventional wireless networks due to rapid topology changes and lack of central administration. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume that all nodes are working within a cooperative and friendly network context. However, misbehaving nodes that exhibit abnormal behaviors can disrupt the network operation and affect the network availability by refusing to cooperate to route packets due to their selfish or malicious behavior. In this paper, we examine the effect of packet dropping attacks on video transmission over MANETs. We also study the effects of mitigation using intrusion detection systems to MANET in presence of video traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study multimedia over such environments. We propose a novel intrusion detection system, which is an adaptive acknowledgment scheme (AACK) with the ability to detect misbehaved nodes and avoid them in other transmissions. The aim of AACK scheme is to overcome watchdog weaknesses due to collisions and limited transmission power and also to improve TWOACK scheme. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme, simulation experiments are performed. The results of our experiments show that MPEG4 is more suitable for our simulation environment than H264 video traffic. The simulation results show that AACK scheme provides better network performance with less overhead than other schemes; it also shows that AACK outperforms both TWOACK and watchdog in video transmission applications in the presence of misbehaving nodes.
