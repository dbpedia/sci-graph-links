Abstract Many studies have demonstrated that infants exhibit robust auditory rhythm discrimination, but research on infants’ perception of visual rhythm is limited. In particular, the role of motion in infants’ perception of visual rhythm remains unknown, despite the prevalence of motion cues in naturally occurring visual rhythms. In the present study, we examined the role of motion in 7-month-old infants’ discrimination of visual rhythms by comparing experimental conditions with apparent motion in the stimuli versus stationary rhythmic stimuli. Infants succeeded at discriminating visual rhythms only when the visual rhythm occurred with an apparent motion component. These results support the view that motion plays a role in infants’ perception of visual temporal information, consistent with the manner in which natural rhythms appear in the visual world.
