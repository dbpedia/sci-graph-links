Abstract BackgroundThe association between subjective cognitive decline and falls has not been clearly determined. AimsOur aim was to explore the effect of subjective cognitive decline on falls in community-dwelling older adults with or without objective cognitive decline. MethodsWe included 470 older adults (mean age 73.6 ± 5.2; 329 women) living in the community and obtained data on fall history directly from the participants. Subjective cognitive decline was assessed using a self-administered question. Objective cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Statistical analyses were carried out separately for participants with objective cognitive decline and those without. ResultsA multiple logistic regression analysis showed that, among participants without objective cognitive decline, subjective cognitive decline was positively associated with falls [OR 1.91; 95�onfidence interval (CI) 1.17–3.12; p = 0.01). Conversely, among participants with objective cognitive decline, subjective cognitive decline was negatively associated with falls (OR 0.07; 95�I 0.01–0.85, p = 0.04). DiscussionThe result suggests that the objective–subjective disparity may affect falls in community-dwelling older adults. ConclusionsThe presence of subjective cognitive decline was significantly positively associated with falls among cognitively intact older adults. However, among their cognitively impaired peers, the absence of subjective cognitive decline was positively associated with falls.
