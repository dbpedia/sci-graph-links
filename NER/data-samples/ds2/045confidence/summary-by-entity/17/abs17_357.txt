Abstract Anxiety sensitivity, one measure of distress intolerance, has been increasingly shown to play a role in a variety of health behaviors. A number of reports now suggest that individuals with higher levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS) are less likely to engage in exercise. However, this finding has been inconsistent across sex and limited by measurement strategy. This study examined the relationship between AS and self-reported exercise in a mixed-sex sample of 233 individuals. Consistent with prediction, AS was negatively associated with engagement in vigorous-intensity exercise; however, the strength of this association when covarying for sex was dependent on the measurement strategy used (continuous vs. categorical ASI scores). Sex did not moderate the AS-vigorous exercise association. AS was not associated with moderate-intensity exercise or walking. Results suggest a role of distress intolerance in exercise behavior and confirm the importance of continued research on this topic.
