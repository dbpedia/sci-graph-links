Abstract The study presents analysis of the experimental flow curves for polycrystals of fcc concentrated solid solutions Ni-Cr and Ni-Mn. It was demonstrated that the flow curves of these alloys can be divided into a number of stages of work hardening, and stage II bisects into two substages: with parabolic, and linear hardening. It was demonstrated that the shape of the curves of work hardening is determined by the type of dependence L = f(σ), where L is the average path length of the motion of the dislocation;σ is flow stress. Some possible critical stresses of transition from stage to stage are discussed.
