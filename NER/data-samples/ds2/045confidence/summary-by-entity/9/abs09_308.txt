Abstract A new method for the investigation of surface coatings by EPMA is presented. It is based on a physical model which takes into account the X-ray intensity depth distribution, the absorption and the electron backscattering effects at the interface between film and substrate. When combined with the “concentration mapping‘ (CM) technique, a two-dimensional film thickness distribution and the film composition can be determined simultaneously. Only bulk standards are required for this method. With some examples in the field of steel sheet production and electrogalvanizing the versatility of the method as well as its high sensitivity are pointed out. Particularly important for practical work is the applicability to almost any combinations of film and substrate materials as well as the wide thickness range from almost the total X-ray emergence depth down to the monolayer range.
