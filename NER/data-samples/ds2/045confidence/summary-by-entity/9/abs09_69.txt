Summary Many important functional coatings are realized by advanced coating technology in almost any kind of industry. To meet that goal, innumerable coating techniques and coating materials have been developed and are in use. By varying coating and substrate material, an almost unlimited potential exists in the case of plasma spraying and its process variants, which has to be regarded as the most important coating technique. To meet increasing requirements in coating performance, there has also been an increase in the importance of analytical techniques in coating production. The dominant areas of analytical methods which arise in the case of plasma spraying are characterization of coating materials, spray process control and coating characterization as well as cases of coating failures. To meet these requirements in analyzing, many analytical techniques are available and their use is a must in coating technology.
