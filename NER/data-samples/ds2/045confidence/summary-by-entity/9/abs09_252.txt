Abstract In situ Al-4.5Cu-5TiB2 composite has been processed through stir casting method, in which, the TiB2 particles have been precipitated in situ by mixed salt route involving reactions between K2TiF6 and KBF4.The as-cast specimens containing 20 volume percent liquid content have been subjected to three mushy state roll passes, each leading to 5 percent reduction in thickness. The grain structure has been found to be globular in the mushy state rolled composites. Measurements along the cross-section have shown decrease in average grain size and increase in hardness, as one proceeds along the direction of rolling. On the other hand, grain size and hardness have been found to be more or less similar, when compared for sections perpendicular to the rolling direction.
