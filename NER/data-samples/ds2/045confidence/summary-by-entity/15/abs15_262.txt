Abstract The practical experience on the implementation of ISO/IEC 17025 compliant quality system in a nuclear analytical laboratory of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) is described. This paper summarizes the need for a quality system and accreditation, the process of a quality system implementation, the quality system structures, and the formal accreditation of our laboratory by the Korean Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (KOLAS). Also, the improvements in the management, technical and service quality which resulted from implementation of this system are briefly reported.
