Abstract Traditional information system and managerial mechanism cannot meet the new environment protection regulations; therefore, a new solution must be set up, else it may run the risk of losing the market and the value of product brand.This research focuses on the solutions provided by the network and communication industry, manufacture of the green products, and the establishment of a Webbased green collaboration management system, which incorporates the environment protection requests into the product development and green supply chain activities. There are three goals: (1) For the design of green products, green components and product management are set up for the purpose of de-toxin and ease of disassemble; (2) For the green supply chain, the management of hazardous substances, product recycle and disassemble are set up; (3) For the product recycling management, the recycling information is feedback for the product update and collaboration operation. The result of research can provide information for the integration of workflow and information system currently in use, provide RoHS and WEEE management solutions, and set up green collaboration information system, so that green products, brand leadership, and environment protection endeavor can be assured.
