Abstract The paper depicts the development of reference data models for strategic key performance indicator systems specific to waste management firms providing a new comprehensive typology of generic models for data warehouse solutions. Additionally, a development methodology for industry solutions is applied, which, given the empirically founded typification process and the theoretically derived performance measurement systems, is characterized by a high degree of structure and transparency. The new approach thus systematically integrates both inductive-empirical and deductive-analytical elements.
