Abstract Local independent unions (LIUs), which have represented a sizable minority of union members, largely emerged from company unions once they had been declared illegal upon the upholding of the National Labor Relations Act. This paper constructs and analyzes three distinct patterns of the organizational transformation of company unions into LIUs to determine if these LIUs became autonomous and independent of management or remained controlled by the employer. It was discovered that, in a majority of the cases, these LIUs were legitimate unions that operated independently of employer domination.
