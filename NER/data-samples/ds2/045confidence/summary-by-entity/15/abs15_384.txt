Abstract When designing, planning and controlling supply chains schedule reliability is the central objective and is a key performance indicator for assessing the logistic behaviour of a supply chain. The central influencing factor on schedule reliability is the lateness of supply chain processes. In order to comprehend possible interdependencies between logistical objectives and the influencing factor lateness various approaches have been developed for mathematically describing lateness in a supply chain’s primary processes. This paper focuses on the mathematical description of output lateness distributions in inventory systems. The developed logistic model describes the relationships between stock and service levels as well as the resulting inventory system’s output lateness distribution. Within a comprehensive simulation study the quality of the model’s depiction is demonstrated. The paper concludes with an overview of possibilities for applying the developed model for describing the lateness behaviour in supply chains.
