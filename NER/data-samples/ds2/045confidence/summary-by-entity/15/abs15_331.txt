Abstract This paper discusses the competitive pressures forcing major organisations to co-operate ever more closely in designing, manufacturing and supporting new products and major assets. It explains the resulting business and integration issues and presents a potential solution based on the use of product data management technology, supported by business consultancy and flexible commercial models that share investment costs and benefits.
