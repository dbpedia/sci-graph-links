Abstract The thesis of this book is that efficiency, equity and voice are all human rights and should be treated as such by individuals, corporations and governments. The author reviews a wide range of philosophical and religious material that affirms the human rights nature of these aspects of employment relations. He also assesses a broad spectrum of approaches to employment relations against the standards of efficiency, equity and voice. Of particular note is the authorâ€™s critique of contemporary mainstream economics for subordinating voice to efficiency.
