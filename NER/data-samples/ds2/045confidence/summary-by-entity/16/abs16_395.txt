Abstract This article looks at authorship patterns in Dutch sociology from 1939 to 1987. Results from co-author analysis show an increase in collaboration. Yet, most publications are still written by single authors. Network analysis of co-author relations for two seven year intervals and one six year interval distinguished 37 clusters with three or more members. Most clusters could be identified by experts. However, the clusters only partially matched their perception of research networks within Dutch sociology.
