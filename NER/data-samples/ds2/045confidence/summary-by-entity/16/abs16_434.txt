Abstract To counteract the fragmentation of cooperative development in California, U.S.A., a multi-stage strategy was developed to link capital-intensive agricultural cooperatives with member-intensive consumer cooperatives. The strategy began by identifying issues on which agreements between the two groups could come easily. These included joint sponsorship of a statewide Co-op Month and the initiation of a university Center for Cooperatives. Specific details of the implementation process are discussed.
