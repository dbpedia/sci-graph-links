Abstract  The study presents the findings of an impact analysis of public support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF, in the field of materials research. The Project Management Organization New Materials and Chemical Technologies, NMT, at Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH is acting on behalf of the BMBF. More than 350 projects with industrial participation have been analysed to determine the effectiveness of the project funding in application-oriented materials research. In addition some projects were assessed in depth to provide case studies for various areas of materials science. The scientific and technical success as well as the commercial, ecological and sociological (job-market effects) impacts of projects finished for at least one year have been investigated by means of a questionnaire addressed to the industrial participants with the following results:
