Abstract As part of a wide-scale education reform, Hong Kong schools have been focusing on the creation of ‘no loser’ classrooms that support learning for all students (Education Commission 2000). This article examined both groups of ethnic minority and Chinese students’ perception of assessment practices and the extent to which classroom practice is consistent with preferred assessment practices. The 11 items of assessment practices list, developed by Brown et al. (2009a), were used to investigate the perceptions of 1,518 student respondents from 15 primary and secondary schools, in which a large number of ethnic minority students were accommodated. A confirmatory factor analysis showed that the respondents in the group from secondary schools viewed teacher-dominated assessment as the most important assessment practice in the model examined (Brown et al. Learning and Instruction, 19(2), 97–111, 2009b) whereas those in the primary group considered teacher-student interactive assessment as the most important practice. Also, three perceptions of assessment practices of ethnic minority students were confirmed: teacher-dominated, student-centred and teacher-student interactive. Amongst them, the most preferred one was the teacher-student interaction assessment practice. Finally, the implications of the creation of a no loser classroom for all students are discussed.
