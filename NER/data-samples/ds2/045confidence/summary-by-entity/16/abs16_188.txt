Abstract We consider the Boltzmann equation for the hard-sphere model. We construct an explicit approximate solution of this equation in the form of a continuum distribution in the case of global Maxwellians. We obtain some sufficient conditions for attaining the minimum of the uniform-integral mismatch between the sides of the equation.
