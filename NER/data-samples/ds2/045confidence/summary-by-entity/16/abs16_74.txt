Abstract This study examines, from the consumer centric perspective, how service convenience in conjunction with online service quality affect long-term relational exchange in the electronic mediated environment (EME). Service convenience is conceptualized as a second order formative construct with six convenience dimensions demonstrating the process of online service consumption. An analytical framework is developed and tested to validate a comprehensive research model of service convenience and its antecedents and consequents. Analysis of data from 772 respondents revealed that service convenience is indeed a multidimensional formative concept and contributes to long-term exchange relationship between the consumers and service providers. Implication and future research is discussed.
