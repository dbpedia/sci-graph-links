Abstract This article analyzes changing formations of global and everyday culture—particularly those associated with health, medicine, and consumption—through a concrete investigation of the development and use of anti-obesity medications. The first half of the article elucidates some of the new local-global connections being forged between fat bodies and global orders by situating the production and circulation of a new class of such medications within a sociotechnical assemblage that includes, among other elements, scientific research, transnational corporations, overweight individuals and populations, and the internet. The second half of the article explores the forms of local and everyday pharmaceutical practice associated with these medications. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with medication users, I demonstrate that while biomedical models focus on the physiological and psychological effects of drug interventions, the significance of the medications in practices of everyday life is largely socio-spatial. I suggest that these medication provide a means of protecting individuals from a hostile modern environment—the obesogenic landscape of hyperconsumption—and argue that the practices associated with the use of obesity medications can be understood as part of the work of accommodating and reproducing contemporary consumer and capitalist culture.
