Summary In two experiments subjects were asked to report the identity of a position-cued critical letter in a linear array of letters. The identification errors made were classified either as “intrusion” (i.e., a report of a letter not in the array), or as “location” (i.e., a report of a noncritical or context letter from the array), and the arrays used were either unpronounceable non-words or words. In the first experiment all stimuli were four letters long and were presented in two parts: a leading array in which the information from two quadrants of a vertical by horizontal division of each letter was presented, and, after intervals of 40 and 160 ms, a trailing array of the complementary letter parts. The cue for the critical letter appeared either 80 ms before the initiation of the leading array or 320 ms after. The results showed a word advantage in all conditions, and an analysis of mislocations as proportions of total errors did not show that they differed significantly for non-words and for words. In the second experiment the stimuli were eight letters long and they were presented intact, followed after 140 ms by a patterned mask. The critical letter was again pre- and post-cued, and arrays subtended either 1.6° or 5° of visual angle. The results again showed a general word advantage and no difference in the proportions of mislocations for non-words and words. The results of both studies failed to provide support for the notion that the non-words probably required more attention than the words, and since this differential-attention hypothesis questioned the equality of encoding assumption of the Interactive Activation model of word perception, its rejection supported the latter proposition. It was concluded, therefore, that the encoding of the strings of letters in these studies was independent of their linguistic properties.
