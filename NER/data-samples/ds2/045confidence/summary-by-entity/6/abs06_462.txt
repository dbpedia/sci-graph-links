Abstract Comparison of the current approaches to human ecology shows a contradiction between certain views on the subject and the methodology of its analysis. The notion of human ecology as the ecology of the species Homo sapiens is being developed in terms of modern general ecology and should be considered at all organizational levels, from individual to global. Material and spiritual cultures, which are the main adaptations of human beings represent a continuation of the general trend of living matter towards progressive evolution and are accompanied by an increase in orderliness related to the intensification of energy consumption. This superindividual adaptation determines the human capacity for occupying new ecological niches without changing the hereditary background. Therefore, consideration of Homo sapiens at the superorganismal level is of special importance in human ecology. Analysis of this issue shows that the functional patterns of systems belonging to this level have certain characteristics in common with those of the population systems of other species.
