Abstract A simplified and inexpensive procedure for the conduct of research on recognition memory retrieval is presented. The procedure is a card sorting analog to Sternberg’ s item recognition task. An experiment is presented which demonstrates the card sorting task’ s validity. Discussion centers on the suitability of the task for the undergraduate laboratory. Suggestions are given for how card sorting may be used to study psycholinguistic processing and semantic memory.
