Abstract This study aimed to further characterize the nature of swallowing dysfunction in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome (SS). Subjects filled out a perception of swallow function form. Measures of stimulated salivary flow rate were also taken, and videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing was completed. The amount of saliva produced by patients with SS was significantly less than that produced by normal age-matched controls, and these patients perceived their swallowing to be impaired. Few statistically significant differences were found between the SS group and normal age-matched controls on temporal measures of swallowing, and 96�f swallows in the SS group were judged to be functional. There was no correlation between perception of swallowing and amount of saliva produced. No strong correlations were found between temporal measures of swallowing and salivary flow rate. Results indicated that patients with SS tend to perceive their swallowing to be worse than physiologic swallowing measures indicate. The decreased saliva production in these patients does not appear to be the cause of their perceived swallowing difficulty but may affect their sensory judgment of swallow function. Future studies will focus on how quality of saliva affects swallowing in these patients.
