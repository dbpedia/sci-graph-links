Abstract The influence of predation risk on the opportunity for female mate choice was investigated in the tailspot wrasse Halichoeres melanurus at two sites on a coral reef in Okinawa, Japan. Females mated repeatedly with the nearest males, but they also changed mates frequently at both sites. Mate changes were seen not only in the context of spatiosocial changes (mate disappearance or shifts in male territories) but were also probably the result of actual mate choice by females. Females at one site (site A) changed mates more often and conducted longer spawning trips from their home ranges to male territories than at the other site (site B). Fish at site A were faced with a higher frequency of predators than that of site B. However, fish of site A suffered fewer attacks from predators because they had more shelter, suggesting lower predation risk in that site. These results suggest that females under higher predation risk had less opportunity to choose preferable mates and that they had to mate with the same, nearest males in most cases.
