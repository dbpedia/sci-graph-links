Abstract This article defines envy and describes the various ways in which it may manifest itself, pointing out that there may be positive as well as negative effects of envy. These concepts are then applied to the psychotherapeutic situation, and the effects of envy in the transference, and particularly the countertransference, are discussed. Finally a case presentation demonstrates how the therapist's recognition and understanding of envy in the countertransference were used in a positive way and helped the therapy to proceed in a more productive direction.
