Summary The responses of Polygonum pensylvanicum L., an early successional annual, and of Polygonum virginianum L., a late successional perennial, were examined along discontinuous gradients of soil moisture, light and nutrient availability. In the case of P. virginianum both individuals grown from seed and individuals grown from rhizomes were examined. The results show that variation in the response of individuals of a species of different age to environmental variation is as great as that found between the two congeneric species of different successional habitats. In general, individuals of the two species were more similar to one another in response to the resource gradients when both were started from seed, than were individuals of P. virginianum grown from seed and from rhizomes. Potential differences in stored reserves (starting capital) between rhizomes and seeds appeared to have little effect upon responses to resource availability. A number of plant characters were found to vary along the gradients in ways that were unique to the character, the gradient, and the age of the individual. These characters included aspects of leaf size, shape, and orientation, as well as whole plant architecture. Many if not all of these characters are likely to have significant effects upon the functioning of plants. The origin of this difference in response to the gradients of individuals of P. virginianum of differing age may be ontogenetic or may reflect differences in genetic composition created by recombination.
