Abstract It can be seen from some theorems proved by Penrose that when Strong Causality or Distinguishing fail, they fail along at least a segment of a null geodesic. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the other causality conditions. In particular, we prove that when causal continuity and stable causality fail at some point, there is a segment of a null geodesic through that point along which the conditions fail.
