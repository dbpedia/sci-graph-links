Abstract. To evaluate the adaptive value of daphnian aggregation associated with attack abatement, a combined laboratory and field experiment was performed. As the lake investigated does not contain planktivorous fish, only invertebrate predation is important. In the laboratory, newly collected Chaoborus flavicans, among the most important predators to exploit the Daphnia population in the lake, were individually placed in a spherical flask containing different densities of juvenile Daphnia prey. The number of successful attacks of Chaoborus was independent of prey abundance. Thus, in a given density regime, each individual prey gained protection from a dilution effect. In the field, dense aggregates of Daphnia were created by continuously adding food at a localized point in the littoral. Even though the food input produced aggregates of Daphnia which were maintained for 3Â h, the number of invertebrate predators did not increase in the input area. It is concluded that each Daphnia in a group reduces the probability of predation through an effect of attack abatement which is approximately proportional to the number of prey in the group. However, when considering the high median density of Daphnia, together with their strong response to food input, it seems more plausible that natural aggregates are driven by a patchy food distribution, whereas attack abatement is only a secondary effect of aggregation.
