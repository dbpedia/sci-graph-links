Abstract The geomorphology of the Lar Valley in the Northeast of Tehran, the Capital of Iran, is under the geological influence of the Central Alborz, in which the different geological formations are folded and thrust, time and again over each other by faults, creating the heights. The Damavand volcano is located to the east of Lar Valley, appearing in the heights of Alborz at the point of deviation in the structural strike of Alborz chain and along the faults during the quaternary period. The physiographic, landslide phenomenon, rock fall, valleys, water courses and alluvial fans in the Lar Valley were reviewed and studied according to aerial photographs, satellite images and field observations from the aspect of their susceptibility to the impact of faults. The results indicate that 80�f the peaks and high mountains in Lar Valley are created and influenced by the action of overthrust faults. Ninety percent of the land and rock sinking are located in the intermediate regions between the faults, and they are believed to be the results of fault impacts. Seven out of the nine cases of landslide in Lar are located on or in the margin of the faults depicting the latter’s influence. The floor ratios of eight valleys were calculated and it was determined that in addition to the impacts of faults on creating the valleys, the situation of most of these along the margins of the faults as well as seven valleys are influenced by faults. The slope of rivulets and auxiliary rivers and their angles in relation to each other and the main river were calculated. The results showed that seven rivulets were under the influence of faults. Fifty-nine percent of the alluvial fans in Lar Valley were greatly influenced by faults, whereas 49�ere under their normal impact. The supposition in this study is that the results can be used to identify faults and their characteristics.
