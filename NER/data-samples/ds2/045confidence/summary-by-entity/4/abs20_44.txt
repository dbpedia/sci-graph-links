Abstract. A system for automatically identifying the script used in a handwritten document image is described. The system was developed using a 496-document dataset representing six scripts, eight languages, and 279 writers. Documents were characterized by the mean, standard deviation, and skew of five connected component features. A linear discriminant analysis was used to classify new documents, and tested using writer-sensitive cross-validation. Classification accuracy averaged 88�cross the six scripts. The same method, applied within the Roman subcorpus, discriminated English and German documents with 85�ccuracy.
