Abstract This paper presents the results of the first stage of an ongoing project of evaluating the spatial and temporal variability of soil water as fundamental factors for vegetation regeneration in the arid ecosystems in the Blue Nile-eastern Sudan. The specific aim of the present study is to understand the temporal and spatial variations of the major climate variables in the region and discuss its relevance to regional climate variability and changes. In this case, we systematically analyze the major climate variables (maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, and net solar radiation). To evaluate the different characteristics of the climate variables, Mannâ€“Kendall method, two-phase regression scheme, and wavelet transform technique are used; each method has its own strength and weakness, and the results of the three methods complement each other. The results show that the annual and seasonal maximum temperatures are increasing significantly. The annual minimum temperature and minimum temperature in dry seasons are decreasing. The minimum temperature in rainy season is increasing with a smaller rate as compared with the increase of maximum temperature in the season. The difference between maximum and minimum temperature is increasing in all the seasons. Net solar radiation in the region shows a significant increasing trend in all seasons, which corresponds well with the changes of maximum temperature. Besides, significant decreasing trends can be identified for relative humidity in all the seasons.
