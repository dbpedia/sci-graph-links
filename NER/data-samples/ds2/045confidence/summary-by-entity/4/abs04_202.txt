Abstract We give upper bounds for the size of 3-uniform hypergraphs avoiding a given odd cycle using the definition of a cycle due to Berge. In particular, we show that a 3-uniform hypergraph containing no cycle of length 2k 1 has less than 4k 4 n 1 1/k  O(n) edges. Constructions show that these bounds are best possible (up to constant factor) for k=1,2,3, 5.
