Summary Anhydrite and gypsum are the main components of the sulphatic rocks of Switzerland. The chemical reaction of anhydrite in contact with water provokes a considerable swelling pressure which often causes damage to underground constructions. During the drilling of a gallery through a chain in the Jura mountains the occurrence of sulphatic rocks could be observed in several outcrops. To distinguish the degree of gypsification of the sulphatic rocks a simple laboratory method was applied.
