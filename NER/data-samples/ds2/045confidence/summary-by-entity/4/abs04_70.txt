Abstract Recent variations in the warm seasonal mean of surface specific humidity (q sfc) in Japan were studied using 34 years of data (1976–2009) from 150 meteorological observation stations of the Japan Meteorological Agency. The regional trend in the warm seasonal mean q sfc at 3 local standard time (LST) (UTC   9 h), averaged over Japan, increased significantly with small changes in the relative humidity: the rate of increase was  1.93 g/kg per 100 years. The warm seasonal mean q sfc over Japan, calculated using four-times-daily data, increased slightly: the rate of increase was  0.95 g/kg per 100 years. About 16 �f the stations exhibited a significant increasing trend in warm seasonal mean q sfc calculated using four-times-daily data; these stations were concentrated in eastern Japan. The increasing trends at 40 �f the stations were more evident for the mean q sfc at 3 LST than at other local times. The local time at which the diurnal cycle of the mean q sfc reached a maximum was 15 LST in period 1 (1976–1992) and tended to be delayed until up to 21 LST in the interior in period 2 (1993–2009). In addition, the rate of increase in mean q sfc at nighttime was larger around the coastal and mountainous areas on days with well-developed thermally induced local circulation.
