Conclusion In the final analysis, despite the reservations expressed earlier, I do not regret having become a sociologist because it has allowed me to write a few books and express ideas on some subjects of importance, modest as their impact might have been.15 I also found academic life generally congenial espe-cially given the abundance of leisure that goes with it.
