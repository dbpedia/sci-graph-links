Abstract The various theoretical approaches currently used in the description of the πNN system and the experimental situation of its several reactions are reviewed. The system consists of reactions leading to three-body states (πd→πNN,NN→πNN), reactions leading to two-body states (πd→πd, πd→NN, NN→NN), and possibly reactions leading to one-body states (the speculated πNN bound-state problem).
