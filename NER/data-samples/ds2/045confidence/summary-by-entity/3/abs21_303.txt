Summary Cultures ofStaurastrum gracile maintained in a liquid medium in a 16∶8 hours light: dark regime were asynchronous. Alteration of the regime to 14∶10 or 18∶6 failed to induce synchrony, as did variation of the light and dark temperatures. The cultures were synchronized by eliminating a light period to give a total dark period of 32 hours. One such cycle gave 54�ynchrony, the cells entering division at the onset of the second light period after treatment. The omission of a second light period 72 hours after the first produced no increase in the level of synchrony. The level was improved by omitting a further light period 48 hours after the first to give a 32∶16∶32 induction treatment which resulted in 64�ynchrony. In no instance did the cells divide between the dark treatment and the synchronized wave of cytokinesis. The mechanism of this synchrony may be explained by the existence of an essential, dark-labile division precursor.
