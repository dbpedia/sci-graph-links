Abstract Basic results of theoretical and experimental studies of acoustic effects caused by horizontal refraction in a shallow water are reviewed with special emphasis on the effect produced by intense internal waves on the propagation of broadband signals. Theoretical calculations and experimental data testifying to the manifestation of three-dimensional acoustic effects in the SWARMâ€™95 experiment are presented.
