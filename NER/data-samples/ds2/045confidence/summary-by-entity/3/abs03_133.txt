Abstract Using laser spectroscopic techniques the natural radiative lifetimes of 4s 2 n 1 s 2 S and 4s 2 n 2 d 2 D states of neutral gallium have been measured forn 1 = 6 to 11 andn 2 = 4 to 9. These states, as well as previously measured4s 2 np 2 P states, have been investigated theoretically using multi-configuration Hartree-Fock calculations. Oscillator strengths to all lower-lying states have been calculated and theoretical lifetimes of the investigated states evaluated. The2 D sequence is strongly influenced by the 4s4p 2 2 D perturber, and strong cancellation effects in the radiative decay are observed both theoretically and experimentally.
