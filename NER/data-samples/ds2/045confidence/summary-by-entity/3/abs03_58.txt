Abstract The molecular dynamics method is applied to simulate spalling during the plane shock interaction between plates. The effect of lattice defects in a material on the propagation of a shock wave and the process of spalling is studied. The plastic effects are described using a model of imperfect particle packing with defects (vacancies). The model proposed can describe the separation of the shock-wave front into an elastic precursor and a plastic front and give velocity profiles for the free target surface close to the experimental profiles.
