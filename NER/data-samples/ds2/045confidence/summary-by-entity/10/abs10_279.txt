Abstract As scaling has continued for more than 20 years, it has yielded faster and denser chips with ever increasing functionality. With recent advances in technology, the number of transistors mounted on a VLSI chip is about 10 million gates. In such advanced technology, device feature sizes have become increasingly smaller than the wavelength of light used by the available optical lithography equipment. Therefore, a design for manufacturability (DFM) approach has become the most important factor in the design of LSI. In this article, we propose a new DFM approach as the target for the next generation in the layout design phase. Simulation results evaluating the proposed algorithm show good performance.
