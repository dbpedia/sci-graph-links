Abstract Inkjet of conductive patterns is a topic which already attracted much interesting research. Its importance arises from the ability to deposit electrical circuits on almost any kind of substrates. Understanding the controlling parameters to obtain lines with suppressed coffee stain effect still remains an important goal. The results reported here were obtained with a commercial nanoparticle based silver ink printed with a Dimatix 2800 printer. They show the effect of the printing parameters (drop spacing, substrate temperature, ink concentration and substrate type) on the 3D shape of straight lines. In particular it is shown that flat lines can be obtained at any ink concentration on the two different substrate types tested but at specific substrate temperature and drop spacing. Dependence of line cross-section area and line width on drop spacing is also analyzed.
