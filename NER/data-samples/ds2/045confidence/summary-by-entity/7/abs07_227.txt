Abstract Frequently occurring red heartwood decisively restricts the volume of light-coloured beech wood, which can be processed to high-grade appearance products. Forestry and wood industry lack suitable means for maximising the yield of light timber, since the intra-tree extent of red heartwood varies considerably. The present study characterised in detail the intra-tree shape of red heartwood and its relationships to tree-external traits (dead branches, branch scars), considered as possible initiation points of red heartwood formation. An experimental method based on log scanning and image analysis was developed and applied. Using its output for three-dimensional visualisation and data analyses, external traits being linked to the local red heartwood shape were identified. Furthermore geometric relationships were established for characterising these external traits and for deriving discriminating criteria.
