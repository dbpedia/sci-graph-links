Summary Let X 1, X 2,..., X n be independent random variables having a common distribution in the domain of normal attraction of a completely asymmetric stable law with characteristic exponent α}(0,1) and support bounded below. Let X n:n ≧X n:n -1≧...≧X n:1 denote the ordered sample. We obtain the rate of convergence of n -1/α (X n:n  ... X n:n-k n 1 ) to the stable limit law as both n and k n »∞. As a consequence we obtain a representation of the sum X n:n  ... X n:n-k n 1 .
