Abstract The aim of this paper is to extend our knowledge about the power-law relationship between citation-based performance and collaboration patterns for papers by analyzing its behavior at the level of a national science system. We analyzed 3012 Cuban articles on Natural Sciences that received 17,295 citations. The number of articles published through collaboration accounted for 94 �The collaborative articles accounted for 96 �f overall citations. The citation-based performance and international collaboration patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.22 ± 0.08. Citations to a field’s research internationally collaborative articles in Natural Sciences tended to increase 2.1.22 or 2.33 times each time it doubles the number of internationally collaborative papers. The Matthew Effect is stronger for internationally collaborative papers than for domestic collaborative articles.
