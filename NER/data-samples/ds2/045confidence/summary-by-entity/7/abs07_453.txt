Summary A description is presented of experimental techniques used and results obtained in measuring radiation at various levels in a pine forest. When point source values of solar radiation below the canopy were compared to horizontal average values for the same hours, hourly average values were found to vary from 60�o 260�whereas average daily values varied only as little as 2�o 11�The amount of solar radiation which penetrated the canopy varied both diurnally and seasonally. The greatest seasonal variation (from 44�o 33�was observed within the span of a few weeks during the leafing season, even though there were only a few deciduous trees in the area. A higher albedo was found for spruce than for pine, and diffuse to direct solar radiation was shown to vary with air mass. Net long-wave radiation was higher with Arctic air masses than with Maritime Polar or Tropical air masses. Atmospheric emissivity did not correlate well with either air temperature or vapour pressure when morning data were combined with afternoon data. A somewhat improved relationship was possible when morning and afternoon data were grouped separately. Downward long-wave radiation below the canopy was controlled primarily by lower canopy temperatures and secondarily by downward long-wave sky radiation. It was estimated that after leafing only about 15�o 20�f downward long-wave sky radiation was penetrating to below the canopy.
