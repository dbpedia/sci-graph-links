Abstract The evolution of public procurement law has been influenced by the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union which has been instrumental in developing the concepts of the public procurement acquis and in providing clarity and certainty to its decentralised application. The current reform agenda of public procurement is guided by the Courtâ€™s precedent which attempts to fuse the underlying principles of public procurement regulation with the fundamental EU Law principles. Public procurement is viewed by both EU Institutions and Member States as an instrument for growth and competitiveness in the light of the European 2020 Strategy.
