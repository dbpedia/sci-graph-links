Abstract A comparative analysis is performed for the distribution and the frequency of occurrence of the quantitative ratios between the chemical coefficients of binary chemical compounds, symbols of twinning faces, etc. Comparison is carried out using the modified Weiss-Goldschmidt prognostic ranked scheme. It is demonstrated that the Pauling parsimony law is combined with the Goldschmidt complication principle.
