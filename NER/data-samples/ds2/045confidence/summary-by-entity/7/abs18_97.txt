Abstract For control systems which can be locally stabilized in small time by means of a dynamic periodic time-varyingstate feedback law, we give a sufficient condition on Lie derivatives of the output for local stabilization in small time by means of a dynamic periodic time-varyingoutput feedback law. If the system is analytic our sufficient condition is also necessary.
