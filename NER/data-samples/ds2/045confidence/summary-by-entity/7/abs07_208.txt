Abstract The vertical foliage distribution of Castanopsis cuspidata (Thunb.) Schottky was examined in trees of various sizes to clarify its variation in relation to tree size and the light environment in a stand. As indices of these parameters, we analyzed crown social position (CSP: percent of stand height) and specific leaf area (SLA). The vertical foliage distribution of trees was expressed by a Weibull function. The variation in the vertical foliage distribution of C. cuspidata could be categorized into three types using crown social position and light environment. In the first type, leaves were concentrated to the top 20ï¿½f the tree; such trees are canopy trees that can receive full sunlight. The second type had a large relative crown depth and an asymmetric distribution with the maximum foliage located near the top of the tree; such trees are suppressed trees whose crowns do not receive sufficient light. The third type had a large relative crown depth and a symmetric distribution; such trees occur in high light environments, although their crowns are in the understory layer. The differences in the vertical foliage distribution are related to the strategies used to capture light. Multiple regression analysis showed that CSP and SLA at the top layer of the tree explained successive changes in the vertical foliage distribution. These results will contribute to scaling-up the vertical foliage distribution to the community level in pure stands of C. cuspidata using an individual-based model.
