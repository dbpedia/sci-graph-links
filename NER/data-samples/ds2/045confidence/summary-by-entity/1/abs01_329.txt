Abstract In this paper, we study characteristics of detection of spatial signals from an antenna array in the case of short samples. All the studied decision statistics are obtained on the basis of the generalized likelihood ratio for arbitrary-size samples. As an example, we develop the working characteristics for detecting a useful signal representing one or two coherent plane waves against the background of spatially uniform and nonuniform noise. The efficiency of the used statistics is compared with the Ï‡2 criterion for detecting noise-like signals.
