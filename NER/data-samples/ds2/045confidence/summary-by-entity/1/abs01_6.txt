Abstract Equations are obtained which describe the interaction between a nonstationary electromagnetic field and a measuring transducer consisting of two linear parallel conductors separated by a dielectric layer. The system of equations obtained holds for an arbitrary orientation of the Poynting vector and different angles of polarization.
