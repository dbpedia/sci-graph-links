Abstract The problem is formulated in this article of finding all Einstein spaces in which the equations of the geodesics admit a complete separation of variables. The problem is completely solved in the case of the interval ds2=gijdxidxj i=0,...3, being quadratic in the differentials of the acyclic coordinates xν ν=2, 3, and it is shown that this kind of space can be subdivided into five classes.
