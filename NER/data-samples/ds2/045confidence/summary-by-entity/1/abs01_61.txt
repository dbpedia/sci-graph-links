Abstract The concepts of k-systems, k-networks and k-covers were defined by A. Arhangel’skii in 1964, P. O’Meara in 1971 and R. McCoy, I. Ntantu in 1985, respectively. In this paper the relationships among k-systems, k-networks and k-covers are further discussed and are established by mk-systems. As applications, some new characterizations of quotients or closed images of locally compact metric spaces are given by means of mk-systems.
