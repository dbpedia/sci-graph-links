Abstract Multi-objective algorithms are aimed to obtain a set of solutions, called Pareto set, covering the whole Pareto front, i.e. the representation of the optimal set of solutions. To this end, the algorithms should yield a wide amount of near-optimal solutions with a good diversity or spread along this front. This work presents a study on different coarse-grained distribution schemes dealing with Multi-Objective Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms (MOACOs). Two of them are a variation of independent multi-colony structures, respectively having a fixed number of ants in every subset or distributing the whole amount of ants into small sub-colonies. We introduce in this paper a third method: an island-based model where the colonies communicate by migrating ants, following a neighbourhood topology which fits to the search space. All the methods are aimed to cover the whole PF, thus each sub-colony or island tries to search for solutions in a limited area, complemented by the rest of colonies, in order to obtain a more diverse high-quality set of solutions. The models have been tested by implementing them considering three different MOACOs: two well-known and CHAC, an algorithm previously proposed by the authors. Three different instances of the bi-Criteria travelling salesman problem have been considered. The experiments have been performed in a parallel environment (inside a cluster platform), in order to get a time improvement. Moreover, the system scaling factor with respect to the number of processors will be also analysed. The results show that the proposed Pareto-island model and its novel neighbourhood topology performs better than the other models, yielding a more diverse and more optimized set of solutions. Moreover, from the algorithmic point of view, the proposed algorithm, named CHAC, yields the best results on average.
