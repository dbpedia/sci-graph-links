Abstract This article presents a method to study the free vibration and stability of laminated homogeneous and non-homogeneous orthotropic cylindrical, truncated and complete conical shells of general staking with clamped edges under a hydrostatic pressure. Based on the Love first approximation theory, the basic relations, the modified Donnell-type stability and compatibility equations have been obtained for laminated orthotropic truncated conical shells, the material properties of which vary piecewise continuously in the thickness direction. To solve this problem an unknown parameter λ was included in the approximation functions. Applying Galerkin methods, the buckling pressures and fundamental natural frequencies of laminated homogeneous and non-homogeneous orthotropic conical shells are obtained. The parameter λ which is included in the obtained formulas is obtained from the minimum conditions of critical stresses and frequencies. The different generalized values are obtained for the parameter λ for buckling pressures and frequencies of cylindrical shells, truncated and complete conical shells. The appropriate formulas for single-layer and laminated cylindrical shells made of homogeneous and non-homogeneous, orthotropic and isotropic materials are found as a special case. Finally, the influences of the degree of non-homogeneity, the number and ordering of layers and the variations of conical shell characteristics on the critical hydrostatic pressure and natural frequencies are investigated. The results obtained for homogeneous cases are compared with their counterparts in the literature.
