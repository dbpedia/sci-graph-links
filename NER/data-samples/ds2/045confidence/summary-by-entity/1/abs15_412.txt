Abstract Marketing managers began adopting the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method of inventory control from the manufacturing industry almost thirty years ago. A new approach, “Just-In-Time” inventory, pioneered by Japanese firms, should be considered. This approach consists of at least two significant phases: one, technical, based on instantaneous communication flow and the computer; and secondly, behavioral, emphasizing improved cooperation between members of the channel system.
