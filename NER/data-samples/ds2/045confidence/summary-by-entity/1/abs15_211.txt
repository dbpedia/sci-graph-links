Conclusion A glimpse of the future of private sector unions may be gleaned from examining the past. Union densities have declined for nearly half a century, and structural and demographic changes, global competition, and various other factors have caused much of this decline. However, as recognized by early union leaders, legislative successes that diminish the role of collective bargaining naturally contribute to a diminished role for unions in the workplace and union decline must inevitably follow.
