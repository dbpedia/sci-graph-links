Abstract: The local persistence probability P l (t) that a site never becomes active up to time t, and the global persistence probability P g (t) that the deviation of the global density from its mean value does not change its sign up to time t are studied in a (1 1)-dimensional directed percolation process by Monte-Carlo simulations. At criticality, starting from random initial conditions, P l (t) decays algebraically with the exponent . The value is found to be independent of the initial density and the microscopic details of the dynamics, suggesting is an universal exponent. The global persistence exponent is found to be equal or larger than . This contrasts with previously known cases where . It is shown that in the special case of directed-bond percolation, P l (t) can be related to a certain return probability of a directed percolation process with an active source (wet wall).
