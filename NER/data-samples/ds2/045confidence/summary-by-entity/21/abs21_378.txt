Abstract This essay explores what is suggested by a statement of Carl Jung's: “Of all those who consulted me in the second half of their lives, no one was ever cured who did not attain a spiritual outlook on life,” Special emphasis is focused upon the psyche's upheaval at midlife and the transformation from an ego-centered personality to a more self-oriented way of being. Creative aspects of the midlife experience are discussed as they pertain to the individuation process.
