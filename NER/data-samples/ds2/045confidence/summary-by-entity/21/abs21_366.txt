Abstract Although today unjustly neglected abroad and often even in his native land, Edvard Immanuel Hjelt (1855–1921), was an exceptionally gifted, dedicated, and multifaceted individual who made important contributions to chemistry, the history of chemistry, politics, and the management of national and international affairs. Little information about him is available in English. The present article supplements the only two English sources available [1, pp 66–83; 2] and makes this chemist-statesman better known to those chemists and historians who do not read Swedish or Finnish.
