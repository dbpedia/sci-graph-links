Abstract With an increasing number of young people reaching university entrance age, the demographic reality of Latin American countries is changing the face of their traditional higher education spaces. The impact is driving institutions to seek effective solutions, and technology has been identified as a ‘way forward’ in terms of offering education to the growing population of young people who want it. Technology-mediated education must therefore help to improve Latin American citizens’ quality of life. In Mexico, and since 2010, the National System of Distance Education (SINED) — an initiative led by universities interested in strengthening education mediated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) — has been exploring ways to incorporate these tools into the evolution of Mexican and, by extension, Latin American universities. This monographic Dossier, produced in conjunction with RUSC. Universities and Knowledge Society Journal, is part of the SINED’s effort to progress towards generating information, documentation and materials to support the academic community involved in ICTs and innovation from a number of angles, including use, learning and research. In order to achieve the objectives set, it is important to support and disseminate effective initiatives in and consolidated experiences of using and applying technologies to university education contexts, and also to foster the emergence of spaces that are open to the agents of the educational community for disseminating and sharing their experiences of technologies in education.
