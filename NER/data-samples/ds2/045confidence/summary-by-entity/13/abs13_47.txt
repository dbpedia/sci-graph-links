Abstract The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and undergraduate Grade Point Average (GPA) are used as primary criteria for admission to medical schools across the country. Prospective students are often considered uncompetitive when they do not meet the minimum MCAT score required even when they have performed well in a post-baccalaureate or a master program. Touro University Nevada (TUN) College of Osteopathic Medicine offers a rigorous Master of Health Sciences (MHS) program where students both take the majority of fall semester courses and are assessed with the first year medical students. In order to determine the best admission criteria for MHS students into medical school, this study aims to determine whether there are correlations between the MHS cumulative GPA (cGPA), the MCAT score, the preclinical years’ cGPA, and the scores on the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examinations (COMLEX) of MHS students. The results indicate that there are strong correlations between these students’ MHS cGPAs and their preclinical years’ cGPAs and their COMLEX scores. Conversely, there are no significant correlations between their MCAT scores and their medical school performance indicators. Consequently, MHS cGPA appears to be a more reliable predictor of students’ performance in our medical school. It is plausible that the MCAT scores should be considered as a secondary criterion for admission of MHS students who perform especially well in the program. For these students, the MHS cGPA appears to be a better-suited primary criterion for admission to medical school.
