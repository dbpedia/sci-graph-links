Abstract A survey of the literature in medicine and in comparative education finds virtually no reports of systematic studies of professional education across national boundaries. This paper describes the use of the Priority Sort of Educational Objectives in Mental Health with samples of psychiatric and psychiatric nurse educators in the United States and South Korea. The data suggests a somewhat different pattern of cultural influences in professional education priorities between these disciplines in the two countries. The relative impact of the culture of a profession and of national culture are examined through the data generated on these populations of educators in two culturally dissimilar countries. Despite these differences of culture there has been a great impact of professional education from one country to the other. The resulting data suggest a stronger impact of professional culture with one profession, psychiatry, and a greater impact of national culture with the psychiatric nurse educators.
