Abstract Few educators would argue the relevance or impact of microcomputers on teaching and learning environments. Microcomputers offer the opportunity for profound constructive change. They set the occasion for a reassessment of all that is important in education. Nowhere is this more evident than in Faculties of Education. A necessary precondition, though, to needs assessment, in particular, or curriculum development, in general, is control. This article urges that control be established through probing educationally significant groups to realistically determine attainable needs and to design programs to accomplish those needs.
