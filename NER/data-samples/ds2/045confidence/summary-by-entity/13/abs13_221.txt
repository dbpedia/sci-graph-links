Abstract This study focused on efforts in four colleges of education deemed exemplary in their approaches to prepare preservice teachers to use technology. The study addressed one over-arching question: What are the important pieces of the puzzle that make up the current technology integration efforts at these exemplary sites? Data were gathered during the 1997–98 academic year. Findings suggest that there is a web of enabling factors that supports student learning opportunities and desired technology-related outcomes for preservice teachers. The informed leadership of deans and other administrative and faculty leaders appears to be especially critical to sustain and expand technology-integration efforts. Leadership issues, along with a wide range of other factors, are systematically examined across the four case studies. The authors conclude that while each of the four cases is unique, many of the recommended practices explored in this study would likely prove beneficial if employed in other settings.
