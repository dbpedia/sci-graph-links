Abstract Web 3D technologies have developed very rapidly over the past few years resulting in, for example, the standardisation of the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML97). Although such technologies have the infrastructure for considerable improvements of games products, they have not yet taken off as games development languages. Inspired by teaching a Virtual Reality module in the School of Computer Science at Birmingham, where typically 30ï¿½f the students choose to develop games in VRML for their practical work, the author describes some of the students' games projects and looks into the educational aspects, advantages, limitations and desired features of VRML for games development.
