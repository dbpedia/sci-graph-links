Abstract Progressive age-related declines in vision make everyday tasks more difficult for older adults. The consequences of age-related visual change are particularly evident in the presence of serious disorders of the eye such as cataract. Cataracts, a near-universal visual outcome of aging, increase the opacity and light scattering properties of the lens. These changes, in turn, impair acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color discrimination, especially under conditions of dim illumination or strong glare. Research shows that the performance, safety, mobility, comfort, and driving habits of older drivers are affected adversely by cataract-induced visual loss. Conversely, the striking improvements in sight with surgical replacement of the cataractous lens appear to enhance aging driversâ€™ performance and safety. The relative benefits of treating cataracts unilaterally versus bilaterally, however, have yet to be determined, as do the direct and mobility-mediated effects of cataract and cataract treatment on psychosocial variables that contribute to well-being and quality of life.
