Summary Retinal adaptations to a tide pool environment in ten species of fishes belonging to as many families were studied. These fishes may be grouped into typical or temporary tide pool inhabitants. The retinal structure of these forms may be grouped into three categories viz. 1. visually dependent (good acuity and sensitivity), 2. specialised for dim environments (high sensitivity at the cost of acuity), and 3. poor visual ability.
