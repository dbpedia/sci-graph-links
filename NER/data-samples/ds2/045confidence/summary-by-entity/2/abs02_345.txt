Abstract In this study, elastic scattering of the 9Be 27Al system has been re-analyzed by using phenomenological model (WS) and microscopic double-folding model (DF) potentials within the framework of the optical model at different incident energies. In the phenomenological and double-folding calculations, we have used the new parameters to explain the 9Be 27Al reaction. The real potentials in the double-folding calculations have been obtained by using the density distribution of the 9Be projectile and the 27Al target. The imaginary potentials have been taken as the Woods-Saxon volume. The imaginary radius rw and the imaginary diffusion parameter aw have been fixed to 1.1 fm and 1.85 fm, respectively. We compare the phenomenological model results with the doublefolding model ones as well as the experimental data. These comparisons provide information about the similarities and the differences in the models used in the calculations. The cross sections, the volume integrals and the Ï‡ 2/N values have been obtained for seven energies. Additionally we have shown a threshold anomaly for the 9Be 27Al system in the both calculations.
