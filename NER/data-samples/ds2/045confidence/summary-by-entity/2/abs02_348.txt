Summary The present paper sets forth a criterion for the evaluation of the formative time of the cathodic space charge, beginning with the moment at which the discharge becomes self-standing. Such a criterion is based on two facts to be observed in the study of intermittent discharges with a low-pressure gas: 1) it is possible to note a rise time of the oscillation pulse at the beginning of the first kind which is independent of the external circuit. 2) in these conditions a notable overtension exists at the start of the intermittent discharges in respect to the initial tension of Townsendâ€™s phase. From an evaluation of the pulse rise time and overtension value a calculation of the formative time of the cathodic space charge is possible. At the end, moreover, a general picture of the different kinds of intermittent discharges and conditions of their existence is drawn.
