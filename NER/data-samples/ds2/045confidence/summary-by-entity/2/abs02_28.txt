The equations of motion, including dissipation, for the dynamic magnetism of 3He-B following the complete turnoff of a small field are solved with the aim of demonstrating that two characteristic relaxation times may be distinguished. These are the rapid relaxation toward a rather long-lived mode (that turns out to involve an extremely simple motion), and the relaxation of this mode. The linear relaxation of the inverse frequency squared observed for the “wall-pinned mode” is rigorously justified, and corrections to the ideal case are discussed.
