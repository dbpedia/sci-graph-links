Abstract Biological applications of infrared spectroscopy have pressed for ever greater instrumental capabilities in terms of spectral sensitivity and quantitative exactness. Improved instrumentation has provided measurement of many vibrational modes in biological samples that previously were lost in noise. With highly optimized sampling conditions, useful measurements have been made with a peak-to-peak noise level less than 5 microabsorbance (5×10−6 absorbance), at 0.5 cm−1 resolution. However, optical and instrumental instabilities often result in sine waves that are not totally removed by the ratio of sample to reference. These often limit effective spectral sensitivity to 50 or 100 microabsorbance, peak-to-peak, and constitute a non-random noise. Non-atmospheric absorptions, especially one at 1959 cm−1 with 0.8 cm−1 band width (FWHM) are reported. The latter is due to a trace impurity in the KBr beam splitter substrate and compensator plate. Improvements in instrumentation and sampling conditions are expected to yield measurements of absorption bands as small as 50 microabsorbance with excellent signal/noise.
