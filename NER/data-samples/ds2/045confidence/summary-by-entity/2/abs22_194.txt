Abstract. In claims problems, we study coalitional manipulations via claims merging and splitting. We characterize (division) rules that are non-manipulable via (pairwise) splitting and that also satisfy standard axioms of equal treatment of equals, consistency, and continuity. And we obtain a similar result for non-manipulability via (pairwise) merging.
