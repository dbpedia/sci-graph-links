Abstract An optical sensor combined total analysis system (TAS) is thought to be one of the most powerful functional elements needed to realize a “ubiquitous human healthcare” system. In accordance with this concept, we have proposed a fundamental structure of detecting side scattered light from a minute cell or particle running along a microfluidic channel, partially utilizing the channel filled with water or saline solution as a light waveguide. Based on this concept, we have fabricated a trial-manufactured optical TAS chip and carefully evaluated its side scattered light measuring performance in in-plane direction, supplying and detecting visible laser power by using multiple optical fibers and their precise positioning mechanisms. We have successfully obtained experimental results of both transmitted light power change and that of side scattered light, and we confirmed that there was a strong relationship between their signal waveforms. Furthermore, we have developed a hybrid numerical calculation method on the basis of the finite-difference time-domain method, in addition to the beam propagation method. Based on this hybrid method, we tried to compare results between the experimental inverse pulse of transmitted light and a pulse of side scattered light, and those based on numerical calculations. Excellent qualitative accordance was obtained between the inverse pulse of numerical and experimental results. In contrast, the experimental pulse of side scattered light indicated a considerably spread base in comparison to the numerical results.
