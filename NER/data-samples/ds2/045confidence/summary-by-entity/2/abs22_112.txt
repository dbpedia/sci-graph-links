Abstract  The nature of a contradiction (conflict) between two belief functions is investigated. Alternative ways of distributing the contradiction among nonempty subsets of frame of discernment are studied. The paper employes a new approach to understanding contradictions and introduces an original notion of potential contradiction. A method of an associative combination of generalized belief functions – minC combination and its derivation – is presented as part of the new approach. A proportionalization of generalized results is suggested as well.
