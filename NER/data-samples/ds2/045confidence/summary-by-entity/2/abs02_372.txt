Abstract In [1] a method was proposed for investigating the mechanical stresses in solids by means of UHF electromagnetic waves; this method has recently been called the radiopolarization method (as distinct from the optical polarization method, in which waves in the optical range are used). An advantage of the new method is that it enables us to detect and investigate stresses in bodies which are opaque to visible light but permeable to ultra-high-frequency radio waves (porcelain, radioceramics, abrasives, ferrites, rubber, etc.). In addition it is comparatively easy to find the numerical values of the principal stresses by this method. Polarization methods reveal the stressed state of a solid as a collection of bands (lines equal in value to the difference between the principal stresses) or as isoclines from which isostats (lines of principal stress) are constructed. The first radiopolariscope described in [1] involved a great amount of work in plotting the bands (isochromes), and the accuracy of the results was not high.
