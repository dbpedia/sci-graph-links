Abstract As in the field of economics, the questions of business ethics can be divided into two distinguishable types â€” micro and macro. Micro-ethical questions arise primarily for subordinates in an organization and concern what should be done when the demands of conscience conflict with perceived occupational requirements. Macro-ethical questions arise principally for superiors and concern the setting of policy for the organization in general. The present article elaborates upon this distinction and advances a line argument for resolving micro-ethical problems when their affinity to macro-ethical issues is noted.
