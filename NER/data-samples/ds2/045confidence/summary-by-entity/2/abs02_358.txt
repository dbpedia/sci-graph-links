Abstract Thermodynamic modeling of the Pb-Bi-Hg ternary system was done with the help of the calculation phase diagram (CALPHAD) method. This work included a thermodynamic characterization of the three binary borders: the parameters relating to the Pb-Bi system were taken from the literature, whereas those of Pb-Hg and Bi-Hg systems were determined during this study, and were primarily based on particular calorimetric measurements. Some differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data for the ternary system allowed us to verify the existence of a ternary compound with a composition close to Pb0.45Bi0.35Hg0.2 and the presence of two peritectic invariants. With these results, it was possible to carry out the assessment of the ternary interaction parameter of the liquid phase.
