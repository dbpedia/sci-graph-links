Summary The objectives, appropriate strategies, the state of conservation in South Africa, and the contributed research which is needed, are evaluated. It is suggested that the ultimate objectives of conservation are to maintain the ecosystem to support people and to achieve economic advantages. These can only be obtained by providing for the greatest possible diversity of life on Earth. An appropriate conservation strategy can be based on a balanced combination of five types of conservation opportunities. These opportunities are: (i) formal conservation in reserves, (ii) promotion of land use change for conservation, (iii) law enforcement, (iv) national resource utilisation planning, and (v) the development of a national land ethic. Adjustment of the opportunity combination to address changing threast must be an ongoing exercise. Conservation strategies need to be based on sound conceptual models of ecosystem structure and function, as well as human needs and aspirations. The main goals of the conservation ecologist are the development, testing and validation of conceptual models of ecosystems.
