Abstract. Several case studies of microanalysis of objects of cultural heritage are reviewed. These objects, including paintings, metal artefacts, paper and archaeological glass, present a variety of research questions. In all cases, their analysis was complex due to the different problems raised by each material and the interpretation of the results.
