Abstract The noise status of growing urban centres of the country arevery much required to develop acoustic design and planningguidelines for various land use classification. An attempt inthis direction has been made by measuring noise equivalentlevels for cities like Delhi, Jamshedpur, Dehradun and Nagpur.The choice of Ldn (Dayâ€“Night noise level) which is a betterdescriptor of noise quality provides an interesting status ofnoise in these urban centres. It has been observed that maximumpercentage of areas in Delhi and Jamshedpur fall undermoderately severe to very severe noisy conditions as compared toDehradun and Nagpur on the noise rating scale. Ways and meansare also considered for mitigation of noise.
