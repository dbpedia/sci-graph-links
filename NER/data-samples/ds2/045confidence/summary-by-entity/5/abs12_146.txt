Abstract Temperature controllers are typical devices in most office-buildings, but the intended users very seldom use them. It has been a constant observation during our research that all common temperature controllers to date are quite impossible to use and understand correctly. With the proper use of temperature controllers comfort could be improved and a lot of energy could be saved. This paper presents a model of first use of an OOBE device, in which the actor’s beliefs are included. A list of conditions for energy saving actions, a design decision matrix and a model of action circle is presented in this article. The model indicates that the user’s action can be extinguished at various points during the action circle. However, sufficient and understandable initial feedback on the device’s interface is the key to correct novel use.
