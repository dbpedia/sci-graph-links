Abstract The accessibility-oriented transport planning method is critical for many high population density cities in China. Most definitions of accessibility only consider spatial separation and ignore the influence of traveler choice on accessibility. In this paper, the combined travel demand model is employed in transport planning. The travelers’ choice behavior of the model is based on the random utility theory. The model overcomes inconsistence problem of the sequential four-step model on travel behavior and congestion effects. Based on the same random utility theory, an accessibility measure is proposed, which can be integrated into the combined travel demand model. The accessibility measure can reflect the traveler’s choices at different stages (travel choice, destination choice, mode choice and route choice). The properties of the accessibility measure are discussed through a numerical example.
