Abstract This study examines in detail an extinct building tradition in the territory of central and southern Moravia, where the earthen constructions of the Moravian-Pannonian house type were widespread in the lowlands. The greatest attention has been paid to a specific building technology which utilizes cobs, namely mud-lumps called v√°lky. These represent a unique construction solution that goes beyond the central European context of earthen building. Different variations of this building technique were used in the studied area for the construction of barns, some houses, detached storage buildings and fences.
