Abstract The paper considers the relocated city phenomenon—a new and unusual subject of urban studies research. By relocated city is meant one that in the course of its history has changed location at least once. Two main groups of reasons have been revealed for the change in a city’s location: catastrophes and state administrative decisions. At different historical stages, the reason for the migration of cities changed. In the 20th century, the transfer of hundreds of villages and tens of cities in Russia is mainly related to the creation of large flatland reservoirs. Relocated cities possess significant resources of geographic imagination, which can be used for their stable development.
