Abstract Electric shock administered to the painted turtle Chrysemys outside the drinking situation failed in any general way to affect water intake in differentially hydrated Ss; nor did such treatment disturb the rather precise aquastatic mechenism demonstrated by this species. Deprived turtles did, however, tend to consume more water than controls when some degree of familiarity with the drinking surround had been obtained. Although shock administered within the water-available situation likewise failed to produce a general drinking deficit, initial intake by nondeprived Ss was reduced, and the first indication of a disturbance in the water-regulatory mechanism was observed.
