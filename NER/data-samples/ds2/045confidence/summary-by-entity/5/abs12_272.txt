Abstract A fully differential architecture has numerous advantages in a switched-capacitor delta-sigma modulator such as immunization to clock-induced noise, supply rejection, simple sign conversion of integrator gain and doubled output dynamic range. Efficient use of the fully differential architecture nevertheless requires a completely symmetrical layout and routing, which may contradict with the requirements of component matching. Some design choices have to be made at this point, depending on what requirements can be compromised. This paper discusses the importance of certain layout features which may serve as a guide in making these design choices.
