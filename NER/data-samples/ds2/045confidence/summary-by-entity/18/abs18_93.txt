Abstract BackgroundThe attitudes and practise of doctors concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide have been the subject of studies performed in many countries. However, these issues have not been studied properly in Portugal. Materials and methodThis study is a survey of 450 Portuguese oncologists by postal means and personal contact. ResultsThe response rate was 33�143). Only 13�ould practise euthanasia with the present law in force forbidding such practise, and 24�ould do so if it were legalised; 39�avoured its legalisation and 36�ould like to have the option of euthanasia if they had a terminal disease. About assisted suicide, 15�ould do it with the current law in force forbidding such action and 25�ould do so if it were made legal; 32�avoured its legalisation and 24�ould like to have that option if they had a terminal disease. There was one case of euthanasia and no cases of assisted suicide. The most important factor related with the acceptance of euthanasia and assisted suicide was religion, with non-practising Catholics accepting such practises more often than practising Catholics. The Portuguese oncologists have a very positive view on the potential role of palliative care in preventing many requests for euthanasia and assisted suicide. ConclusionPortuguese oncologists are mainly against the practise of euthanasia and assisted suicide and the number of requests is also relatively low; consequently, the number of episodes of assisted death is also apparently very low.
