Abstract This article aims at presenting the main issues resulting from self-defense protocols implemented to defeat any launched network attack. The authors, namely a network security expert and an examining magistrate, built a universal model and submitted it to a variety of typical cases in order to anticipate the main consequences of usual self-defense reactions. The above-mentioned cases range from the most stupid attack to the most sophisticated one. Consequences are expected to occur on both technical and judicial levels. The possibility that a battle may be won on a technical level could have disastrous effects on a judicial level.What we usually call “self-defense” applies both to blind attacks and targeted assaults (which may use viral codes). Judicial issues will be set forth according to a general scheme which is common to main criminal law systems (mainly French and American ones).
