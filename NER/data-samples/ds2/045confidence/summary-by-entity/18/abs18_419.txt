(a)If a right holder notifies the operator of an online marketplace of an infringement of his rights by a sales offer placed on that marketplace, the operator as tortfeasor has the obligation on penalty of injunctive claim to prevent such infringements in future [citations omitted].(b)This presupposes that the notification is concrete enough that its addressee can easily detect the infringement—that is, without an intensive legal and factual examination. The extent of the examination the operator can be expected to make in this respect depends upon the circumstances of the individual case, especially upon the gravity of the reported infringements, on the one hand, and upon the opportunities the operator has to detect it, on the other hand.(c)The complainant is only required to furnish proof of the infringement if this is justified by legitimate interests of the operator of the online marketplace. This can be the case if there is legitimate reason under the circumstances for the operator to doubt that a proprietary right exists, that the notifying party is authorised to assert this right or that the reported facts of an infringement are true, and therefore would have to conduct his own, thorough investigation in order to be sufficiently sure an infringement has taken place. If the operator of the online marketplace has such legitimate doubts, he is as a rule obliged to communicate them to the notifying party and to request appropriate evidence of the infringement and of the notifying party’s authority to prosecute it.(d)An obligation regarding an operator’s conduct, which if violated, could constitute grounds for a risk of repetition only arises once the operator has learned of the infringement. Thus, the infringing conduct that is the object of a warning or other notice in which the operator of an online marketplace first learned of an infringement cannot be seen as infringing conduct that constitutes grounds for a risk of repetition in the sense of an injunctive claim. Rather, the assumption of risk of repetition requires that an infringement is performed after the obligation to prevent further such infringements has been established [citation omitted].
