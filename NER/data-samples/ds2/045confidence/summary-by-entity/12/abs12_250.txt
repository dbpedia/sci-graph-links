Abstract The building sector has a huge impact on the environment; it consumes 30–40 �f global natural resources and 40 �f energy. The impacts of the building sector can be reduced drastically by implementing a net-zero approach in both design and sustainability management of buildings. Net-zero building is a building system that uses sustainable materials and produces its needed energy and water throughout its life cycle. Unlike green buildings, there is a limited number of sustainability rating systems for net-zero buildings (e.g., Living Building Challenge). Despite the importance of geographical characteristics and local environmental conditions, spatial consideration in green and net-zero buildings is largely lacking in the literature. Considering the variability of environmental behavior around the globe and its significant effects on energy, water demands, and availability of construction materials, it is a major shortcoming to ignore the role of geography in net-zero buildings. This paper discusses a new methodology in the assessment of net-zero buildings by integrating regional characteristics and life cycle sustainability assessment. The methodology outlined in this paper can assist in sustainability design and decision making of net-zero buildings.
