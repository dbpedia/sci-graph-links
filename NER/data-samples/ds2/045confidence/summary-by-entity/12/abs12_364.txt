Abstract In this paper, we introduce the p-adic Moufang condition for hyperbolic buildings of rank 3. It is the most obvious and simplest generalization of the p-adic Moufang condition for affine buildings, introduced in Part III of this sequence of papers. We show that p is very restricted, which confirms (but does not prove) the conjecture that no p-adic analogue is possible for the construction of Moufang (hyperbolic) buildings by Ronan and Tits.
