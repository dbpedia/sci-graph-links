Abstract Lead concentrations of atmospheric particulate matter were measured systematically by X-ray fluorescence method at three sites of Debrecen city over long periods. The time dependence of Pb concentration level in air was investigated and compared with literature data. High variation was found in lead concentration values with respect to place and time.
