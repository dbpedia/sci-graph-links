Conclusions The following main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis:(a)The ordinary neo-classical equilibrium growth model considering only process innovations is inconsistent, if it is accepted that there exists satiation for existing goods. In such a model there is a continuous lack of demand so that the neo-classical “equilibrium” cannot persist.(b)A growing market economy can stay in equilibrium only if there is a balance between technical change used to create new products and applied to processes.(c)The natural growth rate of the economy is no longer exogeneous as in the orthodox neo-classical model, but depends on the interaction with the rest of the economy.(d)There are two structural changes going withequilibrium growth, namely (i) a constant rise of the proportion of income to employment and (ii) a secular fall in the share of old products in favour of new products in total output.(e)Phases of inflation and price stability are (partly) due to imbalances in the introduction of product and process innovations.(f)Allowing for advertising, the preference function of consumers becomes an endogeneous part of a growing economy; it changes continuously to adjust to evolving technical conditions in the society, and at the same time it influences other parts of the economy.
