Summary This paper examines the cyclical relationship between exports and output in the U.K. using structural time-series modelling. The time series on exports and output over the period 1885â€“1993 are decomposed, and the cyclical components are extracted. Causality testing as applied to the cyclical components reveals the absence of causality from exports to output except in the post-1945 period. The results of causality testing are confirmed by the results of estimating a structural time-series model in which exports appear as an explanatory state variable. Three different explanations are suggested for the change in this relationship during the most recent period.
