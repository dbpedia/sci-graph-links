Bed settlements of buildings and structures during their construction, or at the moment of completion of its individual stages should not be considered in computing ultimate settlements in design, if they do not affect the operational utility and service life of the buildings. 2. In designing buildings and structures on fills, including those placed during contruction, embankment settlements that occur prior to the start of foundation installation should not be considered in computing the ultimate settlements of the buildings. 3. For large fill areas, the compression of saturated clayey soils with time under pressures not exceeding those computed in accordance with SNiP II-15-74 can be determined by methods of the theory of one-dimensional soil consolidation.\n" .
