A phased development model or paradigm used to address teachersâ€™ professional development and stages of effectiveness have been noted. Conceptual models of Field Experience have been developed in accordance to the paradigms addressed the professional development of teacher effectiveness, basing on no matter external forces or internal reflective capability that will change a teacher. Simply put, a focus is placed upon teachers to change and grow. Field experience is not equivalent to student placement or teaching supervision, but is a device for teacher change at various professional stages. This implies the need for a re-thinking of teacher education preparation.\n" .
