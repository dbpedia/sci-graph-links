Representatives from 34 randomly selected restaurants participated in both the pre- and post-interviews. Although 26.5 percent of the respondents were concerned that the ordinance would be difficult to enforce, 94 percent found the ordinance easy or very easy to enforce. While some customers appeared to have negative reactions to an ordinance that prohibited smoking, four times that many appeared to have positive reactions to the ordinance. Although approximately 12 percent of the respondents indicated that the ordinance had “a slightly negative effect on employees,” the majority (88.2%) felt that the ordinance had either no effect or a positive effect on employees. Most respondents believed that the ordinance would have no effect on their business and most reported that the ordinance had no or no known effect on business. Although many restaurant representatives had concerns about a non-smoking ordinance prior to its enactment, restaurant representatives' self-reported experience with the ordinance suggests that most of these concerns were not realized.\n" .
