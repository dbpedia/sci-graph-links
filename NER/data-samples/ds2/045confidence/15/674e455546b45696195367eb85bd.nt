        nif:isString    "Abstract Members of three established teams in different organizations participated in problem-solving sessions using a structured consensus model. Participants perceived a significant increase in communication openness during these sessions as compared to their previous problem-solving sessions. The increase in communication openness suggests an improved openness to the flow of information among team members. The results of this study provide early indicators of successful applications for this consensus model, including improving the participation of team members during strategic planning and enhancing the upward flow of information to senior decision-makers for purposes of organizational change and development.\n" .
