Gray's Natural Arrangement of British Plants (2 vols., November 1821) was for many years deliberately and unjustly neglected by British botanists on account of its idiosyncrasies, anti-Linnaean character, unorthodox nomenclature, narrow generic concepts and contemporary hostility to the supposed authorR. A. Salisbury, but is nevertheless nomenclaturally important, particularly for cryptogamic groups. This paper surveys its history, authorship, date of publication and nomenclature." .

The subject countries cover a broad cross-section of ethnic, economic, and political differences. The authors report data and discuss such issues as the demographic characteristics of women (i. e., age distribution, marital status, and fertility rates), level of education, work force participation, political activity, military service, and access to health care. Social class and ethnic and racial differences among the women in each of the societies are also considered. They offer a short historical review of the major legislative and social changes that have occurred in the status of women in many of the subject societies during the past 50 years. The authors describe the degree of relative social freedom that women enjoy in the different societies and how their statuses differ from those of men." .

His passions were medicine and violin making. Most of his life was spent in Sušak (now a part of Rijeka, Croatia), where he worked, played music and studied the art of making stringed instruments. He visited Cremona on several occasions and studied a number of violins, drawings and tools made and used by old masters. For his profound knowledge of Cremonese violin making the Italians dubbed him \"Uomo che legge violini\" (The Man Who Can Read Violins). In his workshop he made fifty-two violins, two violas, two cellos and a string quartet. Some of these instruments are still played in Europe and America. The remaining violins and possessions (tools, manuscripts, drawings, literature and countless diplomas and certificates) have been kept in a memorial room at the Maritime and History Museum of the Croatian Littoral in Rijeka. In addition, a street near the Faculty of Medicine in Rijeka is named after Franjo Kresnik." .

The result together with the materials collected from the literature suggested that there seemed to be definite difference in the anatomical distribution. A relatively high incidence of carcinoma of the rectum and concomitant low incidence of carcinoma of the sigmoid and descending colons in Japan was found to be the major difference when compared with the data published in the American literature. Some difference was also noted in a relatively high incidence of polypoid-type carcinoma and in a relatively low incidence of annular-type carcinoma among Japanese materials in contrast to those of American materials. The reason for these difference is not clearly understood at present and further collection of materials and pertinent data are necessary." .

In fact, back in the early 1950s in the United States, three young mediators with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) drafted a 62-page memo on the subject of their work which included 120 different techniques of mediation, many of which would be familiar and useful to practitioners today. Their pioneering work, however, was neither recognized nor encouraged by the FMCS; in fact, it was suppressed. This article focuses on the reasons for the suppression of that work, providing an overview of the vast changes that have taken place in mediation's history and the federal labor-management mediation agency over the past half-century." .

With various arguments, strong supporters, fierce opponents and moderates in the middle stand out as three major camps. Some look at the WTO case from their own, often narrow, perspectives; but all tend to link China trade to other, often broader, issues. People from various camps simply disagree on the means to achieve a common objective: a prosperous and democratic China that will not threaten America’s national interests. The American debate on China’s WTO accession has as much to do with domestic politics as it does international trade. The WTO controversy is part of the greater debate on America’s China policy in the post-Cold War era. The WTO debate suggests that a better understanding of the complex nature of the relationship is necessary for managing U.S.-China relations in the future." .

The administrative process involved three levels (community, regional office, land office). The damage reports and taxation records for South Moravia (the southeastern parts of today’s Czech Republic) were mainly stored in the Moravian Land Archives at Brno in estate accounts and collections of family archives. Data related to the date of a given hailstorm, its accompanying convective phenomena, the communities affected and the type of damage, as interpreted from taxation records, has created a database spanning the years 1650 to 1941 AD. A total of 766 records contain descriptions that cover 433 days upon which hailstorms did damage in South Moravia, as well as incidentally provide some additional information for the remainder of the Czech Lands and other parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The hailstorms detected concentrate to a large extent around the 1821–1850 period, which accounts for 44.4 % of all events. Although reported most frequently without other convective phenomena, they were often accompanied by torrential rain. The current contribution analyses the four most outstanding hailstorms in detail, those characterised by the highest number of estates and communities affected: 26 May 1830, 18 July 1832, 25 June 1844 and 20 June 1848. Uncertainties in hailstorm data, particularly with regard to their spatial and temporal heterogeneity, are discussed. Finally, the 1811–1850 period, with the highest number of hailstorm days, is compared with hailstorm patterns that derive from systematic meteorological observations in the 1961–2000 reference period. Damaging hailstorms disclosed by taxation data will be used to compile long-term hailstorm series for South Moravia (together with those derived from other documentary evidence and systematic meteorological observations)." .

The project will formulate conclusions about the environmental consequences of different hydraulic engineering projects as China pursued different developmental paradigms. The state pursued Soviet-style central planning for much of the 1950s, Great Leap Forward decentralization and communalization between 1958 and 1961, a blend of state planning and mass mobilization during the 1960s and 1970s, and “market socialism” during the post-Mao era (1978–). The project will be organized around these four eras and it will examine the implications that each of these developmental approaches had on North China’s water resources. Comparative conclusions about the environmental consequences of these four developmental periods will be guided by several fundamental options that faced state and party leaders throughout the post-1949 period: (1) modern hydraulic engineering vs. traditional water conservancy and mass mobilization, (2) central vs. local planning, (3) international technical cooperation vs. self-reliance, and (4) economic development vs. environmental protection. The results of this study will suggest the potential environmental consequences of water policy choices that are made in China. Whether the issue is centralization versus decentralization, reliance on contemporary standards of hydraulic engineering versus traditional mass mobilization, or self-reliance versus international cooperation, an examination of the experience of water management in China since 1949 will point to the environmental consequences of hydraulic engineering choices." .

Under the experimental conditions (25 C and 26‰ S) the worm has an average generation time (22 days) and average life span (45 days) similar to other chromadorids which have been studied in the laboratory. Tracer-feeding experiment with 32P-labelled bacteria, diatoms and chlorophytes indicate selectivity by the worm in both the ingestion and apparent digestion of potential food organisms, with the diatoms and chlorophytes being the preferred foods. Out of a total of 20 species of algae and 14 species of bacteria, two species of diatoms (Nitzschia acicularis and Cylindrotheca closterium) were found which are capable of sustaining indefinite growth. Bacteria-free culture has not been established, however, due to the extreme sensitivity of the worm to antibioties. A comparison of the feeding habits of C. macrolaimoides with Rhabditis marina, another marine nematode fed the same potential food organisms is made, and the influence of selective feeding on the spatial and temporal distribution of marine nematodes is discussed." .

Despite its distinctive clinicopathological characteristics, the existence of TAO as an entity sui generis was challenged for many years as it languished in relative obscurity. Then, as societal attitudes towards smoking changed, TAO not only became accepted as a disease entity, it quite literally became a poster child to illustrate the ills of smoking. Herein, we examine the history of TAO to illustrate the power of societal attitudes and politics in shaping medicine." .

Documentary data are used in two ways. First, maps of relative annual rainfall levels are presented for each of the 12 single-year and five protracted ENSO episodes during the period, in order to identify the associated inter-annual rainfall variations. These suggest that the relationship between ENSO episodes and rainfall variability identified for the twentieth century, whereby warm events are frequently preceded by wetter conditions during the austral summer prior to the event year and succeeded by drought in the following summer, has broadly held for much of the last 160 years. This is despite the long-term fluctuations in precipitation and temperature which are known to have occurred over this period. Droughts are identified following at least thirteen of the 17 single-year and protracted ENSO episodes. Pre-ENSO wetter periods are less common, with only nine of the ENSO episodes preceded by above-normal rainfall. Second, the documentary data are analyzed in detail in order to reveal any evidence for high resolution intra-annual variations in the seasonal distribution of rainfall during ENSO events. Seasonal sequences of rainfall/drought appear to have closely followed contemporary patterns, with heavy rainfall commonly occurring late in the pre-ENSO year or early in the ENSO year(s), and drought at the start of the post-ENSO year. This relationship can be seen to hold most strongly for single-year ENSO warm events and for the first year of protracted events, but rainfall conditions were more variable during the later years of protracted events." .

The etiology of IBD is still under investigation. We performed an epidemiological study to clarify the characteristics of IBD in Japan, focusing on patients’ family history. MethodsWe obtained clinical data on ulcerative colitis (UC) (46,114 cases) and Crohn’s disease (CD) (11,305 cases) in 2007 from an electronic database maintained under the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s nationwide registry system, and analyzed the differences in disease characteristics between patients with IBD who had a family history of the disease and those who did not. ResultsA total of 2.7% of the patients with UC and 2.6% of those with CD had a family history. The present age and age at disease onset were lower among the patients with UC who had a family history than among those without (present age: p < 0.001; age at disease onset: p < 0.001; Mann–Whitney U-test), but no similar trend was observed in the patients with CD. Disease severity was worse among both the UC and CD patients with a family history. The clinical course of patients with UC was not affected by family history. Levels of independence in daily life were associated with family history among CD patients, whereas age was associated with levels of independence in daily life among UC patients. ConclusionDisease characteristics of IBD vary in some aspects according to the presence or absence of a family history." .

Material assemblages from the Ottoman period illustrate the global connections that entangled the eastern Mediterranean with Western European capitalism after the 16th century. Other categories of material culture illustrate such global interactions: the accounts of travelers to the Holy Land in the form of books, paintings, and photographs. These accounts have been understood as part of the Western domination of the Middle East. Orientalist paintings as artifacts of Ottoman Palestine are the focus here, complex interventions in the assumptions about the Holy Land that can be appropriated for archaeological understandings of Palestine’s past. The paintings of landscape artist David Roberts (1796–1864) are used as an example. He traveled through Palestine in the late 1830s and created an unparalleled collection of images." .

O’Neill’s drunken and enigmatic sailor has no corresponding character in Aeschylus’ Oresteia, nor in its subsequent classical iterations. As I show, the Chantyman is explicitly crafted after the mythological Charon, imported from Book 6 of Virgil’s Aeneid. Moreover, the use of this epic archetype serves to promote O’Neill’s mechanism of predetermined causality, both by means of its thematic implications and structural position within the narrative of Aeneid 6. The allusion recalls the Virgilian unveiling of Aeneas’ familial destiny and thereby underscores the broader and inevitable consequences of Brant’s death upon the House of Mannon. Ultimately, this intertextual strategy augments O’Neill’s self-professed project in this play: to recreate on the modern stage a tragic world order governed by fate, in the conspicuous absence of a divine apparatus." .

The X and Y are totally unpaired at late zygotene when most of the autosomes are synapsed; however, their attachment points at the presumptive SC end are closely apposed. The X and Y axes pair to form a length of SC that is somewhat shorter than the unpaired portion of the Y. Unpaired axes may appear thin and sometimes double, or may thicken to form fusiform bulges that are sometimes hollow: two on the X and one on the Y. Discrete differentiations, tentatively identified as kinetochores, are often visible at the proximal end of the SC on the Y axis, and also between the fusiform differentiations on the X axis. Additional differentiations, in the form of loops and densely staining granular excrescences form on the X axis and sometimes on the Y. A further differentiation appears as a cloud-like sheath around the distal end of the X axis, often in association with a bi-lobed dense body. At late pachytene, the XY-SC remains intact, but the unpaired X and Y axes develop side branches. Just before diplotene, while the autosomal SCs are still intact, the XY-SC is lost, although the axes persist and remain together at the attachment point of the SC. The X and Y differentiations form a logical temporal sequence when grouped according to progressive structural complexity.

Greenough, an American living in Paris, persuaded the firm of Carl Zeiss to construct the first low-power stereomicroscope. Fitted by Zeiss with Porro prisms for image erection, this instrument became the ancestor of all stereoscopic dissection microscopes (“binoculars”) now in use. On the basis of original documents and earlier publications, the present Centennial Essay traces both the history of the Greenough stereomicroscope and the scantily documented life of its inventor, including his probable descent from a family of famous New England sculptors. The aim is to provide some historical background for a truly timeless instrument that was fundamental to developmental biology, beginning almost from the days of its proclamation by Wilhelm Roux." .

Drawing upon Baudrillard’s concept of simulation, it discusses the extent to which Chongqing’s Red culture campaign can be characterized as the simulation of a traditional Maoist mass campaign. This paper argues that instead of being a real mass campaign, the Red culture program exhibited the following critical features of simulation—the procession of a model of the real, the liquidation of referentials, and the constitution of a self-induced and monolithic circuit of power. Firstly, the operation of Chongqing’s Red culture campaign followed an established model of the ideal revolutionary mass campaign. The activities therefore did not follow their own trajectories but were organized to fit in the preexisting model. Secondly, the Red culture campaign was a process during which signs were emptied of their representational meaning. The definition of Red was expanded to include all songs that were considered “healthy” and “positive.” As a result, it stopped referring to any specific concept of political ideology. Thirdly, Chongqing’s Red culture program demonstrated characteristics of a self-induced and nondialectical power circuit. The program did not exchange meaning with the audience of the program. Rather, the exchange of signs took place within the territory of an imagined singular political power. To think of the Red culture campaign not as a mass campaign but possibly the simulation of a mass campaign, this paper examines a distinctive set of power relations that were embedded in Chongqing’s controversial political program and aims to facilitate a better understanding of the organization of political power in the current Chinese society." .

This paper analyses the earliest archived instrumental meteorological records collected in West Cornwall (SW England). Observations were obtained from the Met Office archive (Camborne 1957–2010; Culdrose 1985–2011), Trengwainton Garden (1940–2010), and from the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, (data for Falmouth (1880–1952) and Helston (1843–1888)). Homogeneity tests were used (Levene and Brown-Forsythe tests) to exclude any trends not related to climate variability. The data exhibit trends in annual mean and maximum temperatures over the timescales analysed, and show a general temperature increase in the 20th and 21st century. Annual and seasonal temperature change was found to vary locally with strongly positive trends in autumn, spring and summer seasons. Trends in precipitation are positive only for the 19th century and only for one station. Correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index gives negative results for precipitation data. However correlation with the NAO index is positive with temperature, especially in the winter season. Return period analysis shows a decrease in intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events in the post-1975 period (Camborne and Trengwainton Garden stations). Climate change in the 20th century and future continued warming is likely to have major implications on biodiversity in this region." .

In 1799 the magistrate of the town of Maribor issued a memorandum regarding the establishment of a town hospital in the renovated building of the town hospice, providing space for 24 patients. The work of the hospital was carried out in the former hospice building until 1855. In the period between its establishment and eventual relocation 26 beds were added. The last two decades of the hospital's operation at the original location were marked by the assiduous work of the town's physicist, Dr. Anton Kuker. In the first half of the 19th century, the population of Maribor grew rapidly as a consequence of the construction of the Southern Railway. The town authorities therefore purchased the Prosenjak family villa in the Magdalena suburbs and relocated the hospital to it in 1855, providing 28 rooms for 110 patients. For a whole century, the care of patients was taken over by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. The hospital was soon admitting over 1000 patients a year, the most common complaints being pulmonary catarrh, gastritis and fever. In 1872, when the Master of Surgery Feliks Ferk joined the hospital, the internal \"medical\" and the \"external\" surgical departments were formed. Although medical studies were not easily accessible, there were a number of Slovene physicians working in the hospital and the town in that period. In the last decades of the 19th century, the hospital was often renovated and enlarged. The infrastructure (telephone, water supply system, heating, lighting) had also been modernized before World War I. In 1914, the first X-ray apparatus was purchased. Between the wars, the hospital's development was boosted by recruitment of the Slovene physicians Ivan Matko, Mirko Černič, Janko Dernovšek and Hugon Robič. The initial external and medical departments split into several departments: internal medicine, surgery, dermatovenereology, gynecology and obstetrics, infectious diseases, X-ray institute, autopsy department, and pulmonary department. A department of otology and ophthalmology was also founded. After the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Maribor Hospital was no longer overshadowed by the formerly dominant regional hospital in Graz in present-day Austria. A greater number of patients entailed more rapid professional development. At the beginning of World War II, the hospital comprised six departments, two institutes and a dispensary, and had an elaborate administrative structure with numerous support services." .

We have determined the concentrations of lead in 41 well-preserved ancient and 11 contemporary rib bones of a mature age (40–60 y), with a view to historically evaluating lead exposure in humans. The oldest Japanese bones (1000–300b.c.) were found to contain a mean of 0.58 μg Pb/g dry wt and a mean molar ratio of lead to calcium of 0.6×10−6, compared with 4.7–5.2×10−6 in the bones of the Edo era (1600–1867a.d.) and contemporary residents in Japan. The mean molar ratios of female bones were always higher than those of male bones for each era. From this fact we may assume that facial cosmetics were one of the main routes of lead exposure among the ancient Japanese, especially those who lived during the Edo era." .

Regrettably, Western interest is still extremely narrow and restricted to statistical economic data and the belief that social change in China and modernisation is driven exclusively by the forces of globalisation, that is, economic forces, is widespread and little attention is given outside of specialist circles to the new robust intellectual and artistic-creative energies underlying China’s transformation and self-invention since 1978, identified by Deng Xiaoping as absolutely essential for China’s modernisation program. Bootleg Faust (Daoban Fushide, written by Shen Lin of the Central Academy of Drama, 1999), the ambitious staging of the translation-adaptation-deconstruction of the German classic by Meng Jinghui, China’s leading experimental theatre director on January 1, 2000 to welcome the New Millennium (and to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Goethe’s birth) is a remarkable artistic achievement. The very fact that Goethe’s Faust One and Two, completed in 1832, and rarely performed in its totality in German-speaking countries, can be staged in Chinese adaptation for weeks, and to full houses in Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese provincial centres and overseas is proof that the Luhanite vision of a global village is no longer virtual, but real, just as real as Meng Jinghui and Shen Lin’s theatrical professionalism and genius to give Goethe’s signature work relevance in twenty-first century China. Some of the salient aspects of this theatrical achievement and the socio-cultural significance of Meng and Shen’s irreverent artistic endeavour of deconstructing Goethe’s Faust will be explored in this paper." .

Its emergence as an economic leader coincides with the demise of the cold war. Taken together, these trends alter the basis of the long-standing U.S.-Japan relationship. While the security partnership is likely to continue as a force for regional stability in the post-cold war environment, it is simply natural that a prosperous, self-confident Japan will begin to assert an independent voice in international affairs. In this study the author examines Japan’s recent debate over its policy in the Persian Gulf crisis. Particular attention is given to five competing schools of thought that shaped the national debate among Japanese opinion leaders. Although Japan’s response to the Gulf crisis was marked by a series of false starts and confusion, it is likely that a new foreign policy paradigm will eventually emerge from the ongoing debate among the contending schools of thought identified by the author." .

Nowadays septic arthritis and reactive arthritis (usually classified as Reiter's syndrome) are distinguished. To place current knowledge within its historical context we reviewed the medical literature on sexually acquired arthritis in the nineteenth century and examined the medical records of London teaching hospitals from this period. We used original sources of rheumatological literature at major London libraries, including the Heberden library of the Royal College of Physicians, and visited the archives at three London teaching hospitals to review original case records and examine diagnostic registers. The first clear description of arthritis associated with venereal disease was given by Swediaur (1798/1809) in French. It became relatively common in London from 1820 onwards with 13 cases described in the literature between 1818 and 1836. It accounts for 3% of admissions at University College and St Bartholomew's Hospitals between 1835 and 1839 and also 3% of admissions at the London Hospital from 1895 to 1900. In the 50 years after Swediaur's report, arthritis associated with venereal disease seemed quite common. This may have been related to the industrial revolution or other social diseases. Historical observations suggest its evidence may vary considerably with time." .

The average daily ratio G/G clear of available global irradiance to its local climatic clear-sky value in the summer half-year corresponds to 65.5%, while that of the direct irradiance on the horizontal surface I′/I′ clear was 41% of the climatic clear-sky value. In the case of dry Rayleigh atmosphere as a reference, these ratios are 53.5% and 28%, respectively. The time series of the summer season totals reveal a longer interval of reduced values in 1976–1993 as well as two periods of frequent sunny summers in 1967–1975 and since 1994. The probability density distribution of the summer season totals during the observed period is strongly asymmetric; in spring, however, it is close to the normal distribution.

Start-up of steady-shear at rates from 0.1 to 10 s−1 was carried out using a controlled strain rotational rheometer and a sliding plate rheometer for strain histories involving one or several shear rates. The shear stress and first normal shear stress difference were measured as functions of time, and the morphologies of the samples before and after shearing were determined. For each strain history except that involving a single shear rate of 0.1 s−1 the blends showed typical non-linear viscoelastic behavior: a shear stress overshoot/undershoot, depending on the history, followed by a steady state for each step. The first normal stress difference increased monotonically to a steady-state value. The values of the stresses increased with the addition of SEBS. The shear stress overshoot and undershoot and the times at which they occurred depended strongly on the strain history, decreasing for a subsequent shear rate step performed in the same direction as the former, and the time at which stress undershoot occurred increased for a subsequent shear rate step performed in the opposite direction, irrespective of the magnitude of the shear rate. This behavior was observed for all the blends studied. The time of overshoot in a single-step shear rate experiment is inversely proportional to the shear rate, and the steady-state value of N1 scaled linearly with shear rate, whereas the steady-state shear stress did not. The average diameter of the dispersed phase decreased for all strain histories when the blend was not compatibilized. When the blend was compatibilized, the average diameter of the dispersed phase changed only during the stronger flows. Experimental data were compared with the predictions of a model formulated using ideas of Doi and Ohta (1991), Lacroix et al. (1998) and Bousmina et al. (2001). The model correctly predicted the behavior of the uncompatibilized blends for single-step shear rates but not that of the compatibilized blends, nor did it predict morphologies after shearing." .

The protagonists of this progress were primarily clinicians whose purpose was to link symptoms with pathological lesions and to elaborate a pertinent nosology. Pierre-Joseph Desault and Jean-Nicolas Corvisart were the forerunners, along with Xavier Bichat, a genius who died before he was able to realize his full potential. Guillaume Dupuytren, a renowned surgeon, founded an Anatomical Society with enthusiastic students; while Gaspard-Laurent Bayle and René-Theophile Laennec studied tuberculosis and developed the principles of clinicopathological correlations. Laennec’s invention of the stethoscope in 1816 constituted a dramatic improvement of the possibilities of clinical examination and effectively established the clinicopathological method. A chair of morbid anatomy was created in 1835 for J. Cruveilhier, while a museum of morbid anatomy was established thanks to a 200,000 francs donation on behalf of G. Dupuytren. The French practitioners, however, did not believe that the microscope would play a major part in further medical progress, and after the revolution of 1848, the so-called School of Paris declined." .

The arguments for using history are divided into two categories; history as a tool and history as a goal. The ways of using history are placed into three categories of approaches: the illumination, the modules, and the history-based approaches.

Efforts to explore human cavities for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes began as early as the 5th century BC. The evolution of laparoscopy at the beginning of the past century has been a major step toward minimization of surgical trauma. The present article investigates the terminological origin and the evolution of the terms endoscopy and laparoscopy. MethodsA search of ancient bibliographical archives and a review of the modern medical literature was undertaken. ResultsThe word endoscopy derives from the Greek word endoscópesis, a compound word consisting of éndon, which means inside and scopeín, which means to watch carefully. Laparoscopy also is a compound word, consisting of the words lapára, which means abdomen or abdominal wall, and scopeín. The word lapára derives from the adjective laparós, which means soft. The word lapára may be traced back to the Linear B syllabic script (17th to 13th century BC), as well as in descriptions of fights by the epic poet Homer (8th century BC). Although endoscopic examinations had been performed since the 5th century BC, the term endoscopy is first encountered in medical manuscripts of the 19th century AC, after the evolution of novel instruments and following the advent of artificial light. Similarly, the word laparothoracoscopy was first used in the early 20th century. ConclusionsThe origins of the words laparoscopy and endoscopy are traced back to the archaic period and later to the classical years of ancient Greece. The everlasting semantic of these origins is revisited in the 21st century, as minimization of surgical trauma with the aid of modern technology substantiates the diachronic objective “to do no harm.”" .

Sherry accepts that the Jesuits did indeed suppress the method, but offers two objections. First, that the book does not distinguish between indivisibles and infinitesimals, and that whereas the Jesuits might have reason to object to the first, the second posed no problem for them. Second, seeking an alternative explanation for the Jesuits’ hostility to the method, he proposes that its implicit atomism conflicted with the Catholic doctrine of the sacrament of the Eucharist, and was therefore heretical. In response to Sherry’s first criticism I point out that the Jesuits objected to all forms of the method of indivisibles, and that the distinction between indivisibles and infinitesimals consequently cannot explain the fight over the method in the seventeenth century. With regards to the Eucharist, I agree with Sherry that the Jesuits were indeed concerned about the method’s affinity to atomism and materialism, though for a different reason: these doctrines were antithetical to their efforts to impose divine hierarchy and order on the world. In as much as the technical details of the miracle of the Eucharist mattered, they provided no grounds for objecting to a mathematical (rather than physical) doctrine." .

To understand ecosystem response and the wider social consequences of environmental change, we constructed a 396-year long (1615–2010) drought sensitive tree-ring width chronology (TRW) of Pinus nigra var. banatica (Georg. et Ion.) growing on steep slopes and shallow organic soil. We established a statistical relationship between TRW and two meteorological parameters—monthly sum of precipitation (PP) and standardised precipitation index (SPI). PP and SPI correlate significantly with TRW (r = 0.54 and 0.58) and are stable in time. Rigorous statistical tests, which measure the accuracy and prediction ability of the model, were all significant. SPI was eventually reconstructed back to 1688, with extreme dry and wet years identified using the percentile method. By means of reconstruction, we identified two so far unknown extremely dry years in Romania—1725 and 1782. Those 2 years are almost as dry as 1946, which was known as the “year of great famine.” Since no historical documents for these 2 years were available in local archives, we compared the results with those from neighbouring countries and discovered that both years were extremely dry in the wider region (Slovakia, Hungary, Anatolia, Syria, and Turkey). While the 1800–1900 period was relatively mild, with only two moderately extreme years as far as weather is concerned, the 1900–2009 period was highly salient owing to the very high number of wet and dry extremes—five extremely wet and three extremely dry events (one of them in 1946) were identified." .

Despite this fact, as well as because of it, he has achieved the status of “classic” artist, in the process becoming an academic staple: university professors lecture on him because he must be “covered,” even if they do not appreciate his artistic accomplishments. At the same time, Brecht’s innovations in dramatic form and theatrical style have become clichés: indeed, he has already been rejected by many theater people who hastened to copy those innovations without understanding them. Given his recent dismissals by both the academic and the commercial theater worlds, then, Brecht is in danger of becoming a legend without ever having been thoroughly known. But it remains true that knowing him thoroughly is very difficult—and altogether necessary. The purpose of this essay is to facilitate the “knowing” of his dramatic oeuvre through an investigation of it not only in the context of Brecht’s own dramatic theory, but also in the context of the history of drama; through a consideration of his dramatic work, as well as his directing style, from the point of view of its naturalism versus its theatricalism, its obeisance to tradition and its devotion to experimentation; and through a discussion of acting for Brecht’s theater. In the end, Brecht was dedicated to transforming the theater into something that would entertain by asking us to exercise our critical intelligence, rather than something that would divert by making us forget the world. This essay concludes by asking whether this kind of theater—epic theater—continues to exist now." .

The Libri announcement was supported by the concurrent finding of a box with the early Little Florentine Thermometers that survived the Inquisition and was confirmed by Schouw, von Humboldt and Maxwell. However, all investigations made to find Renieri’s observations were fruitless. This paper clarifies this complex situation differentiating between myth and reality. A careful analysis of the Libri’s announcement in the historical context points out that Libri made the announcement while escaping for conspiracy from Florence and needed a scoop to be introduced in the French Academy of Sciences. For this reason he made a deliberate mix of new and old assertions, i.e. he claimed to have made new discoveries but without explaining too much and reporting misleading details about well known stories concerning the earliest meteorological observations. This induced people to suppose that further, earlier records existed. The consequence of this was that climatologists searched for years the claimed records. This paper shows that the Medici Network almost certainly contains the earliest exploitable instrumental observations. The possibility of finding a short series of observations prior to 1654 is remote." .

The construction of the map largely depends on translators and their literary translations. No doubt, academic works on the history of world literature written or translated by scholars from target countries have made equally remarkable contributions. But in most cases the weight of those contributions is particularly felt by readers who take up foreign literary studies as profession, especially in China. To general readers, it is through the strenuous efforts the translators have made that they have acquired that very map they desired for. This essay aims to reveal the different maps in the eye of the Chinese readers in different historical periods and their constructions through our endeavor to sort out and describe relevant facts gleaned from a hundred-odd period since the end of the Qing Dynasty to the beginning of the People’s Republic of China. Meanwhile, the essay also attempts to show the functions and influence the translators and their activities perform and exert through relatively meticulous analyses of the relevant facts." .

Scholars are debating whether parents always loved and nurtured their children. The historical record provides some support for both sides. Parents who abandoned their children often did so with the hope that someone else would be able to raise them. But others, like the ancient Carthagians, sacrificed their own children to appease the gods. Colonial Americans appear to have been particularly solicitous of the well-being of their children. The paper then traces the changes in the role of women in facilitating the process of childbirth in America. Scholars are cautioned not to idealize the childbirth experiences of women in the past as they experienced considerable pain and fear." .

Only in literary studies one meets with this notion (...); in political or economic history, history of art or of science no such circumscription is conceivable. And people stick to it merely on account of linguistic difficulty. As the literary historian cannot be conversant with all the provinces of European literature, he turns his limitations to advantage, substitutes an objective demarcation for a subjective one and represents literary history as the history of a national literature instead of keeping his eye on the larger whole.

Clones with different phototactic behaviour were found to have divergent life history strategies, with positively phototactic clones being good exploiters under the non-limiting conditions provided in the laboratory, i.e. low density (1 ind./1), high food concentration (6,5–7 105 Scenedesmus cells/ml, restored daily) and high temperature (20° C). They realized a high intrinsic rate of increase at a small adult body size through rapid development, at a cost of producing small neonates. Negatively and intermediately phototactic clones had larger adult body sizes, and produced larger neonates that were more starvation-resistant than those of positively phototactic clones. Selection for high intrinsic rate of increase in intermediately phototactic clones was mediated through the production of large clutches." .

After our article had appeared we obtained some new information about the present state of the theory.

Whereas modern philosophers and historians have generally credited the Middle Ages with a radically different time concept in contrast to the modern world, here I will argue that occasionally the differences were considerably less stringent and perhaps not even existent. Often, quite naturally, the mental-historical framework was deeply influenced by the Catholic Church which perceived human life within the extremes of life and death, or of secular time and eternity. The analysis will take us from Old High German heroic epic poetry represented by the “Hildebrandslied” with its noteworthy emphasis on the many years in which the father did not see his son, to the late Middle Ages when Oswald von Wolkenstein, through his poetry, and Helene Kottannerin, through her unique diary, indicated their full awareness of the meaning of time in its measurable quality. Not every author reflected the same concept of time, and many of them simply took their readers to the timeless world of King Arthur. Other authors, however, such as the Stricker, expressed a clear idea of time almost in the modern sense of the word by way of positioning their protagonists in problematic situations when they are suddenly pressed for time and need to reach painful decisions. The article does not intend to blur the differences between the Middle Ages and our own cultural period, but it wants to deconstruct the romantic sentiment that the consciousness of time prevalent in the Middle Ages was completely different to the modern concept of time." .

However, the path to adoption of sound constitutions is much less clear. This paper turns to the history of constitutional transfer to propose an alternative to taxonomies offered in the literature, which typically classify constitutions either by governmental structure (presidential v. parliamentary, or centralized v. federalist) or by source of influence (e.g. US 1787, Spain 1812, France 1958). These classifications are found wanting; instead, this paper proposes a new taxonomy based on the origin of the constitutional ideas and adoption. Formal constitutional parchment must match informal constitutional culture, so a constitution’s likelihood of success is greatest when the ideas are indigenous; the source of adoption is ultimately secondary. The paper closes with four case studies of constitutional transfer and adoption." .

Even in the absence of flavour-blind phases, we find potentially sizable CP violating contributions to b→s decay amplitudes. The effects in the mixing-induced CP asymmetries in B→ϕK S and B→η′K S , angular CP asymmetries in B→K ∗ μ + μ − and the direct CP asymmetry in B→X s γ can be in the region to be probed by LHCb and next generation B factories. At the same time, these effects in B decays are compatible with CP violating contributions to meson mixing, including a non-standard B s mixing phase hinted by current tensions in the CKM fit mostly between $S_{\\psi K_{S}}, \\epsilon_{K}$ and $\\Delta M_{B_{s}}/\\Delta M_{B_{d}}$." .

This paradox is discussed for Italy by revisiting the history of contraception and reproduction during the second half of the twentieth century, and by using new data for the end of that century and the early twenty-first century. The main results are: (1) it has been possible to maintain low rates of planned and unplanned fertility without resorting to more effective contraceptive methods thanks to a careful use ofcoitus interruptus; (2) the pace of diffusion of the pill and IUD was so slow because of the opposition to contraception of the Catholic Church, a gender system emphasizing traditional male and female roles, and a medical culture that made physicians reluctant to prescribe the pill for their patients; and (3) the contraceptive patterns of Italian women born after 1960 are more similar to those of their Western counterparts, although new peculiarities appear, for example, substantial reliance on the condom by people living as couples as well as sexually active singles." .

In Europe, P. mascittii is the northernmostly distributed phlebotomine species. While P. perniciosus is a proven vector of leishmaniasis as well as various sandfly fever causing phleboviruses, the situation for P. mascittii is different. For this species, vector competence could not be proven yet, but is strongly suspected. During an entomological survey in July 2013, one female sandfly was caught in Giessen in the German state of Hesse. Adjacent to the collection site, different potential habitats could be found. Morphological examination of the cibarium, pharynx, and genitalia revealed the specimen as P. mascittii. This is the first reported occurrence for Hesse, and not only the northernmost documented occurrence for P. mascittii, but also of the whole subfamily in the Palearctic region.

We analyzed confluence patterns of intrahepatic segmental bile ducts, seeking to relate hepato-lithiasis to anatomic variation. The comparative study was completed patients with hepatolithiasis in Taiwan and Japan. Methods. Direct cholangiography was performed in 103 hepatolithiasis patients in Taiwan and 77 in Japan. Segmental ducts patterns were classified as type I, normal configuration; type II, “triad” confluence; type III, posterior segmental duct joining left hepatic duct; or type IV, distal confluence of the right posterior segmental duct. Results. Taiwanese patients had only calcium bilirubinate or black stones, and were mostly female. As overall analysis, types I, II, III, and IV were found in 61, 26, 13, and 3 patients, respectively. In Japanese, types I, II, III, and IV were found in 52, 10, 13, and 2, respectively. There was no difference between the two institutes. Since no patients in Taiwan had cholesterol calculi, Japanese patients were reanalyzed including only 58 patients with calcium bilirubinate or black stones. Differences in those populations remained insignificant. Conclusion. Anatomic variations in segmental ducts apparently do not contribute to pathogenesis of hepatolithiasis." .

KNP pigs were at the brink of extinction in the 1980s, since then efforts have been made to restore the breed by bringing together the remaining stocks in South Korea. As a result, KNP was registered as a breed in 2006. To find additional breed-specific markers that are distinct among pig breeds, variations in O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) were investigated. OGT is located on chromosome X and catalyzes the post-translational addition of a single O-linked-β-N-acetylglucosamine to target proteins. FindingsLength polymorphism in the intron 20 of OGT was identified. The intron 20 of OGT from Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire breeds was 281-bp longer than that from either KNP or Chinese Meishan pigs. The difference between the Western pig breeds (BB genotype) and KNP or Meishan pigs (AA genotype) was due to an inserted 276-bp element and the 5-bp ACTTG. ConclusionsThe polymorphism in OGT identified in this study may be used as an additional marker for determining the breed of origin among Meishan and the Western pig breeds. The length polymorphism suggests that the locus near OGT is not fixed in KNP. This marker would be relevant in determining the breed of origin in crossbred pigs between KNP pigs with known genotypes and the Western pig breeds with BB genotypes, thus confirming the contribution of the X chromosome from each breed." .

Rather, researchers assume a linear relation based on the argument that science is allied with the development of technology. To probe this issue further, this study uses a ranking of over 5600 scientists based on number of appearances in Google Books over a period of 200 years (1800–2000). The results point to several peak periods, particularly for scientists born in the 1850–1859, 1897–1906, or 1900–1909 periods, suggesting overall cycles of around 8 years and a positive trend in distinction that lasts around 100 years. Nevertheless, a non-parametric test to determine whether randomness can be rejected indicates that non-randomness is less apparent, although once we analyse the greatest minds overall, rejection is more likely." .

Twenty-nine African American college age women were classified as obese, overweight, or normal according to their body mass index. Sixty-six percent of the women participated in some form of physical activity. Over half of the participants used some commercial diet form to lose, gain, or maintain weight. When asked about their level of body satisfaction, the majority of women in all three groups were satisfied.

The penchant to stigmatize PATCO detracts from important aspects of the union’s unorthodox strategy. Preparations for 1981 negotiations were coordinated by rank-and-file activists who referred to themselves as ‘choir boys’. An extensive mobilization network cultivated by the ‘choir boys’ contributed to cohesiveness and in effect democratized PATCO. The union’s effectiveness in building internal solidarity was its most notable accomplishment. Twenty-first-century labor-movement revitalization will require not only strong, creative leadership but also rank-and-file mobilization in the mold of PATCO’s ‘choir boy’ system. It is this type of grassroots activism that has the potential to promote an internal culture of militant action which can serve as the foundation for union growth." .

Since 1946 he has been living in USA. I met him in Jerusalem in September 1995. During one week we would sit together at breakfast time at the Hebrew University guesthouse. This week and many discussions with G. Feher were fascinating for me. Further we continued in our contacts, we exchanged letters, papers, essays. This way an idea to introduce George Feher to his former countrymen was born. Professor Feher as an experienced researcher in physics and biophysics, as a personality who met with William Shockley, Edward Teller and many other famous scientists, and moreover, as a personality collecting scientific humor and jokes, attracted the interest of Slovak scientific community. His life may be an inspiration especially for young people looking for examples of a true scientific career." .

We studied the proliferative activity and genetic changes in the two lesions in an attempt to define their biologic and pathogenetic relationships. The MIB-1 index was 11% in the meningioma and <1% in the MA, indicating increased proliferative activity in the meningioma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was done for two chromosomal regions commonly deleted in meningiomas. There was loss of the neurofibromatosis 2 locus (22q12) in both the meningioma and MA. Conversely, the region of 1p32 was not deleted. Our results indicate that both the meningioma and MA arose from the same clonal process, with the meningioma probably undergoing additional, but undefined, genetic alterations that confer upon it a more proliferative potential. This loss of 22q12 in the MA raises doubt about the presumed hamartomatous nature of MA." .

The averaged contrail cover exhibits maximum values along the transatlantic flight corridor around 50 °N (of almost 2%) and over western Europe resulting in 0.5% contrail cloudiness on average. A strong yearly cycle appears with a maximum (<2%) in spring and summer over the Atlantic and a smaller maximum (<1%) in winter over southwestern Europe. Comparing the two time periods, which are separated by one decade, shows there is a significant decrease in contrail cloudiness over western Europe and a significant increase over the North Atlantic between March and July. Contrail cloud cover during daytime is about twice as high as during nighttime. Contrails are found preferentially in larger fields of 1000 km diameter which usually last for more than a day. Causes, possible errors and consequences are discussed." .

Somereasons for this relative neglect are identified and a case ismade for the claim that criminology can contribute to anunderstanding of the Holocaust and that the Holocaust cancontribute to the development of a more profound criminology. Thispaper draws upon an integrative criminological approach toconstruct a framework for understanding the Holocaust. This multi-disciplinary framework links philosophical, sociolegal,sociological, behavioral and criminological dimensions todiscriminate between unique and non-unique aspects of the Holocaustas a case of genocide and as crime.

In part 1 a female Dante descends into hell not to learn the nature of sin as her medieval counterpart does but to realize the depth of the female artist's exile from the political and artistic life of the dominant, androcratic, culture. Part 2's satire inverts the medieval purgatorial ascent with real-estate-agent Virgil and porn-star Beatrice trying to persuade Dante, now a male, to accept the culture's money-based, celebrity-oriented values. Part 3 of each work culminates in a vision. One difference, however, is that whereas the medieval vision is empyreal, the contemporary vision is terrestrial. A second difference is that the contemporary Dante, a girl again, relates in a narrative the vision of community for which she was put to death. Understanding the penalty exacted for a minority perception, she voluntarily returns to the underworld to give voice to other exiles." .

Interestingly, despite the low number of prescriptions and paucity of new data available, there does continue to be intermittent professional articles and Internet communications that both discourage and encourage the use of Addyi based on their respective analyses of earlier efficacy and safety data. Both sides weigh in on issues of medicalization, pharmaceuticalization, commercialization, and the question of sexism versus science. But missing from most of the diatribes is another reason for Addyi’s very slow uptake by the medical community related to the regulatory approval process itself, economic, and political forces, and most importantly historical factors that help account for the differentiated response to Viagra and Addyi. Sexual healthcare professionals in particular who share a common belief in multilevel causality would be remiss in not recognizing the extremely important historical differences and circumstances surrounding the launch of Viagra by Pfizer in 1998 and the launch of Addyi by Sprout (currently owned by Valeant Pharmaceuticals) in October, 2015. Analysis of the 1998 Viagra launch found in “The History of Sexual Medicine” (APA’s Handbook of Sexuality and Psychology) provides enhanced perspective about Addyi’s less-than-meteoric introduction, particularly given the substantial media buzz and publicity that surrounded Addyi’s convoluted and controversial path through the FDA. It is critical to recognize that in 2015 there was no large backlog of women already using FDA-approved sexual medicine drugs to treat their “FSD,” as none had been previously approved for that purpose. Unlike Viagra, there was no preexisting audience for the drug who could choose to substitute a new medical drug therapy for a noxious pharmaceutical regimen they were already using. Unlike Pfizer in 1998, Sprout lacked broad existing company/physician/patient relationships. Furthermore, post-launch regulatory limitations on marketing and advertising of Addyi make it much less likely that women who believe they suffer from HSDD symptoms would not necessarily be aware that a new treatment was available nor how to be evaluated or how to obtain it. Finally, FDA imposed provider and distributor certification requirements have exacerbated the situation at least presently. None of the above negates the importance of a continued, but professional and thoughtful debate over what type of therapy is the most appropriate, safe, and efficacious treatment for women." .

While permanent contact with the active compound led to an efficacy of 100% in the case of Mite-Stop® on mites in both farms, there was only a 96.2% killing effect of ByeMite® on the mites of the French farm. Even short contacts of only 4 s killed 100% of mites in the case of Mite-Stop® at the French farm and only 84.5% in the German farm. ByeMite®, on the other hand, killed only 27.8% (Germany) and 30% (France) when mites got the chance to escape from the treated grounds to untreated ones. When using only the half doses of both products, Mite-Stop® still reached, after permanent contact, 100% activity on the German farm and 98.2% in France, while ByeMite® killed 93.8% (Germany) and 90.6% (France). Short contact to half doses of course reduced the activity of both products (Mite-Stop® = 59.3% in France, 22.1% in Germany; ByeMite® = 28.8% in France, 18.8% in Germany). With respect to the fumigant activity of the products, the strains of D. gallinae reacted differently. While Mite-Stop® showed a clear fumigant activity in the case of the German mites, this product did not affect the French mites by air distribution, neither did ByeMite® in both cases. Therefore, mites have to come in contact with both products. Against Mite-Stop®, there was apparently no resistance and low doses have high efficacy after even short contacts, which regularly occur in a treated stable, where mites have the chance to leave treated places to untreated hidden spots." .

Some aspects of the history of post-World War II quantum field theory, of solid state/condensed matter physics, and of the development of neoliberalism—the commitment to the belief that the market knows best, to free trade, to enhanced privatization, and to a drastic reduction of the government’s role in regulating the economy—are reviewed in order to make some observations regarding certain “top-down” views in solid state physics in postmodernity, the economic and cultural condition of many Western societies since the 1980s, the decade in which many historians assume modernity to have ended." .

Both types of seasonal variation have undergone chronological changes from decade to decade. In the USA the former seasonal type curve has become so flat that mortality might well be said to have been \"deseasonalized\", while in the other regions the concentration of deaths in the cold season has been growing more conspicuous in recent years.

We investigate the twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the scalar mesons a0, $ K^{\\ast}_{0}$ and f0 within the QCD sum rules. The QCD sum rules are improved by a consistent treatment of the sizable s -quark mass effects within the framework of the background field approach. Adopting the valence quark component $ (\\bar{q}_{1} q_{2})$ as the dominant structure of the scalar mesons, our estimation for their masses is close to the measured $ a_{0}(1450)$ , $ K^{\\ast}_{0}(1430)$ and $ f_{0}(1710)$ . From the sum rules, we obtain the first two non-zero moments of the twist-3 LCDAs $ \\phi^{s,\\sigma}_{a_{0}}$ : $ \\langle \\xi_{s,a_0}^{2(4)}\\rangle=0.369\\;(0.245)$ and $ \\langle \\xi_{\\sigma,a_{0}}^{2(4)}\\rangle=0.203 \\;(0.093)$ ; those of the twist-3 LCDAs $ \\phi_{K^{\\ast}_{0}}^{s,\\sigma}$ : $ \\langle \\xi_{s,K^{\\ast}_{0}}^{1(2)}\\rangle=0.004\\;(0.355)$ and $ \\langle \\xi_{\\sigma,K^{\\ast}_{0}}^{1(2)}\\rangle =0.018\\;(0.207)$ ; and those of the twist-3 LCDAs $ \\phi_{f_{0}}^{s,\\sigma}$ : $ \\langle \\xi_{s,f_{0}}^{2(4)}\\rangle=0.335\\;(0.212)$ and $ \\langle \\xi_{\\sigma,f_{0}}^{2(4)}\\rangle=0.196\\;(0.088)$ , respectively. As an application of those twist-3 LCDAs, we study the $ B\\rightarrow S$ transition form factors by introducing proper chiral currents into the correlator, which is constructed such that the twist-3 LCDAs give dominant contribution and the twist-2 LCDAs make negligible contribution. Our results of the $ B\\rightarrow S$ transition form factors at the large recoil region $ q^{2}\\simeq 0$ are consistent with those obtained in the literature, which inversely shows the present twist-3 LCDAs are acceptable." .

Consideration of all articles looking at Douglas bag technique and chemical gas analysis has here focused on the growing appreciation of errors in measuring expired volumes and gas composition, and subjective reactions to airflow resistance and dead space. Multiple small sources of error have been identified and appropriate remedies proposed over a century of use of the methodology. Changes in the bag lining have limited gas diffusion, laboratories conducting gas analyses have undergone validation, and WHO guidelines on airflow resistance have minimized reactive effects. One remaining difficulty is a contamination of expirate by dead space air, minimized by keeping the dead space <70 mL. Care must also be taken to ensure a steady state, and formal validation of the Douglas bag method still needs to be carried out. We may conclude that the Douglas bag method has helped to define key concepts in exercise physiology. Although now superceded in many applications, the errors in a meticulously completed measurement are sufficiently low to warrant retention of the Douglas bag as the gold standard when evaluating newer open-circuit methodology." .

With simultaneous measurement of isometric tension rhythm of the strand, it was revealed that the period and phase of oscillation in ATP leakage correspond well with those of tension production. Further, microinjection of luciferin-luciferase into the plasmodial strand indicated that the intracellular luminescence of luciferin-luciferase also oscillates with the same period and in the same phase as the tension rhythm. The free ATP concentration in a homogenate ofPhysarum plasmodium was of the order of 10 μM, but if the homogenate was heated in boiling water, the intensity of luminescence suddenly increased 10–100 fold.

Vegetative buds showed well-defined phenological stages: pre-dormancy, “true dormancy”, and end of dormancy. Both GA3 and chilling treatments shortened the sprouting times of vegetative dormant buds close to those in predormancy. Isolated floral buds were irresponsive under all conditions and did not sprout even with the GA3 or chilling treatments. In a comparative study with buds immediately after collection anatomical analysis demonstrated that vegetative buds were almost completely developed by midsummer/early automn and remained in a resting state until the end of winter. Floral buds developed continuously over the same period. Both types of verticils began to differentiate in midsummer. Sepals and petals developed mainly in late summer, androecious floral parts developed throughout the resting period, while gynoecious floral parts showed differentiation in late winter.

Following the acquisition of land in Fiji, the British recruited impoverished people from India and relocated them as indentured servants to do work on sugar cane plantations that natives refused to do. When Fiji became independent nearly 100 years later, the island nation had nearly equal populations of native Fijians and people of Indian decent. Fiji experienced three military coupes between 1987 and 2000 while the two ethnic and culturally distinct groups competed for jobs and political power. As a small, island nation, identity-based communication in Fiji represents a microcosm of other more complex multicultural societies.

The first god, the ancestor of all the rest, is the illusive Demogorgon. Described as nearly invisible, hidden by clouds and gloom, with a name toο horrible to utter, Demogorgon will reappear in subsequent drama and literature, playing a decisive role in Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound. This article traces the origins of Demogorgon, first to the Erichtho passage in Lucan [6.744-747], wherein there is a similarly awesome but nameless spirit. Boccaccio cited and quoted this very passage, as he did the similar passage in Statius’ Thebaid [4.514-517]. Boccaccio then cites Lactantius [Placidus], who has been credited with creating the name “Demogorgon,” although the manuscript tradition does not bear reliable witness to the name until the twelfth century. Ultimately Demogorgon seems to derive from Plato’s demiourgos, although his benign creator god underwent a severe transformation during the intervening centuries. Boccaccio seems to follow as well a second tradition derived primarily from Theodontius, himself illusive, which derives ultimately from the archaic Greek Arcadian tradition." .

A high publication rate is usually interpreted as representative of high scientific value of the conference. MethodsPoster and podium presentations from the 2007 to 2012 annual meetings were identified. Pubmed was used to search for the abstract title and/or the combination of authors to verify whether the data were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts were considered published if the data presented at the meeting were identical to that in the publication. The journals in which the data were published were identified, as well as the origin of the research centre. ResultsFrom 2007 to 2012 826 abstracts were featured at the CSRS Europe annual meetings. There were 236 podium presentations and 590 poster presentations. 42 % of the podium presentations resulted in a publication, and 28 % of the poster presentations led to a publication. Overall, 32 % of accepted abstracts effectuated a publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Abstracts from European research groups had a publication rate of 29 % compared to 34 % for abstracts from non-European research groups. Spine, European Spine Journal, Journal of Spinal Disorders and Techniques and J Neurosurgery Spine were the most common publication journals for the abstracts. The mean impact factor of the journals in which was published was 2.2. Conclusion42 % of the abstracts that were accepted for podium presentation at the CSRS Europe resulted in a publication in peer-reviewed MEDLINE indexed journals. Publication rates are at the high end of the publication rate spectrum of abstracts accepted for European scientific meetings." .

The temperature trends are different in each climatic zone and season, while the interannual variability shows a similar seasonal dependence for the North and South of Italy. In particular, summer temperature shows a characteristic pattern with alternating minima and maxima reaching significant values in the period 1940–1970: a maximum for the North between 1940–1960 and a minimum for the South between 1960–1970." .

This is the question posed by this contribution, which explores articles published within the past fifteen years in various French-language scientific journals. Through a systematic review of the scientific literature, we analyze the evolution of topics in the sociology of aging through five well-known French-language journals of sociology. Three of them are generalist journals (Revue française de sociologie, Revue suisse de sociologie, Recherches sociologiques et anthropologiques), from France, Switzerland, and Belgium respectively. The remaining two journals, both from France, are specifically devoted to the study of aging (Gérontologie et société, Retraite et société). The results invite further exploration of the influence of the national contexts in which French-speaking European sociologies are structured." .

This movement lasted for more than three decades, from late 1950s to 1994, had a presence on all continents, and can be seen to be part of the construction of a global political culture during the Cold War. The paper argues that the history of the anti-apartheid struggle provides an important historical case for the analysis of present-day global politics—especially in so far that movement organizations, action forms, and networks that were formed and developed in the anti-apartheid struggle are present in the contemporary context of the mobilization of a global civil society in relation to neoliberal globalization and supra-national political institutions such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank." .

Yet, in documentaries imaging the events of the Shoah, one runs the risk of missing their most basic property, namely their unimaginability. The mere idea that one is able to imagine the unimaginable comes down to a denial of the Shoah’s status as an event that defies our understanding. The unimaginable ‘real’ of the Shoah, however, is not simply located in its object, in the cruelty of what happened in the camp. The Shoah makes us at the same time facing the unimaginable ‘real’ of the modern subject—the blind spot in our own identity. If we need imagination to deal with the Shoah, it is also because of an ungraspable ‘real’ in ourselves. This is why adequate Shoah representations, acknowledging their object as being beyond representation, include the same ‘beyond’ concerning the subject of the Holocaust memory. The essay makes this clear in an elaborated comparison of Claude Lanzmann’s 1985 film, Shoah, with some conceptual works of art from the late nineties—all of this ‘fine-tuned’ in a reflection upon Ingmar Bergman’s Persona." .

Results indicate that an increase (decrease) in elevation and a northward (southward) shift in mean station location in the CDD correspond with decreases (increases) in temperature. Although the movement of station locations in the CDD showed only modest impacts on trends, the effects of the movements are statistically significant, and explain some of the variances in the temperature trends. Results therefore suggest that climate divisions with more rugged terrain and greater shifts in elevation are more susceptible to spuriously generated trends." .

Over a dozen rosaceous taxa representing extant and extinct genera of all four traditionally recognized subfamilies are known from flowers, fruits, wood, pollen, and especially leaves. The complexity seen in Eocene Rosaceae suggests that hybridization and polyploidy may have played a pivotal role in the early evolution of the family. Increased species diversity and the first appearance of additional modern taxa occur during the Late Paleogene in North America and Europe. The Rosaceae become increasingly important components of fossil floras during the Neogene, with taxa adapted to many habitats." .

With this situation in mind, one might wonder if the United States government ever engaged in efforts geared toward strengthening the region's resistence to this recurring phenomenon. That inquiry is explored here. In so doing, the paper presents an historical sampling of the federal role in drought planning - by the way of legislative and other means - for the period, late 1870's to 1940. Included in the sampling are the J. W. Powell report, dry-land farming, irrigation, shelterbelts, and crop insurance - to name but a few. When these drought planning measures are examined as a unit, it provides a basis for some interpretative observations - summarized in the conclusions. The postscript is a commentary on the concept of a national drought planning policy. Categorized as the precursor to an impact assessment study, this work can serve as a reference point for additional interdisciplinary research not only on the subject of drought planning but also on the manner in which segments of society interact with climate and (as in this case) its varying components. The climatically intense Great Plains, its diversity hidden beneath a cape of perceived sameness, offers an ideal research focus but is but one example. Thus, the way seems clear for geographers, historians, sociologists, political scientists, economists, and others to continue to become increasingly involved in, and make significant contributions to, such climate-related investigations." .

It was found that for all the diseases considered there is a monthly change in frequency distribution which led to the elaboration of a seasonal disease calendar. For Japan it was noted that the mortality peak has gradually moved from summer to winter for most diseases.This pattern has been found to exist in the highly industrialized European countries and the USA for some time, while a high summer mortality and typical seasonal disease distribution is still found in little industrialized countries such as Egypt. The deseasonality of diseases seems to be typical of industrialized countries with highly developed public health and medical services." .

While most were at an intermediate level, this paper reviews three that were written for the early grades. These books provide a quaint insight into the society as well as the science of the nineteenth century. Since they were small and cheaply made, only a few copies have survived. Figure 1 contains black and write reproductions of the title pages as well as a color photograph of the three books. To illustrate their style, several pages of each are available in the supporting files: la11.pdf (178 Kbytes), davy.pdf (974 Kbytes), and green.pdf (318 Kbytes). The early American spirit of inevitable progress was as wide as the new United States itself. The faith that society could “lift itself by its bootstraps” prompted an emphasis on applied science. Independence from Europe, conquering the west, and utilization of natural resources created a demand for technical education. Public lectures on science were eagerly attended by adults. Colleges replaced classical studies with practical subjects. Chemistry became a standard course in academies and high schools." .

This conclusion would be of relevance, as it implies a contrast in the spatial signature and forcing of current warmth to that during the Medieval Warm Period. Our analysis of the data displayed in the IPCC report, however, shows no indication of an increased spread between long-term proxy records. We emphasize the relevance of sample replication issues, and argue that an estimation of long-term spatial homogeneity changes is premature based on the smattering of data currently available." .

The history of hydraulic technology even began long before Archimedes (287–212 BC). It is amazing to see what was accomplished in the application of hydraulic technology during antiquity, millenniums before the development of the concepts of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum used in present-day hydraulic design. The first developments of hydraulic technology occurred with the development of irrigation for agriculture, followed by the development of urban centers. A brief history is given of the development of hydraulic technology during antiquity." .

Following Ian Hacking, we point out that in the history of mathematics the amount of contingency is larger than is usually thought. As a case study, we analyze the historians’ approach to interpreting James Gregory’s expression ultimate terms in his paper attempting to prove the irrationality of $$\\pi $$ π . Here Gregory referred to the last or ultimate terms of a series. More broadly, we analyze the following questions: which modern framework is more appropriate for interpreting the procedures at work in texts from the early history of infinitesimal analysis? As well as the related question: what is a logical theory that is close to something early modern mathematicians could have used when studying infinite series and quadrature problems? We argue that what has been routinely viewed from the viewpoint of classical analysis as an example of an “unrigorous” practice, in fact finds close procedural proxies in modern infinitesimal theories. We analyze a mix of social and religious reasons that had led to the suppression of both the religious order of Gregory’s teacher degli Angeli, and Gregory’s books at Venice, in the late 1660s." .

A drying trend over North China was observed, which can be attributed to decreasing precipitation since the late 1970s. Moreover, NCAR/NCEP reanalysis dataset was used to investigate causes behind the drying trend in North China. The moisture flux on the regional boundaries of East China was calculated and a higher wavelet power spectrum for low-latitude boundaries (based on 20 and 25°N) occurred with significant periods in a 1-year band during 1961–2005; however, since 1977, a significant 1-year period can no longer be detected on the northern boundary of South China (based on 35°N). The summer moisture flux during 1961–1977, when compared to the same during 1978–2005, has increased in East China. Good matches are found between moisture alterations and precipitation changes, and are also confirmed by the periods of moisture transport along different latitudes. The significant 1-year periods of moisture transport along the mid-latitude boundary (based on 35°N) have disappeared since 1977, which could be the causes behind the drought in North China. The disappearance of the significant 1-year band of moisture transport along the mid-latitude boundary (based on 35°N) in the late 1970s could be a result of the significantly decreased moisture transport in North China in summer. When southerly winds are weakened in East Asia, the southwesterly winds can only reach the south of the lower Yangtze River, which is the major cause behind the frequent summer droughts in North China in the recent years." .

Contributions to the international and the Dutch scientific literature, in the form of regular publications, chapters in books, contributions to proceedings and Ph.D. theses were counted over two 5-year periods, i.e. 1981–1985 and 1986–1990. The quality of publications in the international journals was assessed using the average impact factor of the journals over the 10-year period. The number of publications in the international literature doubled during the observation period 1986–1990 compared to the period 1981–1985. Nevertheless, the quality of the publications remained the same. Metabolism, oncology/ haematology, immunology/infectious diseases and cardiology are the subspecialisations in which scientific research takes place in four or more academic paediatric hospitals. In total, 84 Ph.D. theses were produced in which a paediatrician was either the project leader (mostly a professor in paediatrics) or the investigator-in-charge. Insight into structure and major research efforts of paediatric hospitals in other countries of Europe may lead to exchange of views and, maybe, profitable co-operation." .

As the grandson of Ye Shengtao, a leading May Fourth writer, Ye Zhaoyan always feels responsible for connecting the contemporary with the early Republican period. The ways in which he makes the connection are interesting: he disguises under his popular appeals serious and critical reflections upon the relationship between history, memory, and love. I highlight Ye’s active remembrance of what has been repressed by the grand history, his constant examination of the writing of history through creating the writer as a historical figure of modern China, and his embedment of historical experience in the everyday." .

Exhumation and cooling from the total track annealing temperature (>120°C) of the Cozia and Cibin massifs occurred in the Palaeocene–Early Eocene. Between the Eocene and Middle Miocene, there was a stagnation period concerning vertical displacement; the presently exposed part of the basement was buried in shallow depth. The present crests of the Cozia and Cibin Mountains were at temperatures around 80°C and 50°C, respectively. The second exhumation period occurred in Middle Miocene times. The magnitude of the Miocene vertical displacement is on the order of the present-day relief. The vertical apatite FT age distribution in the basement and the age clusters in the sedimentary rocks prove that the levels of the crests were already close to the surface in Palaeogene times. Therefore, the post-Palaeocene erosional removal from the crest zones is very limited." .

These observations cover the period from discovery through to the end of 1997. The light curve shows that the rate of brightening of the comet varied widely at different times, with rapid rates of brightening at high heliocentric distance pre-perhelion and a comparably rapid post-perihelion fade. There is no evidence that the comet was suffering a large photometric outburst when first discovered, although a small outburst can be identified at perihelion. At least five difficult brightening regimes can be identified in the light curve between discovery and perihelion. From 2.5 AU to perihelion the rate of brightening with decreasing heliocentric distance was typical for “fairly” new comets(n ∼ 3.5, where “n” is the power law exponent of the heliocentric distance), although this was preceded by a period of very slow brightening with n ∼ 1 from r ∼ 4.0 AU to r ∼ 2.8 AU and followed by an initially more rapid brightening which appears to be related to the on-set of rapid water sublimation activity. We derive the light curve parameters at different stages of the comet's apparition." .

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio makes it difficult to find any significant departure from the simplest null hypothesis of the stability of the rain record at individual stations in northeast India. Only the coarsest possible view, i.e. comparing the two halves of the century, provided strongly significant results in the numbers of days with extreme rain. Using a more general approach, the number of Fourier transform extreme amplitudes also differed significantly. Increasingly heavy events during the summer monsoon season, and partly in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons, are offset by a weakening in the winter monsoon season, so that the annual mean rainfall does not show a significant trend over the Meghalaya Hills. Apart from a greater number of years with noticeable extreme rainfall events in the second half of the twentieth century, we can also observe a more pronounced quasi-periodicity of 10–20 and 30–60 days during the same period.

Even before the Age of Discovery, humanists were already employing personal experience and direct observation as a guide to knowledge. Paolo Marsi (1444–84), professor of rhetoric in Rome and member of Pomponio Leto's Roman Academy, represents the humanist caught between conflicting testimonies of verba and res. His 1468 versified travelogue of his journey to Spain and his 1482 published commentary on Ovid's Fasti on the one hand betray his belief and trust in the cultural and linguistic hegemony of the classical Roman past. However, they also reveal the renegotiation with auctoritas which takes place through firsthand encounters with the physical world. Paolo Marsi merits the distinction of being a truly liminal figure, a humanist open to historical awareness and new methods of learning." .

It did not develop into a major urban centre till the 1970s. This was because of poor transportation development. The available water transport was poorly run by a privately managed British Company, the Elder Demster. With the creation of a state capital in 1967 the government developed ferry services. Theses did not only encourage the migration of people from the rural areas to the newly created state capital for employment in the government and industrial establishments, but triggered off urbanization processes. The opening of a land route in 1978 increased population migration, concentration and urbanization. The increased population is not accompanied by increased food supply. Food is scarce and very highly priced especially the protein-rich foods. The low labour productivity is not unconnected with the prevalent malnutrition and undernourishment in the municipality. Here the government is reminded of its responsibility in meaningful planning that will take care of the necessary food supply now lacking in the area." .

This essay tries to point out that the novel is a full-scale exposition of the then cultural and political darkness. It forewarns the numb national people that the whole civilization would soon be destroyed, or rather self-destroyed, even without any foreign invasion. Most of the “national flaws” which led to the complete destruction of Cat Country still persist, to different degrees, in the current Chinese society. The future of our community is contingent on whether we could face and get rid of those “weaknesses.” But to begin with, the national people have to be awakened to the sordid reality that they have been indulging in for centuries. The essay concludes that Cat Country still bears with it the penetrating satirical power even in the contemporary world, 75 years after its first publication, for the novel has exposed many despicable defects in human nature, which could not be confined to only one single era, or one particular culture." .

These variations were identified through statistical change-point analysis, and the results showed that significant variation existed in 1983 and 2004. Therefore, data in 2005 and thereafter were excluded and differences in TC activities during the period after 1983 (1984–2004) and a period before 1983 (1968–1983), as well as differences in large-scale environments were analyzed. During the period of 1984–2004, TCs mainly occurred in the northwest quadrant of the subtropical western North Pacific (SWNP). The TCs move from the east sea of Philippines, pass the East China Sea, recurved, and moved to Korea and Japan. During the period of 1968–1983, TCs occurred in the southeast quadrant of the SWNP and showed a characteristic westward movement from the southeast of Philippines toward the southern coast of China and the Indochina Peninsula. Therefore, the intensity of TCs during the former period, which were supplied with greater heat and water vapor from the sea, were stronger, while TCs during the latter period quickly dissipated after landing in the southern coast of China and the Indochina Peninsula due to the effects of topography. Thus, the lifetimes of the TCs were short and their intensities were weak. The cause of these differences in TC activities between the two periods was identified through differences in stream flows between the 850 hPa level and the 500 hPa level. At the 850 hPa level, anomalous cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations are reinforced in most waters north (south) to 10° N, and thus, more (fewer) TCs occur in the northwest (southeast) quadrant of the SWNP during the period of 1984–2004 (1968–2003). At the 500 hPa level, since the center of anomalous cyclonic circulation is located in the southeastern region of China southeast to the east sea of the Philippines, anomalous southerlies from the east sea of Philippines to Korea and Japan are predominant. Due to the anomalous steering flows of these anomalous southerlies, the TCs during the period of 1984–2004 show the aforementioned paths. On the other hand, anomalous northerlies or northeasterlies are reinforced in regions in the west of the center of these anomalous cyclonic circulations, and thus, these anomalous steering flows serve the role of preventing TCs from moving toward the southern coast of China the Indochina Peninsula during the period of 1984–2004. During the period of 1984–2004, vertical wind shears and sea surface temperatures are high and low, respectively, in most waters of the SWNP. Therefore, more TCs occur and are reinforced during this period." .

This is done by critically reevaluating the model of evolution of the post-communist countries of Central Europe proposed by Gil Eyal, Ivan Szelényi, and Eleanor Townsley, in their “Making Capitalism without Capitalists.” The present article argues for supplementing their approach with an analytical distinction between the concepts of intellectuals (as masters of the critical discourse culture) and the intelligentsia, which in countries like Poland have an important component of post-gentry culture. The identity and images of the intelligentsia are analyzed as important though highly contested aspects of cultural capital in Poland. Wide implications of discursive battles on the status of intelligentsia in contemporary Poland are exemplified in the case of the debates over the so-called Rywin Affair in Poland and the role played in that affair by the major Polish intellectual Adam Michnik. The political discourse related to the affair and to the status of Michnik are studied in context of the structure of the Polish political scene and related to the academic debates on the intelligentsia, whether it is a “really existing” and significant social group or merely a marginal one and “outdated discourse.”" .

Contemporary historians have generally understood the Baronian imperative to favor a historiography that seeks continuities instead of ruptures, deemphasizes Jews’ victimhood in favor of their achievements and successful integration, and affirms diaspora creativity in opposition to Zionist disparagement of exile. They have also affirmed that imperative equally for all periods and places in Jewish history. Close analysis of Baron’s corpus suggests that such a reading is better termed ‘neo-Baronian,’ for Baron himself employed his injunction against lachrymosity in reference to the middle ages only, whereas his depiction of the modern era stressed sustained crisis, conflict, and insecurity throughout the Jewish world. Such a depiction is fully consistent with his conception of the conditions under which Jews were most likely to find safety and prosperity. That conception, which posited the preferability of ‘states of nationalities’ to ‘nation-states’ and stressed the need for a strong international order capable of checking unrestrained state sovereignty, was evidently born out of Baron’s own experience as a refugee in Vienna during and after the First World War." .

In this paper we consider problems that may emerge when the historical epistemology of mathematics is paralleled to students’ conceptual developments in mathematics. We problematize this attempt to link the two fields on the basis of Grattan-Guinness’ distinction between “history” and “heritage”. We argue that when parallelism claims are made, history and heritage are often mixed up, which is problematic since historical mathematical definitions must be interpreted in its proper historical context and conceptual framework. Furthermore, we argue that cultural and local ideas vary at different time periods, influencing conceptual developments in different directions regardless of whether historical or individual developments are considered, and thus it may be problematic to uncritically assume a platonic perspective. Also, we have to take into consideration that an average student of today and great mathematicians of the past are at different cognitive levels." .

These periods were strongly intertwined with both the history of the river and the history of the city. Urban expansion into the floodplains is demonstrated in this paper by investigating the island Unterer Werd, next to the city centre. In the late 17th century the fluvial dynamic still hampered urban development on the island. First measures to stabilise the river banks and to protect buildings from floods were taken soon thereafter, but the majority of practices aimed at mitigating the risks and impacts of the frequent floods: inundation was a part of the arrangement and the main target was to minimise the potential impacts. This practice also prevailed after the 1830s, when urban expansion began to move into the north and northwest of the island and the Danube floodplains were considered an important land resource for the growing city. In connection with new technologies and available means to channelise the river, the relationship between Vienna and the Danube changed fundamentally. Urban development in the riverine landscape gained new momentum. This process was initiated before the Great Danube Regulation from 1870 to 1875 was completed, the rate of growth accelerated after 1875. The last decades of the 19th century mark a turning point in the urban development of Vienna, with expanding urban areas becoming dependent upon a well functioning and maintained flood protection system." .

What else could be done by the citizens practising their disobedience during the non-violent revolutions in 1989 after Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the American Henry David Thoreau? At a first glance, it perhaps seems to be strange to put the following question: what is the connecting link between the role of political law of a public state and the citizens breaking the rules in order to protect the constitutional rights? What will be the result of this comparison? I think, the result is that we can recognize the role of both functions more thoroughly in operating the constitutional state suitably in order to protect the culture of constitutional rights (reactive role) and to develop them (proactive role)." .

The author argues that the roles of Indian and Chinese diasporas in their respective homelands’ development consistently reflect, and are heavily influenced by, their homelands’ economic development strategies as well as political history and culture. The author also argues that the impact of the diaspora on the foreign relations of their homelands is conditional upon the state of bilateral relations between their homeland and the country of residence. This study raises issues for future research, such as the relationship between the diaspora and regime type of the homeland. The author concludes by suggesting that since activities of overseas Chinese and non-resident Indians provide a unique perspective in the comparative study of Chinese and Indian political economy, the two diasporas warrant more scholarly and policy attention." .

The EPW is generated in the lower troposphere over the East Pacific, propagating predominantly eastward into North America and slightly upward then eventually into the stratosphere. The intensity of the EPW varies from year to year and exhibits apparent decadal variability. For the period 1958–1964, the EPW was in its second maximum, and it was weakest for the period 1965–1975, then it was strongest for the period 1976–1987. After 1987, the EPW weakened again. The intensity and position of the members (i.e., the Aleutian low, the North American trough, and the North American ridge) of the EPW oscillate from time to time. For an active EPW versus a weak EPW, the Aleutian low deepens abnormally and shifts its center from the west to the east of the date line, in the middle and upper troposphere the East Asian trough extends eastward, and the Canadian ridge intensifies at the same time. The opposite is true for a weak EPW. Even in the lower stratosphere, significant changes in the stationary wave pattern are also observed. Interestingly the spatial variability of the EPW assumes a Pacific-North American (PNA)-like teleconnection pattern. It is likely that the PNA low-frequency oscillation is a reflection of the oscillations of intensity and position of the members of the EPW in horizontal direction." .

At the end of the Carboniferous, herbivorous tetrapods appeared in North America and Western Europe; the first (pelycosaurian) dominant tetrapod communities were formed. In the Middle Permian, dominant communities are already known in all continents, where they are formed by Dinocephalian (therapsid) faunas. The history of the Dinocephalian fauna is most completely represented in the fossil record of South Africa and Eastern Europe. In the East European region, it is represented in the Mezen, Golyusherma, Ocher, Isheevo, and Sundyr assemblages, displaying successive stages of phylocoenogenesis of Dinocephalian community. The major features of these stages are considered. In the terminal Middle Permian (Guadalupian), Dinocephalian communities were disintegrated worldwide. In Eastern Europe, this occurred during the Severodvinian ecosystem crisis. The main features of the Severodvinian crisis are discussed." .

Finally the agreement extends also to the distribution of karyotypes within populations, those of the S8 showing a Hardy-Weinberg distribution whereas those of the M7 show a deficiency of structurally heterozygous types.

The national operas that emerged towards the middle of the nineteenth century represent a deviation, because they made use of librettos in the vernacular and often employed elements of a native musical tradition. More often than not, they thematized events from the national past in order to strengthen the nation's sense of identity. I argue that national operas ought to be seen as an important element of the national awakening that took place in Europe, especially in its Eastern and Southern parts, and relate its textual, musical, and institutional dimensions to the linguistic and literary awakenings. Yet, paradoxically, national awakenings and national operas often relied on foreign ideas and artistic currents. Ivan Zajc's Croatian national opera, Nikola Šubi h Zrinski (1876), for instance, is based on Theodor Körner's anti-Napoleonic German play Zriny (1812), which, in turn, was inspired by Friedrich Schlegel's Vienna lectures on literary history and Hungarian historical materials. By means of this case study I show that, contrary to their explicit ideology, national awakenings and national operas seized whatever came their way, often reductively adopting hybrid or foreign materials for national purposes." .

His first English novel, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, which inherits certain aesthetic motifs of his Russian works, such as the artist in exile, the motif of the double, and the theme of \"the other world\", has attracted the academic circle and received extreme views spreading between the good and the bad. But the core question in the whole of Nabokov scholarship is the ambiguous identities of the novel's two heroes, Sebastian and V. who are half-brothers. It is the identity puzzle that makes this novel more and more popular in Nabokov criticism.

In early times, the branches of biometeorology that are usual today were already evident: agricultural and forest meteorology, phenology, medical biometeorology and balneology, aerial biometeorology, urban housing and stabling meteorology all started to emerge several centuries ago. From the 1920 up to 1936, Wilhelm Schmidt at the Agricultural University of Austria laid the foundations of modern biometeorology. He was followed by Franz Sauberer, who headed a Department of Biometeorology at the National Weather Service and devoted his active life totally to biometeorology. Several years after his untimely death, the Department was dissolved. Not until 1981 was biometeorology taken up again at the Agricultural University, where the tradition of Schmidt and Sauberer now lives on in several courses within the area of applied biometeorology: Micro-and Topoclimatology, Agricultural and Forest Meteorology and Atmospheric Radiation. Biometeorology, being an experimental science, has also been influenced by new technological developments. The early period was exclusively observational. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries mechanical and simple electric instruments were used with strip-chart recorders. These time consuming methods have now been replaced by electronic devices, including data loggers and portable computers along with many new electronic sensors, which provide additional insight into biometeorological problems. Since computers also make it possible to solve some of the complicated equations of biometeorology, the future of this science seems to be bright, not only in Austria but throughout the world." .

Contributions and reports seeking to clarify this issue have multiplied in the past 80 or 90 years. Bärtschi–Rochaix reported what seems to have been the first clinical description of cervicogenic headache, but it was not until 1983 that Sjaastad and his school defined diagnostic criteria for this sydrome. The current, revised International Headache Society Classification (ICHD–II) includes the term cervicogenic headache, but the diagnostic criteria it gives differ from those of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), and also from the most recent Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group (CHISG) definition (1998)." .

I study the similarities between Husserl’s phenomenology and Walter Eucken’s economic theory and examine the way that Husserl’s idea of the historical a priori assumes a determinate role in Eucken’s economic thinking. I also return to Foucault’s lectures in order to show how a version of the historical a priori continues to operate in his history of governmentality, and how it functions as a counterpoint to the universalizing approach to the history of science, such as Husserl and Eucken’s. I conclude by rephrasing my initial question on the philosophical connections between Husserl’s phenomenology and German neoliberalism as a broader philosophical question on the political effects of our philosophical understanding of the history of science." .

In this paper we investigate fast particles in the range and support ofsuper-Brownian motion in the historical setting. In this setting eachparticle of super-Brownian motion alive at time t is represented by apath w:[0,t]→ℝ d and the state of historical super-Brownian motionis a measure on the set of paths. Typical particles have Brownian paths,however in the uncountable collection of particles in the range of asuper-Brownian motion there are some which at exceptional times movefaster than Brownian motion. We determine the maximal speed of allparticles during a given time period E, which turns out to be afunction of the packing dimension of E. A path w in the support ofhistorical super-Brownian motion at time t is called a-fast if . Wecalculate the Hausdorff dimension of the set of a-fast paths in thesupport and the range of historical super-Brownian motion. A valuabletool in the proofs is a uniform dimension formula for the Browniansnake, which reduces dimension problems in the space of stopped paths to dimension problems on the line." .

B. diversus workers showed characteristic patterns of behavior in flower use, flower choice, and patch departure. (1) Bumblebees stayed longer on a flower which had been unvisited for a while than on a flower which had been visited recently. (2) Bumblebees preferred visiting flowers which had been unvisited for a while to visiting those which had been visited recently, and to visiting those which had been unvisited for a long period. (3) Bumblebees had a higher probability of leaving a patch after they had stayed on a flower for a short period than after they had stayed for a longer period. The bumblebees appeared to perceive both remotely and proximately chemical cues deposited by other foraging individuals, which indicated nectar rewards in a flower, and thus obtained a higher nectar intake than the mean amount of nectar left in a flower." .

The aim of the present study was to analyze any association between a history of dentoalveolar injury and the shape and size of the nasopalatine canal (NC) using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Material and methodsPatients were allocated to the trauma group if they had a history of dentoalveolar injury and a root filling in at least one MI and/or one missing MI. As controls, 100 matched-controlled (age and gender) patients were selected. NC dimensions including length, width at midway, and diameter of incisal and nasal foramen were measured in sagittal and axial CBCT planes. Furthermore, an evaluation of NC bulging signs, apical osteolysis of MI, and its fusion with NC was performed. ResultsIn the trauma group (n = 96), 31.3 % had at least one missing MI, and 95.8 % had a root filling in a MI. The antero-posterior dimension of the incisive foramen (p = 0.02) and of the NC at midway (p = 0.04) was significantly larger in the trauma group. Significantly more cases with a bulging sign were found in the trauma (n = 19) than in the control group (n = 3, p = 0.001). An apical osteolysis was identified in 5.1 % of MI, and 12/38 did show a fusion with the NC. ConclusionWider dimensions of the NC and a bulging sign may suggest a former dentoalveolar injury to the anterior maxilla. Periapical osteolysis of central MI over 5 mm in diameter tends to fuse with the NC. Clinical relevanceIn patients with a history of dentoalveolar injury and/or apical periodontitis, the NC should be evaluated on available CBCT images. Any inflammatory processes in the neighboring teeth should be recognized and eliminated as they may initiate bulging of the NC and/or the formation of a nasopalatine duct cyst (NPDC). NC with bulging signs should be monitored clinically and radiographically to diagnose a NPDC in an early stage." .

Often lauded as the father of modern Chinese literature, Lu Xun has not only made major contributions to the formation of literary realism but also put his unique vision of tragedy into practice. At the core of his tragic poems and narratives lie the tropes of solitude. The tragic is characterized, not by tragic incident, but by void thereof, by a state of speech-less solitude and nothingness (xuwu). The aesthetic implications of such a tragic vision are twofold. The creation and consumption of literature in China during the first half of the twentieth century focused on questions of the nation and society, but Lu Xun’s solitary characters in The Weeds ask fundamental existential questions while carving a space for a new genre of writing." .

Furthermore, the country’s resultant political instability and economic underdevelopment have been complicated by the multiple transitions to which it has been subject since the war. As a consequence, the process of healing and reconciliation remains a challenge. Young people from different ethnic groups still live in separation and struggle to remain hopeful after witnessing many years of stagnation. This paper conceptualizes a participatory youth development framework designed to enhance the educational experience and active civic engagement of Bosnian youths from three ethnic groups in fostering community change and post-war healing through creative learning and Nonviolent communication. The proposed program aims to enable them to explore the stories of their shared history, challenge their shared future by facing up to their personal, wartime, pre-war and post-war experiences and view themselves as legitimate participants in the community development process." .

These documents were prepared by several indigenous groups as well as by the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries during their military campaigns and long-term evangelization and colonization and later on, by Indian nobles and Spanish historians. Pre-Columbian drawings show flames coming out of Popocatépetl’s crater while later descriptions from the Spanish colonial period in Mexico (1521 to 1821) refer to ash emission and ballistics, lahars, and some pumice falls, similar to what were depicted in the thirteenth to sixteenth century drawings. Graphic information from the pre-Columbian codices, colonial maps, and paintings referring to the eruptions were correlated with historical accounts and religious chronicles, thereby leading to the reconstruction of a more detailed sequence of eruptive events. From such information, it was possible for us to prepare ash distribution maps for the 1540, 1592, and 1664 eruptions. Most of the known historical eruptions seem to be similar to those that have been occurring at Popocatépetl since 1994, indicating the importance of ash emission and crater dome formation throughout its recent eruptive history. The strongest eruptions occurred in 1510, 1519, 1540, 1580, 1664, and 2001; these produced widespread ash falls that affected both populated and rural areas. Duration of eruptive episodes during the past 800 years were estimated to have ranged from less than a year to more than 30 years, separated by repose periods ranging between 7 and over 100 years." .

For this reason five 15-year old pistachio trees cv. \"Pontikis\" were selected and half of the main branches were manually defruited in early May. Polyamines were analyzed in three different organs (shoots, leaves and flower buds) from both fruiting and non-fruiting branches, during the period of kernel growing. Five samplings took place and the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine were assayed. The flower bud abscission percentage was recorded every 5–10 days during kernel formation. Polyamine concentration declined during the period that coincides with that of kernel development, in both fruiting and non-fruiting branches, while significant bud abscission occurred from mid-July till late September in fruiting branches. Polyamine concentration in organs from fruiting branches was in most cases lower than that of non-fruiting ones. Most of the individual polyamines exhibited a high and significant negative correlation with bud abscission. By measuring the spermidine content of leaves and the spermine content of buds, it was possible to estimate the forthcoming bud abscission with significant accuracy (approximately 93%). On the other hand, the total polyamine content of the buds exhibited a significant strong negative relationship with bud abscission. Consequently, polyamines could have an important physiological function in the development of flower bud abscission of pistachio." .

It is educational, and not scientific in nature, because it was written primarily for teacher education and training; it is national, or even nationalistic; it is oriented almost exclusively towards German philosophy; and it is indebted to Lutheran Protestantism. This model of pedagogical historiography leaves its mark on the historiographies that emerged later in England, France, and the United States. Taking the example of Rousseau, this contribution makes it clear that these Lutheran and idealist premises lead to a one-sided historiography, so that the republican tradition in which Rousseau stood could be suppressed. On this basis, the paper points up the methodological necessity in historical research to examine contexts, giving up the idea of one history of education in favor of reconstruction of various traditions. The gain lies in making visible suppressed transnational languages that educational reflection made use of for centuries. In particular, a connection is revealed between the republican education of the eighteenth century in Europe and the concern with the issue of the “good citizen” that has preoccupied the American discussion from Jefferson to the Pragmatists to Diane Ravitch." .

As much as the heroic individuals often seem to be wood-cut like figures with no or little feelings, a closer analysis of Beowulf, Le Chanson de Roland, the Nibelungenlied, and Njal’s Saga demonstrates that some of the true tragic elements contained in them are the conflicts among friends or the inability of friendship to avoid the massive killing. This friendship often comes to the surface only in the ultimate situation of death and dying, but the poets of those heroic epics were apparently deeply inspired to elaborate on the profound value of friendship in a bellicose and catastrophic world where human existence was at great risk. One of the greatest strengths of these heroes proves to be their deeply moving effort to reach out to their friends even in the most deadly situations." .

The association between one of these haplotypes (B haplotype) and the most frequent CF mutation, ΔF508, suggests for the latter a single origin and a subsequent diffusion according to a South East-North West gradient. The linkage disequilibrium data between CF and the B haplotype in different European populations are compatible with a relatively more recent appearance of the mutation in Northern Europe whereas in Southern Europe a longer history of the same mutation would have allowed time for recombination with other haplotypes. This model is also compatible with a selective advantage of carriers but does not account for (1) the excess of B haplotypes observed among both normal and non-ΔF508 CF chromosomes; (2) the correlation between the B haplotype and the severity of the phenotypic effect caused by CF mutations, as measured by pancreatic insufficiency and meconium ileus." .

Several factors, notably the increased national confidence resulting from the reign of Henri IV, a new view of human nature which stressed the heroic potential in mankind, and an evolving interpretation of the function of historiography, combined to produce a new approach towards the panegyric, apparent in the 1630s and 1640s. Comparisons of major contemporary figures, especially Louis XIII and, during the regency of 1643–1651, the Prince de Condé, with heroes of the ancient world produced a kind of hierarchy with Alexander at its head because of his individualistic ambition and self-reliance but with the modern hero surpassing him and all other ancient heroes. During the personal rule of Louis XIV, comparisons with the ancients became redundant, not only because of the level of adulation accorded to Louis but because of a loss of faith in the heroic potential of the ordinary mortal." .

Resistance to deep discounting spelled doom for Brentano’s, particularly when Barnes and Noble became a competitor in the 1980s. Over many decades, Brentano’s experimented successfully with innovative retailing techniques, including bookstores on ocean liners plying Atlantic routes, serving upscale, multi-lingual, international readers. The on-land bookstore chain, in several cities, peaked at 28 stores in the 1980s and was known for its well read, impeccably dressed, courteous staff, setting a model of effective handselling.

As a lingua franca spread extensively in the Canton trade, the so-called “jargon” (a pidgin form of patois) played an essential role as communication tool between Chinese and foreign traders. However, in the eyes of missionaries in early 19th century China, the normal Sino-foreign contact process was interrupted and distorted by both parties’ overusing of the jargon. In this regard, early Protestant missionaries’ support of Chinese language study reveals an initial effort to break through the “jargon” barrier." .

In the European context, Homer’s Odyssey constitutes the earliest representative masterpiece, followed by countless variations and modifications of the genre in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish literary practice over the centuries, including the realm of music as for example Schubert’s Winterreise and in more recent times the film as Wim Wender’s memorable depictions of the wasteland of capitalism in the American West. Travels in mysterious uncharted terri- tory as powerful metaphors of self-exploration also form an integral part of Australian literary consciousness (e.g. Patrick White’s Voss). Chinese literature also has a long and rich tradition of travel literature with its origins dating back well before its Western counterparts. The travel-motif as determining structural and thematic feature appears in numerous variations ranging from flying shamans, journeys in search of paradise or immortality, dangerous sea-journeys as for example Tang Ao’s miraculous adventures reminiscent of Gulliver’s travels, the life of the vagrant monks and robbers in popular literary works, the journeys of scholars to India in search of the Buddhist Scriptures, Kang Youwei’s utopian journeys to heaven, Mao Zedong’s Long March and his ritualistic crossing of the Yangtze in 1956 and 1966 and symbolic journeys in contemporary Chinese literature. The paper will focus specifically on exemplary works of Chinese literature and identify hallmarks of the genre." .

Chargaff was born in Chernivtsi (Austria-Hungary, now Ukraine) but during the First World War his family was forced to move to Vienna. After graduating from the University of Vienna, Chargaff worked in Berlin, where he studied bacterial lipids. Due to Nazis coming to power in Germany, Chargaff moved to Paris and later (1935) emigrated to the USA and obtained a position at the Columbia University, where he initially invastigated the role of phospholipids in blood clotting. In year 1944, applying novel methods Chargaff initiated intensive investigation of the chemical composition of nucleic acids from taxonomically distant species and established two rules, which were later named after him. The first Chargaff's rule provided a significant support to Watson and Crick in construction of their double helical DNA model. The explosion of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced Chargaff to think about the moral responsibility of researchers and science to mankind. He began to raise these issues in the press and manifested himself as a talented journalist, who criticized the bureaucratization of science and its transformation into a way of earning money. Despite decades of life in America, spiritually Erwin Chargaff always remained a European, who never forgot his roots and always remembered his native land." .

The interior of the building conserves abundant samples of Romanesque art, and the tomb in polychromatic stone of the founder, San Pedro de Osma. We have classified those pieces of art that could represent descriptions of movement disorders. In the main façade of the Cathedral, several statues representing prophets can be seen one of them is clearly different to the rest. This statue represents a man with abnormal cervical posture characterized by right rotation, head tilt and elevation of right shoulder. The tomb includes several statues representing fragments of the life of San Pedro de Osma. Some of these figures show movement disorders. First, a woman with a baby in her arms who has marked head tilt to the left. Second a peasant without hands, perhaps amputated, this man has a head tilt to the right. We suggest that in the latter case ergotism can explain both manifestations: peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation, and cervical dystonia. Finally, a statue of polychromatic wood represents a priest with stooped posture, half open mouth, staring expression and a very notorious anterocollis. The author probably depicted a man with parkinsonism." .

The question of what mature adults recall as having been significant messages in their childhood about dealing with racism has been ignored, and so has the question of what the adult impact might be of childhood racial socialization. To explore these issues, we examined the autobiographies of 41 African Americans that included material on the parenting they received to deal with racism. Many of the lessons the autobiographers wrote about learning can be classified in three broad themes—be aware of and alert to white racism, get a good education, and have a strong racial identity. As evidence of the usefulness in adulthood of childhood racial socialization, some autobiographers wrote about how important certain socialization experiences were to them in adulthood. This paper adds to the literature on African American racial socialization by showing the durability of some memories of childhood racial socialization and also showing that there can be an impact in adulthood of childhood racial socialization." .

A rhythmic oscillation in sensitivity to the time that light terminates darkness regulates the level of flowering. The period length of this oscillation is close to 30 hours, peaks of the rhythm occurring at about 13, 43 and 73 h of darkness. Phasing of the rhythm by 6-, 12- and 18-h photoperiods was studied by exposing plants to a given photoperiod at different phases of the free-running oscillation in darkness. The shift in phase of the rhythm was then determined by varying the length of the dark period following the photoperiod; this dark period was terminated by continuous light. With a 6-h photoperiod the timing of both the light-on and light-off signals is shown to control rhythm phasing. However, when the photoperiod is increased to 12 or 18 h, only the light-off signal determines phasing of the rhythm. In prolonged periods of irradiation-12 to 62 h light—a “durational” response to light overrides any interaction between the timing of the light period and the position of the oscillation at which light is administered. Such prolonged periods of irradiation apparently suspend or otherwise interact with the rhythm so that, in a following dark period, it is reinitiated at a fixed phase relative to the time of the light-off signal to give a peak of the rhythm 13 h after the dusk signal. In daily photoperiodic cycles rhythm phasing by a 6-h photocycle was also estimated by progressively increasing the number of cycles given prior to a single dark period of varied duration. In confirmation of Bünning's (1936) hypothesis, calculated and observed phasing of the rhythm controlling flowering in c. rubrum accounts for the photoperiodic response of this species. Evidence is also discussed which indicates that the timing of disappearance of phytochrome Pfr may limit flowering over the early hours of darkness." .

Often this intuition is formulated as the replacement of linguistic approaches by statistical approaches. On closer inspection, however, this position cannot be defended. An analysis of Rosetta, concentrating on the different levels of discussion and of underlying assumptions, shows that the choice of knowledge from linguistic theories or information theory and corpora is by itself not a decisive issue. More important is the question of how the problem to be solved by an MT system is defined. An analysis of the decisions underlying Verbmobil, resulting in a list corresponding point by point to the one for Rosetta, shows how far-reaching the new approach to defining the problem of MT is. As it is shown that these systems are representative of the work in MT as it was done ten years ago and today, it can reasonably be argued that a revolution in MT has taken place, though not in exactly the way it is often believed." .

We aimed to investigate whether gastric H. pylori infection is associated with colorectal polyps in African Americans. MethodsMedical records of African Americans, 40 years and older (n = 1256) who underwent bidirectional gastrointestinal endoscopy on the same day were reviewed. H. pylori status was assessed by immunohistochemistry on gastric specimens. Colorectal polyps were confirmed by histological examination of colorectal biopsies. A subset of serum samples from healthy and polyp-bearing patients (n = 163) were analyzed by ELISA for anti-H. pylori and anti-CagA antibodies. The crude and adjusted effect of H. pylori on the risk of colorectal adenoma and polyp were computed by logistic regression models. ResultsThe prevalence of colorectal polyps and adenomas were 456 (36%) and 300 (24%) respectively. Colorectal polyps were more prevalent in gastric H. pylori infected than non-infected subjects [43% vs. 34%; Odds Ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.5 (1.2-1.9), P = 0.001]. Patients with H. pylori-associated chronic active gastritis were at high risk to have adenomas [Unadjusted OR (95% CI): 1.3 (1.0-1.8); P = 0.04]. There was no difference in histopathology, size, or location of polyps with respect to H. pylori status. Gastric H. pylori infection, age, male gender and high risk clinical presentations were independent risk factors for colorectal polyps. Serological testing also revealed a higher prevalence of H. pylori and its toxin Cag-A in polyp patients vs. non polyp patients’ sera, although in a non-statistically significant manner. ConclusionsThis study showed that current gastric H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps in African Americans. Patients with H. pylori induced gastritis may benefit from early screening colonoscopy as a preventative measure for colorectal cancer." .

In addition to such losses of life, widespread damage may occur to buildings, bridges, communication networks and arable land. A review of the causal mechanisms of lahars, flow behaviour and protective measures, with selected case histories, is therefore appropriate to an understanding of this major geological hazard. The potentially most destructive lahars are those involving sudden release of very large quantities of water from crater lakes or from subglacial lakes. The Icelandic jökulhlaups, although not strictly lahars, give some idea of the huge discharges of water that can be released — ephemeral maximum discharge rates have been estimated up to 100,000 m3/sec, or temporarily equivalent to the flow of the River Amazon. Other potentially destructive lahars are those resulting from pyroclastic flows becoming admixed with running or ponded waters. Of more common but less devastating occurrence are lahars generated by heavy rainfall on the slopes of volcanoes, more particularly on recently ejected pyroclastics. Historical lahar disasters of this type occur most frequently in tropical regions. Other initiating mechanisms include melting of snow and ice directly accompanying eruptions, earthquake triggered collapse, phreatic explosions and directed blasts. Historical lahars generated by these mechanisms have not been responsible for any considerable loss of life, with the exception of the Shimbara Catastrophe in Japan where a lahar entered the sea producing tsunamis. Upon initiation of a lahar, mud, sand and gravel combine with available water to form a high bulk density (>1,400 kg/m3) flow. In some lahars the flow behaviour may approximate to a Newtonian liquid, whilst in others a high concentration Non-Newtonian liquid is formed with the capability of transporting very large clasts which may each weigh over 200 tonnes. The formation of a laminar boundary layer at the base of the flow is responsible for a low friction factor that enables some lahars to travel very large distances (>100 km). It also explains how lahar deposits often overlie completely undisturbed yet easliy erodible materials. This boundary layer can often be identified in many lahar deposits by a fine-grained layer at the base. The continuous phase of such lahars exhibits strength which retards the sinking of boulders and is responsible for the unsupported framework and poor sorting of lahar deposits. Protective measures against loss of life and damage to property are discussed with particular reference to case histories in Indonesia and New Zealand. Indonesian measures have included siphoning water from the crater lake of Mt. Kelut, effective warning systems, and preparation of maps showing regions that may be destroyed by lahars. In New Zealand, two principal centres of Post-glacial lahar activity are Mt. Ruapehu and Mt. Egmont. Since 1861 A.D. eight lahar episodes have been generated from the crater-lake on Mt. Ruapehu, the 1953 lahar being responsible for the ”Tangiwai Disaster”, when 151 persons were killed. Existing and future protective measures against Mt. Ruapehu lahars are discussed. Mt. Egmont has a long record of Post-glacial lahar activity. The causal mechanism of some Egmont lahars has been heavy rains, but the existence of a former crater lake in the summit area cannot be discounted. Based on detailed geological, pedological and botanical investigations a geological hazards map of the Mt. Egmont region has been prepared." .

In almost every hour of our psychotherapeutic or psychoanalytic work we meet this hope for magical transformation that our patients set in various objects in the outside: in drugs, or our presence, or in the symbiotic union with others, in money, in gambling, television, success, food and especially also in sexual gratification or religious ritual. Such magical transformation is contrasted by what George Eliot called “tragic transformation.” The term refers to a process of profound inner change brought about by suffering, i.e., trauma, through massive inner conflict, through insight and through action or active work, in behalf of somebody else, or in the service of a great cause. In the case described in detail, the magical transformation occurs with the establishment of several versions of double reality and double identity, as a way of dealing with extreme traumatization (killing of the mother by the father, the probable participation of the latter in the Holocaust, severe physical abuse). In the psychoanalysis, particular attention was being paid to conflicts within the superego. The gradual shift during therapy as a form of tragic transformation is being described." .

This is apparent in the reading of Rousseau's published works - where his religious instincts especially, separate him from the radical wing of the French Enlightenment. There is an enormous distance between his “Profession du vicaire savoyard”and Diderot's Pensées philosophiques. It is in his great correspondence, however, that one may see just how Rousseau differed from his colleagues in the struggle against religious and political obscurantism. In his letters he discourses brilliantly on basic metaphysical questions and proposes intuition over reason as a more serious intellectual modality. Beyond even those philosophes such as Voltaire, who embraced a kind of vapid deism, Rousseau uses his correspondence to endorse a mystical conception of the universe in which emotion, imagination and feeling are inextricably bound up. In his survey of contemporary philosophical ideas Rousseau expresses as much scorn for intolerant religious dogma as he does for the extreme expressions of atheism. There are many letters in which he argues against the materialist interpretation of matter and demands of the atheist school convincing intellectual proofs for their theses. In the correspondence Rousseau has a great deal to say about his own conception of God, immortality and the soul. His eschatology is, of course, different from the conventional Christian one; he cannot or will not accept the idea of eternal damnation. In his discussion of religion in the letters Rousseau ranges far and wide; he considers, interalia, extra terrestrial life, the idea of free will, the purpose of rapture and theodicy. In this last arena, where a just God is seen to permit evil in the world, Rousseau waxes eloquent in trying to solve this age-old theological quandary. He does so by exploring definitions of the word evil and emphasizing the orderly nature of the universe. In this context, Rousseau, a master of the religious dialectic, reduces the problem of evil and death through an astute linguistic approach. Rousseau's final plea, as extracted from his correspondence, is that human beings must recognize the limits of reason as an instrument capable of solving all the metaphysical problems." .

Nucleon-pole contributions in the $J/\\psi\\rightarrow N\\bar{N}\\pi$, $p\\bar{p}\\eta$, $p\\bar{p}\\eta^{\\prime}$ and $p\\bar{p} \\omega$ decays are re-studied. Different contributions due to PS-PS and PS-PV couplings in the $\\pi$-N interaction and the effects of $NN\\pi$ form factors are investigated in the $J/\\psi\\rightarrow N\\bar{N}\\pi$ decay channel. It is found that when the ratio of |F0|/|F M | takes a small value, without considering the $NN\\pi$ form factor, the difference between PS-PS and PS-PV couplings is negligible. However, when the $NN\\pi$ form factor is included, this difference is greatly enlarged. The resultant decay widths are sensitive to the form factors. As a conclusion, the nucleon-pole contribution as a background to the decay width is important in the $J/\\psi\\rightarrow N\\bar{N}\\pi$ decay and must be considered. In the $J/\\psi\\rightarrow N\\bar{N}\\eta$ and $N\\bar{N}\\eta'$ decays, its contribution is smaller by 0.1% with respect to the data. In the $J/\\psi\\rightarrow N\\bar{N}\\omega$ decay, it provides a rather important contribution without considering form factors. But the contribution is suppressed greatly when adding the off-shell form factors. Comparing these results with data will help us to select a proper form factor for such kind of decay." .

The diagnostic parameter, maximal change of breath hydrogen concentration 120 or 150 min after a load of 50 g lactose, showed a bimodal distribution, separating lactose absorbers (n-1537, 85.2%) and lactose malabsorbers (n=268, 14.8%). The distribution of the adult lactase phenotypes was independent of age, sex, and educational status. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms after lactose administration demonstrated the incongruity of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance. In addition to grouping by residdence, the probands were classified according to the birthplaces of their grandparents in order to reconstruct the distribution pattern of the lactase phenotypes prior to World War I, a period of relative population stability. Considerable differences in the frequency of lactose malabsorption were found in regions corresponding to traditional ethnic groups within the German population: northwest Germany 6–9%, west and south 13–14%, southwest 23%, east (including formerly German territories east of rivers Oder and Neisse) 22%. These differences are discussed with reference to population history. The present fairly even distribution of the lactase phenotypes in West Germany is the result of internal migrations at the end of World War II." .

Nearly all stations exhibited warming trends. For each station, the temperature relative to the average value during 1961–1990 was found. The resulting temperature change averaged over the Arctic stations was plotted. For the period 1820–2014, trends were found for the January, July and annual temperatures of 1.0, 0.0 and 0.7 °C per century, respectively. Decadal variations are evident and much of the temperature increase occurred during the 1990s.

To better understand healthcare disparities within African-Americans communities, we characterized anxiety, mood, and substance use disorder prevalence and associated service utilization among public and non-public housing residents. MethodsWe used data from a nationally representative sample of African-Americans recruited as part of the National Survey of American Life. ResultsIn public housing residents, the 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders was 1.8 times higher than in non-public housing residents (P = 0.002), mood disorders was 1.4 times higher (P = 0.189), and substance use disorders was 2.2 times higher (P = 0.031). Public housing remained associated with mental illness after controlling for sociodemographics and chronic illness. Public and non-public housing residents did not differ significantly in mental healthcare utilization, but utilization was low with 16–30% of public housing residents with a 12-month disorder receiving mental health assistance. ConclusionsA relatively high proportion of African-American public housing residents suffered from psychiatric disorders, and few received mental healthcare assistance, indicating that further work is needed to enhance utilization." .

This idea is suggested by the unique architectural landscape of the place. The sacred as the spiritual is concealed and requires specification, as it is embodied in the material through symbols and myths (M. Eliade, R. Otto, G. van der Leeuw). Ambivalence is the fundamental feature of the sacred (R. Caillois and G. Bataille). The notion of Homo Sacer (G. Agamben) is the key to “profanation of non-profanum”. The cultural landscape of Vilnius is presented by such cases as the history of the Great Synagogue, Saint Casimir’s church and other sacred locations in their historical variations and Akropolis case as Sacrum Commercium. The article offers three types of Sacrum border transformation and reveals new indications of the “Sacrum” and “profanum” ambivalence and the mobility of its border." .

Feher, a native of Slovakia, barely escaped Nazism and communism and became a scientist in the USA. The Nazi concentration camps and the communist gulags have become a symbol of the 20th century. This symbol stands here to pose a question: How the two totalitarian systems, fraught with irrationality, may have arisen and thrived in parallel with an unprecedented expansion of science, the paragon of rationalism? The question has become even more urgent in the 21st century. The Ground Zero, an empty spot left after the collapse of the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, has become the symbol of the entrance of humankind into the new millennium. We can do much, but we understand too little about who we are and what we are doing — this is a message that the two symbols convey about the precarious stage of our evolution. The second message concerns the role of artifacts, specifically scientific instruments, in the advancement of science. Human cultural evolution has been steadily progressing, in a form of a ratchet, only because artifacts have been continually evolving. Contrary to the common Popperian wisdom, the demarcation in science may not consist in the amenability to theoretical falsification, but rather in the amenability to instrumental grasping. Scientific instruments have empowered humans for impressive feats of manipulation with Nature and themselves. Knowledge arising in the course of autonomous evolution of artifacts may surpass the horizon of human understanding and grasping. New knowledge may still be power, but no longer the power of humans. We may need a revision of some fundamental ideas of European thought. Our understanding of the human mind may entirely reshape our comprehension of the nature of physical knowledge, and vice versa." .

In such research it has usually been found that particularly Black students and those of Hispanic origin have far lower retention rates than White students and those of Asian origin. In Canada, however, it has only been in recent years that large numbers of non-Whites from primarily British Commonwealth countries have immigrated to Canadian cities. As a result, there has been no investigation of race and student retention in Canadian universities. In this article, attention will focus on the first year voluntary and involuntary withdrawal of students of various racial origins enrolled full-time at York University, Canada's third largest university, located in Toronto. Students who withdraw involuntarily are those who because of low academic standing are debarred from continuing for a second year. Information for the study was obtained through end-of-year surveys carried out in 1993, 1994, and 1995 and from administrative records. In general it was found that differences in overall retention rates for Blacks and students of South Asian, Chinese, ‘other’ non-European, and European origins are small. Moreover, a logistic regression analysis indicated that while racial origin is not a predictor of voluntary withdrawal from university at the end of first year, it has a slight effect on involuntary withdrawal." .

The study of the polyhedra (in Euclidean 3-space) in which faces may be self-intersecting polygons, and distinct faces may intersect in various ways, was quite fashionable about a century ago. The Kepler—Poinsot regular polyhedra, and several of their generalizations, were investigated about that time by Cayley, Wiener, Badoureau, Fedorov, Hess, Pitsch, and others; the accumulated wisdom was presented in Max Brückner's well-known book Vielecke und Vielflache in 1900. Despite the intrinsic interest of the topic, and its relations to various other disciplines, there have been very few additional investigations during the intervening century, except for discussions of uniform polyhedra. In particular, there has been no mention or clarification of the many errors and other shortcomings of Brückner's book. One of our aims is to point out the extent of these inadequacies; they are illustrated by a discussion of isogonal prismatoids, the investigation of which is our main objective. A prismatoid is a polyhedron having all its vertices in two parallel planes. Familiar examples are prisms and antiprisms. A polyhedron P is isogonal if all its vertices form one transitivity class under isometric symmetries of P. Although these restrictions appear very severe, there exist many different kinds of isogonal prismatoids. Some general concepts concerning polyhedra with possible self-intersections are presented, and several classes of isogonal prismatoids are discussed in some detail." .

In general, these changes have been associated with global warming. Here we present a study of thermal growing season (GS) trends in the Greater Baltic Area, northern Europe. Yearly dates for the start, end and length of the GS were computed for 49 stations in the studied area, using daily mean temperature measurements. Trends and tendencies of the GS parameters were analysed within the twentieth century. We also examined GS trends in long records (starting before 1850) from the region. The results show a general increase of the length of the GS of ca one week since 1951 in the area, where the most considerable change has occurred in spring (starting ∼6 days earlier). The largest increases were found at stations adjacent to the Baltic Sea and North Sea, where some Danish stations showed significant increasing trends in the length of the GS of more than 20 days. The only tendency for a shorter GS was found in Archangelsk, north western Russia. The three longest records displayed large inter-annual and decadal variability, with tendencies for increased frequencies of longer growing seasons since the 1950s." .

Overcrowding and poor management by undertrained naive farmers make these birds more susceptible to diseases not known so far in this region. A farmer reported that about a hundred pigeons were unable to feed properly and regurgitate feed. Birds lost body condition gradually, and three among these died. Both alive and dead pigeons were presented to the Veterinary Clinical Complex (VCC) for detailed examination. All these pigeons were found to be cachectic with wasting of breast muscles. On necropsy, no significant gross lesions were recorded in most of the visceral organs, except mottling of the liver. However, in the oral cavity, gray Turkish towel-like lesions were seen at the opening of the pharynx which continued into the larynx and proximal esophagus. Microscopic examination of material scrapped from lesions revealed a large number of budding yeast-like organisms and pseudohyphae, suggestive of Candida spp. Histologically, marked necrosis and sloughing of oral and esophageal mucosal epithelium with the presence of pyogranulomatous inflammation containing a large number of Candida organism were observed.

Daurat, Gérard, and Nivat and independently Gardner, Gronchi, and Zong raised the problem of the reconstruction of lattice-convex sets K from g K . We provide a partial positive answer to this problem by showing that for d=2 and under mild extra assumptions, g K determines K up to translations and reflections. As a complement to the theorem on reconstruction we also extend the known counterexamples (i.e., planar lattice-convex sets which are not reconstructible, up to translations and reflections) to an infinite family of counterexamples." .

Charmonium sum rules are analyzed with the primary goal to obtain the restrictions on the value of the dimension 4 gluon condensate. The moments M n (Q 2 ) of the polarization operator of the vector charm currents are calculated and compared with the experimental data. The three-loop ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}^2$) perturbative corrections, the contribution of the gluon condensate with $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}$ corrections and the contribution of the dimension 6 operator G3 are accounted. It is shown that the sum rules for the moments do not work at Q 2 = 0, where the perturbation series diverges and the G3 contribution is large. The domain in the (n, Q 2 ) plane where the sum rules are legitimate is found. A strong correlation of the values of gluon condensate and $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ charm quark mass is determined. The absolute limits are found to be for the gluon condensate $\\langle ({\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}} /{\\pi}) G^2 \\rangle = 0.009\\pm 0.007{\\mathrm{GeV}}^4$ and for the charm quark mass ${\\bar m}({\\bar m}) = 1.275\\pm 0.015 {\\mathrm{GeV}}$ in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme." .

Given the strong relationships between temperature and grapevine phenology, the book represents a potential source for reconstructing past spring temperatures. However, this document has been little utilized so far, due to high varietal heterogeneity and lingering uncertainty regarding cultivar identity. This research developed an approach to address these difficulties, by means of a single-cultivar-based modeling analysis, associated with a set of alternative hypotheses about cultivar early development for the period to be reconstructed. Each hypothesis allowed the calculation of a different past temperature reconstruction, which was evaluated against contemporary independent observational data. The results showed that all the development stages recorded before 1900 were compatible with a vine type with a very low heat requirement for bud burst. Estimates were derived from a model calibrated on a subset of drawings of unknown cultivars executed between 1875 and 1898. The model based on this data subset was the only one giving a consistent reconstruction of spring temperatures, expressed as accumulated growing degree days going back to 1740. Although some uncertainty still exists regarding the reconstruction, the research shows that the Book of Vinesprouts contains generally consistent information about spring temperatures for a period of over 269 years for this region of Hungary." .

Before World War II, the size of the community investigating this topic was limited. During this period, in particular before 1925, about 90% of the papers were published by H. Rubens and his co-workers in Germany. One or two researchers from the US joined the Rubens group per year from 1890 to the beginning of 1910. During the next year or two, some researchers joined M. Czerny, who is seen as the successor of Rubens. After World War II, far-infrared techniques progressed further in the US, which did not suffer damage during the war. The advanced techniques of far-infrared grating spectroscopy were transferred from the US (R. A. Oetjen) to Japan (H. Yoshinaga). Yoshinaga and his co-workers expanded the techniques by themselves. This paper describes the historical development of far-infrared spectroscopy before Fourier transform spectroscopy became popular around 1970." .

In such settings, the secret is shared among a group of participants that is partitioned into levels. The access structure is then determined by a sequence of threshold requirements: a subset of participants is authorized if it has at least k0 0 members from the highest level, as well as at least k1 > k0 members from the two highest levels and so forth. Such problems may occur in settings where the participants differ in their authority or level of confidence and the presence of higher level participants is imperative to allow the recovery of the common secret. Even though secret sharing in hierarchical groups has been studied extensively in the past, none of the existing solutions addresses the simple setting where, say, a bank transfer should be signed by three employees, at least one of whom must be a department manager. We present a perfect secret sharing scheme for this problem that, unlike most secret sharing schemes that are suitable for hierarchical structures, is ideal. As in Shamir's scheme, the secret is represented as the free coefficient of some polynomial. The novelty of our scheme is the usage of polynomial derivatives in order to generate lesser shares for participants of lower levels. Consequently, our scheme uses Birkhoff interpolation, i.e., the construction of a polynomial according to an unstructured set of point and derivative values. A substantial part of our discussion is dedicated to the question of how to assign identities to the participants from the underlying finite field so that the resulting Birkhoff interpolation problem will be well posed. In addition, we devise an ideal and efficient secret sharing scheme for the closely related hierarchical threshold access structures that were studied by Simmons and Brickell." .

This acanthocephalan was previously described from hedgehogs in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Measurements of specimens from Iran, Bulgaria, Germany, Central Asia, Morocco, and Egypt show considerable variations in the size of the trunk, proboscis, proboscis hooks and receptacle, and eggs. The SEM studies add new perspectives to its morphology. Features observed for the first time include the near terminal position and shape of the female gonopore and orifice, among others. Histopathological studies for this species are reported for the first time.

The concept of “New Literature in Chinese Language” is a best choice to define it, especially in the visual field of world literature. “New Literature in Chinese” contains modern and contemporary literature, together with “literatures in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and overseas Chinese literature”, or “international Chinese literature”. “New Literature in Chinese” enjoys the advantage of furthest surpassing and even overcoming the regulations and restrictions of national plates and political regions, hence the New Literature studies can get rid of the politicized academic prediction and construct new paths in exploring the laws of Chinese aesthetic expressions. Just as the concept “English literature” should be understood as “literature in English” rather than “British literature”, the concept of “New Literature in Chinese Language” is acceptable." .

Twenty countries across the world are represented, mostly European, with a particular emphasis on the United Kingdom. A priority was given to older workers, many of whom were key founders of human genetics in their own countries and areas of work, and over 20 of whom are now no longer living. The interviews also give valuable information on the previous generation of workers, as teachers and mentors of the interviewees, thus extending the coverage of human genetics back to the 1930s or even earlier. A number of prominent themes emerge from the interview series; notably the beginnings of human cytogenetics from the late 1950s, the development of medical genetics research and its clinical applications in the 1960s and 1970s, and more recently the beginnings and rapid growth of human molecular genetics. The interviews provide vivid personal portraits of those involved, and also show the effects of social and political issues, notably those arising from World War 2 and its aftermath, which affected not only the individuals involved but also broader developments in human genetics, such as research related to risks of irradiation. While this series has made a start in the oral history of this important field, extension and further development of the work is urgently needed to give a fuller picture of how human genetics has developed." .

As the most important and popular genre in Chinese literature, modern Chinese novel has been developing under the Western influence, and it has played a vital role in flourishing modern Chinese literature and enlightening modern Chinese intellectuals and the broad reading public. To the author, toward the end of the nineteenth century, Chinese literature was almost “marginalized”. In order to resume its lost grandeur it moved from periphery to centre by identifying itself with Western cultural modernity or modern Western literature. To realize this grand and ambitious aim, translating novel became an important task. In dealing with the Western influence, the author also reperiodizes twentieth-century Chinese literature: modern literature started with the May 4th Movement in 1919 and ended in 1976; since 1976, Chinese literature has been in the contemporary era, which is characterized by more postmodern than modern. In this global context, Chinese fiction writing has become part of world literature and been developing in a pluralistic direction." .

Researchers have attempted to use other metrics, such as Google Books, libcitation, and publisher prestige. However, these approaches lack content-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of users. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic books can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric perspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by multi-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a book’s impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn are crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted to identify review sentiment polarities and aspects’ sentiment values. Lastly, the numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values, star values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the entropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores. The results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our method versus traditional book citations show that, although there are substantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to reflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a promising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at the multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also be a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications." .

Further attacks in 2003 (Jakarta), 2004 (Jakarta), and 2005 (Bali) have turned terrorist attacks into an ever-present reality. MethodsThe authors reviewed medical charts of victims evacuated to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Burns Centre during three suicide attacks involving Bali (2002 and 2005) and the Jakarta Marriott hotel (2003). Problems faced, lessons learnt, and costs incurred are discussed. A burns disaster plan drawing on lessons learnt from these attacks is presented. ResultsThirty-one patients were treated at the SGH Burns Centre in three attacks (2002 Bali attack [n = 15], 2003 Jakarta attack [n = 14], and 2005 Bali attack [n = 2]). For the 2002 Bali attack, median age was 29 years (range 20 to 50 years), median percentage of total burn surface area (TBSA) was 29% (range 5% to 55%), and median abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) was 6 (range 3 to 10). Eight of 15 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. For the 2003 Jakarta attack, median age was 35 years (range 24 to 56 years), median percentage of TBSA was 10% (range 2% to 46%), and median ABSI was 4 (range 3 to 9). A large number of patients had other injuries. Problems faced included manpower issues, lack of bed space, shortage of blood products, and lack of cadaver skin. ConclusionThe changing nature of terror attacks mandates continued vigilance and disaster preparedness. The multidimensional burns patient, complicated by other injuries, is likely to become increasingly common. A burns disaster plan with emphasis on effective command, control, and communication as well as organisation of health care personnel following a 'team concept' will do much to ensure that the sudden onset of a crisis situation at an unexpected time does not overwhelm hospital manpower and resources." .

Sitka was the capital of Alaska, when it was part of the Russian Empire, to which Alaska belonged until 1867, when the American government purchased it. In 1827, the Russian established an observatory on Baranof Island, Sitka Harbor, which made 17-hourly observations, later extended to 19 and thereafter to all hours of the day. When analyzing the data, the 12-day time difference between the Russian (Julian) calendar, at which the observations were made, and ours (Gregorian) has to be considered. The climate of Sitka is maritime, with relative warm winter temperatures—there is no month with a mean temperature below freezing—and moderately warm summer temperatures with 4 months above the 10 °C level and plentiful precipitation all-year long. It is the warmest zone of Alaska. Even though there is a substantial break in observations in the late nineteenth century, these are the only observation, which started so early in the nineteenth century. Systematic US-based observations commenced much later normally in connection with the gold rush, whaling in Northern Alaska, and the fur trade, predominantly along the Yukon River. During the 186 years of observations from 1827 to 2013, the best linear fit gave a temperature increase of 1.56 °C for the whole period or 0.86 °C per century, somewhat lower than expected for the relatively high latitudes. The increase was nonlinear, with several multi-decadal variations. However, when comparing the first normal (1831–1860) to the last normal (1981–2010) and assuming a linear trend, a higher value of 1.06 °C per century was calculated. The discrepancy might be explained by nonlinearity and the fact that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, observations were sporadic. Furthermore, the observed warming is less pronounced than the values found for Interior and especially Arctic Alaska for later time period for which such a comparison was possible (Wendler et al. 2014). Significant correlation values were found with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the North Pacific (NP) Index, El Nino 3.4, and the 18.4 years nodal tide; the latter was previously reported in an excellent investigation by T. Royer (1993)." .

But for a relatively small scale conflict in a rather unknown corner of the world, Kosovo’s crisis of 1998–1999 brought with it a host of complex issues that challenge the international community to this day. As with any issue or case in the area of genocide studies, attention and understanding must first go to the dramatic human suffering inflicted upon one group by another. The macro-level political, legal, and ethical discussion and debates swirling about Kosovo should not and must not obscure the powerful and provocative human element at play. First and foremost, the Kosovo issue revolves around how best to save lives following an explosion of genocidal violence. Simultaneously, however, Kosovo in 1999 exploded with ramifications for the future of state sovereignty, the United Nations, and understanding the causes of genocide, nation building, and humanitarianism in the twenty-first century." .

The emergence of a temporal understanding of nature and the new developmental-history approach, it is thought, permitted the formation of modern biology. This paper questions that historical narrative by closely analysing the concepts of development, history and time set out in Karl Ernst von Baer’s study of the mammalian egg (1827). I show that Baer’s research on embryogenesis aimed not simply to explain temporal changes, but to inscribe the formation of new individual organisms into a continuous, unending organic process. I confront Baer’s views with other explanations of embryogenesis arising in the 1820s and 1830s, especially those of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Jean-Louis Prévost and of Theodor Schwann. By highlighting divergences between these scientists, especially as to their view of the role of gender differences in reproduction, I argue that biology evolved not from a homogeneous concept of developmental history but out of various, even opposing, views and research programmes. Thus, the birth of biology did not imply the end of all natural history’s thought models." .

Firstly, the overpressure histories of all nodes on the walls of a cube with a side-length of 2 m are computed under a reference-charge explosion at each node of its inner space using the LS-DYNA software, and then are collected to form a reference database. Next, with the thought of the isoparametric finite element, an interpolating algorithm is established to calculate the overpressure history of an optional point on the walls induced by an explosion at any position inside this cubic space. Then, some ratio factors of peak values and durations of overpressure on the walls, reflecting changes in the charge weight and side-length of a cuboid, are derived and applied subsequently, together with their contributing coefficients, to make some modifications to the above algorithm, which achieves an approximate simulation to the overpressure histories on the walls under the optional charge weight and cuboid size. Finally, example results verify the rapidity and validity of this method, and provide feasible ranges of the charge weight and cuboid size according to the current computing condition." .

Furthermore, we investigated the transition processes caused by the optimal precursor, and found that these processes could be divided into three stages. In the first stage, a cyclonic eddy is advected to the formation region of the Kuroshio large meander, which enhances the LM path and causes a cyclonic eddy to shed from the Kuroshio mainstream. This process causes the LM path to change into a small meander path. Subsequently, the small meander is maintained for a period because the vorticity advection is balanced by the beta effect in the second stage. In the third stage, the small meander weakens and the straight path ultimately forms. The positive vorticity advecting downstream is responsible for this process. The exploration of the optimal precursor will conduce to improve the prediction of the transition processes from LM path to straight path, and its spatial structure can be used to guide Kuroshio targeted observation studies." .

Karst] and silver fir ( Abies alba Mill) in the Lower Bavarian Forest region in southern Germany. These chronologies were compiled, using both historic and living tree-ring data, with the main aim of developing a dendroclimatic reconstruction for the region covering the last 500 years. Moving window correlation analysis shows that prior to the twentieth century, both species co-vary in a similar way (1480–1899 mean r =0.66). There is no significant correlation between the species chronologies since ca. 1930, which partly reflects anomalous growth trends in the fir chronology since ca. 1960. Multiple regression analysis was utilised to assess the ability of both species chronologies to model March–August precipitation. The precipitation signal of the spruce data was found to be both stronger than the fir data (1872–1930 calibration: r 2=0.45 vs 0.25) and more time stable. After ca. 1930, the fir chronology loses it ability to model March–August precipitation until there is no climate signal at all in the fir data in recent decades. The spruce data also express a later weakening in their climate signal in the mid 1970s. We present compelling evidence indicating that the anomalous trends observed in the fir data, since the mid 1960s, appear to be predominantly related to local SO2 emissions from power plants and refineries. It is also likely that this local anthropogenic forcing is the cause of the weakening of the climate signal in the spruce data since the mid 1970s. The conclusions from this study are: (1) The fir tree-ring data cannot be used for traditional dendroclimatic calibration, although prior to the twentieth century the decadal variability in the fir data is very similar to spruce and so these data could be used to extend potential reconstructions in the future; (2) The recent decline and recovery event in the fir data appears to be unique to the twentieth century and is not part of a natural episodic phenomenon; (3) Traditional dendroclimatic calibration of March–August precipitation will be made using solely the spruce ring-width data. However, due to SO2 forcing in recent decades, the calibration period will be shortened to the 1871–1978 period." .

As a result, surface morphology-based nomenclature schemes have been proposed in most languages to aid in the classification and distinction of lava surface types. One of the first to be published was likely the nine-class, Italian-language description-based classification proposed by Mario Gemmellaro in 1858. By far, the most commonly used terms to describe lava surfaces today are not descriptive but, instead, are merely words, specifically the Hawaiian words ‘a‘ā (rough brecciated basalt lava) and pāhoehoe (smooth glassy basalt lava), plus block lava (thick brecciated lavas that are typically more silicic than basalt). ‘A‘ā and pāhoehoe were introduced into the Western geological vocabulary by American geologists working in Hawai‘i during the 1800s. They and other nineteenth century geologists proposed formal lava-type classification schemes for scientific use, and most of them used the Hawaiian words. In 1933, Ruy Finch added the third lava type, block lava, to the classification scheme, with the tripartite system being formalized in 1953 by Gordon Macdonald. More recently, particularly since the 1980s and based largely on studies of lava flow interiors, a number of sub-types and transitional forms of all three major lava types have been defined. This paper reviews the early history of the development of the pāhoehoe, ‘a‘ā, and block lava-naming system and presents a new descriptive classification so as to break out the three parental lava types into their many morphological sub-types." .

A la veille et au lendemain des indépendances, les écrits qui se focalisent sur cette image étaient encore la chasse gardée des hommes. Par conséquent, l\"image de la femme libre, en l\"occurrence de la prostituée dans la littérature africaine pourrait se résumer comme suit : Dans une Afrique encore très conservatrice et dont la littérature est le porte-parole, la femme prostituée décrite de la plume de l\"homme n\"est qu\"une immorale, une débauchée, victime des abus de la civilisation européenne. Dans la réalité tout comme dans la fiction, l\"image de la prostituée est considérée comme négative par rapport à la tradition africaine. En tant que personnage de roman, la femme prostituée est rarement héroïne. Comme pour la ramener à son rang dans sa vie normale de femme, elle joue aussi les seconds rôles dans les œuvres de fiction. Cela ne pouvait être autrement pour une littérature qui se voulait une littérature de réalité, de dénonciation, pas surréaliste, ni futuriste. En fait, si en réalité la prostitution a fait émergence en Afrique avec la colonisation et l\"urbanisation et que la femme, la principale concernée fut contrainte de se livrer au plus vieux métier du monde, la littérature de l\"époque, de tendance anticoloniale et purement de production masculine n\"a pu justifier l\"existence du plus vieux métier du monde de façon objective, sans couvrir d\"invectives les femmes qui s\"y résignent. L\"image de la prostitution comme acte immoral et déboires exclusifs de la femme se projette intégralement sur la littérature, qui ce faisant garde ses caractéristiques de littérature de témoignages. Mais au regard accusateur porté par la société sur la femme qui décide choisir son mode de vie, s\"oppose graduellement la parole des femmes écrivains qui se fait de plus en plus agressive, revendicatrice sur un mode d\"autoreprésentation plus élaboré. C\"est cet effort de réhabilitation de l\"image de la femme victime des contraintes sociales par les femmes écrivains qu\"il nous plairait d\"examiner dans cet article." .

Also, setting, was very sporadic with respect to time. Several hypotheses were tested to explain such observations. Individual cultch shells were not differentially attractive to setting larvae. However, cultch shells containing 24-hour-old spat or 2-month-old spat attracted more set than unspatted control shells in the same culture and stimulated more set than that received in separate control cultures. Undersides of bottom-most layers of shells attracted more set than the higher layers of shells in laboratory cultures. Two-month-old spat, inside larval-proof plankton mesh bags, stimulated set on shells outside the bags indicating that a water-borne pheromone may be the stimulating agent. These findings confirm the contention of Crisp (1967) that gregarious setting occurs inC. virginica." .

The period under consideration is the twelve years from 1961 through 1972 for the two month interval July-August, which is the main season of the occurrence of the Etesian winds over the eastern Greek seas having their existing in the combination of the Balkans high pressure and the permanent low pressure system over the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The synoptic evolution of the above mentioned charts proved that the mobile anticyclones or the wedges of the Greek area, seemingly form one common system with the Azores' anticyclone but their generating factors are different from these of the Azores' permanent anticyclone which implies that the term “extension” should not be used." .

This paper attempts to trace his meteoric rise from Junior Researcher in 1969 to his appointment in 1986 as the Director General of the Chamber of Mines Research Organisation and concurrently Research Advisor to the Chamber of Mines of South Africa. In addition, during the period 1988 until his return to Austria in 1993, Professor Wagner was the Senior General Manager (Operations) of the Chamber of Mines and played a pivotal role in reshaping the Chamber and its subsidiary companies. Twenty years after his departure from South Africa Professor Wagner is still remembered for his clarity of thought in identifying industry problems, his foresight in predicting how those issues would impact the future and in the specification of the research and remedial actions necessary to address the problems. These attributes are illustrated by looking at the South African mining industry Professor Wagner served from 1969 to 1993 (the past), what has happened to that industry in the intervening years and, in particular, its present state. Finally some thoughts are included on what drives the future of the industry.

La domanda – cui all'inizio anche l'autore pare non trovare risposta – è riportata a problemi attuali (come quello della ex-Jugoslavia, dove serbi, croati e sloveni si sono fatti la guerra tra loro dimenticando il loro passato nazionalismo jugoslavo dovuto al nemico comune, l'Italia, o quello del fondamentalismo islamico, cui si accenna). L'autore, poi, dopo una lunga discussione delle teorie sulla materia, giunge alla seguente conclusione: il nemico comune altro non è che lo specchio delle nostre paure ed è necessario combatterlo prima che diventi pericoloso per noi stessi e per gli altri, ed anche per questo non è necessario andarlo a cercare o crearlo.

Such behavior seems to agree with the periodic rate change I observed in a previous paper. The present work improves that study by extending the data set up to the end of 2016, adopting the latest version of the historical seismic catalog of Italy, and introducing Schuster spectrum analysis for the detection of the oscillatory period and the assessment of its statistical significance. Applied to the declustered catalog of M w ≥ 6 earthquakes that occurred between 1600 and 2016, the analysis individuates a marked periodicity of 46 years, which is recognized above the 95% confidence level. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the oscillatory behavior is stable in respect of random errors on magnitude estimation. A parametric oscillatory model for the annual rate of seismicity is estimated by likelihood maximization under the hypothesis of inhomogeneous Poisson point process. According to the Akaike Information Criterion, such model outperforms the simpler homogeneous one with constant annual rate. A further element emerges form the analysis: so far, despite recent earthquakes, the Italian seismicity is still within a long-term decreasing trend established since the first half of the twentieth century." .

Preparation for bias and pride development did not significantly predict academic achievement. However, gender moderated the association between preparation for bias and academic achievement. Greater frequency of preparation for bias messages delivered to boys increased GPAs. However, as the frequency of preparation for bias messages delivered to girls increased, GPA decreased.

In the Orange River area the formations of the Gariep Group are unconformably or pseudo-conformably overlain by the Nama System. In central and northern South West Africa a similar relationship is exhibited by the Nosib Group and overlying Damara System. Pronounced similarities between the sedimentation and deformational history of both Nosib and Gariep indicate a probable correlation of the two groups and this result is also supported by radiometric ages. It follows that Damara and Nama are most likely either completely or partly coeval. The latter may represent a shelf facies of the former geosynclinal succession. The Gariep and Nosib deformation apparently started with the subsidence of their respective troughs and may have lasted from approximately 850 m. y. to 600 m. y. This tectonic event is older than the Damara Orogeny (550 to 450 m. y.) and may be time-equivalent to the Katanga Episode. Two late-Precambrian glaciations were widespread in South West Africa and their sedimentary deposits are important for the correlation of Gariep/Nama with Nosib/Damara." .

The analysis, applied to isolated auroral substorm onsets (inferred from rapid variations in the AE-index) and to the bulk of the AE data, indicates that the maximum in auroral activity is largely confined to 09–18 UT, with a distinct minimum at 03–06 UT. The diurnal effect was clearly present throughout all seasons in the first cycle but was mainly limited to northern winter in the second cycle. Severe storms (AE > 1000 nT) tended to occur between 9–18 UT irrespective of the seasons whereas all larger magnetic disturbances (AE > 500 nT) tended to occur in this time interval mostly in winter. On the whole the diurnal trend was strong in winter, intermediate at equinox and weak in summer. The implication of this study is that Eastern Siberia, Japan and Australia are mostly at night, during the period of maximum auroral activity whereas Europe and Eastern America are then mostly at daytime. The minimum of auroral activity coincides with near-midnight conditions in Eastern America. It appears that the diurnal UT distribution in the AE-index reflects a diurnal change between interplanetary magnetic field orientation and the Earth’s magnetic dipole inclination." .

And this type of argument shows a spotty history of recognition in logic texts and manuals over the centuries. But how it got into the modern logic textbooks as a fallacy remains somewhat obscure.

Eel hepatocytes maintain membrane integrity and energy charge during a 2 h incubation period and are considered a viable preparation for studying fish liver metabolism. Incubating eel hepatocytes with 10 mM substrates, the following results were obtained: glycerol, alanine and lactate, in that order, were effective gluconeogenic substrates; these three substrates reduced glucose release from glycogen stores, while aspartate had no such effect; lactate, alanine and aspartate led to high rates of glycerol production, with subsequent incorporation into lipid; incorporation into glycogen was low from all substrates; and, alanine oxidation was seven times higher than that observed with other substrates. When eel hepatocytes were incubated with low or physiological substrate concentrations gluconeogenic rates from lactate were twice those from alanine; rates from aspartate were very low. Glucagon stimulated lactate gluconeogenesis, but not amino acid gluconeogenesis, and had no significant effect on glycogenolysis. Cortisol increased gluconeogenic rates from 1 mM lactate. Thus, in the presence of adequate substrate, eel liver gluconeogenesis is preferentially stimulated relative to glycogenolysis to produce plasma glucose. These data support three important roles for gluconeogenesis: the recycling of muscle lactate, the synthesis of glucose from dietary amino acids to supplement glucose levels, and the production of glycerol for lipogenesis." .

Relatively few ethnic minorities in Europe have been recognized as indigenous. A consequence of globalization is that knowledge of rights gained by indigenous groups in different parts of the world has led to explicit or implicit claims for indigenous status by organized groups within some European ethnic or regional minorities. An example from the Northern Isles of Scotland is the Shetland and Orkney Udal Law group (SOUL), which includes on its website links to legal decisions supporting indigenous rights in Canada and Australia. SOUL argues for greater local autonomy regarding the use of resources. The islands were inhabited by Norse settlers from Scandinavia from the 9th century AD and came under Scottish rule in the 1460s. Certain elements of Norse law related to land tenure, in particular foreshore rights, have survived to the present as a form of customary law referred to as udal law. Udal law has been the subject of court cases in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It has been presented as symbolizing Orkney and Shetland identity, and brought into public debates on matters of concern to Orcadians and Shetlanders. Udal law is invoked to support a claim for local control over the surrounding sea and seabed, important for fishing, salmon-farming and oil exploitation. These issues are examined in relation to definitions of indigenous peoples applied by the United Nations, International Labour Organisation, and World Bank." .

In the early 19th century the newly constructed roles of the child became entrenched in the ideology of colonial imperialism. During the Irish Literary Revival, the drama as a key literary genre provided a decidedly anti-imperial response to and counteracting of the colonial stereotypes which described the Irish as feminine, child-like and uncivilized, by redirecting the force of these categories. In several plays of the period the character still growing tends to be implicated in the project of highlighting the difference between the paralytic world of the moment and the potential for change, and is shown as capable of envisaging and anticipating transformation. After the 1920s, in post-independence and post-colonial times the dramatized child-subject becomes related to the sense of frustration and impasse generated by the persistence of the old narratives, troping the experience of communal and individual crisis, loss, the difficulty or even impossibility to change certain patterns, prejudices and attitudes. It is only in the late 1980s that this trend seems to change, and the child in drama evokes the transcendence of past traumas, looking back to the Irish theatre of the early 1900s. The conclusion of the paper points to the recent emerging of yet another group of contemporary Irish plays with teenagers as protagonists, which junior characters, along with their counterparts in world-drama, perform a new aspect of the cultural and anthropological self-definition of the postmodern individual." .

It enables a re-evaluation of the procedures of the pioneers of mathematical analysis. Their procedures have been often viewed through the lens of the success of the Weierstrassian foundations. We propose a view without passing through the lens, by means of proxies for such procedures in the modern theory of infinitesimals. The real accomplishments of calculus and analysis had been based primarily on the elaboration of novel techniques for solving problems rather than a quest for ultimate foundations. It may be hopeless to interpret historical foundations in terms of a punctiform continuum, but arguably it is possible to interpret historical techniques and procedures in terms of modern ones. Our proposed formalisations do not mean that Fermat, Gregory, Leibniz, Euler, and Cauchy were pre-Robinsonians, but rather indicate that Robinson’s framework is more helpful in understanding their procedures than a Weierstrassian framework." .

In this series, 104 with retained biliary tract stones were encountered, and complete removal of stones was successfully carried out in 101, using postoperative choledochoscopy. Any failures of removal of retained biliary tract stones were attributed to improper insertion of the T-tube. The T-tube, of at least 18 French calibers should be inserted into the common bile duct at a right angle so as to obviate a tortuous sinus tract. The follow-up study in cases of complete extraction of the retained biliary tract stones showed that this approach is most effective. Recurrent stone with a silk nidus was found in one patient in whom postoperative choledochoscopy had been performed one year previously. Reoperation was carried out in this particular case. All other patients have remained asymptomatic. Finally, we advise routine use of postoperative choledochoscopy as an adjunct to the T-tube cholangiography, in order to prevent the possibility of retained biliary tract stones." .

Many of these categories are shared with other fields of thought, including science, literature, and common sense, but in history are understood in a unique way. This paper first examines the general notion of categories of historical understanding, then scrutinises some of the specific categories suggested by classic authors on the philosophy of history such as Dilthey and Collingwood. More recent works by Goldstein, Oakeshott, Bevir, and Tucker are treated as contributions to the same discussion. It concludes that the various categories these writers have proposed are neither trivial nor incompatible and that when collated they do indeed compose a framework capable of characterising historical thought." .

Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, as is ibogaine, the main alkaloid of a shrub used in Central Africa to induce NDEs in a religious context. Ibogaine can also elicit different experiences when used in a hallucinatory context or in initiatic rituals, where a superficial state of coma is induced. These data raise the question of whether the chemically-induced NDE-like experience is related to the use of a particular kind of substance or to a genuine comatose state." .

Rectal temperature of Creole bulls (overall mean: 38.8‡C) remains unaffected by black globe temperature (TG), while, for Li × Cr bulls, it is well related to TG, reaching 39.5‡C when TG=39‡C; at this moment, Li × Cr respiratory rhythm reaches 100 breaths/min, compared with only 70 for Creole animals. The “shade” mean levels of these two parameters for each genotype are consistently the same (38.7‡C and 39 breaths/min). Under full sunshine, mean sweat rate is almost the same for the 2 genotypes; under shelter, the crossbred bulls sweat more than the Creole bulls, both shade means being significantly lower than means in the “sun”. Probably, when shaded, the Li × Cr animals must sweat more to balance a greater heat production, but their maximum sweat ability is not very different than the one of Creole bulls." .

Only one intrusion, the Kukkola intrusion, is encountered in Sweden whereas in Finland, their number exceeds twenty. These are concentrated principally in two areas, the dicontinuous Tornio-Närdnkävaara intrusion belt which crosses northern Finland and the Koitelainen intrusion with its satellites located in central Finnish Lapland. The intrusions in the Soviet Union are concentrated in three areas: (i) on the Kola Peninsula, (ii) in the Paanajärvi area close to the Finnish border and (iii) northeast of Lake Onega. Examples of all the ore types characteristic of layered intrusions have been found in these intrusions. Chromitite layers are encountered in the Kukkola/Tornio, Kemi, Penikat, Koitelainen and Burakovsky intrusions, but only one, the Kemi chromitite, has so far been mined. The Portimo, Koillismaa, Monchegorsk and Fedorova intrusions are characterized by PGE-bearing Cu-Ni-deposits in their marginal series. Mineralized zones enriched in PGE are also encountered in the layered series. Those in the Penikat intrusion and in the Portimo intrusions are the most remarkable and the best known to date. Vanadium-bearing Fe-Ti-oxide layers are encountered in several intrusions, but only one, the Mustavaara deposit, is presently being exploited. Two types of parental magma have tentatively been proposed for these intrusions. The first type is represented by a magma which was relatively rich in magnesium and chromium and was as a whole boninitic in composition, whereas the plagioclase-rich intrusions and megacyclic units are interpreted as having crystallized from a magma which was greatly depleted in these elements, especially Cr, and had melted crustal material incorporated in it. The emplacement of the early Proterozoic layered intrusions in Fennoscandia was part of the world-wide igneous activity indicated by other layered intrusions and mafic dyke swarms of similar age in other ancient cratons, i.e. the Jimberlana intrusion in Australia, the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe, the Scouric picrite suite in Scotland, the Hearst-Matachewan dyke swarm, Copper Cliff Formation and East Bull Lake intrusion in Ontario, Canada, and the Vestfold Hills and Napier Complex dyke swarms in Antarctica. This almost contemporaneous occurrence in different parts of the world would suggest a more intimate relationship between the Fennoscandian Shield, northwest Scotland, Canadian Shield, Yilgarn Block, Zimbabwe Craton and East Antarctic Shield at the beginning of the Proterozoic than at present." .

At different points in the plot's development, however, the main characters – Isumbras, his wife, who is stolen away from him by a heathen sultan, and the sultan and his cohorts – implicitly or explicitly propose models of religious \"co-existence.\" These models apply in the first instance to the conflict between Christianity and Islam. But, because the presentation of the poem's Muslims is so reminiscent of medieval English renderings of Jews and apostate and heretical Christians, these models may be read more generally as concerning the difficulty of achieving Christian hegemony, a more relevant topic for the English in the age of Lollardy, when Islam was far away. Although these models are rejected in favor of the seeming religious homogeneity of the poem's ending, this paper reads the fact of the proposals as evidence of poets' and scribes' desire to find alternative models for achieving religious peace." .

Examining the relationship between the index and economic growth, we observe an inverted U-shape in the case of the Globe and Middle East and Africa, an N-shape for Europe while such a relationship is not found for Asia and Oceania. The turning points are high in all cases but their values are within the sample. The most important explanatory variable seems to be the life expectancy with a very high positive effect in all cases. The population density affects negatively the Environmental Performance Index but with a very low magnitude. Concerning the cultural dimensions, masculinity and power distance proved to be statistically insignificant with individualism and uncertainty avoidance affecting negatively Middle East and Africa and Europe, respectively, and positively Asia and Oceania; long-term orientation and indulgence affect negatively Asia and Oceania, with the latter affecting negatively also the Globe." .

Here, we report on a third, apparently independent and even more northerly German colonization area of Aedes j. japonicus in southern Lower Saxony and northeastern North Rhine-Westphalia, which was discovered in spring 2013. In a snapshot study, intended to determine the presence or absence of Aedes j. japonicus in an area close to Hanover, the capital of the northern German federal state of Lower Saxony, where a specimen had been collected in late 2012, central water basins of cemeteries were checked for pre-imaginal mosquito stages at the beginning of the mosquito season 2013. Almost 20 % of the inspected cemeteries were found positive (25 out of 129), with many of them being located in towns and villages close to the motorways A2 and A7. Being of Far Eastern origin, the Asian bush mosquito is well adapted to moderate climates and appears to be further expanding its distribution area in Central Europe. As it is a proven laboratory vector of several mosquito-borne disease agents, its present and future distribution areas should be carefully monitored." .

The aim of this study is to describe several aspects of the twinning rate in a fertile population. The overall rate of twinning was 0.90%:103 twins among all 11492 maternities. The rate peaked at the 7th birth order and at the maternal age of 40 years and over. Until the mid 19th century when the Hutterites lived in Russia, the twinning rate was higher (1.5%), and it decreased during the migration period in the second half of the 19th century (0.7%). After the group had settled in the USA and Canada, the population maintained a twinning rate of 1.0% until 1965. After 1965 the rate decreased to 0.7%, partly due to a decline in fertility among women aged 30 years and over. There was a significant seasonal variation: the twinning rate decreased to 0.5% in May–July compared to 1.2% for the other three seasons during the years up to 1965 (P<0.01), while more recent mothers did not show such a seasonal variation. The incidence of twin births in this population seems to have been influenced by environmental factors, which would change their effect seasonally and secularly." .

The advantages of the state-of-the-art valves include a “book-like” opening system, presence of spring elements, durability, and convenience in servicing. Slide valves should be compatible with the drive mechanism (hydraulic stations are recommended for this purpose) and a set of state-of-the-art refractories." .

Mycoplasma viruses (phages) may also be responsible for modifying the pathogenic power of mycoplasmas, at least for plants and insects. In addition, several mycoplasmas are able to act as undesirable cell culture contaminants that induce erroneous results in both applied and general virology. These problems are examined within a historical context." .

News of ether first reached Newfoundland in February 1847 with a report from England of Robert Liston’s amputation of a leg on December 21, 1846. Ether was first used in St. John’s some days before July 30, 1847, for an operation to amputate both legs, the surgeon being Edward Keilley. Chloroform was used in St. John’s a few days before May 4, 1848 by Samuel Carson in an obstetrical case, and on May 10, 1848 it was used during the amputation of a leg by Edward Keilley. Also discussed are some other items of anaesthetic interest which occurred during the years following until the appointment of the first (albeit part-time) anaesthetist in St. John’s in 1912." .

Design: Cross-sectional study, based on the review of military census files. Setting: Military selection centre of Lisbon. Subjects and methods: In Portugal, military service is obligatory and medical inspections are carried out every year on males at the age of twenty. For study purposes, representative samples were taken from the young male population undergoing inspection for the Armed Forces on a five year basis, between 1960 and 1990 in the region of Lisbon. Weight and height were evaluated by a trained team, using standard measurement instruments and procedures. Results: A progressive and significant increase in weight, height and BMI of the young male population was found between 1960 and 1990. For certain variables the increase was also statistically significant within a five-year period, as it was the case for height between 1965–1980 and for weight between 1985–1990. The increase in BMI experienced some minor fluctuation along the reference period, however, it was statistically significant between 1985–1990. The increase in weight and in BMI was greater in the highest percentiles and particularly noticeable between 1985 and 1990. The percentage of young males with BMI over 25 kg/m2 was of 8.1% in 1960 and of 18.0% in 1990, while those having a BMI over 27 kg/m2 varied between 3.6% and 6.4% in the same period, respectively. The percentage of young adult males with BMI higher than 25 kg/m2 doubled between 1960 and 1990." .

MethodsMedical history, physical examination, radiographic and laboratory tests were obtained from three Chinese clinically diagnosed SEDC patients. PCR technique and direct nucleotide sequencing were conducted to identify mutations in the COL2A1 gene. The protein functions of all the missense mutations were predicted by SIFT and Polyphen-2. Contrast analysis of Chinese SEDC cases were performed through the literature retrieval of the HGMD BIOBASE and PubMed database. ResultsThree novel heterozygous missense mutations (Gly537Asp, Gly909Ser, and Gly1149Val) in the COL2A1 gene were detected in this study. Literature review discovered a total of 15 COL2A1 mutations in Chinese SEDC patients. We analyzed the clinical features, mutation characteristics and explored the genotype-phenotype correlation of these Chinese SEDC cases. ConclusionsOur study contributed to the further expansion of the COL2A1 mutation spectrum and provided more information concerning SEDC in the Chinese population through literature review." .

Varying the concentration of sucrose or IAA in the culture medium had no effect on the size of the quiescent centre in the apical meristem of these roots. It is concluded that the existence of a quiescent centre in angiosperm roots is not due to carbohydrate starvation or to the super-abundance, or lack of, IAA." .

It was encountered exclusively in African and American Blacks, and in North Africans. We assumed that it diffused from the Benin-Togo area to Northern Africa. We now report two South Italian families with αI/65 HE. The phenotype fully conformed to previous descriptions. The mode of transmission was dominant; however, the manifestations were more pronounced when the common, low expression level αV/41 allele occurred in trans to the αI/65 allele, also conforming to previous records. The mutation underlying αI/65 HE turned out to be, again, the duplication of TTG codon 154 and the associated haplotype was the same as that encountered previously (+-+; XbaI, PvuII, MspI). Thus, the αI/65 allele found in Italy must have been introduced from North Africa across the Sicilian channel and would ultimately have originated from the Benin-Togo area. It would witness the same migratory stream as that followed by the Benin type haemoglobin S allele, which is also present in Southern Italy." .

It is the basis for the consensus approval with the other medical societies and institutions in Germany involved in the guideline process of the new “Urolithiasis Guideline”. The German Working Committee on Stone Disease reviewed critically the current literature in the field of urolithiasis—including the existing German and EAU-Guidelines as well as the Conference Book of the First International Consultation on Stone Disease. As far as possible the references were rated according to the EBM criteria. On this basis the expert group discussed all pathways and statements regarding the management of stone disease. The present review coincides with the consented guideline draft of the German Working Committee on Stone Disease. Occurrence of stone disease in the western world increases seriously. Modern lifestyle, dietary habits and overweight—problems of the affluent societies—emerge to be the important promoters of the “stone-boom” in the new millennium. This even affects children, whose stone prevalence is otherwise significantly less than that of adults. Criteria for the high risk group of stone formers were clearly defined. A diagnostic standard is formulated for the basic and the elaborate metabolic evaluation of a stone patient. Approximately 75% of all stone patients could anticipate stone recurrence with elementary reorientation of their lifestyle and dietary habits, summarized as general metaphylaxis. About 25% of the stone formers require additional pharmacological intervention to normalize their individual biochemical risk, precisely compiled for each stone type as specific metaphylaxis." .

Although it has claimed Taiwan by asserting primordial sovereignty, declaring the island to have been part of China “since ancient times,” the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not always viewed the island as part of China. Although it recognized the independence of Mongolia in 1950, before it came to power as the government of the state the CCP envisioned Mongolia as part of China. Postage stamps issued in territories governed by the CCP before 1949 juxtaposed to stamps issued by the Republic of China government affirm what documents suggest: that China's boundaries have not been immutable and have been highly contested by Chinese political elite. This should prompt readers to view with skepticism categorical claims about China's sovereignty and “territorial integrity.”" .

Because of extensive growth of the tumor, right hemicolectomy was also performed and the alimentary tract was reconstructed in the new Billroth I procedure. Many reports have since indicated that PPPD yields favorable results. The patient characteristics ranged widely, from benign diseases to malignancies, including cancer of the pancreas.

The different approaches and attitudes of the two countries towards immigration can be linked to different historical understandings of nationhood. Canada could not be imagined as a country without its immigrants; immigration is an integral aspect of national identity. Conversely, although Germany has always received immigrants, national identity has historically been conceived in ethnic terms. In this paper, I explore some of the contradictions in Canadian and German immigration debates related to national belonging. For example, Canada’s identity as a settler society has long marginalized Indigenous populations, while in German debate the narratives of ethnically-belonging Germans and newly-arriving migrants openly engage with each other. By exploring these contradictions, I develop a perspective of the dialectic of migration and ethnic belonging that can be applied to both Canada and Germany." .

Drawing upon 70 in-depth interviews with African American men and women, it identifies a dual consciousness that shapes respondents’ understandings of who gets ahead and why. While the majority of respondents believe that African Americans face persistent structural inequality, they also believe that members of their group are responsible for their own outcomes. They emphasize the importance of employing individualistic mobility strategies for advancement. They also draw upon broad definitions of success to support an understanding that everyone can achieve some level of success if they work hard enough. When assessing their own mobility trajectories and the mobility trajectories of others they know, respondents tend to attribute individual-level factors to movement up and down the socioeconomic ladder." .

The presumptive ectoderm (PE) of the early gastrula was transformed into mesoderm within 12 h when transplanted into the upper half of the dorsal marginal zone of the same stage. The self-differentiation capacity and the neural-inducing activity of this newly mesodermized PE (MPE) were examined by both isolation and sandwich cultures. The MPE showed self-differentiation for notochord and muscle in the isolation culture. In the sandwich culture, the MPE made contact with the PE of the successive gastrula stages. The MPE was capable of inducing neural tissues even in the PE of the mid-gastrula, which has high neural competence but loses it within a short period of 6 h. These results show that firstly the mesodermization of the PE is completed within 12 h and secondly both the self-differentiation capacity and the neural-inducing activity are established immediately after the mesodermization of the PE." .

Sapwood-injected Rb was detected in outer heartwood at 10 days after the treatment, and continued increasing at 20 days after. Radial movement of Rb toward heartwood was considered to occur soon after the treatment, and to decline at a certain point of the time after Rb injection ceased. However, Rb continued moving in heartwood probably by diffusion even after the cease of Rb injection. In a series of injection experiment, radial movement of injected Rb is not corresponding to the seasonality of both cambial activity and cytological changes of ray parenchyma accompanied with heartwood formation. From the results on Rb’s behavior, we conclude that accumulation of K and other alkali metals in heartwood of Japanese cedar has two steps, active transport from sapwood to outer heartwood via ray, and diffusion in heartwood, and that these processes proceed independently from both cambial activity and cytological changes of ray parenchyma." .

China has been aware of the problem of acid rain and has been conducting scientific research since the late 1970s. However, little effort has been put into practical countermeasures. In the early 1990s, acid rain was re-evaluated as an international environmental problem. Meanwhile, Japan became concerned about trans-boundary air pollution from China. What is important is that Japan's concern strongly influences China's acid rain policy. In the context of growing international concern for environmental problems, China has taken remarkable steps to control acid rain. In this respect, dealing with acid rain is an issue of national pride for China." .

A longitudinal analysis is pursued of the survival of shebeens, an institution for the provision of liquor, in the areas of Black settlement around Johannesburg. The concepts ‘conservation’ and ‘dissolution’ which derive from the Marxian based literature on petty commodity production afford a theoretical lens for interpreting the survival of the informal sector. Three major phases in the persistence of shebeening in Black Johannesburg are delineated, viz., (1) the era of liqour prohibition extending to 1937, (2) the period 1937–76 when shebeens confront the system of municipal monopoly and a progressive relaxation on liquor controls, and (3) the progressive moves from 1976 towards the official acceptance and legalization of shebeens." .

By seeking to understand crime through the vision implied by the normative paradigm we focus upon too narrow a set of phenomenon: namely the ideological structure of social systems or individual personalities. We would do well to shift our vision to include at the very least the political and economic history of that collection of activities which are generally defined by law as criminal. The historical development and political economy of opium and heroin from its introduction by European capitalists into China and Southeast Asia down to its current place in the political economy of the United States has been explored in an effort to demonstrate the utility of refocusing our energies towards a macro-sociological perspective." .

ObjectiveDescribe and analyse the occurrences of DS in patients attending the clinic and clarify the existence of this condition within the Spanish Urological service. Materials and methodsPatients reporting semen loss in urine or involuntarily outside of sexual relations were studied during a period from May 2006 to December 2007. Variables of age, nationality, marital status, family situation, medical history, reasons for the consultation, physical condition and additional tests were studied. All treatments and its effectiveness were also recorded. ResultsDS affected predominantly southern Asian continent citizens (n = 32). The average age was 35.44. Seventeen patients reported semen loss during urination; 20 at the end of urination; 11 spontaneously; 5 while sleeping; 4 during defecation; 1 while showering; 1 while eating meat; and 3 produced by noticing stained clothing. In 28 cases, the supposed loss of semen was linked to sex-related symptoms. All examinations and tests ruled out the existence of actual loss of semen. ConclusionsIn urology consultations, we have been witnessing the unusual appearance of DS, a condition known by psychologists and psychiatrists and practically unheard of by urologists. A previously unknown condition in Spain, immigration from Asia, is causing the appearance of this syndrome. Its rapid identification will prevent patients from paying costly and unnecessary tests and provide alternative therapies, within a multidisciplinary approach involving psychologists and psychiatrists." .

His rigid and noncompromising attitude, together with deep religious feelings at a time when France was riding a very strong wave of anticlericalism, led to his being unable to teach in Paris and to academic exile in the provinces. He was a prolific writer and he left his name on many equations such as the Gibbs-Duhem and Duhem-Margules equations. We present here a general picture of his life and activities against the political climate in France as well as a discussion of some of his most important contributions to thermodynamics." .

Thomas Kuhn argued against this view and claimed that science always follows this pattern: after a phase of “normal” science, a scientific “revolution” occurs. Taking as a case study the transition from the static view of the universe to the Big Bang theory in cosmology, we appraised Kuhn’s theoretical approach by conducting a historical reconstruction and a citation analysis. As the results show, the transition in cosmology can be linked to many different persons, publications, and points in time. The findings indicate that there was not one (short term) scientific revolution in cosmology but instead a paradigm shift that progressed as a slow, piecemeal process." .

Some China observers have even argued that China’s political succession has been institutionalized. While this paper recognizes that the Congress may provide the most obvious manifestation of the institutionalization of political succession, this does not necessarily mean that the informal nature of politics is no longer important. Instead, the paper contends that Chinese political succession continues to be dictated by the rule of man although institutionalization may have conditioned such a process. Jiang Zemin has succeeded in securing a legacy for himself with his “Three Represents” theory and in putting his own men in key positions of the Party and government. All these present challenges to Hu Jintao, Jiang’s successor. Although not new to politics, Hu would have to tread cautiously if he is to succeed in consolidating power." .

Galbraith, who has been politically active on the left wing of the Democratic Party, is a follower of Thorstein Veblen, founding father of the typically American movement called institutionalism. He cannot pride himself upon the unqualified admiration and sympathy of his fellow-economists, whom he has often rebuffed. In spite of inadequacies in his reasoning he has enriched economic literature with some original contributions. He is still going strong and wielding his often acerbic pen." .

Respondents explained their respective journeys to the field via three avenues: biographical, intellectual, and through the graduate school experience. Four scholars spoke to the emotive elements that attracted them to the field. The remainder sought answers to nagging questions on either empirical or theoretical matters. Lastly, the semi-structured interviews elicited accounts of their respective graduate school curricula and the role of mentoring.

Mao Zedong had tremendous power over the political institutions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). During the Cultural Revolution, he mobilized the masses against the Party’s institutions in the name of Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Xiaoping significantly downplayed the role of ideology in politics by trying to avoid theoretical debates. Jiang Zemin invented a new thought, “Three Represents,” yet the thought was detached from his name when it was enshrined in the CCP Constitution. Most recently, as a result of the political succession at the Sixteenth National Congress of the CCP, Jiang is no longer the most authoritative interpreter of the thought. Now it is Hu Jintao, new General Secretary of the CCP, who has become the official interpreter of the thought. He offered a new interpretation in his July 1st speech on the “Three Represents” in 2003. It seems that ideology is no longer a personal trademark. It has become an asset of the Party and been institutionalized under Hu Jintao because Hu has become the legitimate interpreter of the Party’s ideology as the General Secretary of the Party." .

In particular, the article explores how classroom context, including student identities, and student exposure to diverse, often conflicting “political identities” in course material emerge during different “encounters”—a Cultural Revolution poster exhibition, a simulation about the Three Gorges Dam, a Cultural Revolution role-play, and a problem-solving session involving factory workers. The article argues that encounters, which encompass in-class activities, such as problem solving, simulations, and role-play, enhance student engagement with course material, improve student retention of historical and contemporary political knowledge, and encourage critical thinking and peer collaboration in a student-centered learning environment. The article concludes that learner-centered teaching is significant because as the world becomes more complex, the knowledge and skills acquired through student-centered activities in politics classes are highly relevant for the future of self-organization, social interactions, and institution building." .

The monthly median hourly value of h′F, particularly in the post-sunset period (18-20 LT), are positively correlated with the monthly average S. The value of h′F can be deduced from an empirical formula: h′F=0.68S+218.3, with the correlation coefficient (r) between h′F and S being 0.78. The diurnal distribution of r during daytime (06-14 LT) was radically different for the African and Asian longitudinal sectors during 1980-1991, with the most pronounced difference in the post-noon period (12-14 LT) when the correlation coefficients r for the Asian and African sectors are 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. Thus, the daytime F-region in the African sector responded far less to changes in solar activity than the Asian F-region during this cycle. This longitudinal anomaly was however absent in the preceding cycle (1969-1979) when the African and Asian sectors were both characterised by low daytime and pronounced post-sunset correlation coefficient r. The American sector appears to have a high correlation coefficient r in daytime increasing to a small maximum in the post-sunset interval. The post-sunset enhancement in r is a characteristic feature for equatorial stations only (corrected geomagnetic latitude <10°)." .

Ces personnages apparaissent trèsfréquemment dans le roman urbain contemporain, mis en scènesur deux modes différents : en tant que personnages principaux dontle texte retrace le parcours et en tant que personnages anonymes faisant partieintégrante du paysage urbain. On cite ici à titre d'exemplesdes romans de J.-C. Izzo, M. Lindon et J. Echenoz pour le premier cas, ainsi que les textes d'A. Ernaux pour le second. Ces représentations des SDF dans les romans urbains sont intéressantes dans la mesure oùelles fournissent aux auteurs une occasion privilégiée d'exercer une critique sociale visant d'une part l'émergence d'une importantepauvreté urbaine au sein de la société de consummation et, d'autre part, l'indifférence générale que suscite ce phénomène. Dans la plupart des textes, un véritablefossé social se creuse entre les marginaux et les autres personnages, ce qui explique en partie pourquoi les rencontres entre ces deux groupes de personnages restent anonymes ou se font uniquement à l'intermédiairedes médias. Un fossé pareil sépare souvent la vie antérieureet la vie actuelle du męme personnage devenu SDF. Le parcours de ces personnages peuvent présenter plus ou moins d'individualité,les raisons les plus couramment évoquées témoignent cependant toujours d'une sorte d'incapacité des personnages à se plieraux contraintes de la société, d'une sensibilité ou d'un moral plus marqués qui les empęchent de faire un compromis afin de réussir à s'intégrer. Il s'agit là d'une stratégiedont les auteurs se servent pour mettre le lecteur du côté des personnages échoués et du męme coup contre la sociétédont le mauvais fonctionnement provoque leur déclassement. On faitégalement l'inventaire des sujets les plus fréquemment évoqués àpropos des clochards : la perte progressive de la sexualité dont l'aspect purificateur peut être plus ou moins accentué, l'habitat des personnages SDF, les objets personnels et leur rôle modifié par rapport l'usage courant dans la société occidentale, etc. Ence qui concerne le mode de vie des SDF représentés dans les romans, deux modèles dominants se font contraste : la vie en communautémenée dans les grandes villes (il s'agit d'une sociétéparallèle qui coexiste avec la société normale), et lavie solitaire menée à la campagne. Cette dernière représenteune forme de refus de la vie urbaine, un thème nostalgique en voiede disparition dans la littérature contemporaine. A travers les différentestechniques de survie mises en scène dans les textes, les romanciers focalisent l'attention du lecteur sur l'indifférence généralequi se manifeste aussi bien au niveau collectif (administratif) qu'au niveau individuel. Le fait que la solidarité soit toujours montréecomme réaction individuelle et plutôt exceptionnelle contribue àla dénonciation de l'irresponsabilité sociale." .

This relationship is studied by using the theory of wave propagating in a slowly varying medium and by using a quasi-geostrophic, linear, spherical model and the IAP-GCM, respectively. The results show that when the SST is warming around the western tropical Pacific or the Philippines, the convective activities are intensified around the Philippines. As a consequence, the subtropical high will be intensified over East Asia. The computed results also show that when the anomaly of convective activities are caused around the Philippines, a teleconnection pattern of circulation anomalies will be caused over South Asia, East Asia and North America." .

Here we show that the generating principles of developable surfaces were also at the core of their study by Monge. In a historical context, from the beginning of the study of developable surfaces, to the contributions Monge made to the field, it can be seen that the nature of developable surfaces is closely related to the spatial intuition and treatment of space as defined by Monge through his descriptive geometry, which played a major role in developing an international language of geometrical communication for architecture and engineering. The use of developable surfaces in the architecture of Frank Gehry is mentioned, in particular in relation to his fascination with ‘movement’ and its role in architectural design." .

Although Japan's contributions to several biomedical fields have already been reported, little is known about Japan's contribution to gastroenterology and hepatology. Methods. Original articles published in 1991 through 2000 in highly reputed journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology were retrieved from the MEDLINE database. The number of articles having an affiliation with a Japanese institution was counted in total, and the number for each journal was also counted. Japan's share of articles regarding clinical trials and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field was also determined, along with the trend over the past decade. Results. Japan's share of articles in this field was 10.6%, ranking third in the world, following the United States (35.1%) and the United Kingdom (11.5%). Japan's share of articles went up significantly as a whole (P = 0.01), while the share for RCTs showed no significant change (P = 0.57) during this period of time. Conclusions.

Ancient Greece hosted some of the earliest societies that laid the structural foundations of pathology. Initially, knowledge was based on observations but later on the key elements of pathology were established based on the dissection of animals and the autopsy of human cadavers. Christianized Greece under Ottoman rule (1453–1821) was not conducive to the development of pathology. After liberation, however, a series of events took place that paved the way for the establishment and further development of the specialty. The appointment in 1849 of two Professors of Pathology at the Medical School of Athens for didactical purposes proved to be the most important step in fostering the field of pathology in modern Greece. Presently in Greece there are seven university departments and 74 pathology laboratories in public hospitals, employing 415 specialized pathologists and 90 residents. The First Department of Pathology at the Medical School of Athens University is the oldest (1849) and largest in Greece, encompassing most pathology subspecialties." .

As a result, the genomic structure of present day Latin Americans was determined both by the genetic structure of the founding populations and the numbers of migrants from these different populations. Here, we analyzed DNA collected from two well-established communities in Colorado (33 unrelated individuals) and Ecuador (20 unrelated individuals) with a measurable prevalence of the BRCA1 c.185delAG and the GHR c.E180 mutations, respectively, using Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays to identify their ancestry. These mutations are thought to have been brought to these communities by Sephardic Jewish progenitors. Principal component analysis and clustering methods were employed to determine the genome-wide patterns of continental ancestry within both populations using single nucleotide polymorphisms, complemented by determination of Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. When examining the presumed European component of these two communities, we demonstrate enrichment for Sephardic Jewish ancestry not only for these mutations, but also for other segments as well. Although comparison of both groups to a reference Hispanic/Latino population of Mexicans demonstrated proximity and similarity to other modern day communities derived from a European and Native American two-way admixture, identity-by-descent and Y-chromosome mapping demonstrated signatures of Sephardim in both communities.

More importantly, they provide a rationale for the occurrence of mutations typically associated with the Jewish Diaspora in Latin American communities." .

All leaders face the challenge of how to be both ethical and effective in their work. This paper focuses on the requirement that leaders be present to care for their followers in times of crisis. It examines the story of Nero playing his fiddle while Rome burns. This is a tale that has been repeated in various forms by ancient historians and modern writers. The fact that the story gets repeated through the ages tells us about the kind of care that people expect from their leaders." .

In neurosurgery a transsphenoidal approach with post-operative nasal tamponade may promote toxic shock syndrome without signs of local wound infection. By discussing the case history of a patient after hypophysectomy by the transsphenoidal route, we propose that after the appearance of the first signs of toxic shock syndrome, quick removal of the nasal tamponade is a life saving procedure." .

This may be due to the fact that it is the only one that has no exact analogue for arbitrary higher dimensional simplices, for spherical and hyperbolic triangles, or for triangles in normed planes. But it possibly has to do also with the non-existence of any explicit treatment of this center in the Greek works that have come down to us. In this paper we present different proofs of the fact that the altitudes of a triangle are concurrent. These include the first extant proof, in the works of al-Kūhī, Newton’s proof, Gauss’s proof, and other interesting proofs." .

During the MJ stage, a local QBWO in convection is dominant over the SCS, which is strengthened by the southwestward extension of QBWO anomaly from the east of Japan. In contrast, the QBWO during the AS stage originates from the east of the Philippines and propagates northwestward and then westward until attaining maturation over the SCS, followed by a gradual decay while moving westward. Regarding the circulations, the QBWO during the MJ stage is accompanied by a wave train of lower-level circulation anomalies extending from the SCS to the North Pacific. However, it is found that a wave train exists from the equator to the north of the SCS during the AS stage. In the vertical structures, the QBWO exhibits a northeast tilted relative vorticity with height during the MJ stage, while a vorticity anomaly extending from the surface up to near 300 hPa, but with an opposite above during the AS stage. In general, the QBWO active phases during both stages are characterized by the low-level convergence and cold anomaly and upper-level divergence and warm anomaly, with a strong upward motion. However, the cold anomaly at the low level is prominent during the MJ stage in contrast to that during the AS stage. And the warm anomaly at the upper level reveals a distinct enhancement from the MJ to AS stage." .

There are actually five nationwide surveys of BD: Iran, Japan, China, Korea, and Germany. Among case series, four are on more than 200 cases (Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, and UK). BD was classically seen around the Silk Route. Now, it is seen everywhere. The male to female ratios were, respectively (in nationwide surveys), 1.19, 0.98, 1.34, 0.63, and 1.40 to 1. The mean age at onset was 26.2, 35.7, 33.8, 29, and 26 years. Major manifestations were seen, respectively, in nationwide surveys: mucous membrane (oral aphthosis in 97%, 98%, 98%, 99%, and 98%; genital aphthosis in 65%, 73%, 76%, 83%, and 64%); skin manifestations (pseudo-folliculitis in 57%, N/A, 31%, N/A, and 62%; erythema nodosum in 22%, N/A, 38%, N/A, and 42%; ocular manifestations in 55%, 69%, 35%, 51%, and 53%).

It begins by conceptualizing the liberalization of international labor markets as compensation for those who have not benefitted from the liberalization of capital and commodity markets. To demonstrate that the opportunity costs of maintaining closed borders are unacceptably high, it reports on economic studies suggesting huge gains from relaxing national border controls. The focus then turns to the historical record to argue against the realist notion that closed international borders are inevitable. Flaws are exposed in the logic underlying realist “infeasibility” arguments, as well as in much of the misinformation driving mass opinion against increased immigration into the USA. To explain how such myths are perpetuated by some prominent academic theorists, the focus turns to the “liberal paradox” reinforcing the moral perfectionism by which domestic inequality is condemned, but far greater international inequality is not. The conclusion, inspired by Julien Benda's The Betrayal of the Intellectuals, is that this perfectionism can be avoided by emphasizing intellectual integrity and the courage to follow one's ideas to their full logical consequences." .

Numerous examples of permutation identity near-rings are given. The theory is then developed making use of various “localized” distributive conditions, which include as special cases most of the standard global ones (e. g., d. g., pseudo-distributive). These localized conditions only assume distributivity among the elements of certain special (and often “small”) sets. Particularly useful for such sets are powers of the ideals generated by the sets of Lie commutators, additive commutators, or distributive elements. Examples are given where a localized condition holds yet none of the usual global ones do. Results are obtained concerning prime, semiprime, or maximal ideals as well as regular, simple, or subdirectly irreducible near-rings." .

One is a medieval work with deep religious connotations and an obsolete poetics, while the other is a modern epic that deals with the predicament of the individual at the dawn of a new technological and capitalist era. Yet, these differences are essentially historical and do not affect the way in which both works communicate as poetic representations. At this level, in fact, they are very much comparable, as I will try to show. These two works have in common not only the fundamental theme of the “quest for knowledge”, but they also share what is necessarily and inevitably the representational mode of any great poetic work: the mode of allegory." .

This means an enormous reduction in publication time. It will no longer be necessary for manuscripts to wait until the “next available issue”. As each paper is ready for publication, it will be published on the Web with its own publication date as follows: “Published online: 〈date when placed on Springer's LINK server〉”. Each article will receive an international identification code – the “Digital Object Identifier” (DOI), which is registered with the International DOI Foundation and is unique, like the ISBN for books or the ISSN for periodicals. Contributions published Online First are citable by journal title and DOI. The print version will also have the final page numbers, the DOI and the online publication date. Furthermore, the DOI is linked to the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and the bibliography when the printed issue is released. The DOI is never changed and can be used, for example, to create hyperlinks between Online First articles. Online First articles appear in their final form.

History shows that in order to realize this objective, the ‘gradualist’ approach believing primarily in a functional economic integration was preferred to the more radical method of taking immediate steps towards a full political union. The establishment of the European Communities formed the embodiment of the gradualist approach. Though these Communities — and the European Economic Community in particular - have fostered economic and monetary cooperation between the Western European countries, they could not, however, take the necessary steps towards the political ideal due to different views of the member states regarding the process of European integration. With the Treaty of Maastricht, coming into force on 1 November 1993, a new European élan has been born but the question posed by the Council in 1950 still has to be solved. One of the main lessons of European integration in the past fifty years may well be that economic and monetary unification will not proceed without some kind of prompting of a political nature." .

Macrofossil records suggested this genus was distributed widely in North America, Europe, and Asia during the Paleogene and Neogene, before its present limitation to Eurasia. In this study, we describe some Paliurus fossil winged fruits from the lower part of Youganwo Formation (middle Eocene) and Huangniuling Formation (late Eocene) of the Maoming Basin, South China. These fruits are recognized as Paliurus favonii Unger based on a detailed study on the fossil morphology and cuticle characteristics. This represents the earliest occurrence of Paliurus fossil fruits in eastern Asia, and to date is the world’s lowest latitude appearance for this genus. The most ancient records of Paliurus throughout the world are from the middle Eocene of North America and the late Eocene of Japan, leading some researchers to conclude the Paliurus may have originated in North America. Molecular data, however, do not support this hypothesis. The present Paliurus fossil fruits provide new evidence for the origin and phytogeographic history of this genus." .

Many Indian settlements in the American west were built on natural plateaus, near the rims of canyons, or in recesses in canyon walls where they could be defended easily. After 1492, European settlers built communities along the seacoasts, where there were natural harbors, or along lakes and rivers that were transportation routes. Many of these places were low and swampy, so that construction difficulties were common when the early settlements began to expand. Early roads and canals were laid out and built with little or no benefit of geologic knowledge. The Appalachians were a barrier to westward expansion until the first part of the 19th century, when settlers began moving into the interior. In the 1850's the War Department engineers made exploratory surveys to determine the best routes for railroads that were to cross the country from the Mississippi to the Pacific Coast. Most of their geologic reports described the fossils, topography, lithology, and the natural resources of the country they explored, but dealt very little with the geological problems that might be encountered during construction of the railroads. In 1868 the burgeoning town of San Francisco was damaged by an earthquake, but the scientific report that was prepared after the disaster was never published. During the late 1800's four great geological exploratory surveys examined the natural resources of the west, and in 1879 the U.S. Geological Survey was established as a government agency. At first the work of the Geological Survey emphasized mining geology, but the scope of their studies gradually broadened. In 1890 they published an account of the earthquake at Charleston, South Carolina. In 1894 the application of geologic information to construction was discussed in a Geological Survey publication dealing with roads of the United States. A similar report was published by the New York Geological Survey in 1897. However, it was not until the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, that the clear relationship between geology and civil engineering was well established, and the location of roads and structures was influenced by studies of the geologic conditions of the routes or sites." .

Cloudiness also shows significant periodicities near 4.2 and 7.5 years, and probably a sunspot cycle effect (periodicities 11–14 years), with minimum cloudiness at or soon after sunspot minima, though this could also be due to periodicities of 10 and 17 years observed in the SO index.

In turn, it examines the Obama administration’s policies toward Egypt. It discloses the surprising finding that the only consistent aspect of the administration’s policy toward Egypt has been outreach to and engagement with the Muslim Brotherhood. At no time before or after the Brotherhood’s ascent to prominence in Egyptian politics and society did the administration make support of the Brotherhood conditional. At no time did it use US leverage - given the massive amount of financial and military aid Egypt was depending on, and given the new Egyptian government’s desire for prestige in the world community–to pressure the Morsi government to respect human rights, religious liberty and the impartial rule of law. Arguing that American foreign policy at its best is rooted in democratic ideals, this paper asks whether the United States, while respecting that Egyptians must choose their leaders and their political system, could have done more to encourage a positive strategic, moral and political outcome." .

In response, 42 cases were collected in Europe, and one case from New Zealand was added. The following countries were represented with the number of cases indicated in parentheses: Czechoslovakia (2), Denmark (4), Finland (3), France (6), Germany (1), Italy (5), The Netherlands (9), Sweden (6), United Kingdom (4), Yugoslavia (2). The wide geographical distribution indicates a multifocal origin of the translocation. Among the unpublished cases, 31 were ascertained as unbalanced carriers [47,XX or XY,+der(22),t(11;22)] and 12 as balanced balanced carriers [46,XX and XY,t(11;22)]. Among the published cases, 10 were ascertained in unbalanced and 3 in balanced carriers. The breakpoints of the translocations indicated by the contributors varied, the most frequently reported being 11q23;22q11 (25 cases), followed by q25;q13 (10 cases). While the first one seems more likely, it was not possible to decide whether the breakpoints were the same in all cases. All 32 probands with unbalanced karyotypes had inherited the translocation, 31 from the mother and only 1 from the father. This ratio became 43:1 when the published cases were added. A segregation analysis revealed that in families ascertained through probands with unbalanced karyotypes there was a ratio of carriers to normal (all karyotyped) 54:55, not a significant difference. The formal maximum (minimum) recurrence risk for this unbalanced translocation was calculated to be 5.6% (2.7%). When the ascertainment was through a balanced proband, the maximum risk was 2.7%. The risk was calculated as 5.7% for female and 4.3% for male carriers. The mean family size was 1.67 for the offspring of female carriers and 0.78 for the offspring of male carriers. This significant difference suggests that heterozygosity for the translocation reduces fertility in males. Indeed, several of the probands with balanced karyotypes were ascertained because of sub- or infertility. Only 2 de novo translocations were found among the 59 probands, and both, were among the 12 cases ascertained as balanced carriers. The source, quality, and quantity of the clinical data for the subjects with unbalanced karyotypes were variable, and no definite conclusions were possible about phenotypes. The following signs were recorded in 10 or more of the 45 cases: low birth weight, delayed psychomotor development, hypotonia, microcephaly, craniofacial asymmetry, malformed ears with pits and tags, cleft palate, micro-/retrognathia, large beaked nose, strabismus, congenital heart disease, cryptorchidism, and congenital dislocation of the hip joints. Many signs were similar to those considered typical of trisomy 11q, and the phenotype coincided almost completely with the presumptive phenotype of complete trisomy 22. No cases with coloboma was recorded, while other signs of the “cat-eye” syndrome were found in several probands. This might indicate that individuals with the cat-eye syndrome and carriers of the unbalanced 11/22 translocation have the same segment of 22 in triplicate plus or minus another chromosome segment." .

Thomson This being the 100th anniversary of J. J. Thomson’s discovery of the electron, the October 1897 paper in which he presented his case that cathode rays are streams of subatomic “corpuscles” is attracting a great deal of attention. Viewed from 100 years later, this paper stands out as the starting point for the research into the structure of the atom that has dominated 20th-century science. Viewed in its original historical context, however, this paper was but one of a group by Thomson and his Cavendish Laboratory research students and is matched in importance by his two ensuing papers: “On the Charge of Electricity carried by the Ions produced by Röntgen Rays” published in December 1898 and “On the Masses of the Ions in Gases at Low Pressures” published in December 1899. All three of these seminal papers, which appeared in the prestigious Philosophical Magazine, are included here, along with the published text of Thomson’s talk of April 30, 1897, in which he first put the subatomic proposal forward and George Fitzgerald’s commentary on this talk." .

Colonoscopic examination showed many irregularly-shaped discrete ulcerations in the sigmoid colon extending for a length of 6cm, situated 16cm proximal to the anl ring. Histopathology of the biopsy specimen in and around the ulcerations revealed the deposition of amyloid materials in the proper mucosa and the submucosa. Similar ulcerations were not detected by endoscopy in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Multiple biopsy specimens taken from various parts of the gastrointestinal tract other than the sigmoid colon showed no amyloid deposition. Further investigations showed no particular abnormality in any organs and the patient was free of such systemic disease as myeloma or collagen disease. The findings were consistent with those of localized sigmoid amyloidosis. Localized colonic amyloidosis is rare, this being the fifth patient reported in Japan in the past 15 years." .

Polygynous colony caste proportions are more constant than for queenless colonies. Correlation coefficients are not significantly different between numerical and biomass neuter caste ratios (large workers: small workers; total worker population: soldiers) inN. corniger orN. ephratae. The intraspecific range of both numerical and biomass percentages of soldiers, small workers, and large workers is large inN. corniger andN. ephratae. Numerical and biomass percentage of soldiers, small workers, and large workers were all significantly different between monogynousN. corniger and monogynousN. ephratae colonies. Mean individual weights of soldiers, large workers, and small workers did not differ between species. Single queenN. corniger colonies tend to have a higher ratio of the number of small workers: large workers and the number of soldiers: workers, and a lower proportion of presoldiers: soldiers than do monogynousN. ephratae nest. PolygynousN. corniger colonies have a statistically larger ratio of number of larvae: number of workers, and a higher number of presoldiers: soldiers than do single queen colonies. These all suggest differences in growth rate related to single versus multiple queens. Monogynous and polygynous nests have significantly higher ratios of larvae: workers than do queenless colonies. In both numerical and biomass analyses of variousN. corniger caste ratios, correlation coefficients were highest in comparisons between the total number or dry weight of all workers vs soldiers. Mean individual dry weights of large and small workers in queenlessN. corniger colonies are significantly higher than in queenright colonies. This may be because the queenless colony population is aging without generating more young so fewer individuals are in the early worker instars." .

Reachability is an equivalence relation and if D is 1-arc-transitive, then this relation is either universal or all of its equivalence classes induce isomorphic bipartite digraphs. In Combinatorica, 13 (1993), Cameron, Praeger and Wormald asked if there exist highly arc-transitive digraphs (apart from directed cycles) for which the reachability relation is not universal and which do not have a homomorphism onto the two-way infinite directed path (a Cayley digraph of Z with respect to one generator). In view of an earlier result of Praeger in Australas. J. Combin., 3 (1991), such digraphs are either locally infinite or have equal in- and out-degree. In European J. Combin., 18 (1997), Evans gave an affirmative answer by constructing a locally infinite example. For each odd integer n >= 3, a construction of a highly arc-transitive digraph without property Z satisfying the additional properties that its in- and out-degree are equal to 2 and that the reachability equivalence classes induce alternating cycles of length 2n, is given. Furthermore, using the line digraph operator, digraphs having the above properties but with alternating cycles of length 4 are obtained." .

In the northern area the K-feldspars display disordered monoclinic structures, in the southern, heterogeneous triclinic structures. The distribution of K-feldspar crystals showing different triclinicity degrees suggests the disordered monoclinic structures to be primary. Only in a later period did the structures of some crystals become ordered, but in an amount and to a degree differing from locality to locality. The areas under consideration adjoin along a sharp straight line coinciding with a fault. By movements taking place along this fault two durbachite blocks, each with a different physical-chemical history of consolidation, came into contact." .

However, it seems that there are no reports of rectal prolapse concurrent with antibiotic-associated colitis in the veterinary literature. A 3-month-old male cross-bred dog presented with a history of recurrent episodes of rectal prolapse following the administration of oral cephalexin. The rectal prolapse was corrected surgically. Based on the dog's recent history of antibiotic use, the sudden onset of bloody diarrhoea, tenesmus and subsequent rectal prolapse, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was considered as the primary cause of rectal prolapse in this case. Clostridium perfringens were isolated from a bacteriological stool culture. The dog was treated with amoxicillin for three consecutive weeks. There were no detectable signs of diarrhoea or a recurrence of rectal prolapse during the 2-month follow-up period." .

According to two different creep laws used, two sets of viscosity values are obtained. Viscosities in the outer part of the Moon are found to be larger than those anywhere on Earth. These high values ofη explain the large elasticityQ found in lunar seismograms. Viscosities below about 500 km in depth are so small that, at present, some kind of convection or a flow of matter is possible. Tidegenerated moonquakes at depths of around 1000 km seem to be connected with some viscous process. From considerations of viscosities at the time period of mare filling, some selection of ancient selenotherms may be performed." .

In the present study, we identified and analyzed the characteristics of the 100 most frequently cited articles published between 1970 and 2010 in journals pertaining to pain research and related fields. These articles were identified using the database of the Science Citation Index (1970 to present). The most cited article received 3,017 citations and the least cited article received 302 citations, with a mean of 585 citations per article. These citation classics were published in six high-impact journals, led by Pain (84 articles). Of the 100 articles, 39 were observational studies, 25 were review articles, and 20 concerned basic science. The articles originated from 14 countries, with the United States contributing 47 articles; 67 institutions produced these 100 top-cited articles, led by National Institutes of Health of the United States (8 articles) and University College London (6 articles); 18 persons authored 2 or more of the top-cited articles. This analysis of the top citation classics allows for the recognition of major advances in pain research and gives a historical perspective on the scientific progress of this specialty." .

The relation among them have been discussed and also their problems stated. These Precambrian series are forming the anticlinorium nuclei of hercynian structure. The incomplete understanding of these series, as well as their occurrence in distant and isolated outcrops, give place to doubtful interpretations when traying to establish the stratigraphical sequence and he correlation among the different series. The discussion implied from the global study of these problems permit us, provisionally, to establish a general stratigraphy and a possible correlation among different units. All these series constitue an Upper Precambrian; within it three groups have been differentiated: lower group consisting of basic and ultrabasic complexes; intermediate group with a very important acid volcanism and derivated rocks, and finally upper group where pelitic schists and greywackes prevail." .

The analysis of phenylketonuria (PKU) mutations in Northern Ireland shows that most major episodes of immigration have left a record in the modern genepool. The mutation I65T can be traced to the Palaeolithic people of western Europe who, in the Mesolithic period, first colonised Ireland. R408W (on haplotype 1) in contrast, the most common Irish PKU mutation, may have been prevalent in the Neolithic farmers who settled in Ireland after 4500 BC. No mutation was identified that could represent European Celtic populations, supporting the view that the adoption of Celtic culture and language in Ireland did not involve major migration from the continent. Several less common mutations can be traced to the Norwegian Atlantic coast and were probably introduced into Ireland by Vikings. This indicates that PKU has not been brought to Norway from the British Isles, as was previously argued. The rarity in Northern Ireland of IVS12nt1, the most common mutation in Denmark and England, indicates that the English colonialisation of Ireland did not alter the local genepool in a direction that could be described as Anglo-Saxon. Our results show that the culture and language of a population can be independent of its genetic heritage, and give some insight into the history of the peoples of Northern Ireland." .

However, the traditional logical-semantic approach is not useful for studying zhengming in so far as Confucian judgment prioritizes “appropriateness” over “semantic truth” as it is expressed through its historical narrative. It is in the roles and relations that stem from the family through the whole society within which people are constantly cultivating their persons. This sets the aesthetic context for the art of attuning names. Therefore, zhengming can be seen as pragmatics within the historical narrative." .

The second part is an audacious revisionist history of American sociology, a confounding counter-narrative that demystifies mainstream sociology’s hegemonic tale of self-congratulation.

Of further interest is the fact that all the cases in Japan occurred sporadically and exclusively in winter, and regressed spontaneously and fairly rapidly within six months. Furthermore, most of the cases reported in Europe also occurred in the winter months. These facts imply an etiological relationship between the lowered temperature and the bone lesions." .

The first endoscope was created in 1806 when Phillip Bozzini, a German-born urologist, constructed the lichtleiter, which used concave mirrors to reflect candlelight through an open tube into the esophagus, bladder, or rectum. Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze, another German urologist, produced the first usable cystoscope in 1877 by using series of lenses to increase magnification. He was also the first to place light inside the organ of interest to aid visualization. In 1880 Mikulicz made the first gastroscope using a system similar to Nitze’s cystoscope. Modern endoscopy was born with the introduction of the fiberoptic endoscope in the late 1950s. Over the ensuing 50 years endoscopy revolutionized many aspects of the surgeon’s practice. Endoscopy can now be used to diagnose and often treat gastrointestinal cancer, hemorrhage, obstruction, and inflammatory conditions. This review was initiated by the SAGES Flexible Endoscopy Committee to chronicle the role of the surgeon in the development and introduction of flexible endoscopy into clinical practice, historically and in contemporary surgery. Flexible endoscopy evolved out of surgeons’ need to overcome diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. There have been many recent technological advances that facilitate endoluminal therapies, and flexible endoscopy is now traversing new ground. Surgeons have been major contributors in the development of all aspects of endoscopy. There is a continually expanding list of therapeutic options available to patients. The difficult questions of which procedure, on which patient, and when can be answered best by the surgeon versed in endoscopic, laparoscopic, and open surgical techniques." .

The event may be related to a cyclone north-west of the Czech territory moving to the east with an intense western flow over central Europe. The storm did great material damage to houses, farm buildings, churches, and forests and is recorded in various documentary sources for 85 places in the Czech Lands. The windstorm had a significant influence on the development of local plantation forestry (discussed in greater detail). Judging by territorial extent and damage done, this windstorm, compared to other similar events, has been classified as “the windstorm of the eighteenth century” in the Czech Lands. This contribution demonstrates the potential of documentary evidence for the elucidation of heavy windstorms in the pre-instrumental period in Europe." .

From its military origins on the eve of World War II, OR has over the past seven decades matured to become a discipline that is recognised worldwide for its contributions to managerial planning and complex operations on all levels within both private companies and public institutions. Besides being an indispensable tool as a means for decision support, OR is today a well-established academic discipline and a field with its own institutions. Thus, OR-professionals are joined in national societies worldwide, assembled since 1959 in the global organization International Federation of OR Societies (IFORS) which again is subdivided into four Regional Groupings. Among those is the Association of European OR Societies (EURO) having as members the national societies of 31 countries notably in Europe. Two questions will be addressed: what is OR all about? How do National OR societies fit within the frameworks of IFORS and EURO? Partial answers are provided to both." .

The political situation, historical experience and cultural character of East-European countries were shared and could easily be understood by the Chinese, who have gained their national consciousness and independence as well as aspired for modernity by fighting the oppression and invasion of the foreign powers, and through learning from and resisting the Western empires at the same time. East-European literature has, therefore, exerted particular influence on modern Chinese literature at the time of its transition from the traditional. This article attempts to reveal the political, geographical, historical and cultural similarities shared by East-European countries and their significance to modern China. Then it makes a survey of the introduction, reception and influence of East-European literature in China, taking Petőfi Sándor, Bertolt Brecht and Milan Kundera as examples to show the significance of East-European literature to modern Chinese literature." .

Here, my inquiry is guided by Ovid’s version of the Narcissus myth and Plato’s theory on the mirror character of reciprocal love. Although medieval versions of the theme tend to depict narcissism as love unrequitted, there are also depictions of fulfilled love, imagined as an encounter with oneself s beautiful image. Narcissism is ambivalent also as a model of self-reflection, since the person may either enjoy his mirrored self or experience himself as unhappy consciousness." .

By this move his poetic practice transcended the phase represented by Stefan George, Rainer Maria Rilke, or Mihály Babits and paralleled poetic events then unseen or unforeseen by Lórinc Szabó. These included transmutations in the work of contemporary poets, Gottfried Benn, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound or Attila József. The novelty was not thematic but modal: a new discourse, a change from the homogeneous to the dialogical conception of the poem. In Lórinc Szabó's vision of personality the voice of the actorincludes the voice of the rebellious individualof traditional poetry (with a sociological view, a pragmatical-pedagogical motivation and a psychological quest for truth) counterpoised by the voice of the spectatorexhibiting the stable laws of the universe (passing a logical judgment). It was a radical novelty in his poetry that the distinction and distance of the ego and the world ceased to be a precondition of aesthetic formation and were replaced by the polyphonic utterance of a You and the World, which living in, and at the same time distanced from, the ego enter into a dialogue in their poetic quiddity. The idea of “one justice” informing world history gave way to a demand for the “one's justice.” Lórinc Szabó's sense of contradiction between the ego and history was reinforced by his study of Der Einzige und sein Eigentum by Max Stirner. In the light of this work he reconsidered the ideas of religion, fatherland, freedom, love, justice, and liberalism and came to confront all of the bonds of the individual personality and collective action. The poetic adaptation of Stirner's ideas presents a peculiar case of intertextuality: it encourages the poem's train of thought, tunes its mode of discourse, integrates textually in the course and rhetoric of creation, and occasionally informs the poems in their entirety (as a rule those of the highest poetic rank)." .

In England, the sterile hybrid S. × townsendii gave rise by chromosome doubling to the highly fertile allopolyploid Spartina anglica, which has now invaded many salt marshes and estuaries in western Europe, and has been introduced in several continents. In South-West France, another sterile hybrid was discovered in 1892 in the Bidassoa Estuary, and named Spartina × neyrautii. According to their morphology, some authors suggested that S. × neyrautii and S. × townsendii result from reciprocal crosses. During the 20th century, the hybridization site was severely disturbed, and surviving of S. × neyrautii was questioned. In this paper, various Spartina populations are investigated in the Basque region (France and Spain), and compared to the hybrid taxa formed in England (S. × townsendii and S. anglica). The samples were analyzed using molecular fingerprinting (RAPD and ISSR) and Chloroplast DNA sequence (trnL-trnT spacer, trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer). In the Bidassoa estuary, a hybrid isolated clone has been found, that displays additive species-specific nuclear markers of S. maritima and S. alterniflora, and that is subsequently considered as a surviving clone of S. × neyrautii. The molecular analyses indicate that S. × neyrautii and S. × townsendii share the same maternal (S. alterniflora), and paternal (S. maritima) parental species, but also that the two independent hybridization events have involved different parental (nuclear) genotypes in England and in South-West France." .

Findings and arguments are assessed with two important questions in mind: What differentiates the environmental arena from Chinese politics in general? What new insights into Chinese politics can be gained from case studies of environmental protection? Scholarship on environmental politics contributes not only empirical findings, but also critical challenges to the conventional knowledge and frameworks of Chinese politics." .

This paper argues that one of the widely acclaimed canonical works in African studies, Peter Ekeh’s theory of colonialism and the two publics in Africa provides one of the most original perspectives for locating and understanding the character of modern civil society as a product of colonialism. In particular, the theory provides an explanation for why primordial attachments have remained fundamental to the structuration of civil society and why state–civil society relations have largely been fractured, instrumentalist, and dialectical in the post-colonial period." .

The growing civil society that supplements a deficient welfare system finds its roots in the peaceful underground Solidarity movement of the 1980s which played a great role in liberating Poland. After the political turnover, the Solidarity’s mission-driven approach not only survived, but also helped shape Poland’s contemporary civil society. The outlined mechanisms seem to be significant for understanding the transformation of social economy and the welfare state concept in post-communist Europe. In our paper, we identify six mechanisms underlying the Solidarity movement, which, when subsequently implemented by social entrepreneurs, has guaranteed the success of their organizations. We will also characterize the current welfare state in Poland, as well as the role of social enterprises in filling the gaps and addressing the shortcomings of the welfare state. Several case studies will illustrate the latter." .

Korea. However. there have been different views about the date and place of its printing and publication in Korea and abroad. Some Korean scholars think that it was translated into Chinese from Sanskrit in 704 in China and printed during 706–751 in the Silla period in Korea. After a further research it is now proved that this sutra was translated into Chinese in 701 and printed in the following year, 702, in Luoyang, during the reign of Empress Wu. This shows that the sutra could not have been printed in the Silla period. The discoveries of theSnddharma pundarik sūtra printed during 690–699 and the Sanskritdharani charm printed around 650–670 in China also show that thedhārani sutra found in Korea is not the earliest one.

Alteration of the regime to 14∶10 or 18∶6 failed to induce synchrony, as did variation of the light and dark temperatures. The cultures were synchronized by eliminating a light period to give a total dark period of 32 hours. One such cycle gave 54% synchrony, the cells entering division at the onset of the second light period after treatment. The omission of a second light period 72 hours after the first produced no increase in the level of synchrony. The level was improved by omitting a further light period 48 hours after the first to give a 32∶16∶32 induction treatment which resulted in 64% synchrony. In no instance did the cells divide between the dark treatment and the synchronized wave of cytokinesis. The mechanism of this synchrony may be explained by the existence of an essential, dark-labile division precursor." .

In particular, the anomalous dips and post-eclipse recoveries in two successive orbits in the short-on state are clearly distinguishable and are stable features of the X-ray light curves. We argue that to account for these features, the tilt of the accretion disk to the orbital plane must be assumed to change with phase of the 35-day period.

Despite this fact, thousands of women are raped each year. The victim of rape often becomes the target of blame; in one aspect or another she is held accountable for her victimization. Through the use of rape myths, which are grounded in patriarchal expectations of gender role behavior, our culture unites the apparently dichotomous opposites of the rights to justice and physical integrity. While rape myths have received extensive attention from behaviorists, their communication through the mass media has been ignored. This study focuses on the use of, and opposition to, rape myths in prime-time television dramas, as well as discusses the implications of those depictions." .

While the incidence of positive physical findings in the esophageal group was low, the combination of plain and contrast radiography was positive in 96% (47/49). Of the patients with tracheobronchial foreign body, 78% (40/51) had lateralizing signs on physical examination and 80% (41/51) had abnormal inspiratory/expiratory radiographs. Disimpaction of esophageal foreign bodies was carried out using a combination of techniques with 100% success and no complications. All cases of tracheobronchial foreign bodies were managed with the rigid bronchoscope with 98% success (50/51) using a variety of instruments. Complications secondary to the foreign body itself rather than its management were seen in 9 patients, and were often due to a delay in diagnosis. A careful history and physical examination along with appropriate radiographic studies will result in a correct diagnosis in virtually all cases of esophageal and tracheobronchial foreign bodies. A liberal indication for endoscopy using an approach tailored to the particular case will almost always be successful." .

Using a source of 19th century US state prison records, this study contrasts the statures of comparable African-Americans and whites by the primary sources of vitamin D production: time exposed to solar radiation, skin pigmentation, and nativity. Greater insolation (sunlight) is documented here to be associated with taller black and white statures, and a considerable share of the stature differential by socioeconomic status was related to insolation." .

As an application of such function, we point out a slight mistake of Hayman in his proof for logarithmic derivative theorem (Lemma 2.3, Page 36), in his book Meromorphic Functions, published in 1964. We modify his proof." .

The measurement assurance approach has, over time, become increasingly popular in the metrology community, and in recent years has become well accepted both inside and, to some extent, outside the United States as a rigorous way to ensure the quality of calibrations. The concept has also found application in defining traceability to national standards. This paper traces the history of the measurement assurance concept." .
