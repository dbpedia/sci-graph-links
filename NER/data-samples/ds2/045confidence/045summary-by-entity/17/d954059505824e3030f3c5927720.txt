Abstract We review a variety of studies in the neural and cognitive sciences that progressively move from the level of neural systems to the level of individual behavior to the level of group behavior. At each step along the way, the evidence suggests that a cognitive process observed at one spatiotemporal scale of analysis is inseparable from the larger subsuming cognitive process observed at the next larger spatiotemporal scale of analysis. Each incremental expansion of the spatiotemporal scale of analysis is a small enough step to seem trivial, and unlikely to serve as a categorical distinction between “the mind” and the “rest of the world”. Such expansions illustrate the necessity for attending to cognitive phenomena that span across two or more spatiotemporal scales. Our analysis suggests that a mind can be observed among the physical processes that connect together a brain, a body, and an environment, and even among the physical processes that connect a group of people together.
