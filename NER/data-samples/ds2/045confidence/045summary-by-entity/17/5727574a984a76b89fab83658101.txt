Abstract The central theme is the developmental process of alternative sanctions in the Netherlands. Starting-point is the increasing crime rate, especially in the field of juvenile delinquency. At the same time it is clear that the traditional sanctions are not effective. That creates a need of alternative sanctions. The author developed criteria for these sanctions and besides applied these as an experiment in the field of juvenile vandalists in public transport. As a consequence of the positive evaluation the alternative sanctions were institutionalised in the Netherlands by way of the installation of HALT offices in every city.
