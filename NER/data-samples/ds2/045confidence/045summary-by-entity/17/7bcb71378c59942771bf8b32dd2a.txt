Conclusions When the above limitations on the scale parameters are satisfied the codes form similar groups shifted with respect to the closest one by one digit. To analyze the scales it is sufficient to consider a sequence of quantization steps within the limits of a single code group. The quantization steps can be defined by one, two or more terms of the expansion in series of the corresponding exponent. The variety of scales obtained using the above general approach can form the basis for the construction of analog-digital converter devices.
