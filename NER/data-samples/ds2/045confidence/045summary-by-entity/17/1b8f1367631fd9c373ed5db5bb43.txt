Summary Sleep length and sleep quality scores were collected on board ships over periods of up to two weeks from 38 watchkeepers working a ‘4-on/8-off routine’ and 29 dayworkers. All watchkeepers exhibited fragmented sleeping patterns, which indicated a lack of adaptation of the sleep/wakefulness cycle to the hours of work. There were only slight differences in total sleep length between watchkeepers and dayworkers, however, both groups did not obtain an adequate amount of sleep. Within the watchkeeping crews the 3rd Officers had by far the shortest sleep length. Concerning sleep quality, daytime sleep was generally given the lowest ratings, whereas sleep starting before midnight was on average evaluated as the best, both by watchkeepers and dayworkers. Watchkeeping personnel do not normally have any “days off” during a voyage so that missed sleep might even amount to a sleep deficit. A solution for this problem could perhaps be a new, stabilized system that allows a single uninterrupted sleep, which is required for full recuperation, to be taken each day.
