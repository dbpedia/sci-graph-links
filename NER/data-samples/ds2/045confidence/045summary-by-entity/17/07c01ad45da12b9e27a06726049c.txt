Abstract Field experiments investigated survival and development in an arctic population of the oribatid mite Ameronothrus lineatus living on cyanobacterial mats. Mites were sorted to instar and kept in microcosms for 1 year (1997–1998). Juvenile winter survival was high (56–79%), but only about 50% of the adults survived the winter. Summer survival was high in all instars (60–80%). This gave a high survival to adulthood (13.3%). A synchronized moult was observed in July, but juvenile development during the rest of the exceptionally warm summer of 1998 varied both between and within stages, with immatures moulting not at all or up to two times. In a second set of cohorts, experiencing a shorter summer, most juveniles moulted once. Thus, A. lineatus has a flexible life cycle with the juvenile stages normally lasting 1 year, giving a larva-to-larva developmental time of 5 years, but with an increased developmental rate in warm summers. Development also seemed to depend on gender, with males developing faster than females. Adult longevity was studied in the laboratory, and most of the adults lived for 2–3 years.
