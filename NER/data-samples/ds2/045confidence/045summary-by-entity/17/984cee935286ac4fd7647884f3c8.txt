Abstract In an effort to extend the generality of the peak shift phenomenon to the tonal-frequency dimension, two pigeons were given extended intradimensional discrimination training on the tonal-frequency dimension. Both Ss displayed peak shifts early in discrimination training and loss or reduction of peak shift after more extended training. Introduction of response-contingent shock after each response to the Sâ€”appeared sufficient to either yield marked recovery of peak shifts or increase the magnitude of existent peak shift. These data complement similar results obtained on other stimulus dimensions such as color and line orientation.
