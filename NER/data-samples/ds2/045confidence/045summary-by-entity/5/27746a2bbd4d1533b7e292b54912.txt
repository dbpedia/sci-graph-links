Abstract Shipwrecks within Michigan’s Great Lakes provide benefits to users who include historians, archaeologists, sport divers, anglers, salvors, and businesspeople. But as common property resources, shipwrecks are subject to overuse and misallocation that are characteristic of the “tragedy of the commons.” With the passage of state legislation in 1980, shipwrecks are now formally recognized as public trust resources to be managed wisely for the benefits of present and future Michigan citizens. The values of these benefits and the costs of impacts from use should be considered in making allocation and resource management decisions. In addition, the establishment of institutional management systems is needed to guide, monitor, and control the use of shipwrecks. Michigan has established nine underwater preserves and is investigating private-public partnerships in shipwreck management that include community support groups as decision-makers. Strategic planning processes and collaborative decision-making approaches offer some means for designing effective resource management tactics that are consistent with the missions of state agencies. Strategic planning processes relevant to shipwreck management include inventory and assessment of resources, citizen participation and community development approaches, and the marketing of parks, recreation, and tourism.
