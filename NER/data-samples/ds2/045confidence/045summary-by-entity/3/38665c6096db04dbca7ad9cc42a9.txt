Abstract This paper describes the research works performed in my group in recent years in the theoretical methods and computational schemes for investigations of resonances in few-body atomic systems. These methods include the complex absorbing potential method, the stabilization method, and the method of complex scaling. In addition to atomic resonances, this paper also describes some of our recent works on investigations of Borromean bindings in three-body atomic systems. By systematically changing the two-body interaction from the long range Coulomb potential to the short range screened Coulomb (Yukawa) potential, we have investigated the Borromean bindings for hydrogen molecule ion H 2+ and the muonic molecular ions.
