Abstract High-speed impact of metallic Taylor cylinders is investigated computationally and experimentally. On the computational side, a modular explicit finite element hydrocode based on updated Lagrangian formulation is developed. A non-classical contour integration is employed to calculate the nodal forces in the constant strain axisymmetric triangular elements. Cell and nodal averaging of volumetric strain formulations are implemented on different mesh architectures to reduce the incompressibility constraints and eliminate volumetric locking. On the experimental side, a gas gun is designed and manufactured, and Taylor impact tests of cylinders made of several metallic materials are performed. Computational predictions of the deformed profiles of Taylor cylinders and experimentally determined deformed profiles are compared for verification purposes and to infer conclusions on the effect of yield strength, strain hardening and strain rate on the material response. The article also compares the performance of different plastic flow stress models that are incorporated into the hydrocode with the experimental results and results provided by previously reported simulations and tests.
