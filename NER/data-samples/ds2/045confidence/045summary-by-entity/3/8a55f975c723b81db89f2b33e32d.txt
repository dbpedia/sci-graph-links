Abstract The Schrödinger Coulomb Hamiltonian for electronic and nuclear motion in a diatomic molecule is presented and its effect upon functions which are products of functions of electronic and of nuclear variables is explicitly exhibited. Computational approaches to finding approximate solutions in such a basis are outlined.
