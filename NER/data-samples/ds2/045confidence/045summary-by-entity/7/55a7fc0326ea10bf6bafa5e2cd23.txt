Abstract A field study compared genetically improved, container-grown loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings to naturally established loblolly seedlings on a cutover pine site in southern Arkansas, USA. Pines on 50% of all plots were released from woody and herbaceous competition within a 61 cm radius of each tree stem. Woody competition was controlled by hand cutting for 5 consecutive years and herbaceous competition was controlled with herbicides (sulfometuron methyl and glyphosate) for 4 consecutive years. Competition control increased 5-year survival by 21–23% for natural and planted seedlings, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the two regeneration techniques. Five years after field establishment, planted pines averaged 85% more volume than naturally established pines. Nevertheless, greater volume gains (551–688%) were achieved within regeneration techniques, as a result of competition control, than were achieved between the two regeneration techniques.
