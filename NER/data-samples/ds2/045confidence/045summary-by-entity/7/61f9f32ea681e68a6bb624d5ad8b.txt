Abstract Buds and branches were experimentally removed in spring from 3-year-old seedlings of Abies nordmanniana to stimulate growth allocation to the leader. Great allocation changes were observed the same year, not only to the leader but also to bud formation. Subapical buds, 'whorl buds', increased in average number from 4.5 up to 5.0, their diameter increased up to 36%, and the number of new lateral buds increased up to approximately 300%. Treatments involving the subapical (\
