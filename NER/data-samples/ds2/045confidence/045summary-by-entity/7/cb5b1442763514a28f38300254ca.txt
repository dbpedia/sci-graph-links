Abstract We investigated the effect of (a) different local climate and (b) thinning of the forest canopy on growth and N status of naturally regenerated European beech seedlings in a beech forest on shallow rendzina soil in southern Germany. For this purpose, a 15N-tracing experiment was conducted during the growing season of the year 2000 with beech seedlings growing on a warm, dry SW-exposed site and a cooler, moist NE-exposed site, and in a thinned and a control stand at each site. Biomass, 15N uptake and partitioning and total N concentrations of beech seedlings were determined. Site and thinning produced clear differences, particularly at the end of the growing season. Biomass and cumulative 15N uptake of beech seedlings then increased due to thinning on the NE site and decreased on the SW site. Total N concentrations in leaves, roots and stems of beech seedlings responded similarly. Therefore, growth and N status of beech seedlings are found to be favoured by thinning under cool-moist conditions. However, under higher temperature and reduced water availability—conditions that are prognosticated in the near future—thinning reduces N uptake and plant N concentration and, thus, impairs N balance and growth of beech regeneration.
