Summary Seedlings from nine families of Pinus radiata were grown in a glasshouse under conditions of high and low nitrate nitrogen availability to investigate effects on anatomical and strength characteristics of stems. Families were classified into groups dependent upon their previously determined susceptibility to stem deformation prevalent in plantations established on fertile ex-pasture. Nitrogen treatments significantly affected seedling form in terms of both branch production and stem slenderness. The high N treatment resulted in shorter seedlings, a proportion of which were obviously stunted. Stem strength of seedlings, physically supported throughout the experiment, was assessed as stem lean at harvest as well as the bending strength of the fresh stem at 50% stem height. These two variables were found not to be correlated. Stem lean at harvest was greatest in families known to be susceptible to stem deformation. These families produced stems that were also more slender than families of low susceptibility. Increased stem lean was associated mostly with increased stem slenderness while elasticity was more influenced by pith diameter, stem density and wood radius.
