Abstract This study explores accountability testing in the elementary schools of New York City with particular emphasis on the impact of a statewide social studies test on the value given to social studies instruction in comparison to other subjects. The attitudes of a group of elementary teachers are examined. Some of the teachers taught all subjects in the curriculum and others taught only social studies. Through mixed method research this study reveals that, even with a statewide test and social studies specialists created to meet the demands of the test, social studies is valued less than language arts and math, two of the other major curriculum areas that are also tested. Factors influencing this finding are the social studies test’s role in determining the adequate yearly progress report for schools and the promotion of students within New York state’s accountability system, as compared to other subjects. This exploratory study adds to the research on the narrowing of the curriculum in the elementary schools and considers the impact of a statewide test in social studies and the presence of social studies specialists in response to the test.
