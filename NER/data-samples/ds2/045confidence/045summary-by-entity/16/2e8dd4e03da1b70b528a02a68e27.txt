Summary This paper studies the determinants of job vacancy duration in The Netherlands applying a hazard model to micro data. Important determinants of job vacancy duration appear to be required education, type of occupation and employers' size. Job vacancies for which the highest level of education is required last longest, those at the secondary level or general schooling at extended primary level last shortest. The durations of job vacancies for service occupations are shorter than those for other occupations. The duration of job vacancies increases with the size of the employer. Furthermore vacancies for jobs with unpleasant working conditions do not have a longer than average duration. The hazard model uses a Weibull specification of duration dependence, while the influence of unobserved variables is described with gamma-distributed error terms. Unobserved heterogeneity does not seem to be very important. Finally it appears that duration dependence is positive which may be an indication of employers lowering their hiring standards as the duration of the job vacancy increases.
