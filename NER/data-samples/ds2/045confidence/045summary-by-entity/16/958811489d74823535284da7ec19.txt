Summary The field of spot test analysis is now thirty years old. During its existence it has become an established technic for practical qualitative analysis and is becoming recognized as a valuable pedagogic tool. It is to be emphasized that spot tests are true microchemical technics, having absolute sensitivities generally comparable with microscopic methods, and having concentration sensitivities of superior order. The value of spot tests in many types of analyses are surveyed. Also, the contribution of spot test studies in the development of such broad fields as those dealing with organic reagents, catalysis, chromatography, masking and demasking, and the teaching of advanced analytical principles are discussed. Future work in the field will undoubtedly include numerous new tests for both inorganic and organic compounds, detailed studies of selectivities of tests applied to complex mixtures, new methods for increasing the selectivity and sensitivity of tests, and finally, the development of many uses for spot tests, including new applications in the important field of trace analysis.
