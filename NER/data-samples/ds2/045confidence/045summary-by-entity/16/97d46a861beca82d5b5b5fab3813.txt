Abstract This study analyzes the effects of integrating economics into the social studies curriculum and the effects of participation in the Stock Market Game (SMG) on the Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP) economics outcome scores. The study was carried out using state summary and disaggregated data and summary data for each school system in Maryland. The 1992 and 1994 MSPAP economics outcome scores for grades 3, 5, and 8 constituted the dependent variable with the level of integration of economics in the curriculum and the level of participation in the SMG being the main explanatory variables. Using comparative static analysis, two related but separate questions were addressed. The first question asks how school systems with different levels of integration of economics in the curriculum and with different levels of participation in the SMG compare to the state average. The second question asks how these groupings compare to each other. It is this second question that lends itself to more rigorous hypothesis testing.
