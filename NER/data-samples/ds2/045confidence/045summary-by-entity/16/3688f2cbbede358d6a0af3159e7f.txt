Abstract The objective of this study was to explore and gather human reactions and perceptions on computer visualizations of interior wood. The subjective qualities of such products are important because they infl uence the most critical of consumer decisions: to buy or not. To learn more about a phenomenon than quantitative data can provide, qualitative methods are needed. Here, grounded theory was used with focus groups to form a map of 14 people’s experiences of wood. Six computer-generated pictures with visible wood were varied into 18 pictures, such that two-by-two comparison resulted in 3500 words. These were combined into a map that was generated earlier, which had found 2000 words. The main dimensions found were light, color, unity, and authenticity. Light is more than brightness; shadows and lighting seemed more important for the wood feeling, and color and contrast gave life and warmth to the material on the screen. Respondents wanted wood that was more “woody” and “warmer” than wood actually is, that is, a hyper-realistic picture. Perhaps smart modification rather than photorealism should be the goal. Distribution of the earlier found activity and harmony was important for most respondents. In addition, many subjects discussed the composition and/or the context or purpose of the pictures. The impact of wood is not just related to the wood itself; it is also intertwined with its surroundings.
