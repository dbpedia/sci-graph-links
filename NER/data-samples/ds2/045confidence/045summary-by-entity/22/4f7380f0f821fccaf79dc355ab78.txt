Abstract “The two big problems — the nature of development and the nature of the mind — are being subdued. I don’t know whether there will be beautiful, general theories to come out of this — something really nice like Watson and Crick’s double helix — or whether there will be an accumulation of more and more details. I’ll confess to a secret hope for the former” (Crow 2000).
