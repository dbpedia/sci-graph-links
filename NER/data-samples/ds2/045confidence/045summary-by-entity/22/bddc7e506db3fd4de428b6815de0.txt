Abstract  The paper continues a study of extensional formulas and their representation by normal forms. The notion of extensional formula is extended to the case when extensionality is considered with respect to a binary reflexive relation. It has been proved that extensional formulas can be represented by normal forms of infinite type and “approximated” by normal forms of finite type. All proofs are given formally in fuzzy predicate BL-logic.
