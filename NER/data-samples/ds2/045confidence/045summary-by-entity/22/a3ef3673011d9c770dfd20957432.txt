Abstract Rational-emotive theory (RET) is reformulated on an epistemological basis (comprehensively critical rationalism [CCR] instead of logical empiricism) consistent with current mainstream philosophy and with the practice of rational-emotive therapy. The irrational beliefs that lead to dysphoric emotions can be defined logically and independently of their consequences. They are of two kinds: (a) grandiose beliefs that some object, state, or event in the world should be other than it is, because one wants it to be, and (b) beliefs that evaluations such as good, bad, right, wrong, wonderful, and awful are factual (inherent in the object of the evaluation) rather than definitional. Evaluations are arbitrary designations that we add to the value of a measure of some characteristic of an object or event. Dysphoric emotions (anger, anxiety, depression, guilt, jealousy, and shame) result from evaluative attributions that individuals believe to be inherently true, rather than definitional.
