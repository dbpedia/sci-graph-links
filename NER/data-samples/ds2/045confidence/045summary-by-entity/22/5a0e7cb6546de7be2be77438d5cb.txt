Abstract  In this paper we describe conditional probabilities as difference set. The main idea is that a system is in same state and from this state is can get to another state if there are fulfield some properties. In other words we have a partial binary operation ⊖ such that the operation ⊖ can be interpreted as a change of a state. If we put some logical questions about change of states on this we get the structure which is called a difference set.
