Abstract A method of calibrating scanners based on multiresponse regression models which connect the color parameters of color images of a calibrated light target with the results of the scanning of this target is proposed. A procedure and the results of an analysis of the covariance matrices of the errors of observation of the color parameters for different types of scanners are presented. Estimates of the prediction capability of the proposed calibration method are given and comparative results of its use are presented.
