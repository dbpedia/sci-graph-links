Abstract The Kodaikanal sunspot data set covering the interval 1906â€“1987 is analyzed for differential rotation of sunspots of different sizes. As is known, smaller sunspots rotate faster than larger sunspots, and this result is verified in the analysis of this data set. These results agree well with the Mount Wilson sunspot results published earlier. The activity cycle dependence of sunspot rotation is studied. An increase in this rate at the minimum phase is seen, which has been reported earlier. It is demonstrated that this cycle variation is seen for sunspots in all size categories, which suggests that it is not a relative increase in the number of the faster-rotating small sunspots that causes the cycle dependence. These results are discussed as they may relate to subsurface dynamic properties of the Sun.
