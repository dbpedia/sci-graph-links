Abstract We discuss the scientific contribution of Battaglia and Protopapasâ€™ paper concerning the debate on global warming supported by an extensive analysis of temperature time series in the Alpine region. In the work, Authors use several exploratory and modelling tools for assessing and discriminating the presence of different patterns in the data. We add some general and specific considerations mainly devoted to the modelling stage of their analysis.
