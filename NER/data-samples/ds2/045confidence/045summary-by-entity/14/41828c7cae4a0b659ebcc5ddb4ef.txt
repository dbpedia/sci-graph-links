Summary A description is given of the aims, design, and policy requirements of the EMS, and of the sort of exchange rate instability it is supposed to end. Changes in market exchange rates are attributed to differential inflation rates between countries and real exchange rate movements. Stable exchange rates can be obtained only if monetary policy is, managed so as to produce international differences in inflation rates that exactly compensate for movements in real exchange rates. Past monetary policies were seriously inconsistent with this requirement. And as yet nothing indicates that they will improve in the future. Moreover, real exchange rate changes are neither well-understood nor well-predictable. As a result, the prospects for the EMS to create monetary stability are dim. It will produce neither price nor exchange rate stability. A better alternative is proposed. Countries should combine flexible exchange rates with low, stable, and equalized inflation rates across the EC and dismatle capital and exchange controls.
