Abstract The 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances was used to determine holdings of selected financial products by low-to-moderate income households, defined as households with incomes less than or equal to 80% of median household income for their region. First, we estimated determinants of holding bank accounts. Next, we estimated determinants of holding other selected products, contingent on holding a transaction account. Finally, we estimated the potential demand for these other products by households without accounts, should they become account holders. We found that if non-account holding households were to obtain accounts, they would increase their demand for credit cards, first mortgages, car loans, consumer loans, certificates of deposit, and IRA/Keogh accounts. The implications for financial institutions, policy makers, and consumer educators are presented.
