Abstract This paper addresses the problem of joint disaggregating a group of time series when their temporal aggregation values and their contemporaneous aggregation are known and when a number of related series in the desired frequency are available. The focus is on temporal distribution of annual series. This problem was treated before by other authors but they did not solve the problem of spurious steps which usually emerge in this framework. Proposed here is the simplest hypothesis congruent with reality that solves this difficulty. An algorithm is proposed to use these hypotheses in empirical works.
