Abstract The non-fragile observer-based stabilization and H ∞ control problems for neutral stochastic hybrid systems with time-varying delay are studied in this paper. The time-delay is unknown and time-varying with known bounds. Based on Lyapunov functional approach combined with LMIs techniques, the delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of the non-fragile observer-based H ∞ controller are given. Under the control of the non-fragile observer-based H ∞ controller, the resulting closed-loop system not only is robust stochastic exponential stable in the mean square but also satisfies the H ∞ performance level. A numerical example with simulation is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
