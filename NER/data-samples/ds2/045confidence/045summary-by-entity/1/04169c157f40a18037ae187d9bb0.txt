Abstract. In this paper we formulate, within the Liapunov framework, a sufficient condition for exponential stability of a differential equation. This condition gives rise to a new averaging result referred to as “partial averaging”: exponential stability of a system , with α sufficiently large, is implied by exponential stability of a time-varying system .
