Summary After having pointed out weaknesses in traditional approaches to exploration in a preceding paper, it will now be shown what can be gained by using statistical methods in practical application to exploration. In particular, statistical data collection for joint surveys will be presented including methods for error reduction. Extensive treatment will be given to subjective assessment of uncertainty, a methodology that is well suited to engineering geology; its use in describing tunnel geology is given as a practical example. Finally, it will be shown how these methods of rational uncertainty description are employed to plan exploration in an optimum manner, with an example in exploration planning for underground gas storage caverns.
