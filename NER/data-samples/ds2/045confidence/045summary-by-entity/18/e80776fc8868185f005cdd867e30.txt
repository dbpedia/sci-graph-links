Abstract Let K denote an oval, a centrally symmetric compact convex domain with non-empty interior. A family of translates of K is said to have property T(k) if for every subset of at most k translates there exists a common line transversal intersecting all of them. Property T means that a transversal exists for all members of the family. Two translates, K i and K j are said to be φ-disjoint, φ>0, if the concentric φ-enlarged copies of K i and K j are disjoint. It is well known that in a φ-disjoint family of congruent discs T(3)⇒T if $\\varphi>\\sqrt{2}$, and $T(3)\\not\\Rightarrow T$ if $\\varphi<\\sqrt{2}$. In this note finite φ-disjoint T(3)-families of translates of an oval will be investigated.
