Abstract The sea-breeze scaling of Steynis extended by incorporating data fromtwo additional locations. This is done primarily to remove concerns that the original scaling laws contain featuresspecific to the Vancouver data upon which they were based. This new analysis also employs the integrated, ratherthan instantaneous, heat flux proposed by Tijm. The analysis results in well-defined scaling laws for allthree locations, and include explicit latitude dependence, which was not possible in the earlier study. The integratedheat flux reveals systematic diurnal behaviour that is shown to result in a separate scaling law for diurnalevolution of sea breezes at a single location.
