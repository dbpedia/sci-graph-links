Abstract. It is proved that there is a function p(c)≥0 such that p(c)>0 if c is large enough, and (a.s.) for any t∈[0,1], the trajectory of Brownian motion after time t is contained in a parallel shift of the box [0,2− k ]×[0,c2− k /2] for all k belonging to a set with lower density ≥p(c). This law of square root helps show that solutions of one-dimensional SPDEs are Hölder continuous up to the boundary.
