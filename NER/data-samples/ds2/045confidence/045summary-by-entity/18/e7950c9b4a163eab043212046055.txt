Abstract A formalized theory and unified approach to the analysis of division of functions as the basis of the development of various communities, including those of metazoans are elaborated. The concept of the histione, an elementary unit of multicellularity, is introduced. The concepts, rules, and symbols required for description of divisions of functions in this unit are proposed. For quantitative characteristics of such division, sensible and experimentally determined parameters are used. Based on this, it is shown that the development of communities follows the periodic law. Classification of communities looks like a periodic table. This table takes into account two developmental types (progressive and deviant) and reflects the main developmental laws, cyclicity, directedness, and parallelisms. In addition, the table enables prediction of the composition and structure of communities in future development and estimation of the last.
