Abstract A compact subsetK of the unit ball in ℂ n is said to beL-regular if the extremal function $$h_K (z) = \\sup \\{ f(z):f \\in PSH,f< 0f \\leqslant - 1 on K\\} $$ is continuous. With a method from an earlier paper we prove thatL-regularity is essentially a local property of the setK. As a corollary we note that, in the special case when ℝ n ,L-regularity is nothing but a local property ofK.
