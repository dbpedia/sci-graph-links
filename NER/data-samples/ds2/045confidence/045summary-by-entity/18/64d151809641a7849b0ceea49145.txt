Abstract. We consider the standard discrete-time model of a frictionless financial market and show that the law of one price holds if and only if there exists a martingale density process with strictly positive initial value. In contrast to the classical no-arbitrage criteria, this density process may change its sign. We also give an application to the CAPM.
