Abstract In the framework of the direct photometric problem we obtained analytic expressions describing the light variations of spotted stars in case of arbitrary limb-darkening law. These could be used as a basis for solution of the inverse photometric problem for arbitrary types of rotating stars characterized by surface spots.
