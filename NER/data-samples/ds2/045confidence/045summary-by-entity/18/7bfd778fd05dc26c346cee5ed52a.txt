Abstract In the present work a method to establish the effective applicability range of load separation condition in precracked specimens which undergo crack growth during testing is proposed. This methodology is based on theoretical and experimental considerations which lead to the application of a modified power law to represent load separation properties in materials that exhibit a Ramberg-Osgood type law deformation behaviour. The proper definition of the applicability range of the method allows J-R curve determination based in a single load - load point displacement record.
