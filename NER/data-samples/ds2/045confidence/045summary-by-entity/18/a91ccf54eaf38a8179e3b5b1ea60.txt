Abstract  Ground movements of many types can be responsible for socio-economic losses that lead to construction or insurance claims or even legal proceedings. Should the ground movements be the result of landslide movements, proving the cause or even the occurrence of the landslide may often be the main area of dispute. In this paper the definition of a 'landslide' suitable for legal purposes is examined and the various causes of landslides are briefly reviewed. The legal difficulties of proving the cause and occurrence of a landslide are then explored through three legal case studies involving damage, or potential damage, resulting from landslide movements.
