It must be distinguished between use of the invention in order to conduct experiments necessary to prepare a product, which will be used after the expiration of the patent protection, and obtaining profits from the use of the patented invention by an unauthorised person during the patentâ€™s term of protection. Such profits may only be obtained by the patent owner.
