Summary When an object is withdrawn from a bath of a viscous and wetting liquid, a liquid film adheres to its surface and liquid is thus lifted out of the bath. The simplest case is that in which the liquid is lifted by means of a plane vertical plate emerging from the liquid. In part I the “single-lift” process is treated where the thickness of the film lifted by the plate is a function of location on the plate and time. Results of experiments reported in literature and of our own experiments are correlated and compared with theory. Part II deals with the “continuous-lift” process in which the liquid is continuously lifted, e.g. by an endless belt and removed at some height above the bath, thus forming a most primitive type of pump. In the stationary state the flux lifted and film thickness are constant. Theory for this case is incomplete and experiments have been carried out in order to determine what flux and film thickness can be expected under certain conditions.
