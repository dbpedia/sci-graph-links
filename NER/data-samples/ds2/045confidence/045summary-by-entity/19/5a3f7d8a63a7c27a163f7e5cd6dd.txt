Abstract Artistic engagement with the archive is on the increase and takes many forms. Archive-based artwork does not always contain or display its archival source. However, in some cases the archives themselves—rather than the information or evidence they hold—are utilised to form part or all of the work. This is particularly true where visual and audiovisual records are used creatively. The archival record is thus interpreted and re-created, giving rise to potential tensions and discord. Focusing on the film archive—and in particular on documentary film originally created and collected for the purpose of recording and accountability—the paper addresses this act of creative interpretation and re-creation. Firstly, it considers the use of archives in the creation and/or destabilisation of national identity and collective memory. Specifically, it examines the re-use of visual evidence of the Holocaust and its aftermath. Among others, it discusses the work of artist Eyal Sivan, whose use of archival material from the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann has caused great controversy. Secondly, Walter Benjamin’s concept of aura and its application to archives is used to highlight the conflict that such forms of creative engagement may bring to the archival arena and to questions concerning the role and responsibility of the archivist as access provider or gate keeper.
