Abstract An analytical relationship “the current peak height—the potential sweep rate” is derived for the three-dimensional film formation under ohmic resistance control. The model takes into account both the changing of the coverage degree and the thickening of the surface film. It is shown that a criterion for definition of the growth type (2D or 3D) of the surface film can be offered. An offered model is tested for anodic oxidation of silver in sulfuric acid solution.
