Abstract Movie directors and designers of displays for process control have one thing in common: they must display the inner state of a complex system in an understandable way to a group of spectators/operators that do not have direct access to the interior of the system. The paper redefines the three basic filmic units: cut, scene, and sequence, and presents five topics from film theory that may give inspiration to the interface designer. The examples are taken from maritime instrumentation.
