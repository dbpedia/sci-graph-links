Abstract Representation of film texts for scholars and students has been fraught with difficulties imposed by the very nature of the text. The time-varying image track presented hurdles to close significant challenges to formulation of units of meaning and analysis. The digital environment offers opportunities for addressing these problems. We offer here a model of the film document as a bundle of time-varying signals. We demonstrate using this model to construct a system for close analysis of film texts, including precise measurement of attributes. Finally, we consider some consequence for the pedagogical environment.
