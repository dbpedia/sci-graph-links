Abstract The steady axisymmetric motion of a viscous film together with a cylinder is investigated. The shape of an axisymmetric film of constant mass depends not only on the physical properties of the liquid, the rate of rotation and the radius of the cylinder but also on the pressure difference between the liquid and the ambient medium. By calculation and by means of a qualitative investigation of the first integral of the basic equation it is shown that for different values of the parameters the free surface of the film may be cylindrical or wavy, intersect itself or consist of periodically distributed isolated annular layers. The calculation results correspond with the experimental data the more closely the thinner the film and the greater its transverse velocity. This is attributable to the absence of gravitational acceleration from the model of the steady axisymmetric motion.
