Abstract In a deterministic model for the spread of news in a closed homogeneously mixing population of individuals who never forget (or, of an epidemic without recovery), it is shown that the fractions Ï€i of the population first hearing the news (contracting the disease)i th hand are given by the terms of a truncated Poisson distribution.
