Abstract The article deals with the impact on an elliptical film of liquid, with the effect of the film shape on the punch deceleration and on the velocity of liquid spreading, and with the stability of the process. The problem is solved for the case of a slowly flowing viscous liquid as well as for an ideal liquid, but with the inertia forces taken into account. The theory is found to agree with experimental data. The inertia-free spreading of a circular film of viscous liquid has already been studied by Reynolds [1]. Interest in this problem is being shown again in connection with certain aspects of lubrication, of the punch and die operation, and with the sensitivity analysis of liquid explosives [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Several articles deal with the impact on a circular film [3, 4, 5, 6].
