Abstract Based on principles from modern artificial intelligence and robotics, we developed the RoboMusic concept. In RoboMusic, we use a number of robotic devices as instruments, and the tunes are composed as a behavior-based system. The music artist composes a baseline behavior for the robotic instruments, and composes the behavioral response to interactions by human musicians. The music artist is transformed from a composer of static music tunes to a developer of robot behavior: behavior that is expressed by the robotic system as music pieces. Music compositions are transformed to become robotic behavior as in a behavior-based system. A RoboMusic concert is performed with robotic instruments, and changes the concept of live concerts by inviting the audience to interact with the bandâ€™s instruments themselves and thereby guide the live performance of the music themselves.
