Abstract A general definition of dominance elimination procedures for finite games is given which includes the multistage game representation of sophisticated voting for binary procedures. There then follows a proof that the set of outcomes resulting from the successive application of any dominance elimination procedure to any game in which each player has strict preferences over the alternatives, and in which the alternative and strategy spaces are finite, contains the set of outcomes attained by applying a procedure previously defined byFarquharson [1969].
