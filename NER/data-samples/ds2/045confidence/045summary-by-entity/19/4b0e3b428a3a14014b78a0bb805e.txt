Summary A method is presented of recording the ray movement of a mirror pick-up on a phtographic film with the aid of a photographic extension to a cathode oscillograph. This method consist of projection of the ray of the mirror transducer on a dull screen, to which the attachment is oriented as to the screen of the cathode oscillograph.
