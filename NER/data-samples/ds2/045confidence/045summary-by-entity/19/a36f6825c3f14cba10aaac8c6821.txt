Abstract Over the last 20 years the dance and the spirit of the dance as primary therapeutic agents have been eroded. A brief history of dance/movement therapy focuses on those aspects of dance that inspired the development of dance/movement therapy, and the socio-economic and political circumstances which nurtured its growth. Influences from the socio-economic and political climate of the 70's and 80's, and influences from within the dance/movement therapy profession are discussed as they relate to the current state of the field. A progression from movement alone to full-out self-expressive dance is postulated as a means to fuller therapeutic growth. The structural elements of a dance/movement therapy session are considered in relation to evoking the spirit of the dance in individuals and groups. Finally, the spirit of the dance is underscored as dance/movement therapy's unique contribution to the field of mental health.
