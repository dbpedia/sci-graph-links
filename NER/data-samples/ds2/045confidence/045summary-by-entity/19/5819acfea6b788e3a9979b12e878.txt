Abstract I present a pre-history of contemporary handheld projector-based interaction to inform the design of future interactive systems. I begin by documenting the two main types of pre-cinema handheld projection from Europe and Japan, the handheld magic lantern and the utsushi-e performance. I then present a summary of projection techniques used by performers when interacting with these devices. I situate these techniques within contemporary research and illustrate how they are being used and built upon with contemporary technology. Finally, I discuss how knowledge of pre-cinema handheld projection devices, techniques, and performance can inform the design of future handheld projector systems.
