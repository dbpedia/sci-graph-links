Abstract The article is based on a session presented during the International Digital Publishing Forum: Digital Book 2015. The article takes the Q&A format to address selected questions that most publishers outside China, are eager to find answers regarding entry to the China market. The questions are raised from an ‘outsider’ perspective, which makes them more relevant to most of the readers of Publishing Research Quarterly whose readers are all over the world.
