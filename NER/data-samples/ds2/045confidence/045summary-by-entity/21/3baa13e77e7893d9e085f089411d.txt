Abstract The Confucian concept of zhengming, especially as found in Xunzi, has long been approached from a semantic viewpoint. However, the traditional logical-semantic approach is not useful for studying zhengming in so far as Confucian judgment prioritizes “appropriateness” over “semantic truth” as it is expressed through its historical narrative. It is in the roles and relations that stem from the family through the whole society within which people are constantly cultivating their persons. This sets the aesthetic context for the art of attuning names. Therefore, zhengming can be seen as pragmatics within the historical narrative.
