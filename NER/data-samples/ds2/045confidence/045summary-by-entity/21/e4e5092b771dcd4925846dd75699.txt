Summary Secular changes as revealed by the readings of the river gauge at Hankow, China; rainfall records at Seoul since 1770 and annual totals of rainfall at six representative weather stations in Japan show two pronounced minima of the average rainfall at about the turn of this century and at about 1940. Thus this variation in rainfall was paralleled in the Far East, and it seems to have been of world-wide extent. Recent gradual increase of annual precipitation is really of great practical value for economical life in the Far East.
