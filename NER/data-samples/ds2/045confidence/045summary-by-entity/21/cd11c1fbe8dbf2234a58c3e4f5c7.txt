Abstract We define the compound logarithmic function on simple connected region. As an application of such function, we point out a slight mistake of Hayman in his proof for logarithmic derivative theorem (Lemma 2.3, Page 36), in his book Meromorphic Functions, published in 1964. We modify his proof.
