Abstract This study attempts to reconstruct the rainfall conditions of southern Spain from 1600 A.D. to 1650 A.D. during the so-called ‘Little Ice Age’. Weather information was taken from original documentary sources (urban annals, local and religious histories, municipal documents, letters) in two cities in the region, Seville and Granada. A numerical index was established to characterize the rainfall, its conditions, evolution and geographical distribution. Results were compared with modern precipitation data and with the results of other studies on historical climate.
