Abstract This paper explains how organizational design/ enterprise engineering can be viewed as an operational work system that produces designs, models, and/or specifications along with the related understandings, discussions, and commitments. It applies a work system lens to visualize a typical work system that performs organizational design/ enterprise engineering. It uses the same lens to identify possibilities for research on the related topics.
