Abstract In this paper, we introduce union soft subnear-rings and union soft ideals of a near-ring and union soft N-subgroups and union soft N-ideals of an N-group by using Molodtsov’s definition of soft sets and investigate their related properties with respect to soft set operations, soft anti-image and lower α-inclusion of soft sets. Since these notions show how a soft set affects on substructures of near-rings and N-groups in the mean of union and inclusion of sets, they can be regarded as a bridge among classical sets, soft sets and near-rings. We then obtain significant relation between soft substructures of near-rings and union soft substructures of near-rings, soft substructures of N-groups and union soft substructures of N-groups.
