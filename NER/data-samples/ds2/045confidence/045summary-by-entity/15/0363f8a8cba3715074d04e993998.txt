Abstract  On September 1, 1992 all testing sites in the United States were required to comply with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA'88). These regulations, based on both total quality management (TQM) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) principles, reshaped the environment for more than 90% of laboratories. CLIA'88 represented a revolutionary change by imposing universal, uniform regulations based on test complexity for all sites examining materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA'88 specifies minimum requirements for personnel, quality control, and proficiency testing (PT). In addition, laboratories are required to follow manufacturers' directions and comply with other specified good laboratory practices. PT is mandated for most of the frequently run analyses and quality assurance requirements integrate the principles of CQI as well as TQM into the regulatory process. Biannual inspection is integral to CLIA'88, however, laboratories can choose other federally approved (\
