Abstract Based on network embedding, enterprise technology innovation and knowledge management theories, the study has built theoretical conceptual model of multiple network embedding influencing enterprises’ technological innovation performance from the perspective of knowledge management. The work discussed the internal mechanism of knowledge management activities affected by embedded relationship, embedded structure and embedded resource influencing technological innovation performance. Through obtaining 190 SME’s survey data in the Yangtze River Delta region, we systematically validated the conceptual model with the structural equation model. It showed that embedded relationship, embedded structure and embedded resource in enterprise organization network can effectively improve the enterprise’s knowledge management capability, bringing significant promotion in technological innovation performance. Wherein, the embedded relationship and embedded resource can promote not only the technological innovation performance of the enterprise, but also the performance by improving the knowledge management ability of the enterprise. While, the promotion effect of embedded structure to enterprises’ technological innovation majorly relies on the fully-mediated knowledge management to achieve.
