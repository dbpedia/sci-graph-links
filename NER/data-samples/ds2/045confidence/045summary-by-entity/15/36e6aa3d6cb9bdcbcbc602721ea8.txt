Abstract This paper considers a unionised monopolistic firm producing a final good with isoelastic demand by using two intermediate commodities, one of which can be either imported from a low-wage country or bought from domestic subcontractors. The paper shows that, notwithstanding wage moderation, the union is better off when the firm chooses offshoring rather than domestic sourcing. The firm is the less likely to choose offshoring the more wage-oriented is the union and the higher is the union bargaining power in the wage negotiation.
