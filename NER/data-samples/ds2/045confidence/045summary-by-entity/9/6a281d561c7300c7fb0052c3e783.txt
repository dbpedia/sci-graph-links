Abstract The thermal stability of the interface in an SiC-fiber reinforced Ti6Al4V-alloy was investigated using analytical transmission electron microscopy. Composites processed by hiping were heat-treated in vacuum between 600 °C and 800 °C for several hundred hours. The structure of the interface was investigated by TEM, and the element concentration in and near the interface was measured using EDX-STEM and EELS. Experimental errors resulting from the sample preparation are discussed. Based on the structural and analytical investigations, the conclusion can be drawn that the interface is stable for application temperatures of up to about 600 °C.
