Abstract An antiplane shear strip crack moving uniformly in transversely isotopic magnetoelectroelastic media when subjected to representative non-constant crack-face loading conditions is studied. Readily calculable explicit closed-form representations are determined and discussed for the components of the stress, electric and magnetic fields created throughout the material. Representative numerical data are presented. Alternative boundary conditions for which corresponding analyses can be derived analogously are listed.
