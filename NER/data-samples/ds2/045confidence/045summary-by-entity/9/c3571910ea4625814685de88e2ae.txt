Abstract A simplified mechanical model of a section of a heat-resistant coating (HRC) as a round plate with an immovable center having radial tangential stresses τ is presented. It is a natural consequence of a normal density distribution of the probability function for the shear strength and for the local compliance. Stresses and the strength conditions are determined for the two-dimensional case. Also determined is the relationship of τ to an external thermal load ɛcEc for the one-dimensional case. It was shown that with increase in the value of ɛcEc significant additional (previously unknown) stresses develops in the HRC due to the specifies of the model. Using this model a qualitative explanation of the known experimental data can be given.
