Abstract  The rapid development of fabrication technologies for the manufacture of precision microstructures is enabling the realisation of new products. Improved access to national facilities and new mechanisms for technology transfer are helping companies to exploit these technologies. A brief description of the facililties for deep X-ray lithography in the UK is given together with some recent initiatives for the transfer of knowledge and technology to industry
