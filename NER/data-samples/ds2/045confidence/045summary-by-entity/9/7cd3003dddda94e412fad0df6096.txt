Abstract This paper considers the results from a study of the growth of fatigue cracks on the basis of improved linear-fracture mechanics approaches and the method of ultrasonic Rayleigh waves for the purpose of revealing the pattern of their development in the elements of structures and equipment and substantiating their residual life with consideration for detected cracks.
