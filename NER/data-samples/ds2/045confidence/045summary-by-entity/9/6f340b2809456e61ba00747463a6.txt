Aspects of formation of structure in single-crystal rotor blades from alloy ZhSKS2 under conditions of high-gradient directed crystallization are considered. It is shown that the formation of structure in a direction radial with respect to that of drawing, especially the formation of shroud and root flanges, presents the highest difficulty. Growth in the radial direction is shown to depend on the mode of directed crystallization and purity of the blend material.
