Abstract Protection technologies of initially vulnerable industrial control systems are based on network segregation, the logical separation of the control network from the corporate network, and the use of firewalls. Manufacturers of industrial equipment attempt to embed security functions (of authentication and PLC password protection), but without using additional protection means, the components of these automatic process control systems remain unprotected because of the architecture designed without taking into account information security requirements. In this paper, a comparative analysis of the existing approaches to the APCS protection has been carried out, security criteria for each approach have been formalized, and a new subject-centered approach has been proposed that develops the cyber security paradigm.
