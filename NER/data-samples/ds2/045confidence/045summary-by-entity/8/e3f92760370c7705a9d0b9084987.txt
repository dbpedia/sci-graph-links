Summary The author determines for arbitrarily varying channelsa)the average error capacity andb)the maximal error capacity in case of randomized encoding. A formula for the average error capacity in case of randomized encoding was announced several years ago by Dobrushin ([3]). Under a mild regularity condition this formula turns out to be valid and follows as consequence from either a) or b).
