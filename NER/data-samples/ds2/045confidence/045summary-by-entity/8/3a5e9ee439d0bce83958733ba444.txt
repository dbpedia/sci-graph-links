Abstract The upcoming standard IEC 61850 prepares the ground for the broad application of data communication networks and systems in substations. With the new systems becoming installed, new testing methods and tools will be required in addition to the established ones. Also the established methods need some adaption to the new situation. This paper gives an overview about the technology, the possible effects on testing, and outlines test methods and tools to be applied.
