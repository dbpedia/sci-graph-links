Summary BackgroundCorneal transparency is a useful indicator for corneal function. Our aim was to investigate central corneal endothelial cells and corneal thickness in transplanted corneas at an average of 5.4 years after penetrating keratoplasty Patients and methodsThe study involved 68 perforated keratoplasty patients with at least a 1 year follow-up. Post-operatively, the central corneal endothelial layer was observed using a contact specular microscope. Central endothelial cell density, corneal thickness and the coefficient of variation of endothelial size were statistically analysed. ResultsThe post-operative follow-up time was ranging from 12 months to 23 years. Endothelial cell density (ECD) was 1,501 ± 249 cell/mm2. The average cell size was 673.6 ± 98.3 μm2, and the coefficient of variation of cell size was 0.61 ± 0.11. No difference in ECD was detected between diagnostic groups. Corneal thickness was 0.56 ± 0.06 mm. Correlation between ECD and post-operative time was not significant (r = 0.02; p = 0.85). ConclusionOur study concluded that ECD showed a higher rate of decrease after penetrating keratoplasty with no relation to pre-operative diagnosis.
