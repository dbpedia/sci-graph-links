Abstract Although the clinical clerkship model is based upon sound pedagogy, including theories of social learning and situated learning, studies evaluating clinical performance of residents suggests that this model may not fully meet the learning needs of students. Here our objective was to design a curriculum to bridge the learning gaps of the existing clerkship model and then evaluate the impact of this on performance on clerkship summative evaluations. We followed Kern’s framework to design our curriculum and then compared performance on the clerkship objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), all summative clerkship multiple choice question (MCQ) examinations, and the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part 1 before and after the introduction of our curriculum. In the 2 years following the introduction of our clinical skills curriculum the mean score on the clerkship OSCE was significantly higher than in the 2 years prior to our curriculum [67.12 (5.3) vs. 62.44 (4.93), p < 0.001, d = 0.91]. With the exception of the surgical clerkship MCQ, performance on all clerkship summative MCQ examinations and MCCQE Part 1 was significantly higher following the introduction of our curriculum. In this study we found a significant improvement in the performance on clerks on summative evaluations of knowledge and clinical skills following the introduction of our clinical skills curriculum. Given the unpredictable nature of clinical rotations, the clerkship will always be a risk of failing to deliver the intended curriculum—so medical schools should continue to explore and evaluate ways of changing the delivery of clerkship training to improve learning outcomes.
