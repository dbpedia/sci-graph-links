Abstract BackgroundClinical performance examinations (CPX) with standardized patients (SPs) have become a preferred method to assess communication skills in US medical schools. Little is known about how trainees’ backgrounds impact CPX performance. ObjectiveThe objective of this paper is to examine the impact of student ethnicity, primary childhood language, and experience of diversity on the communication scores of a high-stakes CPX using SPs. DesignThis research was designed as an observational study. ParticipantsThe participants of this study were third-year medical students at one US medical school. Measurements and Main ResultsThe measurements used in this study were CPX scores from mandatory exam, student demographics and experience with diversity measured by self-report on a survey, and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores. A total of 135 students participated. Asian and black students scored lower than white students on the communication portion of the CPX by approximately half a standard deviation (Asian, 67.4%; black, 64.4%; white, 69.4%, p < .05). There were no differences by ethnicity on history/physical exam scores. Multivariate analysis controlling for MCAT verbal scores reduced ethnic differences in communication scores (Asian–white mean differences = 1.95, p = 0.02), but Asian–white differences were eliminated only after sequential models included primary childhood language (difference = 0.57, p = 0.6). ConclusionsEven after controlling for English language knowledge as measured in MCAT verbal scores, speaking a primary childhood language other than English is associated with lower CPX communication scores for Asian students. While poorer communication skills cannot be ruled out, SP exams may contain measurement bias associated with differences in childhood language or culture. Caution is indicated when interpreting CPX communication scores among diverse examinees.
