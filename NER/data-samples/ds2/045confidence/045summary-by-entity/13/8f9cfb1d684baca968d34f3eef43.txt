Abstract This paper aims to explore the educative power of an experienced mathematics teacher educator-researcher (MTE-R) who displayed his insights and strategies in teacher professional development (TPD) programs. To this end, we propose a framework by first conceptualizing educative power based on three constructs—communication, reasoning, and connection—and then we extend the conceptualization with another two dimensions: the reciprocal facilitator-learner relationships involving educators, teachers, and students, as well as a bridge between research and practice. Based on both self-study and case-study approaches, we further elaborate features specific to the MTE-R’s educative power which includes communication using an approach of creating educative phenomenology, reasoning by mapping teachers’ ideas onto emergent models to solve problems in educative challenges, and connection between research and practice by coordination. In particular, the core of the educative power that supported the MTE-R to initiate at-the-moment actions was his insights into the essence of mathematics, and the learning of students and teachers. We believe that the conceptual framework in this study offers a powerful tool that could guide the analyses of educative power, especially for those studies related to the initiation of at-the-moment actions and the implementation of TPD programs.
