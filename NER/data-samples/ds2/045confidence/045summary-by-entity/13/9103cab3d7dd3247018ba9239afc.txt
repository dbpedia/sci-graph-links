Abstract Previous literature predicts disadvantaged groups to develop low aspirations and expectations, and has often explained high aspirations of these groups in terms of irrationality and fantasy. In this paper the educational aspirations of Palestinian students in Israel are examined using data from a representative sample of high school students. The results show that: (1) despite their disadvantage within the Israeli society, Palestinian students hold very high educational aspirations; (2) their low SES and minority status do not automatically lead to low educational aspirations; and (3) educational aspirations of students are highly associated with their social capital and perceptions. Specifically, the data suggest that students' perceptions of the importance of education and of the available opportunities for success within the education system and the job market determine whether the minority students develop high educational aspirations or adopt low ones. These results are discussed in the light of the unique social, economic and political context of the Palestinian community in Israel.
