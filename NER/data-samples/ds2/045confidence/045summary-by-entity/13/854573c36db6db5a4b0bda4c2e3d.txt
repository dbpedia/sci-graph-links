Abstract Schunk (1983) found in his study with U.S. students that teachers' ability feedback (“You're good at this”) had a stronger motivational effect on students' learning than that focusing on effort (“You've been working hard”). The present experimental study examined such differential effects of attributional feedback on 386 elementary and high school Chinese students who were brought up in a culture where effort and endurance were strongly emphasized. Generally, the results with elementary students (Grade 4) replicated Schunk's findings. Mutual reinforcement effects also showed that effort and ability feedbacks combined led to the highest perceived effort expenditure.
