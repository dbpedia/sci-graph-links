Abstract In this paper we will introduce the concept of adjoint methods and some properties of them. We will show that there is a self-adjoint scheme of even order corresponding to every method. Using the self-adjoint schemes with lower order, we can construct higher order schemes by “composing” a method, and this constructing process can be continued to get arbitrary even order schemes. The “composing” method presented here can be used to non-symplectic schemes as well as symplectic ones.
