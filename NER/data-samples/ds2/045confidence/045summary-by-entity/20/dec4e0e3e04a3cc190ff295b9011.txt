Abstract Male field crickets produce calling songs that are used for attracting conspecific females for mating. Acoustic communication was studied in the trilling field cricket, Gryllus rubens.A “trilled” calling song consists of a continuous train of sound pulses, each of which was repeated at a stereotyped rate. Singing males were recorded at different temperatures. The pulse period of the calling song decreased with increasing temperature; there was less effect of temperature on pulse duration. Female phonotaxis was studied on a noncompensating, spherical treadmill. In two-stimulus (choice) playback experiments, females preferred the conspecific “trilled” song over the “chirped” calling song of a sympatric species, Gryllus fultoni.This preference persisted even when the song of G. fultoniwas 6 dB louder. Females also discriminated between synthetic trills having different pulse periods; females chose trills with the conspecific pulse period over trills having lower and higher pulse periods.
