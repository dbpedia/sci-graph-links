Abstract Career decision-making difficulties (CDMD) are often faced by students entering their final year of high school, and can further complicate when a student belongs to a minority group, such as a linguistic minority (Francophone) within an Anglo-dominant society (Ontario, Canada). The current study aimed to examine CDMD in 984 Franco-Ontarian grade 12 students attending French-language secondary schools. Findings, obtained through the comparison of four linguistic identity groups, revealed that students self-identifying as predominantly Francophone tended to report the least CDMD. Results are discussed in terms of future research and implications.
