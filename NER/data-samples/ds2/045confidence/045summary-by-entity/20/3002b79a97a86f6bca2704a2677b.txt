Abstract Although focus on linguistic and cultural variables in education has been a priority at the federal level, few empirical papers reporting experimental analyses of the influence of these variables have been published. The goal of this special issue is to highlight recent experimental analyses of cultural or linguistic variables on student behavior or academic performance and to illustrate the challenges in translating an applied behavior analytic approach across languages and cultures. The special issue is comprised of studies that address three issues relevant to behavioral education: (1) comparative effects of providing academic instruction or addressing challenging behavior of children with intellectual and developmental disorders in English or their home language of Spanish, (2) delivering effective instructional practices with students from diverse racial and cultural groups, and (3) considerations regarding the translation of applied behavior analysis in education for adoption in a different language and culture.
