Abstract Using a modified version of Furstenbergâ€™s suggested definition of tangential distality, a differentiable analogue of the Furstenberg Structure Theorem for distal transformation groups is proved. Examples are given which show tangential distality is of a rather different character to distality. Conditions are given under which tangential distality implies distality.
