A is said to be 2-code annihilated by a language B if AB is a 2-code. Such a language B is called a 2-code annihilator of A. The concept of 2-code annihilators is a generalization of the concept of Q-annihilators where Q is the family of languages consisting of primitive words. We investigate the 2-code annihilators of languages. A characterization of languages 2-code annihilated by every singleton set {u} where u is a non-empty word is obtained. We also characterize the case of when the catenation of two languages is a 2-code.
