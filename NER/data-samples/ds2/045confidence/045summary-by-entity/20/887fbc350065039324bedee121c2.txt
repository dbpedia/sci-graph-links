F and A be families of languages and let $\\circ$ be a binary operation of languages over an alphabet X where |X| $\\geq$ 2. A language B $\\subseteq$ X + is called a right F-annihilator of A if A $\\circ$ B $\\in$ F for every A $\\in$ A We discover some general concepts and results on F-annihilators in this paper. In particular, we investigate the P-annihilators and the D-annihilators of languages, where P and D are the family of prefix codes and the family of disjunctive languages over X, respectively. The D-annihilators of the dense regular language X + are studied in their own right and as examples of D-annihilators. A language A is a disjunctive core if the catenation AB is disjunctive for every non-empty language B. Clearly, the family of all disjunctive cores is closed under catenation. We show that the set Q c of all non-primitive words over X is a disjunctive core.
