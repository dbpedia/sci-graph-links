Abstract It is well known by the strong multiplicity one that π is uniquely determined by the Satake parameter c(π, v) for almost all v. Also, it suffices for us to test only finitely many v. We proved some S-effective version of multiplicity one theorems. Roughly speaking, if π and π′ are not equivalent, then there is also a bound $$\\mathfrak{N}(S)$$ which is some expression in terms of K, d and max(N(π), N(π′)), which are analytic conductor of π and π′, respectively (will be defined soon), such that there is a v ∉ S with π v ≌ π′ v and $$N\\mathfrak{p}_v < \\mathfrak{N}$$. We also proved S-effective multiplicity one for the Chebotarev Density Theorem, and for GL(1).
