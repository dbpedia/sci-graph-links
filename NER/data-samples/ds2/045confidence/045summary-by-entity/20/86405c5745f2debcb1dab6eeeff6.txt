Abstract. We present the development of the Lucid language from the Original Lucid of the mid-1970s to the TransLucid of today. Each successive version of the language has been a generalisation of previous languages, but with a further understanding of the problems at hand. The Original Lucid (1976), originally designed for purposes of formal verification, was used to formalise the iteration in while-loop programs. The pLucid language (1982) was used to describe dataflow networks. Indexical Lucid (1987) was introduced for intensional programming, in which the semantics of a variable was understood as a function from a universe of possible worlds to ordinary values. With TransLucid, and the use of contexts as firstclass values, programming can be understood in a Cartesian framework.
