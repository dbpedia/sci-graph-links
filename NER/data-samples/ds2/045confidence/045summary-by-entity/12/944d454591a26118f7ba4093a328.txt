Abstract The world is experiencing a growing problem with a range of diseases collectively referred to as sick building syndrome. This problem results from a combination of tightened buildings, large scale use of man-made materials, and modern offices full of devices emitting noxious and toxic vapors. The state of knowledge about sick building syndrome has increased greatly in recent years. However, knowledge of these advances is not yet widespread. From an engineering perspective, solutions to sick building problems are not being held up by a lack of technological capability, but rather by a lack of awareness of the knowledge base that is available. From a policy perspective, the range of strategies that exist beyond increased regulatory control are not commonly appreciated. It is to these shortcomings that this paper is addressed. Hopefully, this overview of recent advances in engineering technology and policy making will help to improve our responses to this expanding problem.
