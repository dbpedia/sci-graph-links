Abstract TheE-optimality of the following designs within the class of all proper and connected designs with givenb, k andv under mixed effects model are established.i)A group divisible design with 位2 = 位1 + 1.ii)A group divisible design with 位1 = 位2 + 1 and group size 2.iii)A linked block design.iv)The dual of design (i)v)The dual of design (ii). All these designs are known to satisfy the same optimality property under fixed effects model whenk
v. From the results proved here, theE-optimality of designs (ii, (iii), (iv) and (v) under fixed effects model in the situation whenk >v also follows.
