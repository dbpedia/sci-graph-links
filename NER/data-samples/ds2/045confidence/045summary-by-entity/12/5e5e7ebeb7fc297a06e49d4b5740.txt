Abstract The functional design of buildings is discussed with particular reference to thermal and ventilation considerations. Brief reference is made to indoor environmental conditions in both conditioned and unconditioned buildings. The lack of useful information with respect to the effects of directional radiation in warm climates is emphasized. A method is outlined for a more rational assessment of outdoor meteorological conditions in terms of the probability of joint occurrence of various combinations of meteorological elements. The influence of structural design on the thermal performance of buildings is discussed in terms of the diurnal variation of outdoor air temperature and solar radiation fluxes. The need of ceiling insulation is specifically stressed.
