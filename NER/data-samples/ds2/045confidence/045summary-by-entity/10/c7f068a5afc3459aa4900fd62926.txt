Comparative analysis of the diffuse reflectance spectra (300–2100 nm) and of the integrated absorption factor of coatings based on micropowders, nanopowders, and micropowders modified with Al2O3 nanopowders has been performed. In addition, the changes in the spectra resulting from electron irradiation of the powders with energies of 30 keV at a fluence of up to 3∙16 cm–2 have been analyzed. It has been found that the diffuse reflectance decreases in order of coatings based on micro-powders, nano-powders and modified powders, while radiation resistance increases in order of coatings based on nano-powders, modified and micropowders.
