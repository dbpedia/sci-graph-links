Abstract Fiber-based devices for operation in fully optical networks are relatively large in size and can not be used in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). We have developed an efficient graphene-based nanophotonic switching nanocell, working in linear regime (cross state) and in non-linear regime (bar state) with relatively low optical power, so that they can be cascaded and integrated in PICs. Indeed, that device is a fully optical switch, which can work in dense wavelength division multiplexing systems.
