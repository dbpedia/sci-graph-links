Abstract The static and dynamic behavior of a curved single-walled carbon nanotube which is under twist–bending couple based on nonlocal theory is analyzed. The nonlocal theory is used to model the mechanical behavior of structure in small scale. The obtained differential equations are solved using a simply supported boundary condition and Navier analytical method. Moreover the twisted vibration and bending of curved nanotube is analyzed and also the armchair model is assumed in this study. The following parameters were studied in this paper: the effect of nonlocal parameter, the curved nanotube’s opening angel, the Young’s modulus and the mode number is studied. The results were verified with the previous literature which showed an excellent agreement. The results of this paper can be used as a benchmark for future investigations.
