Abstract To characterize the local low-level circulation in the Tyrrhenian Sea coastal area near Rome, the wind velocity field observed by Doppler sodar operating in the Estate of Castelporziano, has been studied. The prevailing diurnal behavior of the wind speed and wind direction as a function of the season was highlighted for the winter and the summer 2007. Two different patterns of the local circulation can be alternately observed in the night to early morning and after the sunset to late evening. The data analysis has shown that the statistical distribution of wind direction during the night, in winter, presents great occurrence at low levels in the northeastern sector and around 100Â°. Moreover, it has been observed that the nocturnal components of the wind direction at low-level changes with the height, and these changes can be associated with the effects induced by the large-scale flow on the local circulation at higher levels.
