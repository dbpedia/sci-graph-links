Abstract The arrangement of matter in the earth has been studied from the point of view of density gradation. The recently discovered Cryoscopic Effect has been applied to the subject. Cryoscopic experiments conducted on mixtures of solid solutes and of liquid solutes point to the conclusion that the layers of matter in the earth generally follow the orderly pattern and abide by the natural phenomenon exhibited by the Cryoscopic Effect, and are positioned according to theirDispersion Ratios (a new fundamental property of solutes, and a revealingly new physical unit coined for the purpose) rather than the molecular weights of the components.
