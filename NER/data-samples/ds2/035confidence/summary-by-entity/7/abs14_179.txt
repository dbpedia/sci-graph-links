Abstract This paper describes the content and logical structure of an engineering data base, to be constructed from direct technical information, for use with input-output (IO) models of the national economy. These models, which until now have relied almost exclusively on accounting information describing past economic transactions, can now be extended to analyze the future prospects for the U.S. economy and its individual sectors in terms of detailed technical decisions taken at the sites of production. The basic IO data base describes each sector's input in terms of its use of given amounts of goods and services produced in all sectors, per unit of its output. The new data base will distinguish the individual activities carried out within a sector, specify the important technical alternatives for each activity, and describe each alternative in terms of inputs of the required goods and services. The structure of the new data base accommodates the quantification of both production and “overhead” activities and their integration, and its implementation in stages is facilitated by the fact that it is a generalization of the structure of existing IO data bases.
