Abstract A new approach is considered to processing interlaboratory test data resulting from several different values for the measured quantity. There is a basic method for the simultaneous estimation of the additive and multiplicative components of the total error, which employs covariance analysis. It is shown that if one of the components is not identified reliably, one can transfer to one of the two models in variance analysis.
