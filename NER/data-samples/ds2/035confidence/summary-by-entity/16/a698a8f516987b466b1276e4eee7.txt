Abstract This paper explores how women construct meaning around their abortion experiences in retrospect. It does so by offering profiles of four women who participated in a larger study examining various facets of the abortion experience. The four individuals profiled demonstrate some of the diversity in women's retrospecitive accounts of their abortion experiences, and they are representative of a sample of twenty women in this way. Drawing on Dorothy Smith's (Smith, 1987) ideas concerning a sociology for women that “creates space for an absent subject,” this paper demonstrates that women's retrospective accounts of their abortion experiences can inform and transform our politicized abortion discourse. Rather than allow women's narratives to be used by debate factions, I argue for the need to recognize that these narratives can broaden our understanding of the abortion experience.
