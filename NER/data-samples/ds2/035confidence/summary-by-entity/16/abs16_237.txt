Abstract. Measurement and testing are of fundamental importance to science, technology and the economy. There is no science without measurements, no quality without testing and no global market without standards. This article tries to look into the future for the testing community. Based on the anticipated changes in the environment for the testing activities a prediction of the coming technical development as well as acceptance of test results is given. Also the future of accreditation is discussed.
