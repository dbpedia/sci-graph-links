Conclusion Intersections of class, race, of culture and of gender are unavoidable and at the same time, highly politicised. The objective ofInterethnic Families is to foreground these intersections, positioning them within a sociological framework which acknowledges the impact of new times on identity, community and nation. I believe that the cultural and racial shift made visible by theInterethnic Families project and embodied in the lives of interethnic families—a shift which takes us beyond unproblematic notions of multiculturalism—is a fait accompli. Thousands of interethnic families and creolised cultural practices and identities are already altering the cultural and racial landscape of Australia. Their increasing presence and the emergence of a discourse of cultural and racial politics, presents an interesting challenge to policy-makers and educators alike. The Australia which these families have the potential to create is the Australia I hope for myself and other Australians: a country which has moved beyond the conceptual boundaries of multiculturalism and the static notions of community, ethnicity and race which underpin it.Interethnic Families represents a concerted attempt to reveal a pathway towards this awareness and a substantive reconfiguration of our cultural narratives.
