Abstract George Bowles and Thomas Gilbert claim that illatives such as ‘so’, ‘therefore’, and ‘hence’ convey the meaning that the premise confers upon the conclusion a probability greater than 1/2. This claim is false, for there are straightforward uses of these illatives that do not convey the meaning that the probability is greater than 1/2. In addition, because Bowles' and Gilbert's claim is false, a revision of their definition of argument is required.
