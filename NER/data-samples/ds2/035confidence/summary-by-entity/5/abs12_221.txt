Abstract In this paper, an optimization method based on adaptive dynamic programming is developed to improve the electricity consumption of rooms in office buildings through optimal battery management. Rooms in office buildings are generally divided into office rooms, computer rooms, storage rooms, meeting rooms, etc., and each category of rooms have different characteristics of electricity consumption, which is divided into electricity consumption from sockets, lights and air-conditioners in this paper. The developed method based on action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming is explained in detail, and different optimization strategies of electricity consumption in different categories of rooms are proposed in accordance with the developed method. Finally, a detailed case study on an office building is given to demonstrate the practical effect of the developed method.
