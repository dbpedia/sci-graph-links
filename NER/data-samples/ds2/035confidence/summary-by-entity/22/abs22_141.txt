Summary This contribution is neither a cosmetic “facelifting” of an old but loved and admired lady nor is it an advertisement for “Selling new lamps for old“. It is simply a trial to clarify the actual situation and position of analytical chemistry and its paradigmatic change to analytics and its general role in our building of knowledge of nature. Taken this essay in this sense, it is a contribution to the most relevant question: how do we study the nature and what is the validity of knowledge.
