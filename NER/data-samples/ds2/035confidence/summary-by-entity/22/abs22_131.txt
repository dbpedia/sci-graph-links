Abstract An attempt to produce a continuous creation theory by adapting the Brans-Dicke theory is described. The universe is seen to be created out of self-contained gravitational, scalar, and matter fields. However, the solution of the one-body problem reveals unsatisfactory characteristics of the theory, and in particular the principle of equivalence is severely violated. A second theory is described which retains the attractive features of the first theory and which does not fall foul of its objections. There do exist empirical tests for the theory which are described and which will require further examination. In the limit this theory approaches general relativity in every respect.
