Abstract Prior research on the effectiveness of ethics education has yielded mixed results. In this sample of 686 employed adults, we found the majority felt there was little or no emphasis on ethics in their undergraduate program, and they felt poorly prepared to deal with ethical dilemmas at work. Among business, sciences, and liberal arts majors, those who majored in the sciences reported the lowest level of preparation for dealing with ethics issues. Management and law classes were the ones most frequently recalled by respondents as emphasizing ethics. Respondents made suggestions for improving undergraduate ethics preparation.
