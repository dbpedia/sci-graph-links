Abstract The literature is scanty concerning the clinical management of vacation-separations despite their potential for promoting either regression or therapeutic gain associated with the separation. A survey of clinical social workers highlights the range of practice philosophy and experience related to this topic. Case examples illustrate work around typical separation issues. This analysis of the clinical management of vacation-separations is grounded in the context of attachment theory, timing considerations, and separationindividuation issues.
