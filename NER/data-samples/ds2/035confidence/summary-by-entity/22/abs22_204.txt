Abstract In less than a decade, archaeologists have seen the discipline increasingly entangled in the thriving dispute concerning the political and ethical responsibility the profession has to face, in the context of contemporary armed conflict. The recent western military interventions, in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East, ensured many archaeologists and heritage professionals became more involved with military institutions. This trend was counterbalanced by the fact that other members of the academic community strongly distanced themselves from this professional choice, challenging their colleagues on ethical grounds. This paper will put the debate in a wider context, and analyse the issue from several angles, in-order to understand whether a new conceptual framework could be of help in the analysis of this ethical dilemma. The intention is to explore if, when, and under what circumstances, archaeologists should get involved with the military to protect cultural heritage. This exploration will start with the evaluation of some of the limits and contradictions intrinsic in the ideals behind international law. Then it will move towards more contextualized and politically dense considerations and give a closer look to some possible practical solutions.
