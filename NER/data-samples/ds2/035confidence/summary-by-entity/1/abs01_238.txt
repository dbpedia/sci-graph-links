Abstract  This paper is devoted to a general concept of openness and closedness with respect to arbitrary fuzzy relations â€“ along with appropriate opening and closure operators. It is shown that the proposed framework unifies existing concepts, in particular, the one for fuzzy preorderings as well as the triangular norm-based approach to fuzzy mathematical morphology.
