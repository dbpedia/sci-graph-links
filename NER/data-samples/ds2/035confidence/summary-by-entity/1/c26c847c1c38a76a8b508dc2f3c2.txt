Abstract We study the uniqueness of minimizing harmonic maps to a closed hemisphere. We are able to describe the boundary data for which there are more than one minimizer, and to describe in these cases the corresponding set of minimizers. This is a limiting case for a former result of W.JÃ¤ger and H.Kaul.
