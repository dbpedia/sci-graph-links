Summary In mid-October of last year John Kenneth Galbraith, world-famous American economist of Canadian descent and for many years Professor of Economics at Harvard University, celebrated his eightieth birthday. This paper features some of the brainchilds that made his name, for the most part laid down in popularly and very well-written best-selling books, of whichThe Affluent Society, published more than thirty years ago, has been the most influential; it comprises ideas that may regain topicality. Galbraith, who has been politically active on the left wing of the Democratic Party, is a follower of Thorstein Veblen, founding father of the typically American movement called institutionalism. He cannot pride himself upon the unqualified admiration and sympathy of his fellow-economists, whom he has often rebuffed. In spite of inadequacies in his reasoning he has enriched economic literature with some original contributions. He is still going strong and wielding his often acerbic pen.
