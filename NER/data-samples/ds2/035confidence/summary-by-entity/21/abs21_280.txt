Summary The development of Max Wertheimer's ideas about productive thinking is presented as a fable, taking its form from his own fable, “A Story of Three Days.” This development is traced from his early study of the thinking of tribal peoples to his paper of 1920 on the syllogism, and it draws on his book, Productive Thinking. In a final fable, the author very briefly surveys current work in the field of productive thinking.
