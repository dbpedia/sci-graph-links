Abstract This review draws the recent state of the art in metabolic diagnosis and metaphylaxis of stone disease. It is the basis for the consensus approval with the other medical societies and institutions in Germany involved in the guideline process of the new “Urolithiasis Guideline”. The German Working Committee on Stone Disease reviewed critically the current literature in the field of urolithiasis—including the existing German and EAU-Guidelines as well as the Conference Book of the First International Consultation on Stone Disease. As far as possible the references were rated according to the EBM criteria. On this basis the expert group discussed all pathways and statements regarding the management of stone disease. The present review coincides with the consented guideline draft of the German Working Committee on Stone Disease. Occurrence of stone disease in the western world increases seriously. Modern lifestyle, dietary habits and overweight—problems of the affluent societies—emerge to be the important promoters of the “stone-boom” in the new millennium. This even affects children, whose stone prevalence is otherwise significantly less than that of adults. Criteria for the high risk group of stone formers were clearly defined. A diagnostic standard is formulated for the basic and the elaborate metabolic evaluation of a stone patient. Approximately 75% of all stone patients could anticipate stone recurrence with elementary reorientation of their lifestyle and dietary habits, summarized as general metaphylaxis. About 25% of the stone formers require additional pharmacological intervention to normalize their individual biochemical risk, precisely compiled for each stone type as specific metaphylaxis.
