Abstract  During the last quarter of the twentieth century, The United States National Bureau of Standards (NBS), later the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), introduced a measurement quality control concept called ”measurement assurance,” and developed measurement assurance programs, or MAPs, for high-level calibration processes. The measurement assurance approach has, over time, become increasingly popular in the metrology community, and in recent years has become well accepted both inside and, to some extent, outside the United States as a rigorous way to ensure the quality of calibrations. The concept has also found application in defining traceability to national standards. This paper traces the history of the measurement assurance concept.
