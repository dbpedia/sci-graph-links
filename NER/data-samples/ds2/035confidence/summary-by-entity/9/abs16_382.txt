Abstract Universities are centuries-old institutions that inrecent times have undergone important changes as aresult of the expansion of the system of highereducation, the diversification of social demands onthe university, and the increase in public spending onhigher education. In this new context, universitieshave the opportunity to show their capacity foradaptability and their social and intellectualleadership, reacting to the new situation in acreative manner. But to do this they must accept thequality challenge, that is, the responsibilityfor showing that they can do things right and meetsociety's demands with the highest levels of qualityand efficiency. This paper presents how thischallenge must be approached in Spanishuniversities.
