Abstract Research on smart houses has mostly been focused on automation and invisible integration of technology, which may lead to a perceived loss of control and a sense of being observed. In our perspective users play an active and creative role, deliberately engaging with visible technology, not for reasons of efficiency, but rather for the fostering of social relations. In particular, we are looking at the kitchen environment, and we present the Living Cookbook. It enables people to share their cooking experiences, to educate others in the cooking practice, and to suggest a sense of presence and sociability. The cooking activity is reinterpreted as an experience, and the use of technology supports intimacy, communication, education, fun and creativity while cooking.
