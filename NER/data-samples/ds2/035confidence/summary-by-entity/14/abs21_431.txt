Abstract The transformation of Russia is inflicting a vigorous social shock that is degrading morals outside the family and significantly diminishes the sociopolitical power and protections of women and children. The great flexibility of the Russian family helps everyone cope successfully with the present ordeals of life, even as it occurs mostly at the expense of women. But even the resources, materials and morals of the family are limited, and those of Russian women are in particular jeopardy since they were summoned first and sacrifice the most to meet the present threats.
