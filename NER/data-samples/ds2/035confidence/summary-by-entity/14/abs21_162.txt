Abstract Point of care testing (POCT) of urine has been practiced for many centuries. It has come particularly into its own in the second half of the 20th century with the development of tablet- and later dipstick-testing systems. Unfortunately, it has become embedded in clinical practice outside the laboratory, missing the development of the quality culture that has developed inside the laboratory. Analysis of the results of a Urine Quality Assurance Programme demonstrate the value and the need for this quality culture.
