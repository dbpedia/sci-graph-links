Abstract We report a 14-month-old female infant with typical cutaneous larva migrans, but without a history of travelling outside Germany. Cutaneous larva migrans is most commonly observed in and imported from tropical countries. Only a few cases have been described in northern Europe. This report serves as a reminder that under certain circumstances acquisition of this “tropical” parasite is possible even in non-tropical countries.
