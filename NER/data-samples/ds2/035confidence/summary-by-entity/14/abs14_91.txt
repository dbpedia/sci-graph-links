Summary Keynesian IS-LM models assume the production of a single homogenous commodity which can either be consumed or added to an immobile capital stock. Elsewhere the short run implications of both fixed and flexible wage versions of this model were found altered when consumer and investment goods are produced in separate industries and sold for different prices. This paper reports the long run implications of such models. It turns out that qualitatively the steady state multipliers for the one and two commodity models are virtually identical.
