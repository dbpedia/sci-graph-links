Abstract Five possible relationships among speech, writing, and language are evaluated. These relationships are: that writing is related to language through the medium of speech, that speech is based on writing, that spoken and written forms of a language are decodable one to the other, that spoken and written language are related only through the single language they represent but cannot be translated one to the other without recourse to the grammar of that language, and that speech and orthography represent distinct languages. The conclusion reached is that the grammars underlying speech and writing are distinct –that they employ different conceptions of morphology and syntax – and thus may be said to represent different languages.
