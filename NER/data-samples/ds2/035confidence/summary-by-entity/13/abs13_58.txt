Abstract Despite the significance of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) in medical resident selection, there are few reports of evidence-based medical school advising programs for the USMLE and similar exams. Here, we describe a reproducible 10-step evidence-based, student-led process for developing an exam advising program, centered around a local needs assessment, literature review, multi-year study behaviors survey linked to meaningful score outcomes, and intentional dissemination of data to students. Student leadership promoted improved response rates, dissemination of findings, and student-centered programming. This 10-step approach is generalizable to development of advising programs for any standardized medical examination.
