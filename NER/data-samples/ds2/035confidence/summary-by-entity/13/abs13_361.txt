Abstract Here, we propose a presentation-based meta-learning scheme. Firstly, we present support functions that we embed into the system. Secondly, we conduct experiments to verify the meaningfulness of our learning scheme. These suggest that the system can stimulate learners to reflect on their learning processes. Furthermore, the scheme can stimulate learnersâ€™ meta-learning communication. The results show that users tightened their criteria when evaluating their own learning processes and understanding states. It is useful for learners to facilitate changes in their learning processes.
