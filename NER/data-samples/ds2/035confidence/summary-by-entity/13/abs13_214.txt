Conclusion I have tried, broadly, to describe the three interrelated contexts in which UPE's policy framework for transformation was cast. I did this from the perspective of our own learning experience. Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living. Worldwide, and especially in South Africa, increasingly the unexamined university will not be worth surviving. The diminishing influence and credibility of universities will only be countered when organizations of so-called ‘higher learning’ become ‘learning organizations’ — organizations that, in the true spirit of Socratic self-examination, critical openness, and rational debate, and in solidarity and cooperation with their partners and stakeholders, are prepared to keep on learning about what it means to be a university in these times in a country that is itself a classroom in which a lot still has to be learned.
