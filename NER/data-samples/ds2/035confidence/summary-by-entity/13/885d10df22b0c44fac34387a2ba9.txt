Abstract AimThe present research aimed to investigate:1.How well prepared the student thought they were for their first visit to a health centre2.What had they done to enhance their preparedness3.How confident they felt they were to ask the required questions4.The student’s opinion about the extent to which two courses taken prior to the community visit had prepared them for the visits Subject and methodsA questionnaire consisting of 11 items was completed by 131 second-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students from the Faculty of Medical Sciences. The data were treated with chi-square (χ 2). ResultsThe majority of the students (84.7 %) responded that they had prepared for the visit. Most of those who had not prepared were those who entered with high school qualifications. The differences were not statistically significant (χ 2 = 2.739; p > .05). The differences for what the students did to prepare themselves were not significant by gender, except for the category “discussed with peers” (χ 2 = 7.165; p < .01). The most important thing the students (26.5 %) believed they would learn from the early clinical experience was ‘how to communicate effectively with the patients’. ConclusionThe majority of the students had prepared themselves for the experience and hoped, most of all to learn how to interact with patients and communicate effectively with them.
