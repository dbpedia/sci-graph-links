Abstract This paper is mainly about cooperation as a collective action in a group context (acting in a position or participating in the performance of a group task, etc.), although the assumption of the presence of a group context is not made in all parts of the paper. The paper clarifies what acting as a group member involves, and it analytically characterizes the ‘‘we-mode’’ (thinking and acting as a group member) and the ‘‘I-mode’’ (thinking and acting as a private person). The main task of the paper is to clarify cooperation, and this is done by dividing cooperation into I-mode and we-mode cooperation. I-mode cooperation relies on the participants’ relevantly adjusting their goals toward others’ goals and actions to the benefit of all participants. We-mode cooperation basically amounts to joint action in the we-mode. These kinds of cooperation are also connected to the respective kinds of acting as a group member. The paper also investigates the relationship between cooperation and trust and, basically, argues that a two-way connection is involved.
