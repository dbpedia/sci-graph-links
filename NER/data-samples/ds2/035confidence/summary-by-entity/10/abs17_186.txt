Abstract For the equation $$L[u]: = K(y)u_{xx}   u_{yy}   r(x,y)u = f(x,y)$$ (K (y)⪋0 whenevery⪋0) inG, bounded by a piecewise smooth curveΓ 0 fory>0 which intersects the liney=0 at the pointsA(−1, 0) andB(1, 0) and fory<0 by a smooth curveΓ 1 throughA which meets the characteristic of (1) throughB at the pointP, the uniqueness of the Frankl-Morawetz problem is proved without assuming thatΓ 1 is monotone.
