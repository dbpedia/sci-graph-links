Abstract Mate retention behaviors are designed to reduce the likelihood of partner infidelity and relationship termination. Measures of mate retention historically have focused on individual mate retention—behaviors that individuals perform alone. The current research explores coalitional mate retention (CMR)—mate retention with assistance from allies. Using an act nomination procedure, we constructed the CMR Inventory (CMRI) to assess specific CMR behaviors. In study 1, participants (n = 100) provided open-ended responses in which they nominated CMR behaviors. In study 2, participants (n = 387) provided frequency reports on the 44 CMR behaviors identified in study 1. We conducted principal component analyses to guide construction of the CMRI, which assesses seven components of CMRI: manipulation (e.g., “got my partner drunk to see what my partner said”), praise (e.g., “said nice things about me when my partner and other people were around”), vigilance (e.g., “observed how my partner acted around people interested in my partner”), monopolizing time (e.g., “accompanied my partner to a party”), therapy (e.g., “told my partner how much I liked my partner”), gifts (e.g., “told me what gifts my partner wanted”), and violence (e.g., “hit someone who was flirting with my partner”). Discussion highlights the limitations of focusing exclusively on individual mate retention and the importance of considering alliances when researching mate retention.
