Previous studies have demonstrated that the types of spatial-figurative and verbal-logical tasks performed by subjects can be discriminated using a trained classifier analyzing EEG power spectral characteristics individual to each subject. We report here studies using a subset of the same tasks but directed to detecting differences in EEG spectral power associated with the nature of the tasks, common to the group of subjects (31 subjects). Contrasting distributions of statistically significant differences by frequency range coincided qualitatively with the rankings of ranges based on assessments of the effectiveness of the recognition of the type of activity using the trained classifier, except for the theta range. Comparison of general (group) and individual measures showed a more significant level of involvement of the mechanisms of semantic memory in solving verbal tasks and possible differences in the balance of internal and external attention on performance of verbal-logical and spatial-figurative activity.
