Abstract Since previous research suggested that modeling is a more important predictor of children's academic/scholastic self-efficacy (comprising efficacy and response-outcome expectations) than performance accomplishments, the present study reexamines this issue. Subjects, 358 schoolchildren (Mage = 10.58 years), completed the children's scholastic self-efficacy and Intelligence Achievement Responsibility Scales, while their mean grade score was obtained. Their teachers completed the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale. Multiple regression showed that performance accomplishments with feedback was a more effective determinant of efficacy and responseoutcome expectations than modeling. Also, age and attributional style mediated the influence of performance accomplishments on efficacy and outcome expectations, attributional style interacted with modeling in predicting efficacy expectations, while age interacted with performance accomplishments and modeling in explaining outcome expectations. These results support self-efficacy predictions.
