Abstract Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) students are likely to be in every classroom in every secondary school in the United States; yet, their needs are often overlooked. LGBTQ students are at risk for developing academic, social, and emotional problems due to harassment and bullying experienced at school. Although schools have an ethical and legal duty to provide a safe educational experience for all students, few schools implement policies and programs to support LGBTQ students. School psychologists, with training in adolescent development, counseling, consultation, and systems change, are in a unique position to help schools be more responsive to the needs of LGBTQ students. By adopting a public health framework that focuses on primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of prevention and intervention for LGBTQ students, school psychologists can implement strategies and make recommendations for school-wide changes to promote positive development for all students. This article highlights challenges faced by LGBTQ students and presents methods for responding to the needs of this minority group using the public health framework.
