Abstract This study examined the relationships between the cognitive processes of rapid naming and phonological processing and various literacy skills. Variables measured and used in this analysis were phonological processing, rapid naming, reading comprehension, isolated and nonsense word reading, and spelling. Data were collected from 65 second-to-fifth grade children referred for learning difficulties. Regression analysis was performed to determine which of the cognitive processes was the strongest predictor of the literacy skills measured. Rapid naming was found to be a stronger predictor of word reading, reading comprehension and spelling than was phonological processing. When a measure of decoding skills was included as a predictor, it was found to account for the most variance in word reading and spelling. The implications of these results for assessing and designing interventions with reading disabled children are discussed as well as the need to further investigate the double deficit hypothesis.
