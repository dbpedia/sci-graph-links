Summary When the strand was stretched during isometric tension force measurement or loaded with a higher tension during isotonic length measurement, the amplitude of the oscillation was augmented. But these treatments did not change the period or shift the phase of the cycle. When the strand was stretched instantaneously by as much as 30–50�f the whole length, the oscillation in tension production became irregular or even disappeared for a while. Nevertheless, the waves recovered subsequently were found in the phase which was anticipated through extrapolation from the waves before stretching. These facts suggest the presence of a latent cycle, a phase which advances independently of the externally applied forces.
