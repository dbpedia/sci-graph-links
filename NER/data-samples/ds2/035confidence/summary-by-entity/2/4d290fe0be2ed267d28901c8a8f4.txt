Abstract. Light proton-rich bound and unbound nuclei were produced by means of stripping reactions of secondary beams of 20Mg and 18Ne. The decays of the unbound nuclei 18,19Na have been measured by detecting their decay products 17,18Ne and one proton and by performing an invariant-mass reconstruction. For 18Na, the present work is the first measurement of its decay. As the decay scheme of this nucleus could not be determined, two possible scenarios are proposed and discussed. In addition, the decay of excited states in 17Ne via two-proton emission was observed. The proton-proton angular distribution is isotropic for the first two-proton-emitting states, whereas higher-lying states seem to decay by a correlated two-proton emission, consistent with a 2He emission pattern for part of the decay strength.
