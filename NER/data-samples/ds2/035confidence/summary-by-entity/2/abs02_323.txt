Summary Alpha-particle-induced reactions on the target element gold were investigated from 30 to 75 MeV, using stacked-foil activation technique and Ge(Li) gamma-ray spectroscopy method. Six excitation functions for reactions of the type197Au(α,xn),x=1–3,197Au(α, 2pn) and197Au(α, αxn),x=1–3, were studied, of which five new data points and a new reaction were added to the existing data. The experimental cross-section were compared with the predictions of pre-equilibrium hybrid model, as well as the more recent index model using the initial exciton number,n 0=4(4p0h). It was observed that both models show better agreement in respect of (α,xn)-type reactions. However, they are equally bad for the reactions emitting protons and alpha-particles, and for which some direct reaction contributions are indicated.
