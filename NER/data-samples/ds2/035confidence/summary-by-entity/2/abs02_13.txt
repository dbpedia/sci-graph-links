Abstract The reaction p¯p → p¯pπ π−. has been studied with high statistics at CERN-LEAR with incident p¯ momenta from 1.65 to 2.0 GeV/c by the JETSET (PS202) experiment. The aim of this paper is to search for narrow resonances decaying to p¯p. No evidence for such structures is found. In particular, an upper limit for the production of a 2.02 GeV state with a width of Γ = 20 MeV, having been seen in other hadroproduction experiments, is established. Our results restrict the cross section for such a peak to be below 200 nb at the 95�onfidence level.
