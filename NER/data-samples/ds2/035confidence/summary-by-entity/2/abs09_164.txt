Summary The relations governing the effect of age on a constitutive theory are developed. The general constitutive framework for an aging material is reviewed using a phenomenological approach. An age-temperature shift principle is developed by assuming that increasing the temperature reduces the aging time necessary to obtain a given material state. A formulation for aging in a transient temperature environment is also derived. Specific constitutive equations are developed for materials admitting aging effects. The resulting theory is related to existing experimental evidence throughout and it is shown to apply to the annealing of metals and to precipitation hardening. This general approach also provides a method for performing accelerated aging experiments thereby reducing the complications that arise in extended time tests.
