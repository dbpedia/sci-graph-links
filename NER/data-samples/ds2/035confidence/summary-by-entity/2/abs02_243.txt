Abstract Previously, high-intensity triboplasma was discovered in the rear outside gap of the sliding contact by measuring the triboluminescence. However, we have almost no information on the triboplasma generation inside of the sliding contact. This is because the intensity of the photon emission from the inside of the sliding contact is too weak to be detected compared to that from the high-intensity rear outside plasma. On the other hand, plasma generated at the front outside of the contact was also difficult to observe since the intensity was also so weak. In the present article, the author investigated the triboplasma generation at the inside, front outside and very vicinity of the sliding contact together with the rear outside of the sliding contact by measuring the two-dimensional images and intensities of the UV, visible and IR photons emitted from the sliding contact while sliding a diamond pin with a 4-mm tip radius on a sapphire disk in dry sliding in dry air under a normal force of 2 N and a sliding velocity of 34 cm/s. The results showed that extremely weak triboplasma is generated even in the small asperity gap of the sliding contact, that the sliding contact is surrounded by weak circular plasma and that weak plasma is generated further in the front of the sliding contact. Namely, four kinds of triboplasma were observed inside and outside of the sliding contact including the previously reported rear outside high-intensity plasma, (1) weak front outside plasma, (2) weaker circular outside plasma surrounding the contact, (3) weakest inside plasma and (4) high-intensity plasma, visible at the rear outside of the contact. Based on the experimental results, a new model of triboelectromagnetic phenomena has been proposed.
