Summary Structural, mechanical and electrical properties of 99.994�l sheets have been observed with respect to cold work and recovery degree. According to the percentage reduction by rolling, both mechanical and structural properties develop following three distinct stages. In the first stage the dislocations are spread all over in the crystal; in the second stage there is a development of subgrains, and in the third stage the subgrain size tends to a limit value. During recovery two stages were noted, the first corresponding to subboundaries development, the second to subcrystal growth. The first stage, attributed to dislocation climb, is characterised by an activation energy 1.1 eV. Between subgrain dimensiond and hardnessH, a dependenceH∝d −0.1 is found. From electrical measurements there appeared a contribution to electrical resistivity per unit dislocation of ~ 4.l0-19 ohm·cm.
