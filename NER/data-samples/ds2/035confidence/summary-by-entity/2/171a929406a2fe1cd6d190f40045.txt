Summary  The properties of a passive vibration absorber with dry friction significantly differ from those of the classical linear absorber. The exceptional phenomenon is the possibility of suppressing all excited modes. This effect is influenced to a small extent by a special shape of the friction characteristic, but mainly by an appropriately adjusted threshold of the static friction. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental investigations.
