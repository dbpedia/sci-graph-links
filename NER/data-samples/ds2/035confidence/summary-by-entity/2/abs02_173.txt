Abstract Three-nucleon system dynamics can be investigated quantitatively by comparing observables calculated with the use of Faddeev equations with results of precise measurements. Proper description of the experimental data can be achieved only if the dynamical models include, in addition to the nucleon-nucleon interaction, subtle effects of suppressed degrees of freedom, effectively introduced by means of genuine three-nucleon forces. A large set of high precision, exclusive cross-section data for the 1H(d,pp)n breakup reaction at 130Â MeV contributes significantly to constrain the physical assumptions underlying the theoretical interaction models. Comparison of nearly 1,800 cross section data points with the predictions using nuclear interactions generated in various ways, allowed to establish importance of including both, the three-nucleon and the Coulomb forces to significantly improve the description of the whole data set.
