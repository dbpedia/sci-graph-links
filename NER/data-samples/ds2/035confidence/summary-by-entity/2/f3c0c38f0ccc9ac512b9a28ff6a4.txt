Abstract Absorption spectra of Ar clusters containing between 10 and 106 atoms are dominated by strong transitions into bulk and surface states. The intensity variation of bulk and surface excitations is analyzed within a model, which divides the cluster into a surface layer and into an interior part. The thickness of the surface layer is determined by the intensity ratio of bulk and surface excitations. For then=2, 2â€² excitons a reasonable value ranging between the radius of then=2 exciton and the nearest neighbour distance is obtained. In case of then=1 excitons the thickness of the surface layer is much smaller than the nearest-neighbour distance indicating that then=1 surface excitons might be interpreted as excitations of atoms on the cluster surface.
