Abstract The articles in this special issue “Law Without Justice” are reviewed. Although (like many other students of employee rights) the authors did not conceptualize rights adequately, they advanced understanding of employee rights by linking the analysis of concrete rights to the larger social context. Further, by directing attention to the processes of social construction which affect the relationship betweende jure andde facto rights, the articles help to fill an important gap in the existing literature. Some implications for research on employee rights (and applied social science more generally) driven by social issues rather than theories are explored.
