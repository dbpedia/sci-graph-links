Summary Visual acuity was measured with grating test patterns that had areas of 1, 5 or 25 cm2. When subjects were instructed to adjust the viewing distance so that all parts of the grating appeared clear, the smaller gratings were visible at greater distances. However, when subjects were asked to adjust the distance so that they could identify the orientation of the grating, stimulus area had little effect on acuity. The apparent loss of acuity for larger test patterns that was found when the first criterion was used resembles the loss of acuity in the parafoveal retina, and therefore is probably a result of requiring the subject to use peripheral regions of his retina, rather than a consequence of the phenomenal spreading of the lines in small gratings.
