Abstract The technical, operational, legal-political, and management aspects of sanitary sewer overflows associated with non-NPDES entities were investigated. The identification of the parameters contributing to sanitary sewer overflows was focused on wet-weather conditions. Such conditions include rainfall-induced infiltration and inflow (RDII), and increased attention was given to infiltration and inflow (I/I) sources located on private property. The study also included a reference to historical and current approaches and solutions to private-property I/I, with emphasis on local ordinances, NPDES authority, and equity of corrective actions. Telephone surveys to municipalities and agencies working in the field were performed, to retrieve new information and innovating approaches. Rehabilitation of central collection systems alone can reduce I/I by an average of 30�Although the concern is essentially legal and political when dealing with private-property owners, a comprehensive rehabilitation effort extended on private property can reduce I/I by as much as 90�prefix=
