Conclusion In our opening remarks we noted the emphasis on the tools of computer-oriented music research prevailing in most writing. It is not likely that this situation will change for some time. It is apparent that there is a wide variety of computer applications being tested in music research and equally apparent that there is only limited collaboration and limited effort at devising common procedures. It is to be hoped that the future will see the acceptance of one music representation as a lingua franca; the development of widely usable programs with a central clearing house for such programs; and the development of data banks of encoded music scores, thematic indices of various repertories, and other information useful to the music researcher.
