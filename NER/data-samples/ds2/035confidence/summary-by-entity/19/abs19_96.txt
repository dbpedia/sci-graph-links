Abstract This paper presents the conceptualization of an event space of interaction. Referring to enchantment as a means of describing an indeterminate and evolving state of interaction, where the meaning of the interactive object or environment remains open ended and exploratory, this paper explores how contemporary architectural concepts of space and inhabitation can allow for a new framing of interactive experiences. Presenting the two dance-architectures The Changing Room and Sea Unsea as case studies, the paper seeks to demonstrate challenges to the way space and place are understood in Humanâ€“Computer Interaction.
