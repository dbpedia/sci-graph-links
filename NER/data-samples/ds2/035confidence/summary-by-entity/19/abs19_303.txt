Abstract During the relatively brief nascence of the field of dance/movement therapy (DMT), issues of research have both drawn attention and provoked contention. While the need for research inquiry is now commonly accepted and advocated, traditional scientific methods (quantitative—experimental designs involving statistical procedures) are sometimes viewed as inappropriate to a process oriented form such as DMT. With the burgeoning of the social sciences, other alternatives have evolved including amplification of scientific methods and, importantly, phenomenologic models (namely, qualitative—interpretative, content oriented—research). The latter substantially augments the possibilities of investigative research in the healing arts. This paper highlights the two distinctive investigative paradigms (i.e., scientific and phenomenologic), examining them in relation to the spectrum of alternatives applicable to dance/movement and other creative arts therapies. The conceptual and methodological frameworks of the respective models are explained and compared, including examples of how and under what conditions the approaches are typically employed. Likewise, common research issues (e.g., validity and reliability) are identified and discussed. Finally, these contrasting approaches are presented as potentially mutually enhancing rather than mutually exclusive models of research inquiry.
