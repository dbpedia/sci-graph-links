Abstract The growth and development of anesthesiology in the twenty-first century will likely depend on two major factors: our vision for the specialty in the future and our ability to implement an anesthesia education plan that will foster the achievement of that vision. The foundation of effective anesthesia education must be built on an understanding of the past and an analysis of the present but, most importantly, it must be shaped by our vision for the future. Focus on the future is essential, for it is remarkably easy to teach others as we were taught, or as we practice today. Unfortunately, the easy path will not foster the advancement of the specialty or develop the leaders for the future. The comments that follow are not a prescription for success. Rather, they are intended to stimulate discussion and planning regarding the future of anesthesiology, leading to a course of action that will enhance the development of the specialty. Long-term success for the specialty will depend on our efforts in undergraduate and graduate medical education, whereas short-term success will depend on our efforts in the continuing medical education of current practitioners.
