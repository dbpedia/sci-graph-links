Abstract The current school reform movement, with its emphasis on teacher professionalism, teacher empowerment, and shared decision making, has challenged teachers’ unions to develop more collegial relations with school boards. Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, has called for the union to “reinvent” itself and to assume responsibility for improving school quality and the quality of the teaching force. This article discusses the development of teachers’ unions in the 1960s as adversaries of school boards. From the beginning the unions adopted an industrial model of labor relations, one tailored for factories and assembly lines rather than school environments. Today, there are signs that teachers’ unions are accepting Bob Chase’s vision of a more professional union, one in which union leaders and school leaders can become public allies in the struggle to improve schools.
