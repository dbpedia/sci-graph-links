Abstract The relevance and contribution of the construct of quality of life to assessments and intervention plans for children and youth in school settings are discussed. Theory, measurement, and research related to perceived quality of life (PQOL) are reviewed leading to the contention that PQOL information contributes incremental validity above and beyond traditional deficit-based information. The use of PQOL in assessments, treatment planning, and monitoring of the well-being of students in school settings warrants further consideration to provide more comprehensive assessment-intervention activities.
