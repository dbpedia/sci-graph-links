Abstract PurposeEarly use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) improves the chances of successful resuscitation and survival. We have surveyed Japanese individuals on their attitude towards using an AED if they witnessed a cardiac arrest and compared the results with those of our previous study in 2006. MethodsParticipants were asked to complete questionnaires regarding their familiarity with the AED concept and their willingness to use AEDs. ResultsA total of 2,527 high school students, teachers, medical nurses, and medical students completed the questionnaire; the characteristics of these individuals were not statistically different from those of the participants of our previous study. In total, 47 �f the high school students, 89 �f the teachers, 93 �f the nurses, and all of the medical students responded that they were familiar with the concept and use of AEDs. The percentages of high school students, teachers, and nurses indicating a familiarity with AEDs were significantly higher in the current study than in the 2006 study. In total, 73 �f the high school students, 87 �f the teachers, 98 �f the nurses, and all of the medical students surveyed in the current study claimed they would definitely use AEDs if required; these values were also significantly higher than those obtained in 2006. ConclusionsThe number of Japanese individuals who are familiar with the concept of AEDs and who are also willing to use these devices was considerably higher in the current study than in the 2006 study. However, more Japanese individuals should be made aware of AEDs and become familiar with their use.
