Abstract A teaching course in laparoscopic surgery was addressed to 21 young postgraduates as a part of their general surgery program with the aim of making them familiar with the basic principles of laparoscopic surgery. The methodology was based on tutorial teaching and ‘learning by problems’; the students worked in little groups elaborating check lists, discussing problems, and practising with laparoscopic training devices. Theoretical learning, practical abilities, and efficacy of tutorial teaching were investigated at the end of the course: the participant's understanding of instrument function, mastering of equipment, and solutions to clinical problems were good, as were the efficiency and pleasantness of the didactic method. Tutorial teaching seems to be a valid model for basic training in laparoscopic surgery in a modern medical education program.
