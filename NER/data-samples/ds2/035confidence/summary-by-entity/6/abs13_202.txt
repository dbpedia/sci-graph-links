Abstract Keleher is an advocate of workfare, whereas my personal predisposition is to be skeptical about telling others what is good for them. Keleher justifies workfare on two grounds: that welfare sustains dependency, and that workfare makes education available which might lead to marketable abilities. Unfortunately, he also argues that workfare should be mandatory. This coupling of education and mandatory participation is a hazardous generalization without more persuasive evidence. The gist of my concerns is that we try to design systems of reducing dependency that are as noncoercive as possible.
