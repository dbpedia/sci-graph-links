Abstract This study investigates, using the Learning Style Questionnaire, the learning style preferences of a group of vocational tertiary students and their teachers. It seeks to identify learning style differences, if any, between students in various stages of their course, between sexes and between “high” and “low” achieving students and their teachers. Furthermore, it examines the similarities and differences between the preferred learning style of the chosen sample of students and other tertiary vocational students. The major findings for the students, relevant to the above variables, and the teachers are discussed. As well, with respect to teachers and students, the implications of attempting to match teaching and learning styles are examined.
