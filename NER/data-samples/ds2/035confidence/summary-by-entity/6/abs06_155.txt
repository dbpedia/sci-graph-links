Abstract The impact of mechanical cutting for weed control along vegetated irrigation canals in terms of Manning's n, is discussed. Flow resistance was measured in channels completely infested by submerged macrophytes. Next, a path was cut along one or both canal banks by mechanical means and the measurement of flow resistance was repeated. The experiments and measurements carried out during only one seasson are described. A series of relationships between the flow resistance and a cross-section of areas both free from vegetation and with vegetation density, respectively, were found. Clearly, the elucidation of such relationships will be useful in assessing the frictional effects of submerged macrophyte growths in relation to the design and management of irrigation and drainage channels.
