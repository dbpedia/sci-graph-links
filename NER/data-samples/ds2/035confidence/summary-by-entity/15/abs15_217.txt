Abstract We can observe an increasing innovation pace in economy and society which can be considered as the main trend most likely to continue also in the future. However, there are also some indications that in some areas it becomes more difficult to innovate and that we are entering a technological plateau. In addition, in some markets we can observe that customers and society are more aware of possible harmful effects of too much innovation and are calling, for instance, for a more mindful development of technologies resulting in longer lasting products. While hyper innovation describes best the current innovation paradigm, we explore in this paper a counter trend which can be labelled as slow innovation movement.
