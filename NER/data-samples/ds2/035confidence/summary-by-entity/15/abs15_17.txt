Abstract A behavioral model is developed to determine the number of self-employed individuals in an economy characterized by different production sectors and social groups of which the individuals differ by their risk-aversion, their evaluation of job characteristics other than income, their expected managerial ability, the variance of their managerial ability and their productive performance as employee. The model leads to a linear complementarity problem that can be solved by the Lemke-algorithm. The 1-sector, n-group model and the m-sector, 2-group model are singled out for an extensive comparative static analysis.
