Abstract This article identifies open research issues in the management of electronic records in complex systems over time, with an emphasis on system development and implementation. The author proposes that it is necessary for archivists to address the issues at three levels: the organizational/professional level, the technological infrastructure level, and the system- and function-specific level. The paper discusses the technological factors which influence archivists' ability to manage electronic records currently being created, and goes on to recommend that archivists broaden their technological knowledge base, work toward influencing others in their organizations to gain buy-in, and develop models and success stories for positively influencing the development of electronic systems.
