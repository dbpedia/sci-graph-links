Abstract Using an inventory based on findings from several qualitative studies, this investigation developed eight dimensions distinguishing successful senior managers from those who had derailed. Results showed that bosses' ratings of 86 successful senior managers on the eight dimensions were significantly higher than those of 83 who had derailed, providing empirical support for many of the earlier qualitative findings. Comparing the successful managers to the derailed suggests dimensions otherwise overlooked which are important to consider when assessing managerial talent.
