Abstract Through a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services, National-Louis University delivered a leadership training program to Head Start personnel in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. The model, which was grounded in adult learning theory, encouraged a facilitative role for the teaching faculty, active decision-making on the part of the participants, collegial support, and linkages between theory and practice. A social systems approach was used to promote the idea of leaders as change agents. The effectiveness of the training model was assessed through the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results indicated that the training had a positive effect on participants' level of perceived competence, the quality of teaching practices in their classrooms, and the organizational climate of their centers. Additionally, case study data documented feelings of increased self-confidence and self-efficacy on the part of participants. Outcomes suggest that this training model improved the expertise of Head Start directors and teachers and promoted substantive change and improvement in their centers.
