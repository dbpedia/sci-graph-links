Abstract Despite clinical reports of impaired memory functioning of depressed persons, the results of empirical studies in this area have been equivocal. The present study was designed to address a number of the methodological shortcomings of these earlier investigations, examining potential depressionassociated deficits in sensory and short-term memory processing in a single sample of subjects. Twenty depressed and 20 nondepressed subjects participated in two tasks, each examining one of these aspects of memory. The results of this study suggest that whereas sensory memory is intact in depressed individuals, short-term memory processing is impaired. More specifically, the depressed subjects experienced difficulty with the retention of material, likely owing to impaired rehearsal ability. The results of this study are discussed with respect to their implications for cognitive models of depression, and suggestions for future research in this area are offered.
