Abstract In order to increase reading fluency, a research-based tutoring method using repeated reading was implemented over a 10-week period with two second-grade students. Two high school students were trained to be the tutors. In addition, one parent and one older sibling were trained to repeat the tutoring process at night. Treatment integrity was monitored through observation and tutor contact. The six, 30-minute sessions per week were associated with significant increases in sight word vocabulary, fluency and comprehension. Limitations, future research directions, and implications for practice are discussed further.
