Summary The method of fixed set (Uznadze, 1966) was applied to the size-weight illusion. After the repeated lifting of a small, heavy stimulus and a large, light one with both hands simultaneously, the size-weight illusion diminished. It increased after lifting a small, light stimulus and a large, heavy one. These changes in perception were explained as contrast effects caused by the sets which were fixed during the preceding lifts. The same method was applied to the weight-size illusion and the contrast effect was observed in some cases. The results of the application of the fixed-set method to the size-weight illusion and to the visual size perception were compared. All the results showed analogous patterns of conflicting states between the temporarily fixed set and the set that the subject prepares naturally for perception, such as the size-weight illusion. By way of conclusion, the size-weight illusion was assumed to be a kind of contrast effect in the light of Uznadze's theory of set.
