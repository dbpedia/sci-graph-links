Abstract Directiveness and nondirectiveness in genetic counseling are poorly understood on the operational level, and information about what counselors allege they do and what actually is done in practice is lacking. Although they are often thought of as diametrically opposite approaches, when viewed as strategies of persuasion, their similarities become more apparent. Directive counselors attempt to influence the counselee's behavior, whereas nondirective ones attempt to influence the latter's thinking processes; there is need for both approaches. Directiveness may also sometimes occur because of inadequate interview skills. The case made for directiveness is discussed and critiqued, available research is reviewed, and suggestions for future studies are advanced.
