Abstract By avoiding the confound between the physical and semantic properties of words, it was possible to demonstrate the effects and aftereffects of semantic satiation. Subjects were presented a neutral list of words to learn, recognize, and rate for emotional evaluation. On the next six lists, subjects had either positive, negative, neutral, or mixed lists of words and a final list of neutral words to measure aftereffects. The intensity of extremely positive and negative words satiated during the six lists and had aftereffects as predicted by an antagonistic adaptation level model. The recognition memory results indicate that hit rates progressively decreased during satiation, but encoding discriminability (d’) remained relatively constant. This supports a retrieval model of memory. Positive words, however, were significantly less discriminable than negative or neutral words and had negative aftereffects on the encoding d’ of subsequent neutral words that were related to inertia effects in category organization.
