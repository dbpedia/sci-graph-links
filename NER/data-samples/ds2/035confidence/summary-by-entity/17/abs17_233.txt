Abstract A randomized controlled trial examined the growth and form of multidimensional self-esteem over a 12-month period (6-month exercise intervention and 6-month follow-up) in 174 older adults engaged in either a walking or stretching/toning program. The extent to which changes in physical fitness parameters and physical self-efficacy were related to changes in perceptions of attractive body, strength, physical conditioning, and physical self-worth was also determined. Latent growth curve analyses showed a curvilinear pattern of growth in esteem with significant increases at all levels of self-esteem upon completion of the intervention followed by significant declines at 6 months poistintervention in both groups. Frequency of activity and changes in physical fitness, body fat, and self-efficacy were related to improvements in esteem perceptions relative to attractive body, strength, and physical condition. Model fitting procedures suggested that the best fit of the data was to a model in which the influence of changes in efficacy and physical parameters on physical self-worth were mediated by perceptions of attractive body and physical conditions.
