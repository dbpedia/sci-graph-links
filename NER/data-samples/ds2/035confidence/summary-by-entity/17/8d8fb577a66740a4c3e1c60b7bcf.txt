Summary Frame theories propose that memorization and retrieval reports are guided by frames, that is, abstract representations of a scene or an episode. They also propose that in unexpected recall, the subjects assume that the person who interprets the recall message uses a similar frame. Consequently, the recalling subject deletes from the recall report information from the frame that is highly predictable. This prediction was tested in an incidental memory task. After waiting 30 s in an office, the subjects were unexpectedly asked to recall everything in the office. They were either given standard instructions or instructions to recall so much that it would be comprehensible to a ‘Martian’. Thereafter, a recognition test was administered. In neither recall nor recognition were overall differences between the two recall conditions observed. The recognition data of both recall groups and a recognition-only group replicated previous findings, and were in agreement with the frame theories. The recall data revealed a significant interaction of recall instruction, object presence, and frame expectation. This is consistent with the proposition about frame anticipation. Recall of objects expected within the frame was higher under the ‘Martian’ condition than under standard conditions, whereas recall of unexpected objects was higher under normal recall conditions. Both the recognition and the recall data are considered as evidence in favor of frame theory.
