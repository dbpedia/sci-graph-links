Abstract This article examines a legal issue that is derivative of the increasingly multicultural character of the American work force. The recent case of Garcia v. Spun Steak(1993, 1994) is illustrative of the challenge managers can face in dealing with cultural and linguistic diversity in the workplace. Over time, there have been conflicting messages in employment discrimination law as to the propriety of employer-imposed restrictions on the use of languages other than English in the workplace. However, the basic question involves the balancing of both the employer’s right to manage the business and the right to self-expression in the language of one’s choice in the workplace. Recommendations are made as to how each party’s rights can be balanced under the law. What will be seen is that in the nuevo mundoof work found at the edge of the twenty-first century, the interests of both employers and employees may be best served by policies favoring language promotion over language restrictions.
