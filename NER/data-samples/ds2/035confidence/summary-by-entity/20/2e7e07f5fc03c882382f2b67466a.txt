Abstract A distinction between behavioral and linguistic measures of difficulty in language learning is made explicit. It is argued that behavioral measures must be regarded as primary and linguistic measures as secondary, the latter being only a component of the former. An evaluation of the evidence leads to the following conclusions: (a) No unequivocal answer can be given to the question of whether some languages are intrinsically more difficult to learn than others; (b) second-language learning is more difficult than first-language learning, to the extent that native-speaker competence is a very difficult goal to achieve by adult second-language learners; and (c) interlingual distance is a determinant of difficulty but simple, linear relations between them or between linguistic and behavioral measures of difficulty can hardly be expected.
