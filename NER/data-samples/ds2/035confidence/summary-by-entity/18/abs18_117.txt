Abstract A well-balanced, large-time-stepping method for conservation laws with source terms is presented. The numerical method is based on a local reformulation of the balance law as a conservation law with a discontinuous flux function, and the approximate solution of this equation by a front tracking method. This yields an unconditionally stable method which is particularly well suited to calculate stationary states. The viability of this approach is demonstrated by several numerical examples.
