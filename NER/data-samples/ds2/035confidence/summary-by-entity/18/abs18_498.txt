Abstract This report treats the way in which Sweden looks upon the phenomenon of sex discrimination, and how it has been handled by theConsumer Ombudsman and theMarket Court. The possibilities of legal intervention in such discrimination seem small at present, but may be increased as a result of current governmental and parliamentary enquiries. A Working Party appointed by the Consumer Ombudsman has tried to delineate the concept of sex discrimination in advertising, and the Working Party's classification of such discrimination into several distinct categories is presented in the paper, together with a series of examples of advertising regarded as discriminatory by this Party.
