Abstract This paper describes the workshop which took place during the international symposium “Digital Fabrication – a State of Art”, which took place at the School of Technology and Architecture ISCTE-IUL, on 15-16September 2011. Its main goal was to introduce a group of about twenty people to the use of digital fabrication in architecture, in a country where these technologies are not yet fully implemented in architecture schools and curricula.
