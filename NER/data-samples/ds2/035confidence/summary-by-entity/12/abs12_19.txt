Abstract Cycling as a transport mode has gradually become more attractive in cities during the last 10 years. However, not all cities give due consideration to cycling issues in the planning process. In many transport systems, cycling and issues of vélomobility are still neglected. Recent research considers several aspects of cycling, however, few studies have shown why differences in for example modal split and bicycle infrastructure exist between cities. This article deals with the differences in cycling issues between Copenhagen and Stockholm and furthermore why such differences occur in these two Scandinavian capitals. The focus here is on transport planning and the dissimilarities in the structures and aspects that have affected the thinking of planners and politicians and the planning outcomes in these two cities. Questions of marginalisation of cyclists in the public space and different planning politics or politics of vélomobility are touched upon. The results are set in a theoretical frame of power relations, mobility theory and political economies. The results show that these two cities have very different planning approaches and economic, structural and cultural presumptions leading to the fact that Copenhagen prioritises cycling, whereas Stockholm focuses more on facilitating public transport and motorised modes of person transport.
