Abstract In the case of fast track construction, where the design and construction phases are carried out in parallel to shorten the project delivery duration, establishing a Design Management System (DMS) to reduce the interference between design and construction activities has received more attention both from researchers and industry professionals. Especially, in investment projects like mega infrastructure projects, where the total duration of the project is directly related to the profitability of the project, effectiveness of the communication channels and strength of collaboration relations between the design and construction teams can be achieved through effective integration of the DMS with Project Management System (PMS). Within the context of this paper, a framework for DMS used in a mega infrastructure project in Korea will be introduced and its integration with the PMS using the case study will be discussed. This paper briefly demonstrates the responsibility distribution and management of design processes at different design levels. The system also argues how the information exchange is performed between design and construction teams via the integration of design and construction schedule.
