Abstract The demand for urban public transport services in Kuwait emerged as a direct result of rising immigrating labour in the Country which witnessed sudden oil wealth in early 1950s. The main objective of this paper is to discuss and to evaluate the most relevant issues associated with the introduction and the development of the public transport system. Kuwait Transport Company (KTC) is considered the backbone of such a system. The company has recently changed its name to Public Transport Co (PTC). The paper also addresses three major issues: 1) The need and the demand for public passengers services; 2) Indicators of public transport growth and development; 3) The need for ambitious public transport policies and strategies in the light of the recommendations proposed by the studies associated with Kuwait Master Plans.
