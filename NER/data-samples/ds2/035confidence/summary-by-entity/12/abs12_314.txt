Abstract At the disposal of today’s architect is an evolving array of interoperable tools and processes that allow the fabrication of design propositions to be increasingly complex, non–standard and adaptive. How are we equipped to deal with such a growing breadth of new potential, and how are the philosophies that underpin this potential being defined? This paper attempts to address what is something of a contemporary dilemma in architecture, as the constraints of industrial standardisation are relaxed. Have the roles of designers and makers changed in a way that we’ve not experienced before, and is a new approach to making architecture emerging?
