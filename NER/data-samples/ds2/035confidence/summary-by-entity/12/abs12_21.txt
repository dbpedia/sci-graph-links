Abstract Urban health is likely to be one of the momentous challenges of the twenty-first century. Ever increasing numbers of people move to urban environments; the failure to adequately link urban planning to public health is described in this paper, and the WHO Healthy Cities Programme initiated in 1986 is presented as a vehicle to redress that problem. This article describes the foundations, scope and purpose of the Healthy Cities Programme with currently more than four thousand participating towns, communities and cities. Healthy Cities are put in a context of other global agency's agendas. Evaluation efforts in Healthy Cities are described for which a proper inquiry perspective is provided. The Healthy City notion is defined and operationalised and an overview is given of various evaluation enterprises. The paper is concluded with a description of the MARI Framework (Monitoring, Accountability, Reporting and Impact Assessment) currently operational in the European Region of WHO.
