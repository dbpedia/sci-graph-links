Abstract Four typical urban surroundings were modelled, ranging from high-rise structures to low buildings and combinations thereof. These building systems were exposed to typical summer and winter climatic scenarios for latitudes 10, 34, and 50 N. Systematic variations of interior building temperatures were also introduced. The resultant changes in the components of the systems' energy budgets were examined with respect to cause and effect. The simulations produced a variety of unexpected features which intuitively had not been anticipated. It is believed that energy budget features of real cities cannot vary drastically from those simulated, and described in this report.
