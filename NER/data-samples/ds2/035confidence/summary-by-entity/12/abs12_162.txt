Abstract Design is an integral component of product development, which includes manufacturing. In order to avoid costly reworks and delays, and to reduce the lead-time in product development, effective communication of design concepts among the various stakeholders such as customers, designers and engineers is of utmost importance. In this respect, functional representations provide a methodology, which can be used to describe a design or product effectively. However, function is not the only type of information that needs to be communicated among the various stakeholders during a design process. Other types of information such as design specifications and constraints, which are non-functional, also need to be taken into account. This non-functional information cannot be adequately expressed using existing functional representations. Accordingly, in this work, a novel purpose-behaviour-structure (PBS) representation scheme to capture vital design knowledge for collaborative product development is proposed. The proposed PBS representation scheme can be used by designers working in a collaborative environment for product development. A case study on the design of a vacuum cleaner is used to illustrate the functionality of the PBS representation scheme. The details of the representation scheme are presented in this paper.
