Abstract Similarities can certainly be found between systems research and computational sciences, and architecture and design. The first pair deals with information, complex dynamics and organizations; the second pair is often understood as synthetic and systemic. Postwar history recalls a sequence of exchanges between these fields; the aim of this paper is to highlight the relevance of some exchanges and their contemporary legacy. In this connection, the first part briefly outlines the meaning and history of the former disciplines, highlighting the strict circular models and how first-order cybernetics evolved towards a second order. The second part points to some exchanges between systems research, computational sciences and art forms, as well as to its architectural legacy. To a large extent, the current architectural interest in new sciences of emergence and complexity is rooted in the early systems research approach. Both areas are possible root sources of a future, effective built environment.
