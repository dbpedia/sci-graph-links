Abstract Simulation has given statistical relationships for the early stage of slip-band development. Dislocation multiplication is considered within the framework of a double transverse slip model. There is a relationship between the number of loops at the surface and that within the crystal. A method is given for determining the times for source formation and loop generation, and numerical estimates are made from the published experimental data.
