Abstract Observations (mid-July) were made, at high altitudes (3,080 m to 4,267 m, White Mountains, California), of the radiative physical and physiological parameters of importance to man. The data was used to show how man was actually coupled to the climatological events and processes going on at the physical-horizontal interface. Such observations were then used to test theoreticalempirical models predicting such interactions between man and the environment. High correlations were found between hypothesis and observations during the investigational period. Subsequently, an all-year simulation was conducted which attempted to predict the annual march of net radiation on the human and its causal components for high elevations in arid regions.
