Abstract A total of 4,300 cataract extractions were evaluated with respect to operative complications and their effects on postoperative visual function. Severe vision-threatening complications such as vitreous or expulsive hemorrhage occurred in 6 of the 4,300 eyes; 726 eyes followed up over 1–3 years showed late complications in 0.44��1.77�The relevance of the data prior to surgery is discussed.
