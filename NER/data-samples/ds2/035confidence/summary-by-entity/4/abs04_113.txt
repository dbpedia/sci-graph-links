Abstract This investigation concerns the application of a special method of successive approximations to the solution of a practically motivated, nonlinear problem of the bending of a uniformly loaded circular plate supported on a concentric circle. Numerical results are obtained for a range of plate-radius/support-radius ratios, and the former are found to be in good agreement with the results of experiments.
