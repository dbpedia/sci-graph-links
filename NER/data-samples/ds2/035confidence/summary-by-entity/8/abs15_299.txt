Abstract Sea fishing is an extremely hazardous occupation. Since the eighties, several studies and reports have been made in an attempt to further the integration of safe working conditions into the design of fishing vessels. This paper presents various ergonomical interventions, performed on several very different projects: one industrial vessel, and smaller vessels built in co-operation with small firms. The ergonomical follow-up on the design and construction of a large halieutic research vessel was performed along standard principles: work analysis in typical situations, definition and simulation of possible future activity, and input from future users. The experience of work with smaller firms (when they were either the owner or the contractor) has shown the limitations of these principles. The difficulties were mainly related to the projectsâ€™ lack of structure (no specifications, no plans), the lack of availability of the different actors, and the lack of any real demand as far as safety was concerned.
