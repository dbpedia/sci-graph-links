Abstract The paper provides an overview of the perception of the business environment by foreign investors in Transylvania (Romania) as a result of a survey conducted on firms with foreign capital in this region. The first part of our study considers general information about the companies in the sample, regarding size, type of contribution, domain of activity, market, and other aspects. The second part of the study deals with factors concerning the location decision: the factors that influenced the success of operations and impediments and barriers encountered. The fact that despite several obstacles, the business environment is perceived by the majority of investors as a good one, allows the conclusion that the transformation process of the economy is moving in the right direction.
