Abstract This paper describes the characteristics of technology to support the “knowledge worker” through an analysis of the model of knowledge which they embody. The disparity between this model and the “post-industrial” model of knowledge, coupled with examples of technologies that are designed more sympathetically towards the post-industrial model, provides insights that motivate a design approach explicity focused on addressing the requirements and circumstances of the knowledge worker.
