Abstract One of the existing problems of information management is an information security. In this aspects one of possible solution is divide information between a group of persons authorized to manage this information. Information sharing processes allow to protect the information from disclosure. In this paper, the process of division of the information has been enhanced by biometric identification stage. Secure information processes with biometric identification are used to manage very important and strategic data. This paper presents the questions of personal cryptography understood as a combination of the tasks of classifying information and biometric techniques used for this kind of tasks. The techniques of biometric data marking are present on the examples of data division and sharing protocols, expanded by the stages of personal identification and verification. This kind of solutions is presented for the tasks of dividing appropriately the shared secret information. Moreover, we shall present the management process of shadow sets, i.e., of parts of the divided, secret information. The processes of secret data management are refer to tasks of cognitive management, understood as management executed on the basis of understanding the meaning of the processed data.
