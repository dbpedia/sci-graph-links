Abstract Informal and formal communication processes are documented in the primary journal literature. Both processes impose structures on the authors who publish their research, and the formal process imposes a structure on the journals which publish scientific papers. In this paper, it is shown that information theory can be applied to these structures for the purpose of evaluating the contribution that authors and journals make to the communication of scientific information. Experimental results identify the most communicative authors and journals in an area of active research.
