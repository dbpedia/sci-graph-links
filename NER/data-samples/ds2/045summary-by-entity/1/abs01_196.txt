Abstract This paper investigates the robust control problem of continuous-time uncertain switched linear systems, using only a switching strategy depending on the plant output. The proposed method is based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A set of slack variables is introduced to reduce the design conservatism, and new sufficient LMI conditions for the synthesis of the controllers are presented. Two examples show that the proposed method has an adequate performance even in situations when the matrices of the linear subsystems are not Hurwitz and offers a simple and efficient solution for this control problem.
