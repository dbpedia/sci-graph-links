Abstract. This paper is devoted to discuss the regularity of the weak solution to a class of non-linear equations corresponding to Hardy-Sobolev type inequality on the H-type group. Combining the Serrin's idea and the Moser's iteration, L p estimates of the weak solution are obtained, which generalize the results of Garofalo and Vassilev in [6, 14]. As an application, asymptotic behavior of the weak solution has been discussed. Finally, doubling property and unique continuation of the weak solution are given.
