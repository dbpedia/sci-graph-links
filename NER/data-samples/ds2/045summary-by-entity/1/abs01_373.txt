Abstract We propose a pure topological notion of a finite-intersection map (FI-map), which captures the idea of a typical generalized KKM-map, with no use of any generalized convexity structure and prove its full characterizations in terms of recent generalized KKM and connectedness structures. We establish an intersection point theorem in terms of FI-maps. Then, a half of the paper is devoted to apply this result to obtain characterizations of the existence of solutions in optimization. First, we discuss a general model of variational relations. Then, we move on to more particular, but typical and important cases: equilibrium problems, saddle points, constrained minimization, and Nash equilibria. We include discussions and examples to illustrate that our results improve or extend many recent contributions in the literature.
