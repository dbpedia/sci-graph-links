Abstract We will prove some cases of Vojta’s conjecture on blowups of $${\mathbb{P}^n}$$, using Schmidt’s subspace theorem. The results can be stated as inequalities of greatest common divisors. Moreover, from Vojta’s conjecture on one further blowup at an infinitely near point, we derive a still-open special case of the abc-conjecture.
