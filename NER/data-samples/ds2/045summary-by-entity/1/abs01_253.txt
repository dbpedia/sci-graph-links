Abstract. We introduce vector-valued Jacobi-like forms associated to a representation $\rho: \Gamma \rightarrow GL(n,{\Bbb C})$ of a discrete subgroup $\Gamma \subset SL(2,{\Bbb C})$ in ${\Bbb C}^n$ and establish a correspondence between such vector-valued Jacobi-like forms and sequences of vector-valued modular forms of different weights with respect to œÅ. We determine a lifting of vector-valued modular forms to vector-valued Jacobi-like forms as well as a lifting of scalar-valued Jacobi-like forms to vector-valued Jacobi-like forms. We also construct Rankin-Cohen brackets for vector-valued modular forms.
