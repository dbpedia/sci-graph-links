Summary A compact, explicit expression is given for the term of arbitrary order in the power series expansion of Dysonâ€™sS-matrix, for any arbitrary scattering process. The expression thus found forS has a very high degree of symmetry (a fact which the Feynman graph technique could not reveal; our procedure is also free from several shortcomings of this technique), which suggests the existence in the theory of deeper properties. These will be studied in the continuation to this work.
