Abstract In this paper a new coordination approach for decentralized job shop scheduling rules is presented and analyzed in a simulation study. The coordination is based on look ahead information and contains a mechanism for demanding and supplying jobs. The simulation experiments show that the performance of conventional scheduling rules is significantly improved using the coordination mechanism.
