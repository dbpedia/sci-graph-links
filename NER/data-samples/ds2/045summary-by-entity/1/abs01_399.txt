Abstract Statistical methods of experiment planning are used to obtain a mathematical model of the process of growth of variable zoneheterostructures of GaAs-AlxGa1âˆ’xAs, making it possible to control composition by means of the process parameters: working temperature, zone thickness, initial composition of the liquid phase, times of forward and reverse passage of the liquid zone.
