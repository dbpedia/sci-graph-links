Abstract Optimal regulation of hyperbolic systems in the presence of unknown exogenous and initial disturbances is considered. Necessary conditions for determining the optimal control that tracks a desired trajectory in the presence of disturbances are developed. These necessary conditions have the form of a twopoint boundary-value problem along with certain equality and inequality conditions. The results also characterize the worst possible disturbances that are accommodated by the optimum controller without any serious performance degradation. Numerical results on the control of a vibrating beam are presented.
