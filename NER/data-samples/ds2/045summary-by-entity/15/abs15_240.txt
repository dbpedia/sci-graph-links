Abstract This inter-laboratory comparison study was arranged for 28 laboratories from different public and private sector organizations in Pakistan having wastewater testing capabilities aimed at improving the quality and comparability of test results. This national inter-laboratory study was started in December 2003 and completed in July 2004. Laboratories were invited to analyze the wastewater collected from printed circuit board (PCB) industry for lead and copper contamination. The samples fulfill the criteria for homogeneity and stability as done by the reference laboratory. The results obtained from participating laboratories were analyzed in terms of Hampel Test for outliers, while the performance evaluation of the participating laboratories was done on the basis of Z-score. An assigned value derived from the participant's results was compared with a reference value provided by a reference laboratory. Overall >50% of the participating laboratories have shown good performance in this PT-program
