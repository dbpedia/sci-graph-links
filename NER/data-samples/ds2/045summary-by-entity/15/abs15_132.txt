Abstract  The Centro Nacional de Metrolog√≠a (CENAM) has developed the MESURA Interinstitutional Network in collaboration with other research and development institutes in Mexico. This network has the aim of providing integral metrological services to industry throughout the country, with uniform standards of quality and consistency. The fulfillment of this aim has been possible because of a number of factors that have made the MESURA Program an attractor for the integration of metrological services. Among these factors are: an unswerving focus on the customer needs, an integral and logical problem solving approach to consultancy, adequate modular classification of the consultants functions, clear-cut definition of the functions of each member of interdisciplinary groups, and a uniform code of communication among the members of the network. The next stage of the strategy is to strengthen the link between metrology and its industrial applications forming a new type of consultant with the technical experts from R&D Centers. These will be consultants with general knowledge and experience in metrology, specialized in certain type of industrial processes and products. The strategy will be initiated in the year 2000 and with it the MESURA Network is expected to make a strong contribution to fostering the optimum use of metrology in industry and to act as a channel for the integration of other technologies in which the participating Centers have expertise.
