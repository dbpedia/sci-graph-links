Abstract  Public Health Laboratories (PHL) as part of Public Health Services are involved in law enforcement and ensuring food and water quality. The laboratories had to go through an organizational and monetary change imposed by the growing and changing needs of the state of Israel. The laboratories had to become more modern and to implement new and more sophisticated testing methods. Another requirement was to perform a steadily increasing number of tests and to be more flexible towards customers’ demands. Yet, the budget was not changed accordingly, as the Public Service to which the laboratories belong to do not respond to changing needs. Management realization was that the accreditation process could be used as a tool to achieve organizational and cultural change. Understanding and transformation were required throughout the organization, including management. Proficiency testing is performed for all testing methods in all areas even for non-accredited tests such as clinical tests. Proficiency testing was used as a tool for organizational culture change. It is a great index with game elements, that gives employees and managers the possibility for comparison, fixing problems and corrective action. The demands of ISO 17025 made it necessary to change peoples’ attitudes and views on both professional and communication levels. Laboratory quality consists now on the four main principles, described in the 5M&E model which is typical to small organizations and which ensures a constantly improving system: ”Policy statement”, ”Machine”, ”Material”, ”Measurement”, ”Method”, ”Manpower”, and ”Environment” targeted to achieve ”Quality upgrade”. Slowly we succeeded in providing better and more reliable services and have increased our income on what would hopefully become our way to financial independence. We hope this process would provide the Ministry of Health with a better chance to public health using the same financial sources.
