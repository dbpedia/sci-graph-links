Abstract To improve client value within contracting services, it is important to understand what clients value and what their priorities are. Following a disaster event, construction service providers are called by clients upon to assist with reconstruction programs. Having knowledge of client values within contracting services in the post disaster situation, service providers are able to provide better service in the disaster rebuild environment. The construction management literature is focused on business-as-usual construction and its relative values, rather than post disaster reconstruction. The objective of this paper is to explore the most important client values within contractor’s services in post disaster reconstruction situations from public and private sector clients’ perspectives. The study includes a literature review and questionnaire survey. Key client values within contracting services under the nine Project Management Institute knowledge management categories were identified. These values can be used as a basis for developing good practice for reconstruction following a disaster. As part of a aim to develop an assessment tool towards improving client value, by providing better contracting services, a client value index is proposed.
