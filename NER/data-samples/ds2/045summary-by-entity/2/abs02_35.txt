Summary A surprisingly high-temperature dependence of the spin relaxation times has been observed by different authors in optical pumping experiments with buffer gases. An interpretation of these phenomena is given and a systematic experimental investigation is presented. The method used is completely different from Franzenâ€™s method. The agreement between experiments and theory is pretty good, except at very high temperature, when multiple diffusion becomes important. It is shown that the customary approach to the problem may cause large errors in the values of the diffusion coefficient and the disorientation cross-section, and may be responsible for the large spread of these values, as they appear in the literature.
