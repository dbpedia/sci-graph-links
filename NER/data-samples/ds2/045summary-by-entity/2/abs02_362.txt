Abstract Behind-the-limb flares provide a unique opportunity for the study of vertical source structures of microwave bursts and dynamic flare processes. Based on complex observational data related to the outstanding solar proton event on 16 February, 1984, the development of burst emission at a height z ≥ 200000 km above the photosphere has been investigated. A comparison with the associated X-ray emission measured aboard various spacecraft yields a time lag of about ≤ 1 min between the onset of the unocculted impulsive HXR-emission and the onsets of the X-ray and microwave emissions occulted by the solar limb. The lag corresponds to a range of speeds of the propagation of the flare volume of about 3000–5000 km s−1. Considering competing transport agents that could account for such expansion of the source volume, a qualitative model of shock-wave activation of loops successively reaching into larger coronal heights is proposed. From a discussion of the possible emission processes involved, conclusions about the magnetic field, electron density, and particle energies have been obtained.
