Abstract Corrected general and methodical requirements to the method, technology, and instrumentation of radiographic testing which reflect the modern level of the development of nondestructive testing methods and radiation technique are established. Existing standards are analyzed to determine their degree of correspondence to the work under market conditions. Promising and priority trends in the field of standardization of radiographic testing method are determined. Ways for bringing the Russian standards in accordance with the international ones are proposed for approaches to the radiographic testing technique and technology and the testing and measurement instrumentations.
