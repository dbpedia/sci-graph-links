Abstract We study the anomalous absorption of radio waves by small-scale magnetic-field-aligned artificial irregularities taking into account the effect of such irregularities on the propagation of the excited Z -mode. It is shown that this process becomes significant if the transverse size of field-aligned irregularities is of the order of 0.1c/ω or greater, where ω is the radio wave frequency and c is the speed of light in vacuum.
