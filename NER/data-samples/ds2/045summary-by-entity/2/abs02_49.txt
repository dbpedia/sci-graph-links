Abstract Corrections toK→πππ decays induced by vector and scalar meson exchange are investigated within chiral perturbation theory. The widths of scalar mesons are analyzed and their influence onK→πππ parameters were examined. The overall corrections were found to be parameter dependent, but contributing in some cases as much as 10%.
