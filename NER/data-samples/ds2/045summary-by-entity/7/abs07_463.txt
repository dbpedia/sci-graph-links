Abstract Sustainability in forest management is both a biological and socioeconomic concept. Originating in 18th century Europe with the aim of avoiding social and economic disruptions associated with timber shortages, sustained-yield forest management evolved to a highly technical process of modeling growth, mortality, and risk in order to set timber removals at a level that theoretically could be maintained in perpetuity. Changing scientific understanding of the ecological functioning of forest ecosystems has challenged the notion that a sustained yield of timber is equivalent to sustaining all the components and natural processes necessary to maintain the long-term health and productivity of these ecosystems. Continuing uncertainty over what is socially and economically acceptable, as well as ecologically sustainable, will make optimality in forest management a much more difficult objective than in the past.
