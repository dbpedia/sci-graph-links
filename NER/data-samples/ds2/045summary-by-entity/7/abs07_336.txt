Abstract Tropical forests are dynamic systems with extensive natural disturbance, gaps in the canopy being one of the most important types. Tree and branch fall are often the principal cause of natural disturbance. This research was done on adult individuals of a very abundant palm (Astrocaryum mexicanum Liebm, Arecaceae), which is found in the understorey of the forest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Percentages of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizae were determined for individuals selected randomly from plots located both in gaps and under closed canopy. The highest percentages of total colonization, as well as those of hyphae and vesicles, were recorded for gaps. In forest with closed canopy, arbuscules had the highest percentages of colonization; on these sites the palm has been observed to grow less. The higher production of arbuscules may favour nutrient capture in this microenvironment, which is characterized by strong competition.
