Abstract The relation between the Faustmann model and “a forestry of prices” as a concept of thought was examined. At first, the meaning of the Faustmann model in economic sciences is the explanation of allocation and distribution by prices. The rotation age determination plays a secondary role only. Secondly, “a forestry of prices” as an application of the “free to choose” way of thinking is explained. The concept allows us to understand how individuals of anonymous groups achieve forest sustainability and provide forest environmental goods. Thirdly, the relation between the Faustmann model and “a forestry of prices” is discussed. For this purpose, the Faustmann model is described as a scientific laboratory. It helps us to observe how equilibrium arises as a non-intended result of individual welfare maximization in anonymous interactions. And conversely with the help of “a forestry of prices”, we understand also that the individual maximization approach of the Faustmann model re-enacts the unintended interaction situations in anonymous group. With help of the Faustmann model, we can understand deep aspects of “a forestry of prices”. Vice versa, “a forestry of prices” shows the meaning of the formal solutions of the Faustmann model.
