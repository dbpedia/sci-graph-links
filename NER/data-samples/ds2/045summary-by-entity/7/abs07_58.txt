Abstract A minimum-distance boundary method that will minimize the sum of distances between measured points and a fitted self-thinning lines on log-log coordinates of stand density and quadratic mean diameter was proposed in order to estimate the maximum size density line: an upper boundary of self-thinning line. The lines for A. mangium were inferred with this method using data in two areas of unthinned plantations in South Sumatra, Indonesia. Slopes of the lines were deduced as −1.63 and −1.67 within the range of 10–21 cm of quadratic mean dbh. The intensity of self-thinning was examined as a rate of reduction of density in relation to dbh increment. The rates were found to be higher than the slopes in the range close to the maximum line; hence the lines inferred in this study were likely existent. Maximum basal area deduced from the size-density line was 28–30 m2/ha at 12cm of dbh and then it increased up to 34–37 m2/ha at 20 cm of dbh.
