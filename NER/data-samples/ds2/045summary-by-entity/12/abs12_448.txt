Abstract Visual shape parameters and aesthetic aspects of a product are one of the crucial factors for the success of a product in the market. The type and the value of the shape parameters plays an important role in visual appearance of a product and designers tends to be critical while deciding these parameters. The aesthetic aspect of a product has been matter of concern for researchers with its electromechanical design. The Kano model has been found to be a useful tool to establish the relationship between performance criteria and customer satisfaction. To achieve the desired customer satisfaction weight of each product criteria is determined by using Kano model. This study presents an integrative design approach combining the Kano model, Taguchi method and grey relation analysis to obtain the optimal combination of shape parameters and aesthetic aspects. Prioritized criteria of aesthetic attributes have been abstracted through proposed methodology. A case study has been presented to evolve a profile of a car.
