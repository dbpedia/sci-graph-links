Abstract Individual metering of energy in flats is a real opportunity to save energy and money for the occupiers of collective-ownership buildings with centralised heating systems. The individual management of energy, through such devices, make users more responsible and also stimulates them to implement energy retrofit interventions in their flats. The use of individual metering systems in existing apartments, however, could have some critical aspects. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the application of individual energy systems in existing collective-ownership residential buildings, highlighting the critical aspects and providing practical solutions to overcome them. A study has been made of an individual metering application in an existing residential block of flats located in Milan (Italy) with poor thermal insulation between the various dwellings themselves and for the outside walls of the building. Although a net reduction of 50.4 % in the global costs for winter heating, obtained exclusively through plant-modification works, represents an optimum goal for energy savings, the study highlight some critical aspects. The savings for different apartments differ greatly and depend upon the criteria chosen for burden sharing. This study shows that the phenomenon of “heat theft” can prove to be important and provides the possibility of reducing to zero the quota of expenses from consumption whilst still benefiting from comfortable temperatures. Once the problems have been identified, the paper then proposes solutions to overcome them through a revision of the criteria for the allocation of energy costs.
