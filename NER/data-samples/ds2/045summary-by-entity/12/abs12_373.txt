Abstract Parameters leading to the severity of the fire in Lærdalsøyri, Norway, January 18th to 19th 2014, have been analyzed. The fire in the first villa developed significantly faster than the fire fighters could handle and the fire quickly spread to other structures. In addition to 36 modern buildings, 4 historic buildings in Gamle Lærdalsøyri cultural heritage area were lost. Heroic effort of local and neighbor community fire brigades, police, military forces and volunteers prevented the fire from destroying the whole village, including the remaining 157 historic buildings. Adiabatically heated (low humidity) air from surrounding high mountains gave outdoor wood fuel moisture content (FMC) of about 7.6%. Inside inhabited buildings, it is shown that the wooden products reached about 4.5% FMC prior to the blaze. When ignited, this resulted in rapid fire development. Two story villas burned down in less than 1 h while producing much embers and firebrands. Strong shifting winds subsequently spread the fire to neighbor houses by flame contact (periodically 20 m long horizontal flames) and over long distances (200 m) by embers and firebrands. Based on the present work, an increased fire risk associated with low FMC in inhabited wooden houses during winter time can be predicted. This is of value when considering measures to reduce the probability of a fire outbreak as well as measures mitigating the escalation of a potential fire.
