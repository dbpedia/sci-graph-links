Abstract In this paper we describe how we have exploited Evolutionary Computation (EC) to generate creative building designs. The algorithm has been implemented to create a design tool for architects called Design Inspiration system (DIS). The interactive design inspiration tool is able to generate initial design concepts of architectural plans. Our approach illustrates what we regard as an ideal strategy towards an organic architecture that is inspired from living organisms and not concerned with architectural style. The current capabilities of the system are demonstrated by the example of designing a library building. The paper ends by describing a comprehensive experiment with a total of 28 volunteer architects as a cognitive performance measurement tool, capable of accurately positioning participantsâ€™ performance using the design system.
