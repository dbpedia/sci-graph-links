Abstract We present a new approach to the construction of orthonormal wavelets on the interval which allows to overcome the “non interacting boundaries” restriction of existing constructions, and therefore to construct wavelets for U0; 1T also at large scales in such a way that, in the range of validity of the existing constructions, the two approaches give the same result.
