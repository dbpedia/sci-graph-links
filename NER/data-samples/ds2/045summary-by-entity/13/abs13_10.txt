Abstract When designing and developing curriculum for a specific educational institution, curriculum specialists are generally guided by epistemological, ethical, and cultural frames of reference. In this article, I review the literature related to contemporary early childhood education, and categorize perspectives on early childhood curriculum according to their core epistemological and ethical views about the mission of institutions of early childhood education. Reviewing the literature, I have identified four schools of thought which propel various curricula: idealists, empiricists, developmentalists, and reconceptualists.
