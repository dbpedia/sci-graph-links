Abstract Graduate programs in Instructional Technology (IT) were surveyed to determine (1) the similarities and differences among programs and (2) their involvement in teacher education and school systems. Findings show Instructional Technology to be an umbrella term for programs with six different curricular emphases and 66 different program titles. Equal numbers of graduates are placed as school library media specialists and designers and media specialists in business and industry. Very few become college professors. The IT programs responding to the survey participate in the teacher education programs in their institutions primarily by acting as advisors in planning the curriculum and offering media and computing courses. Less than half have formal ties with local school systems.
