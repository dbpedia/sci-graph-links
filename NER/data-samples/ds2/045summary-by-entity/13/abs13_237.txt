Summary BACKGROUND: To assess the educational climate at a medical school, we explored students' perception of their motives for study, the importance of students' personal characteristics for success in the study and profession of medicine, students' perceptions of professional and personal characteristics of their teachers, and students' preferences for their future careers in medicine. METHODS: We surveyed all students coming to the administration office to enroll for the following academic year (2nd to 6th year of study, n = 738) at Zagreb University Medical School, Croatia. Responses with answers to all questions (n = 482, 65% response rate) were analyzed. RESULTS: Students from both preclinical and clinical study years perceived their teachers to be formal: strict, authoritative, punctual, well prepared, and respectful of hierarchy. Similar formal characteristics were seen as important for success in their studies and in the medical profession. The strongest motivation for studying among students in all study years was task completion. Most of the students wanted a career in medical practice, with (n = 160, 33.2%) or without (n = 207, 42.9%) involvement in clinical research; a few (n = 3, 0.6%) wanted to do basic biomedical research, and an academic career was sought by 23.5% (n = 112). The choice of academic career was associated with grade point average (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–2.88), higher scores on motivation scales for professional advancement (OR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.12–2.63) and academic gains (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.17–2.14). CONCLUSION: Medical students perceive formal characteristics and self-interests as dominant aspects of the educational climate at medical school, where they are motivated mostly by task completion. The change towards a climate of social sensitivity and pro-social behavior may require less frontal and more interactive teaching, with personal interaction between students and teachers.
