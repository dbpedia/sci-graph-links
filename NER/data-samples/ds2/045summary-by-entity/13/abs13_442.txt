Abstract Purpose To identify the educational media preferences of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods The IBS-Patient Education Questionnaire (PEQ) was administered to a national sample of IBS patients. Frequencies of item endorsements were compared and meaningful clinical differences were used to identify differences among subgroups. Results 1,242 patients completed the survey, mean age 39.3 years, 85% female, IBS duration 6.9 years, 79% had seen an MD for IBS within 6 months, and 92.6% used the web for medical information. The most desired source of education was “my doctor” (68%), followed by Internet (62%) and brochure (45%). Notably, patients favored an increase in use of media in the future (past vs. future): doctor (43 vs. 68%); Internet (36 vs. 62%); and brochures (26 vs. 45%). Conclusion IBS patients expect more education than they have received. Understanding IBS patients’ learning preferences can be highly valuable in the development or implementation of educational interventions.
