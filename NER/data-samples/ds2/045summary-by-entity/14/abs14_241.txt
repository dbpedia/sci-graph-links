Abstract Much attention has been given to the estimation of hedonic regressions given their potential use as a means to adjust consumer and producer price indices for quality changes. However, there has been warranted criticism over the methods used, particularly relating to the econometric specification of the models. Much of the criticism has arisen from the inability of available data to match the requirements of a fully specified model. Using EPOS scanner data for UK television sets we provide reliable hedonic estimates which incorporate several developments. Such data are available for a wide range of product areas and this application illustrates how they might be used. We develop methodology to help surmount problems arising from omitted variables, the coexistence of new and old models, weighting of observations and quality changes common to all models. More specifically we pay particular attention to the neglected area of product markets where pricing is above marginal cost.
