Abstract Space–time series can be partitioned into space–time smooth and space–time rough, which represent different scale characteristics. However, most existing methods for space–time series prediction directly address space–time series as a whole and do not consider the interaction between space–time smooth and space–time rough in the process of prediction. This will possibly affect the accuracy of space–time series prediction, because the interaction between these two components (i.e., space–time smooth and space–time rough) may cause one of them as dominant component, thus weakening the behavior of the other. Therefore, a divide-and-conquer method for space–time prediction is proposed in this paper. First, the observational fine-grained data are decomposed into two components: coarse-grained data and the residual terms of fine-grained data. These two components are then modeled, respectively. Finally, the predicted values of the fine-grained data are obtained by integrating the predicted values of the coarse-grained data with the residual terms. The experimental results of two groups of different space–time series demonstrated the effectiveness of the divide-and-conquer method.
