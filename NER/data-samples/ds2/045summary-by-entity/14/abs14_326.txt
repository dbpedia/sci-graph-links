Summary The demand for money has been at the centre of monetary econometrics. The policy debate has focused on the stability issue. To investigate this the present paper presents an overview of 400 estimated demand-for-money equations in the EC countries and G7 member states taken from the literature. The results of this survey suggest, firstly, serious doubts on the stability of the demand for money and, secondly, a remarkable evolution in econometric methodology in an attempt to improve the statistical evidence. Thirdly and important from a policy perspective, the analysis of the reported standard errors of the equations shows that among the large European countries Germany has the most stable money demand.
