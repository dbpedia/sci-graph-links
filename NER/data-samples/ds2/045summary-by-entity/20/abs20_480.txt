Abstract A square array is avoidable if for each set of n symbols there is an n × n Latin square on these symbols which differs from the array in every cell. The main result of this paper is that for m ≥ 2 any partial Latin square of order 4m − 1 is avoidable, thus concluding the proof that any partial Latin square of order at least 4 is avoidable.
