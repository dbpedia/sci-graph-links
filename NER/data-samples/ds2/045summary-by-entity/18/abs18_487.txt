Abstract  Forensic examination results play an increasingly important role in bringing many criminal investigations to a successful conclusion. The quality of the results of examinations performed in forensic science laboratories has always been the concern of the individual forensic scientist. The interpretations and results are presented in court to non-experts. Therefore, it is essential to ensure and maintain the highest standards of achievements and accuracy in forensic science. Many factors are important contributors to quality assurance in forensic science. Some unique subjects affect not only the mode of inquiry but also the way in which information is presented to the court, i.e. exhibits collection and sample handling, investigation, examination techniques, report writing and court testimony.
