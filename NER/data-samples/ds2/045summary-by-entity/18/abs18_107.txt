Abstract Using the LIF method, we have measured the rate constants of rotational energy transfer for I2*(B 3Π) in several rovibrational levels and for changes inj up to 32, with I2(X 1Σ), Ar and He as collision partners. A new approach of data processing has been employed to deduce the rate constants from the experimental data. These rate constants were then correlated with fitting laws. It was found that the I2*-I2 and I2*-Ar pairs follow the power gap law with the restriction of Δm j=0, but the I2*-He system has to be represented by an intermediate case between the power gap and exponential gap laws.
