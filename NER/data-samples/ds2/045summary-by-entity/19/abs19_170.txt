Summary The validity of Golay's assumption of a thin film in his theoretical development of capillary chromatography is evaluated by comparing it to Ari's theory which takes into account film curvature. The two solutions are compared using previously published capillary gas chromatography data. The results show that deviations between the theories are insignificant at conventional aspect ratios of 3 %, but can be important at 10 %.
