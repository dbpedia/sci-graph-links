Abstract Current marketing theory is presented as it applies to the dance/movement therapy profession. The need to make marketing accessible to all dance/movement therapists and the need for the use of a total marketing program by the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) are argued. Marketing and its major concepts are defined primarily using Phillip Kotler's marketing for nonprofits, orientation. The marketing process is presented in a step-by-step format with the intention that it would be usable by dance/movement therapists with little marketing background. A sample plan using the marketing process to develop the use of dance/movement therapy services with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related populations is included to further illustrate the process. Recommendations are made for implementation of marketing relative to the theory presented.
