Abstract A method is proposed for determining the thickness of the film in a heavily loaded elliptical elastic hydrodynamic contact. The method consists of integration of the Reynolds equation over the region occupied by the film, using the boundary differential equation for the integral of the reduced pressure. To determine the thickness of the film it is sufficient to know only the integral of the reduced pressure along the line of a constant gap. A new formula is obtained for the thickness of the film in an elliptical elastohydrodynamic contact, i.e., for the general case of a heavily loaded Hertzian contact in the presence of a lubricant.
