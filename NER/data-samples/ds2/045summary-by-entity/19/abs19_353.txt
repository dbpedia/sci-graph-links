Abstract Current studies in children’s grief and bereavement illuminate that creative arts therapies may support children in the sharing and healing of their experiences with a death loss. However, theories or models suggesting the specific role of dance/movement therapy as a possible creative intervention for this population have not yet been published. This qualitative study is designed to explore the experiences of dance/movement therapists who have worked with children grieving a death loss. Second, this research seeks to elucidate how dance/movement therapists’ experiences with this population may inform their choices to use specific clinical interventions. The results of this study highlight themes that may be relevant in dance/movement therapy applications with grieving children, and is meant to provoke further discussion and continued research that may allow for the development of new dance/movement therapy models within grief studies.
