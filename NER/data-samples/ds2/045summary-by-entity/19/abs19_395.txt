Abstract Carmen Amaya was a great Spanish Flamenco dancer raised in the Gypsy tradition, which strictly prescribes, among other things, gender obligations. The proper behavior of women is to bear children and maintain the home. Carmen, from an early age, showed extraordinary skill in the dance form that the Gypsies brought to Spain. Her grasp of the intense, sensual dance was quickly recognized and she became famous throughout the world. But she was trapped in a universal problem: How much loyalty does a great artist owe to family? She died of kidney failure at age 50 in 1963. Hers is an extreme case that focuses attention on a universal problem. She did not draw a dividing line between herself and family tradition.
