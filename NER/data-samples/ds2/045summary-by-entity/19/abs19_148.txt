Summary The rupture problem of a thin micropolar liquid film on a horizontal plane is studied. A nonlinear evolution equation is firstly derived for the film thickness,h(x, t), and then solved numerically. The results reveal that the rupture time of the film strongly increases with increase of the magnitude of the parameterR(=κ/μ). However, the analysis also shows that the micropolar coefficient, λ(=γh 0 2/μ), has little influence on the stability of the film.
