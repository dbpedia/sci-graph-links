Summary The motion of an insoluble and incompressible surface film at the gas-liquid interface of a fluid system in a finite revolving cylinder is dealt with experimentally. It is shown that the film motion induced by the side-walls affects the film motion at the plane gas-liquid interface considerably. Measurements show a difference of 20 to 30% for small speeds of rotation.
