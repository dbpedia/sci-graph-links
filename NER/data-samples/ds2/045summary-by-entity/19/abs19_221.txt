Abstract This study represents an analysis of the variables that constitute dance therapy leadership. Content analysis was employed to analyze leadership content in three major dance therapy books:Marian Chace: Her Papers (1975),Dance Therapy: Focus on Dance VII (1974), andEight Theoretical Approaches to Dance/Movement Therapy (1979). Content was collected and categorized into five topics: Terminology Describing the Dance Therapist, Personality Variables, Goals, Roles and Approaches. The data was analyzed to determine how dance therapists define and perceive the leadership process. The content suggests that there is consensus among the dance therapists reviewed concerning the variables describing themselves and the approaches, goals, roles and personality traits that comprise leadership in dance therapy. The discussion focuses on the implications of identifying leadership variables and on the shift from being specialists to generalists.
