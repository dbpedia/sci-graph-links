Abstract This article examines the diversification of the news media in Korea since the 1990s as a result of deregulation and democratization. It also examines the impact of media diversity on the public's use patterns and its trust in the media, and evaluates the current state of freedom of the press in Korea. Contrary to scholarly research, which holds that freedom of the press has increased significantly over the last decade, this study found that the Korean press still faces a variety of restraints despite improvements in a few areas.
