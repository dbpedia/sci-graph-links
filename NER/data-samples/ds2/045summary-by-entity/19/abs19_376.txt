Abstract A new form of squeeze film system is described in which the movement of one plate towards the other is simulated by the continuous volume generation of liquid over the plate area. The liquid exudes from 1580 holes distributed uniformly over the lower plate surface. An advantage of the system is that there are no moving parts, but it is important to evaluate the device using Newtonian liquids in order to compare the load bearing capacity with that predicted by equations developed for orthodox squeeze film systems. Liquid maldistribution is shown to be a problem which may be solved in various ways, one of which is to ensure that the pressure drop through the plate is high relative to that in the squeeze film. Results obtained using Newtonian liquids make satisfactory comparison with theoretical predictions, though liquid inertia probably makes a lower contribution to load bearing than is the case for an orthodox squeeze film. Liquid maldistribution is allowed for on a theoretical basis or corrected by the use of a distributor plate placed below the perforated surface. Preliminary tests using viscoelastic solutions (based on polyacrylamide of high molecular weight) suggest that the load bearing properties of the squeeze film are significantly enhanced. A load 600 per cent greater than the theoretical load is obtained in one case, the suggestion being made that this is due to stress of viscoelastic origin.
