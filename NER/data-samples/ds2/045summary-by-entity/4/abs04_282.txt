Abstract The concept of effective temperature appears to have certain advantages for indoor use and is applied as an example to the climatological data for Alice Springs, Australia. Average values of effective temperature for the hottest hour of the day are compared with those for certain Australian and overseas locations and it is concluded that, although Alice Springs is uncomfortable for a substantial part of the warm season, the climate is more comfortable than the tropical north of Australia and some overseas arid areas. The larger diurnal range at Alice Springs means more comfortable nights than in areas near the tropical coast. It is stressed that mean values can be misleading, and for adequate treatment it is necessary to examine the distribution of daily values.
