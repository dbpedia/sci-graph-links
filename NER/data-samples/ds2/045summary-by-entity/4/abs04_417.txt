Abstract To obtain the profile of excess 210Pb in sediment column, it is necessary to section the collected core to date. Sectioning thickness is generally not explicit. An approach when sedimentation rate is constant has been suggested by Lu and Matsumoto (Environ Geol 47:804â€“810, 2005). This paper addresses the case when sedimentation rate is variable. Actually, it is possible to assume that sedimentation rate is constant within the sectioning thickness and based on this concept, a tentative approach for determining reasonable sectioning thickness is proposed.
