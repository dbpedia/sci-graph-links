Abstract Uncertainty analysis in hydrological modeling would help to better implement decision-making related to water resources management, which relies heavily on hydrologic simulations. However, an important concern will be raised over the uncertainty associated with watershed subdivision broadly applied in distributed/semi-distributed hydrological models since scale issues would significantly affect model performance, and thus, lead to dramatic variations in simulations. To fully understand the uncertainty associated with watershed subdivision level, however, is still a tough work confronting researchers because of complex modeling processes and high computation requirements. In this study, we analyzed this uncertainty within a formal Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. In a case study using the semi-distributed land use-based runoff processes hydrologic model in the Xiangxi River watershed, results showed that the variation in the simulated discharges due to parameter uncertainty was much smaller than that due to parameter and model uncertainty under different watershed subdivision levels defined using aggregated simulation areas (ASAs). However, the posterior probability distribution of model parameters varied in response to subdivision levels, and four parameters (i.e. maximum infiltration rate, retention constant for slow store, maximum capacity for slow store, and retention constant for fast store) were identified with smaller uncertainty. Although the uncertainty in the simulated discharge due to parameter and model uncertainty varied little across subdivisions, the simulation uncertainty only due to parameter uncertainty was found to be reduced through increasing the subdivisions. In addition, the coarsest subdivision level (7 ASAs) was not sufficient for obtaining satisfying simulations in the Xiangxi River watershed, but inappreciable improvement was achieved through increasing the level among finer subdivisions. Moreover, it was demonstrated that increasing subdivision level would have no advantage of improving the reliability of hydrological simulations beyond the threshold (45 ASAs). The findings of this research may shed light on the design of operational hydrological forecasting in the Three Gorges Reservoir region with profound socio-economic implications.
