Abstract Samples of pheromone carriers, after use for 4–5 weeks in traps in the field, were analyzed. Partial isomerization of prodlure, (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienyl acetate (TDDA), the main component of the sex pheromone of femaleSpodoptera littoralis, took place. All three other possible isomers were formed to yield a mixture of ∼50% (Z,E)-9,11 -TDDA, ∼30% (E,E)-9,11-, ∼13% (E,Z)-9,11-, and ∼7% (Z,Z)-9,11 isomer. The process was found to be photochemically induced; none of these isomers was found under heating alone. Most of the pheromone, however, decomposed under field conditions.
