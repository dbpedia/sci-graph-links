Abstract Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) manifest as abnormal social and language development along with repetitive behaviors. Reported prevalence is 1 in 68 children. Ophthalmic disorders have been reported in as many as 50Â % of children with ASD, making a comprehensive ophthalmic examination necessary for all such children upon diagnosis. Photoscreeners are a useful tool to initially assess children with ASD. Eye examination techniques include observation, social story, visual schedule, and behavioral strategies to maximize chances of identifying ocular problems. Examination under anesthesia should be reserved for cases where ocular pathology is suspected and attempts to examine the child in the office have been unsuccessful.
