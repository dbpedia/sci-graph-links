Abstract The behaviour ofS-matrix for potentials generating bound states in continuum in the neighbourhood of the positive bound state energies is studied. It is shown that unlike the case of usual negative energy bound states, theS-matrix does not have a pole at the positive bound state energy but becomes unity at the energy corresponding to bound states in continuum. Calculations ofS-waveS-matrix for a local potential constructed by Stillinger and Herrick and a separable nonlocal potential constructed by the present authors verify these results. Our results indicate that the bound states embedded in continuum constructedvia the von Neumann and Wigner procedure cannot be interpreted as resonances with zero width.
