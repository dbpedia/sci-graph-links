Abstract To evaluate and compare the dual-pathway, original cognitive-behavioural, and enhanced “transdiagnostic” cognitive-behavioural models of binge eating, using prospective data from a pre-adolescent sample. Models were tested using multilevel longitudinal structural equation modelling. Participants were 236 children (48% male) aged between 8 and 13 years at baseline, who were interviewed annually over a 2-year period. Binge eating was assessed using the Child Eating Disorder Examination. The dual-pathway and enhanced cognitive-behavioural models provided an acceptable fit to the data, whereas the original cognitive-behavioural model did not. Partial support is provided for the prospective validity of the dual-pathway and enhanced cognitive-behavioural models of binge eating in childhood. Results suggest that body dissatisfaction and weight and shape over-evaluation may both contribute to dieting behaviour in youth, and that dieting and affect-related difficulties both require consideration in theories of binge eating development.
