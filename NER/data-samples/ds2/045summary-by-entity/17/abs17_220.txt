Abstract Six Ss performed a self-paced, random-input, discrete tracking task in one and two dimensions by quickly touching well-defined lighted areas with a stylus. An index of task difficulty was computed for each of 14 experimental conditions. Performance in terms of information-processing rate was shown to be primarily determined by the degree of task difficulty and the number of target alternatives.
