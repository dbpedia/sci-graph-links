Abstract. The goal of decentralized consensus protocols is to exchange information among nodes so that each node acquires the information held by every other node in the system. This paper presents a quorum-based, self-stabilizing maxima finding protocol which is based on a decentralized consensus protocol. The protocol exchanges information with less delay than existing ring-based, self-stablizing protocols. Furthermore, quorums can be composed, and the resulting composite quorums can be used to efficiently obtain a solution for any internetwork.
