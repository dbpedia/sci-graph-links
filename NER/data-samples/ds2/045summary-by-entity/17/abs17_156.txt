Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate which homogeneous groups, according to teacher reports of attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADH) Problems on the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF), can be identified in a referred sample (n = 4,422; age = 6–18 years; mean age = 9.9 years; 66% boys, 34% girls). Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted on ADH Problems. In addition, co-morbidity levels in the different ADH Problems groups were compared. LCA yielded three different groups of children and adolescents with both Inattention and hyperactivity–impulsivity, and one group with high scores on Inattention but low scores on hyperactivity–impulsivity. A group of patients with predominantly hyperactivity and impulsivity was not found. Individuals in groups with higher levels of ADH Problems had significantly higher levels of oppositional defiant (OD) and conduct problems, and, although to a lesser extent, significantly higher levels of affective and anxiety problems than individuals in groups with lower levels of ADH Problems. It may not be useful to discern the hyperactive–impulsive type of ADHD.
