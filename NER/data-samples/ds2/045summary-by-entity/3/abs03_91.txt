Summary The paper exposes the theoretical and experimental study performed with the purpose to extend the application of the Linear Absorbances Method to more complex systems, which present two spectral interferences. The curves of collinearity are developed and a theoretical study of them is carried out. The theoretical equations developed are experimentally tested and the influence of the variables involved in the Linear Absorbance Method is studied, too. It is concluded that the use of couples of collinear wavelengths of the interferents allows to obtain the concentration of a compound in the presence of two interfering substances.
