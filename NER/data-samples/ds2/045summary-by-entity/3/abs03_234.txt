Abstract Based on the analysis of patent information, the scientific and technical literature, and research performed at the Saratov Institute of Glass, a classification is proposed for the types of protective nitrogen-hydrogen atmosphere depending on methods of its production. The methods are considered, and the main methods for gas refinement from impurities are listed. A comparative analysis of the methods for producing protective atmospheres is carried out, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed.
