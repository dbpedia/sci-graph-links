Summary On the basis of statistical mechanics, it is shown that the following rules concerning the relative stability of different polymorphic modifications are usually obeyed. (1) The enthalpy of transition of two enantiotropic forms is always positive at temperatures above their transition point, and negative at temperatures below the transition point or between monotropic forms (heat-of-transition rule). (2) Instead of the heat of transition, the difference in the heats of fusion may generally be used (heat-of-fusion rule). (3) If a modification is less dense, it is less stable at absolute zero. (4) For hydrogen-bonded crystals, the modification for which the first absorption band in the infrared spectrum is at higher frequencies has the larger entropy. The possibility of exceptions is discussed.
