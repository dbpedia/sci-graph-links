Abstract Threshold law for the processe+A q +→A( q+4)++5e has been derived within the classical theory. For neutral targets (q=0) the threshold exponent assumes value 5.08, consistent with previous calculations for ionizations of lower orders. The method fails forq<−4. The results are compared with recent experimental measurements, which considerably underestimate theoretical findings. An empirical formula forn-fold ionization is provided, which predicts values for the threshold exponent κ=7.8 and 12.5 forn=5, 6 respectively.
