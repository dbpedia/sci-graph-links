Abstract Generalizations from the experimental current-voltage characteristics of corona discharge for helium and synthetic air at the positive and negative polarities of a star-shaped discharge electrode at different gas pressures are presented. Similar generalizations are performed for current-voltage characteristics obtained for dried air and a coaxial system of electrodes at various temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The generalization consists in reducing the family of the current-voltage characteristics to a single generalized equation that geometrically represents a segment bisector. Some aspects of the application of similarity methods for corona discharge are considered. Townsendâ€™s structure of the characteristics is confirmed, and this fact can serve as a basis for its wide application.
