Abstract The effect on wool growth of a 14-day exposure to hotroom conditions(40.5Â°C, 16 mm Hg) has been examined in mature Merino ewes offered a constant daily ration of lucerne chaff and concentrates. Hotroom exposure led to a significant increase in rectal temperature, respiration rate and water intake in treated ewes; feed intake was reduced to only 75% of the ration offered them.The 14-day hotroom exposure led to a significant reduction in wool growth rate. Wool growth in treated ewes reached its lowest level (approx. 65% of the pre-treatment level) in the second week after hotroom exposure. Examination of the weekly wool samples from treated and control ewes revealed that the heat-induced reduction in wool growth rate was due principally to a reduction in fibre diameter.
