Abstract In an earlier paper a new group of coordinate transformations was obtained for reference systems tied to massive bodies. In the present paper a relation is established between the metric coefficients of such systems and the energy of the signal. The effect of the reference body on the readings of the measuring instruments is considered with the example of the Doppler effect.
