Abstract.  This paper summarises an experimental work performed at the Dunaferr Research Institute, Hungary. Low carbon and low alloy steels with different silicon and nickel contents were heat treated under industrial conditions, i.e. in the reheating furnace of the hot rolling mill. Other sets of samples were heat treated in a laboratory furnace in air atmosphere. Scales formed in both cases were examined by different chemical and physical methods. The speed of dissolution was measured by etching the samples in a special agent and measuring the mass of the sample as a function of the etching time. The main investigations, however, were performed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an ED analyser. EDS investigations showed that with increasing Si content of the base material the scale was more rigid and could easier be removed, while increasing Ni-content caused the scale/metal interface to be more rough. The latter was observed in the case of laboratory samples as well.
