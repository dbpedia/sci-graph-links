Abstract The contact of the dimple/gimbal interface in a hard disk drive was studied experimentally. Two types of dimples with different surface roughness and several types of gimbal materials were investigated. The load–displacement curves for the contact of the dimple and the gimbal exhibit hysteresis, which is related to the plastic deformation of the asperities, during the first few load/unload cycles. The roughness of dimple and gimbal samples was measured before and after load–unload testing using an AFM. The plasticity index was determined based on the roughness measurement. The results show that the roughness and plasticity index of the non-polished dimple decrease with the number of load/unload cycles significantly, i.e., the contact surface becomes smoother than the original surface due to plastic deformation. The roughness and plasticity index of the laser-polished dimple change slightly before and after the load–unload test.
