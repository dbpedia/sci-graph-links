Abstract In 1990 and 1991, a zooplankton sampling program revealed the presence of the hydromedusan Clytia hemisphaerica (Hydromedusa: Leptomedusa) from early May through late September throughout Southampton Water. The most notable aspects of the population dynamics of C. hemisphaerica in Southampton Water were the considerable interannual variation in peak abundance—10.65 m−3 in 1990 and 2.44 m−3 in 1991—and temporal patterns of mean bell diameter. The suggestion of almost continuous reproduction in 1990, as indicated by high abundance and large size range on each sampling date, is in contrast to 1991, where at the Cracknore site, five cohorts were produced at 21 d to 80 d intervals. The maximum bell diameter attained in each generation was typically 10–11 mm. At the Cracknore site in 1991, in situ bell diameter growth was linear within each cohort. A trend of increased growth rate with each subsequent cohort, from 26 μg DW d−1 to 106 μg DW d−1 was coincident with increasing water temperature. Annual production ranged from 0.98 mg C m−3 yr−1 to 1.08 mg C m−3 yr−1 in 1990 and 0.35 mg C m−3 yr −1 to 0.48 mg C m−3 yr−1 in 1991. Daily P: B ratios varied in each cohort from 0.05 to 0.35.
