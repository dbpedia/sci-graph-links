Summary The dependence on light and temperature of the apparent photosynthetic rate was studied on ecotypes of Trifolium repens from different altitudes in the alps (600â€“2040 m above sea level). Due to the altitude, the natural habitats have different temperature conditions. At the higher altitudes the light conditions for the growing plants vary due to grazing or cutting management of these meadows. Accordingly, for this study the plants were grown at different temperatures and light intensities in growth cabinets. High altitude plants had higher photosynthetic rates, especially when measured at low temperatures. According to the light conditions, dependent on management, in the alpine habitats the ecotypes differed in their photosynthetic properties like sun and shade plants. It is stated, that the photosynthetic performance as well as the acclimation capacity to the growth conditions is related to the altitude of the habitats and probably also to the agricultural management.
