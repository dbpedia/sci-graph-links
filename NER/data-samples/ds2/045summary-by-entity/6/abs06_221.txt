Summary In interspecific competition studies, some cases of apparent change in competitive ability have been reported. But the change in competitive outcome could equally well be due to character displacement. As a preliminary to studies of the effects of association of D. melanogaster (yellow white mutant strain) and D. simulans (vermilion mutant strain), the nature and extent of ecological differences between them, and the nature of their competitive interaction was studied. Differences between the strains were shown for oviposition site preferences, and for larval and pupal distribution. In pure species cultures, simulans showed a greater preference than melanogaster for oviposition in the center of the medium surface. In mixed populations, simulans had an increased preference for this oviposition site, where melanogaster was at low frequency. D. simulans larvae utilized the lower half of the medium to a significantly greater extent than did melanogaster. At low density (5 pairs of parents) in pure species cultures, 68.7% of simulans pupae were on the medium surface. As parental numbers increased, this proportion decreased. The distribution of melanogaster pupae was quite different, with only 8 to 12% on the medium at all densities. But the remaining pupae tended to occur higher on the cylinder wall as parental numbers increased. The competitive interaction changed during the developmental period. At four and eight days after culture initiation, simulans appeared superior, while for total adult progeny production, melanogaster was slightly superior. These strans of the two species were not ecologically equivalent.
