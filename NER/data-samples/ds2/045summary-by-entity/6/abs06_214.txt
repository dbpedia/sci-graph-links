Abstract The results of ten-year observations on fluctuations in the sex of individual trees and the sex structure of tree stands in two insular pine forests in the south of Central Siberia are presented. It is noted that the ratio of sex types of pine trees has markedly changed since 1998â€“1999. Significant correlations between the sex structure of stands and anomalies of the annual average air temperature have been recorded since the early 1990s. The male generative sphere of pine has changed to the greatest extent. Periodicity and delay in the change of shoot sexualization in response to changes in temperature are discussed.
