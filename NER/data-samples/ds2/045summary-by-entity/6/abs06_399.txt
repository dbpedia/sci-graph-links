Abstract The general mathematical theory of the gradostat is presented for two competitors. The gradostat provides a mechanism for studying competition along a nutrient gradient. In the two vessel case, the results are complete and the conditions are testable. In then-vessel case, the relevant conditions are stated in terms of the stability modulii of certain matrices and are testable for any specific case.
