Abstract Data traceability and recovery are very important concerns when moving data to the Cloud. The Enhanced Watermarking Approach for Data Integrity and Non-repudiation in Rational Databases (EWRDN) provides data security means as integrity, secrecy, non-repudiation and privacy using data watermarking and compression techniques. These capabilities may enhance the whole security and trust of service providers. It gives the data owners the ability to monitor and recover data, if required. Co-ordinations between different services for data storage, manipulation and retrieval over the Cloud represents the milestone in composing the Database as a Service. Until now and to the best of our knowledge, such a service is not yet realized in a real Cloud environment. In this article, a realization for a proposed EWRDN service with data traceability capabilities is elaborated with the required performance analysis which is the main contribution of this work. A Trusted Authority service co-ordination to operate the proposed service is introduced as well. The results have shown that, the proposed service co-ordination can provide the data traceability features and stands against most of the experienced data security threats through the experiments. Moreover, EWRDN service as a differentiated quality service has been proven to provide two different data compression qualities. It has been shown that within an EWRDN co-ordination, a fixed recovery ratio of compression has been achieved.
