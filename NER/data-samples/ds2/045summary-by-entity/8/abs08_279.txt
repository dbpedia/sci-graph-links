Abstract In this paper we consider the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws on moving meshes by means of an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation of the Runge–Kutta Residual Distribution (RD) schemes of Ricchiuto and Abgrall (J Comput Phys 229(16):5653–5691, 2010). Up to the authors knowledge, the problem of recasting RD schemes into ALE framework has been solved with first order explicit schemes and with second order implicit schemes. Our resulting scheme is explicit and second order accurate when computing discontinuous solutions.
