Abstract The next three years will see the introduction of packet data offerings on GSM. There will also be the emergence of new radio coding schemes to bring data rates up to 50 kbit/s. The introduction of 3rd Generation networks bringing the capability to deliver 500 kbit/s to the wide area will also be seen. For higher data rates closer to that of fixed networks (500 kbit/s to 16 Mbit/s), cordless technologies such as Bluetooth, DECT or HIPERLAN are evolving. Applications are currently limited to home or corporate use but with the right development these technologies could become suitable alternatives to the cellular network where very high data rates are needed. Additionally, the market for wireless systems offering a direct replacement to fixed wired access is exploding. Systems offering anything from 64 kbit/s to 50 Mbit/s are available and offer new entrants the potential to rapidly and economically establish direct access to their customers. Will this be the take-up of wireless data at last? This paper explores the scenarios that these technologies bring to the marketplace and how they will be making a difference. Wireless access has finally come of age.
