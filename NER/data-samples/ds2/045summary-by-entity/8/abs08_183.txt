Abstract We present a compression scheme that is useful for interactive video applications such as browsing a multimedia database. The focus of our approach the development of a compression scheme (and a corresponding retrieval scheme) that is optimal for any data rate. To browse a multimedia database, such a compression scheme is essential. We use a multiresolution setting, but eliminate the need for wavelets. This results in much better compression. We show experimental results and explain in detail how to extend our approach to multidimensional data.
