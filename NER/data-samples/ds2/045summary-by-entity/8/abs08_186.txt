Abstract Interval arithmetic can be used to enclose the range of a real function over a domain. However, due to some weak properties of interval arithmetic, a computed interval can be much larger than the exact range. This phenomenon is called dependency problem. In this paper, Horner's rule for polynomial interval evaluation is revisited. We introduce a new factorization scheme based on well-known symbolic identities in order to handle the dependency problem of interval arithmetic. The experimental results show an improvement of 25% of the width of computed intervals with respect to Horner's rule.
