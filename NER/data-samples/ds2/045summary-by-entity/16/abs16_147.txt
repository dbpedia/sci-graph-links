Summary People working in the environmental field may refer to themselves as environmentalists, but this does not indicate how they approach their work. The term ‘environmental integrator’ has been used to describe people who are specialists with breadth, in comparison to generalists with no speciality. The training of integrators involves the integration of knowledge with the teaching of problem solving and ways of dealing with people and complex organisations. A recent evaluation of the Master of Environmental Science programme at Monash University, which has an interdisciplinary focus, provided an opportunity to see if the training of environmental integrators was feasible. A questionnaire survey of graduates, and interviews with a sample of their employers, indicated that the majority of graduates worked as integrators, and valued the broad perspectives and integrative team work opportunities gained through the programme. While it is difficult to define and measure the qualities of integrators, it is apparent that the Monash programme contributed to the training of such people, and that other tertiary programmes could do likewise.
