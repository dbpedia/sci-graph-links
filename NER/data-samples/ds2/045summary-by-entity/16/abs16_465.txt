Abstract This article seeks to examine the links that are often drawn between ``globalisation'' and crime, particularly youth crime. Critical attention is focused on claims that rapid economic and social change leads inevitably and inexorably to higher levels of offending among the young. Such deterministic accounts may have the unintended consequence of contributing to the further problematisation of young people, leading in turn to calls for more control and surveillance of this ``problem population''. The article urges greater caution in the articulation of futuristic scenarios that link young people to an escalating ``crime problem''.
