Abstract Given a setV of points on the plane, if {q 1,...,q n } is the set of points on the second convex hull ofV, the order in which these points are visited in anyV-gon is characterized. This order must verify two similar conditions to those of Kuratowski's theorem for planar graphs. Moreover, the number of possible orders that verify these conditions is obtained. It isO(5 n ).
