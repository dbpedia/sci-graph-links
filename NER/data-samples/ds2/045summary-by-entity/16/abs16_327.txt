Abstract It becomes a tendency to introduce the German and Japanese theory in the structure of crime to restructure that of China. However, Chinese structure of crime is not that poor as criticized, while that of Germany and Japan applauded by reformist also has disadvantages, such as the confliction inside the system, the deviation of actuality and original intention and the only systematic notion, etc. The issues of Chinese structure of crime, e.g. the relationship of the constituents is not clear and the concept of crime deduced from the structure of crime is too simple, can be solved by carrying through the object-preferred step-up notion and setting up the concept of crime with various meanings. Thus, the current structure of crime does not have to be restructured.
