Abstract In the paper, a family of trace equivalencies in the interleaving, step, partial order, and nondeterministic semantics is defined and studied in the context of time Petri nets. The equivalences studied are based both on the classical concept of transition firing sequences and on time processes, i.e., time extensions of net processes with global transition firing moments. Relationships between the equivalences are established, and a hierarchy of classes of equivalent time Petri nets is constructed.
