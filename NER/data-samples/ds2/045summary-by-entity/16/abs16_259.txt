Abstract Two consequences of the stability version of the one dimensional Prékopa–Leindler inequality are presented. One is the stability version of the Blaschke–Santaló inequality, and the other is a stability version of the Prékopa– Leindler inequality for even functions in higher dimensions, where a recent stability version of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality is also used in an essential way.
