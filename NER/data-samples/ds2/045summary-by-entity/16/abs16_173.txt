Abstract In this study, we used various spatial analytical methods to examine variations and trends in precipitation intensity in the conterminous USA. We found that three different measures of precipitation intensity were highly correlated; intensity increased in a spatially coherent fashion in the northeastern quarter of the USA and generally decreased in the center portion of the western USA. Evidence is presented that spatial and temporal patterns in the trends of precipitation intensity are related to the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Our results are generally in agreement with others who are reporting an upward trend in precipitation intensity during a period when the planet appears to have warmed.
