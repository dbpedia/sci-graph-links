Abstract To clarify if eye fatigue is lessened when looking at wood, we carried out objective examinations using a near-point ruler and also performed sensory evaluations. Visual contact target materials were a white plastic panel, a black plastic panel or a wood panel which had Japanese ash flat grain surface. Each size of the materials was 140 × 280 mm. Test subjects were 30 undergraduate and graduate students. Each subject’s visual distance to a panel was 40–50 cm. The results showed that subjects suffered from more eye fatigue when looking at white and black plastic panels compared to looking at the wood panel in objective examinations. In sensory evaluations, almost all subjective symptom items for eyes and head progressed when subjects looked at white plastic panel or black plastic panel. However, almost no progression of subjective symptoms was noted when subjects looked at the wood panel. In both objective examinations and sensory evaluations, eye fatigue was most highly associated with the black plastic panel, followed by the white plastic panel and, finally, the wood panel.
