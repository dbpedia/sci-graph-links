Summary When an eye movement intervenes between the presentation of a target and a mask, the mask has its effect on material projected on the same retinal position. Davidson, Fox, and Dick (1973) reported, however, that the mask appears to be positioned in real space, a suggestion which implies integration of visible information across the eye movement. The present note argues that their conclusion does not follow from their data.
