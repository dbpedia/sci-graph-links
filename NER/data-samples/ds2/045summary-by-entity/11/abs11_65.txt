Summary BackgroundAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease with rising prevalence. This study evaluates patients’ knowledge and the need for more patient information. Methods271 patients with AMD were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their knowledge about AMD. 150 patients were interviewed by a physician and 121 patients completed the questionnaire on their own. Results79.4 % of patients had previous knowledge about AMD. Most patients, 97.3 %, got their information from physicians. 58 % of patients find their knowledge concerning AMD adequate. Only 23.9 % knew about aid organizations for patients with visual impairments. DiscussionThough the majority of patients had good knowledge concerning AMD, there was a large percentage of patients who seemed to lack information. Physicians should actively ask their patients if they have any questions related to their disease. Medial focus on AMD and information about aid organizations could help patients to cope with their disease. ConclusionA large number of patients seemed to need additional information. We suggest that ophthalmologists provide general information concerning AMD to their patients every 3 to 5 years. Information about aid organizations specializing in visual impairment could also be provided. Well-informed patients would be better able to follow their physician’s instructions and would have a better understanding of their disease, particularly for the sake of therapy.
