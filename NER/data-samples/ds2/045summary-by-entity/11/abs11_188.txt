Abstract  Background: To clarify the relationship between associated systemic anomalies and ocular manifestations in patients with Peters’ anomaly, a retrospective study was conducted. Methods: We classified 37 patients with Peters’ anomaly into two groups, one with (+) and one without (–) systemic anomalies. Results: The systemic anomaly (+) group consisted of 13 patients, eight males and five females, with mean age of 2.3 months. Peters’ anomaly was bilateral in six cases and unilateral in seven. Corneolenticular adhesion was observed in 11 cases. Associated ocular anomalies were seen in 12 cases, and developmental glaucoma was present in eight cases. The systemic anomaly (–) group comprised 24 patients, 13 males and 11 females, with mean age of 28.3 months. Peters’ anomaly was bilateral in 11 cases and unilateral in 13. Corneolenticular adhesion was observed in five cases. The associated ocular anomalies were observed in 10 cases, and developmental glaucoma was accompanied in six cases. The incidences of cases with corneolenticular adhesion, those with other ocular anomalies, and those with glaucoma were significantly higher in the systemic anomaly (+) group than in the systemic anomaly (–) group. Conclusions: Peters’ anomaly accompanying corneolenticular adhesion and/or other ocular anomalies should be evaluated for the presence of systemic anomalies.
