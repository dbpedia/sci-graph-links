Summary We recorded the circadian rhythms of locomotion in vivo and then recorded the rhythm of optic nerve activity in vitro inAplysia maintained in constant conditions (CC). Some of the animals were intact, some had one optic nerve cut (1-nerve-x group) and others had both optic nerves cut (2-nerve-x group). We compared the two eye rhythms with each other and with the foregoing locomotor rhythms. 1.The procedures of eye removal and setting up for recording shifted the phase of the eye rhythm by a maximum of ±2.5 h. The largest phase shifts occurred when the eyes were removed during the middle of the subjective night. The phase shifts were similar in magnitude to those caused by 1 h pulses of light and were not large enough to invalidate the estimation of the approximate phase of the eye rhythm in vivo from data obtained subsequently in vitro.2.After three or more weeks of constant conditions, the two eye rhythms of intactAplysia were usually out of phase with each other. There was a preference for very large interocular phase differences near 180 ° at the expense of medium interocular phase differences near 90 °. The large phase differences developed as soon or sooner after the beginning of CC than medium phase differences (Fig.3A).3.InAplysia with one or both optic nerves cut, the two eye rhythms also got out of phase, but large phase differences were not more numerous than medium ones and medium phase differences developed sooner than large ones. Ocular desynchrony developed earlier in 1-nerve-x animals than in either intact or 2-nerve-x animals. Ocular desynchrony developed no sooner and perhaps later in the 2-nerve-x animals than in the intact animals (Fig. 3).Findings 2 and 3 mean that neural coupling does not assist at all in keeping the two eye clocks in phase with each other as they are in LD 12∶12. The rate of development of ocular desynchrony and the preferred interocular phase difference, however, may be weakly influenced by some type of efferent regulation of the eye clocks.4.IntactAplysia that had medium or large interocular phase differences seldom expressed strong rhythmicity in their locomotor behavior, and animals that had strong behavioral rhythmicity had small interocular phase differences (Fig. 4).5.The locomotor rhythmicity of 1-nerve-x animals was as strong as that of intact animals, but unlike intact animals, the strength of rhythmicity in the 1-nerve-x animals was unrelated to the size of the interocular phase difference (Figs. 5, 6).6.In most 2-nerve-x animals, locomotor circadian rhythmicity was weak or nonexistent (Fig. 6). Nonetheless, there were a few 2-nerve-x animals that had convincing locomotor freeruns, indicating that a circadian oscillator can be coupled to locomotion even after both optic nerves are cut (Fig. 7).7.In intactAplysia with strong behavioral rhythmicity and small interocular phase angles, the rising phase of the eye rhythm usually occurred at, or slightly before, the rising phase of the locomotor rhythm. There were exceptions to this rule, however (Fig. 8).8.In 1-nerve-x animals the phase of the rhythm of the attached eye, but not of the detached eye, corresponded to the phase of the locomotor rhythm (Fig. 9). Results 4 through 8 strengthen the conclusion that the eyes participate in the control of the circadian locomotor rhythm. Further, the eyes are neurally, not hormonally, coupled to the locomotor system. The eyes, however, may not be the driver oscillators for the locomotor rhythm.
