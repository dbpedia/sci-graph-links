Abstract Medicine bottles, examined within a larger context, provide an opportunity to explore how material culture influences, reinforces, and reflects late 19th-century gender roles. Bottles from one of Harpers Ferry National Historical Parkâ€™s late 19th-century privies reflect the gender role of a mother. Available information limits this paper to the examination of a 19th-century ideal. Examining the ideal through both archaeological and documentary evidence, however, reveals the apparatus of ideology and the effects of the ideal in practice. A mutual relationship between genders becomes apparent as does the need to maintain the interrelatedness of gender with other structuring principles of culture.
