Abstract The results of previously published statistical evaluations of morbidity and mortality statistics from 1900 to 1960 for various diseases in Japan,the United States, Egypt and several European countries are summarized. It was found that for all the diseases considered there is a monthly change in frequency distribution which led to the elaboration of a seasonal disease calendar. For Japan it was noted that the mortality peak has gradually moved from summer to winter for most diseases.This pattern has been found to exist in the highly industrialized European countries and the USA for some time, while a high summer mortality and typical seasonal disease distribution is still found in little industrialized countries such as Egypt. The deseasonality of diseases seems to be typical of industrialized countries with highly developed public health and medical services.
