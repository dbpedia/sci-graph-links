Abstract The literature on racial socialization of African Americans has focused on data drawn from young children, teens, and college students. The question of what mature adults recall as having been significant messages in their childhood about dealing with racism has been ignored, and so has the question of what the adult impact might be of childhood racial socialization. To explore these issues, we examined the autobiographies of 41 African Americans that included material on the parenting they received to deal with racism. Many of the lessons the autobiographers wrote about learning can be classified in three broad themesâ€”be aware of and alert to white racism, get a good education, and have a strong racial identity. As evidence of the usefulness in adulthood of childhood racial socialization, some autobiographers wrote about how important certain socialization experiences were to them in adulthood. This paper adds to the literature on African American racial socialization by showing the durability of some memories of childhood racial socialization and also showing that there can be an impact in adulthood of childhood racial socialization.
