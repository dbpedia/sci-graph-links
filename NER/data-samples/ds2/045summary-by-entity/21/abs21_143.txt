Abstract. In this paper we investigate fast particles in the range and support ofsuper-Brownian motion in the historical setting. In this setting eachparticle of super-Brownian motion alive at time t is represented by apath w:[0,t]→ℝ d and the state of historical super-Brownian motionis a measure on the set of paths. Typical particles have Brownian paths,however in the uncountable collection of particles in the range of asuper-Brownian motion there are some which at exceptional times movefaster than Brownian motion. We determine the maximal speed of allparticles during a given time period E, which turns out to be afunction of the packing dimension of E. A path w in the support ofhistorical super-Brownian motion at time t is called a-fast if . Wecalculate the Hausdorff dimension of the set of a-fast paths in thesupport and the range of historical super-Brownian motion. A valuabletool in the proofs is a uniform dimension formula for the Browniansnake, which reduces dimension problems in the space of stopped paths to dimension problems on the line.
