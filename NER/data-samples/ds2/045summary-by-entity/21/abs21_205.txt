Abstract A finite subset K of ℤ d is said to be lattice-convex if K is the intersection of ℤ d with a convex set. The covariogram g K of K⊆ℤ d is the function associating to each u∈ℤ d the cardinality of K∩(K+u). Daurat, Gérard, and Nivat and independently Gardner, Gronchi, and Zong raised the problem of the reconstruction of lattice-convex sets K from g K . We provide a partial positive answer to this problem by showing that for d=2 and under mild extra assumptions, g K determines K up to translations and reflections. As a complement to the theorem on reconstruction we also extend the known counterexamples (i.e., planar lattice-convex sets which are not reconstructible, up to translations and reflections) to an infinite family of counterexamples.
