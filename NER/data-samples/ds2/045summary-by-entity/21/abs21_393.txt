Summary Peach buds (floral and vegetative) were periodically collected from midsummer until the spring flowering and sprouted under continuous light, 100% relative humidity and 20–25°C. Treatments with 200 ppm gibberellin A3 (GA3) or chilling (2–4°C for 30 days before planting) were applied. Vegetative buds showed well-defined phenological stages: pre-dormancy, “true dormancy”, and end of dormancy. Both GA3 and chilling treatments shortened the sprouting times of vegetative dormant buds close to those in predormancy. Isolated floral buds were irresponsive under all conditions and did not sprout even with the GA3 or chilling treatments. In a comparative study with buds immediately after collection anatomical analysis demonstrated that vegetative buds were almost completely developed by midsummer/early automn and remained in a resting state until the end of winter. Floral buds developed continuously over the same period. Both types of verticils began to differentiate in midsummer. Sepals and petals developed mainly in late summer, androecious floral parts developed throughout the resting period, while gynoecious floral parts showed differentiation in late winter. The flower was completely formed a few days prior to blossoming. Thus, in isolated peach buds fertile verticils are not sufficiently developed during the resting time to allow sprouting.
