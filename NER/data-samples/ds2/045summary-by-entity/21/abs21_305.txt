Summary A comparison of the solar flux in January and February with the United States national temperature does not show any evident connection during the period 1952â€“1987. However, when the data are separated according to the east or west phase of the quasi-biennal oscillation (QBO) in the equatorial stratosphere the following phenomenon is found. When the QBO was in its west phase the U.S. national temperature is negatively correlated with the solar flux cycle; the opposite holds true for the east phase of the QBO.
