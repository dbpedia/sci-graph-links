Summary Some simple ideas of G. E. Andrews ([2], [3]) are used here to derive a transformation formula for a general multiple q-series with essentially arbitrary terms. As applications of (or motivated by) this q-series transformation, several transformation and reduction formulas for q-hypergeometric series in two and more variables are presented. Relevant connections of the various q-identities considered here with a number of known results are also indicated.
