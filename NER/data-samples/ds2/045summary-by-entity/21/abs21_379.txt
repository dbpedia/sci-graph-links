Abstract The Douglas bag technique is reviewed as one in a series of articles looking at historical insights into measurement of whole body metabolic rate. Consideration of all articles looking at Douglas bag technique and chemical gas analysis has here focused on the growing appreciation of errors in measuring expired volumes and gas composition, and subjective reactions to airflow resistance and dead space. Multiple small sources of error have been identified and appropriate remedies proposed over a century of use of the methodology. Changes in the bag lining have limited gas diffusion, laboratories conducting gas analyses have undergone validation, and WHO guidelines on airflow resistance have minimized reactive effects. One remaining difficulty is a contamination of expirate by dead space air, minimized by keeping the dead space <70 mL. Care must also be taken to ensure a steady state, and formal validation of the Douglas bag method still needs to be carried out. We may conclude that the Douglas bag method has helped to define key concepts in exercise physiology. Although now superceded in many applications, the errors in a meticulously completed measurement are sufficiently low to warrant retention of the Douglas bag as the gold standard when evaluating newer open-circuit methodology.
