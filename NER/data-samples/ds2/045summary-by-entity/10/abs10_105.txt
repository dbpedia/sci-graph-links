Abstract By theoretically considering a dielectric slab containing graphene, we investigate the effect of the graphene layer on the angular Goos-HÃ¤nchen (AGH) shifts and the transverse angular and spatial shifts from the spin-Hall effect of light (SHEL) for the reflection of a light beam. Through manipulating the voltage applied to graphene via an exterior gate, it was found that near the transmission resonance of the slab containing graphene, the giant and tunable AGH shifts and transverse shifts (TS) for both s-polarized and p-polarized waves are present. We also find that near the normal incident angle, the giant and tunable TS from SHEL for both s-polarized and p-polarized waves can occur on the interface containing graphene. It is expected that these phenomena can result in significant interesting and novel applications of graphene in all kinds of optical devices, and more. Graphical abstract
