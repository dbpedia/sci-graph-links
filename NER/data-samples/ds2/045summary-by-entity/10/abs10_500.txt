Summary We study finite plane strain deformations of an infinite body containing two circular voids and made of a Blatz-Ko material. The body is subjected to either uniform tensile tractions at infinity or a uniform pressure on the void surfaces. In each case, the effect of varying the distance between the void centers on the deformations of the body is analyzed. When the voids are located close to each other, a uniform pressure on the void surfaces results in noncircular deformed voids, and for a fixed value of the pressure, the deformation induced increases as the voids get closer to each other. When the body is subjected to uniform tensile tractions at infinity, say along thex-axis, the voids are deformed into ellipsoids with major axes aligned along thex-axis.
