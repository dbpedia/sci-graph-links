Abstract This study presents a factorial two-stage stochastic programming (FTSP) approach for supporting water resource management under uncertainty. FTSP is developed through the integration of factorial analysis and two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) methods into a general modeling framework. It can handle uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and interval numbers. This approach has two advantages in comparison to conventional inexact TSP methods. Firstly, FTSP inherits merits of conventional inexact two-stage optimization approaches. Secondly, it can provide detailed effects of uncertain parameters and their interactions on the system performance. The developed FTSP method is applied to a hypothetical case study of water resources systems analysis. The results indicate that significant factors and their interactions can be identified. They can be further analyzed for generating water allocation decision alternatives in municipal, industrial and agricultural sectors. Reasonable water allocation schemes can thus be formulated based on the resulting information of detailed effects from various impact factors and their interactions. Consequently, maximized net system benefit can be achieved.
