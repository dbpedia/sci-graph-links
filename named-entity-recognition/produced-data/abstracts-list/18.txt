The first method is based on the extraction of the ion-association compound of CPT with eriochrome cyanine R (ECR) into butanol. The extracted compound in the organic solvent obeys Beer’s law in the range 5–80 μg mL −1. The second method is based on the measuring of the absorbance of the aqueous solution of the compound of CPT with ECR in presence of methylcellulose. Conformity with Beer’s law was evident in the range 0.7–10 μg mL −1 of chlorprothixene. The methods were applied for the determination of chlorprothixene contents in pharmaceuticals." .

The identification of the parameters contributing to sanitary sewer overflows was focused on wet-weather conditions. Such conditions include rainfall-induced infiltration and inflow (RDII), and increased attention was given to infiltration and inflow (I/I) sources located on private property. The study also included a reference to historical and current approaches and solutions to private-property I/I, with emphasis on local ordinances, NPDES authority, and equity of corrective actions. Telephone surveys to municipalities and agencies working in the field were performed, to retrieve new information and innovating approaches. Rehabilitation of central collection systems alone can reduce I/I by an average of 30%. Although the concern is essentially legal and political when dealing with private-property owners, a comprehensive rehabilitation effort extended on private property can reduce I/I by as much as 90%." .

According to Gibrat's Law of Proportionate Effect, the growth rate of a given firm is independent of its size at the beginning of the examined period. Aimed at extending this line of investigation, the present paper uses quantile regression techniques to test whether Gibrat's Law holds for new entrants in a given industry: that is for new small firms in the early stage of their life cycle. The main finding is that for some selected industries in Italian manufacturing Gibrat's Law fails to hold in the years immediately following start-up, when smaller firms have to rush in order to achieve a size large enough to enhance their likelihood of survival. Conversely, in subsequent years the patterns of growth of new smaller firms do not differ significantly from those of larger entrants, and the Law therefore cannot be rejected." .

Specifically, we consider a variant of J. Kleinberg’s grid-based small-world model in which (1) the number of long-range edges of each node is not fixed, but is drawn from a power-law probability distribution with exponent parameter $$\\alpha \\ge 0$$ α≥0 and constant mean, and (2) the long-range edges are considered to be bidirectional for the purposes of routing. This model is motivated by empirical observations indicating that several real networks have degrees that follow a power-law distribution. The measured power-law exponent $$\\alpha $$ α for these networks is often in the range between 2 and 3. For the small-world model we consider, we show that when $$2 < \\alpha < 3$$ 2<α<3 the standard greedy routing algorithm, in which a node forwards the message to its neighbor that is closest to the target in the grid, finishes in an expected number of $$O(\\log ^{\\alpha -1} n\\cdot \\log \\log n)$$ O(logα-1n·loglogn) steps, for any source–target pair. This is asymptotically smaller than the $$O(\\log ^2 n)$$ O(log2n) steps needed in Kleinberg’s original model with the same average degree, and approaches $$O(\\log n)$$ O(logn) as $$\\alpha $$ α approaches 2. Further, we show that when $$0\\le \\alpha < 2$$ 0≤α<2 or $$\\alpha \\ge 3$$ α≥3 the expected number of steps is $$O(\\log ^2 n)$$ O(log2n) , while for $$\\alpha = 2$$ α=2 it is $$O(\\log ^{4/3} n)$$ O(log4/3n) . We complement these results with lower bounds that match the upper bounds within at most a $$\\log \\log n$$ loglogn factor." .

The case-law about civil medical liability has widely changed these past years. The reversal of the burden of proof regarding patient’s information, the presumption of responsibility in case of nosocomial infection, the medical liability without fault, the therapeutic risk and finally the law of 4 March 2002 are just a few examples of these changes. Regarding this judicial tendency of the medical practice, it appears interesting to study the contentious matters between doctors and patients in the orthopaedic and traumatologic surgery activity of a regional university hospital. Over a 20-year-period activity, at a rate of 3,000 patients per year, we found 20 files. The first complaints occurred 12 years after the medical event; they have become more frequent in the past 3 years. The most frequent reasons of complaint are the nosocomial infections and the lack of information to the patients. The rare medical errors could have had less effect if discussed beforehand with the patients. Nowadays fact sheets are available to the public and the committee for the prevention of nosocomial infection (CLIN) is positively involved. The complaints’ handling process is still slow, and therefore delays the compensation of victims. The increasing number of complaints made to the Regional commission for conciliation and compensation (CRCI) could be a solution to address those delays." .

The above-mentioned cases range from the most stupid attack to the most sophisticated one. Consequences are expected to occur on both technical and judicial levels. The possibility that a battle may be won on a technical level could have disastrous effects on a judicial level.What we usually call “self-defense” applies both to blind attacks and targeted assaults (which may use viral codes).

The SWAMI project took a precautionary approach in its exploration of the privacy risks in AmI and sought ways to reduce them. It constructed four “dark scenarios” showing possible negative implications of AmI, notably for privacy protection. Legal analysis of the depicted futures showed the shortcomings of the current legal framework in being able to provide adequate privacy protection in the AmI environment. In this paper, the authors, building upon their involvement in SWAMI research as well as the further advancement of EU privacy analysis, identify various outstanding issues regarding the legal framework that still need to be resolved in order to deal with AmI in an equitable and efficacious way. This article points out some of the lacunae in the legal framework and postulates several privacy-specific safeguards aimed at overcoming them." .

We study the properties of spectrum and eigenstates of the Google matrix of a directed network formed by the procedure calls in the Linux Kernel. Our results obtained for various versions of the Linux Kernel show that the spectrum is characterized by the fractal Weyl law established recently for systems of quantum chaotic scattering and the Perron-Frobenius operators of dynamical maps. The fractal Weyl exponent is found to be ν ≈ 0.65 that corresponds to the fractal dimension of the network d ≈ 1.3. An independent computation of the fractal dimension by the cluster growing method, generalized for directed networks, gives a close value d ≈ 1.4. The eigenmodes of the Google matrix of Linux Kernel are localized on certain principal nodes. We argue that the fractal Weyl law should be generic for directed networks with the fractal dimension d < 2." .

Of these three, tf is the weakest parameter in that a range oftf offers a set of nearly equivalent solutions. In this context, we comment on Nishioka et al.'s finite-lifetime model, which is a modification of the fragmentation model. We propose a truncated Gaussian function as a first-approximation distribution law for particle fragmentation times. We apply this generalized model to a stria in comet Hale-Bopp detected on March 5–15, 1997 and analyzed by Pittichová et al. in a recent paper. We find that in order to fit the stria's estimated width of ∼150 000 km, the fragmentation times cannot be distributed over a period of more than approximately 2 to 3 days." .

We extend this research by using a nationally representative sample of US and German residents to examine the impact of reported civic involvement and the perceived effectiveness of these activities on three outcomes related to litigiousness – use of a lawyer, seriously considering suing, and actually suing. The findings indicate that, with the exception of boycotting, civic involvement is not a significant predictor of litigiousness. Those who believe litigating is an effective way to participate in public life are more likely to litigate. Notably, Americans also are less likely than Germans to see litigation as effective and are substantially less likely to sue." .

These results are significantly different from those obtained in the exogenous imitation model of Lai (J Dev Econ 55(1): 133–153, 1998).

Restrictions on the evolution laws and the yield criteria are established based on the second law of thermodynamics and rational.

In usual probability theory, various characterizations of the Gaussian law have been obtained. For instance, independence of the sample mean and the sample variance of independently identically distributed random variables characterizes the Gaussian law and the property of remaining independent under rotations characterizes the Gaussian random variables. In this paper, we consider the free analogue of such a kind of characterizations replacing independence by freeness. We show that freeness of the certain pair of the linear form and the quadratic form in freely identically distributed noncommutative random variables, which covers the case for the sample mean and the sample variance, characterizes the semicircle law. Moreover we give the alternative proof for Nica's result that the property of remaining free under rotations characterizes a semicircular system. Our proof is more direct and straightforward one." .

A deeper understanding of the frictional behaviour and sliding between an ice mass and a rock bed is an important problem in glacier physics. In this study we investigate two approaches to the problem of glacier sliding. The first approach models friction forces between the ice and the bed. The second approach considers various proposals of a sliding velocity. Anisotropy of rock bed topographies is a source of anisotropic tribological phenomena. Therefore, anisotropic and inhomogeneous friction and anisotropic sliding are discussed in detail. Various types of friction anisotropy are distinguished with the aid of linear and nonlinear friction models. Next, anisotropic friction and sliding rules are derived using an elasto-plastic analogy. A sliding law proposed by Hindmarsh is applied in the analysis of anisotropic sliding. Extended forms of the sliding law are given with the aid of anisotropic friction models. Furthermore, stick-slip motions are identified as important in the dynamics of glacier sliding." .

The discussion is placed in the legal context of Contributory Negligence, and parallels are drawn between the present approach and the ‘economic’ approach to liability. A contributory negligence rule is said to be optimal if it minimizes a weighted sum of the cost of assessment error and the cost of the deviation between a rule and the ‘optimally deterrent’ rule. It is shown that the form of the optimal rule depends on the ‘importance’ of deterrence and on the probability distribution of plaintiffs with respect to fault. Sufficient conditions are given for each of the extant contributory negligence rules to approximate the optimal rule. It is argued that, in designing the law, the preference among rules should be based on the relative plausibility of these sufficient conditions, some of which may be verifiable empirically." .

When a complaint of sexual harassment from a sexualised workplace is raised in a legal forum, a complainant has an obligation to clearly object to the sexual remarks, ‘jokes,’ banter, etc.—which may be the ‘norm’—to show the conduct in question was unwelcome. At the same time, however, a workplace may be structured, in part by law, in a way that restricts employee resistance to uncomfortable sexual experiences. This is the case, I argue, for women working in full-service restaurants when it comes to sexual interactions with customers. This paper explores how restaurant work, in the Canadian context with a focus on the province of British Columbia, is organised in a manner that makes women vulnerable to enduring sexually harassing practices as a routine part of their jobs." .

The sheets are not laminated or glued, but they interact by frictional contact. In general, it is not possible to perform a full-scale finite element contact computation for piles containing thousands of sheets; the problem size becomes too large, and numerical solution methods suffer from severe convergence problems due to the large number of strongly coupled contact conditions. In this paper, a macroscopic material model is presented for the two-dimensional case. The pile of sheets is homogenized by introducing an effective anisotropic constitutive law, which is motivated by formulations of the theory of elasto-plasticity. This macroscopic material law models the behavior of a pile of sheets, allowing for no tensile stresses in the direction normal to the sheets and obeying Coulomb’s law of friction in the tangential contact plane. Applying this macroscopic material model, an equivalent homogeneous body can be treated using much coarser discretizations. Computational results for the problems are provided, and a comparison with simplified contact computations is done." .

The book is an edited collection of work from a number of prominent employment relations’ academics and practitioners across Australia. By drawing upon both Australian and international employment rights the book allows for a critique of current and prospective legislation within Australia. This article highlights key parts of the book that should be of interest to both Australian and international readers. A great deal of the book’s content is based on international conventions concerned with equitable principles which the authors suggest should govern the workplace, for example: a workplace free of discrimination; dignity at work; fair minimum standards and effective dispute resolution. This author contends that the book should be considered by policymakers when drafting new Australian industrial relations policy. It is a welcome addition to scholarship in this field." .

The entropy measure of the magnetogram as a function of spatial scale obeys a scaling law, which leads to a fractal dimension ofD f = 1.7. Furthermore, the entropy scaling law is directly related to the intermittency of magnetic features, which increases for decreasing spatial scales, as expected for a turbulent signal. In this context, the scaling law parameter can be interpreted as a fractional reduction in volume from one step of the turbulent cascade to the next." .

Based on the analysis of the dissipation, state laws, flow rules and evolution equations are proposed for Cosserat, strain gradient and micromorphic continua. The case of the gradient of internal variable approach is also incorporated by regarding the nonlocal internal variable as an actual additional degree of freedom. The consistency of the continuum thermodynamical framework is ensured by the introduction of a viscoplastic pseudo–potential of dissipation, thus extending the classical class of so–called standard material models to generalized continua. Variants of the higher order and higher grade theories are also reported based on the explicit introduction of the plastic strain tensor as additional degree of freedom. Within this new class of models, called here gradient of strain models, one recognizes the fact that, in a second grade theory for instance, the plastic part of the strain gradient can be identified with the gradient of plastic strain. Simple examples dealing with bending and shearing of Cosserat or second grade media are given to illustrate two types of extensions of classical J 2-plasticity : single-criterion and multi-mechanism generalized elastoplasticity. Finally, formulations at finite deformation of the proposed models are provided focusing on proper decompositions of Cosserat curvature, strain gradient and gradient of micromorphic deformation into elastic and viscoplastic parts." .

It differs from non public reason, which is used e.g., in universities and academic institutions. Rawls contrasts with Kant, which opposes the public reason of the scholar—or the philosopher—, who speaks before the world, to the private reason of state or church officials. The later, once they accept an authority, cannot think by themselves (selbst denken). A closer examination shows that Rawls is not so far from Kant as it seems, because he takes the constitutional judges not as they are, but as they should be. However Rawls still apparently refuses Kant’s unity of reason. Further investigation of the relations between ethical reason, democratic reason and legal reason is needed. Democratic reason is tantamount both to public reason and to legal reason in a modern constitutional state. It is a requirement of ethics but still not identical with ethical reason, since it is possible to accept democratic reason and to argue against it from an ethical point of view. There is just one good way of reasoning, in spite of the constraints that the sources of law and the rules of procedure impose on legal reasoning, compared with ethics. Such constraints are based on the democratic principle, which is again based on ethical reason, which at last both grounds and limits the constraints that law imposes on reason." .

The Weber ratio so deduced is not constant, and its dependence on stimulus intensity is exhibited. The dependence of the difference limen on the internal threshold is discussed; it is found that in general there is a finite value of this threshold for which response is impossible. This critical threshold is lower for higher values of the reference stimulus intensity. Similarly, it is shown that the difference limen and the Weber ratio, for a fixed value of the threshold, become infinite (i.e., discrimination is impossible) for a value of the stimulus intensity which in general is finite." .

In this article, the author argues that while the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg has historically taken care to ensure legal harmony in an otherwise uncertain legal context, some recent proposals under the Third Pillar, such as the draft framework decision on procedural guarantees, have been less clear about the relationship between EU legal acts and the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, the author argues that while the Strasbourg court’s judgments in Matthews and Bosphorus helped clarify the scope of its jurisdiction with regard to EU legal acts, the Luxembourg court’s judgment in Pupino would seem to reinforce the discretion left to national authorities in applying Third Pillar legal acts and thus also the scope of the Strasbourg court’s jurisdiction in cases concerning their implementation." .

Music and law are considered as parallel social practices or performative doings. The paper begins with a critical analysis of the special aesthetical features of present-day juridical practice as exemplified by legal trial and legal expertise. Drawing upon reflections on the modern discourse on aesthetics and art, the article then examines in greater detail the specific traits of performance in law and jazz music. Performative processes move from representation to presentation, from a preoccupation with rules and controlling to induced self-programming. Both law and jazz regard the unknown future as a resource for present decisions by “inventing” new possibilities; both require, expand and promote a responsibility that does not follow from statutes nor can be expressed in a code of ethics. Finally, the article addresses the performance situation in jazz. Jazz being polyphonic and improvisational by nature, improvisation makes explicit tradition by staging the context dependency of its performance. It is mediated by the knowledge, the operational history and the communication of the participants. Jazz is an exercise in the possibilities of an “aesthetics of imperfection” which can open up new ways of seeing law and politics." .

The law of motion of the plasma piston was unknown and needed to be determined. Kinematic and dynamic parameters of the expanding piston were obtained to determine the law of power deposition into the channel. As a result of an exact analytic solution of the problem, it is shown that if the pressure function at the channel wall is a series of pulses of increasing amplitude, the pressure function at a fixed point in the wave zone is also a series of increasing pulses. The pulsation period of the pressure curve at the channel wall is equal to the pulsation period of the power deposition curve and the pulsation period of the pressure curve at a fixed point in the wave zone." .

The Oort and Schmidt classification of comet ‘age’ has been extended and applied with Marsden's new determinations of inverse semi-major axis, 1/a, original. All classes of comets withP>25 yr show statistically the same value ofn after perihelion. New comets approach perihelion with smaller values ofn and older comets with increasingly larger values (Table II). For comets ofP<25 yr,n is larger and erratic. A physical interpretation involves the quick loss of a frosting of super-volatile materials from new comets; then, for all comets, the development of an insulating crust after perihelion. The crust also includes ‘globs’ of meteoroidal and icy material. The crust tends to be purged near perihelion but generally to grow in a spotty fashion with cometary age. The orientation of the axes of rotating comets is shown to be an important unknown factor in cometary brightness variations. A speculation is made concerning the axis of rotation for C/Kohoutek, 1973 XII." .

While there is an element of truth in this contention, it betrays the more complex interactions between public legislators and influential transnational private trade associations, most notably the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), both prior to the GFC and in the wake of it. ISDA, its members and national governments interact on the basis of legal and policy tradeoffs which are ostensibly related to OTC derivatives’ regulatory treatment but which, in reality, extend beyond this. The fact of these interactions between ISDA and nation states may raise less regulatory legitimacy challenges than some of the norms which are communicated. A prime example is the public transposition of ‘safe harbours’ which insulate OTC derivatives, including ‘purely speculative’ contracts, from the full force of gambling law. It is thus suggested that while the regulatory role and expertise of ISDA should be formally recognised and appropriately harnessed by public actors in the creation of a new public-private regulatory détente in the OTC derivatives markets, a review of the appropriateness of the current legal treatment of purely speculative derivatives should be a priority for any such regulatory regime." .

The main aim is to find the dimension of the corresponding Gaussian law. It turns out that ifG is the Zariski closure of a group generated by the support of the distribution of our matrices, and ifG is semi-simple, then the dimension of the Gaussian law is equal to the dimension of the diagonal part of Cartan decomposition ofG. In this article we present a detailed exposition of results announced in [GGu]. For reasons explained in the introduction, this part is devoted to the case ofSL(m, ℝ) group. The general semi-simple Lie group will be considered in the second part of the work. The central limit theorem for products of independent random matrices is our main topic, and the results obtained complete to a large extent the general picture of the subject. The proofs rely on methods from two theories. One is the theory of asymptotic behaviour of products of random matrices itself. As usual, the existence of distinct Lyapunov exponents is the most important fact here. The other is the theory of algebraic groups. We want to point out that algebraic language and methods play a very important role in this paper. In fact, this mixture of methods has already been used for the study of Lyapunov exponents in [GM1, GM2, GR3]. We believe that it is impossible to avoid the algebraic approach if one aims to obtain complete and effective answers to natural problems arising in the theory of products of random matrices. In order also to present the general picture of the subject we describe several results which are well known. Some of these can be proven for stationary sequences of matrices, others are true also for infinite dimensional operators (see e.g. [BL, O, GM2, L, R]). But our main concern is with independent matrices, in which case very precise and constructive statements can be obtained." .

The article focuses on the CVM and argues that since Bulgaria’s accession in 2007, external pressure from the EU is a necessary but insufficient condition for change. The EU needs civil society organizations (CSOs) to be an empowered and trustworthy domestic partner, in order for the CVM to achieve the rule of law in Bulgaria.

It begins with a review of the legal arguments around copyright legislation and notes that the law is currently unclear and contested. Adapting the game “scruples” to questions of what is and is not considered theft, a qualitative study reflects on the ways that ethical positions around new media are reached and articulated. The findings relate ethical positions constructed around notions of resistance, intangibility and identity. It is argued that the global online population cannot be policed without consent and that mechanics of artist reimbursement must be developed that account for consumers’ technology scruples. File sharing is then considered not as a legal problem but as a design challenge and a strategy of enchantment is suggested. The design concept of a digital music box is outlined to illustrate strategies of enchantment rather than litigation and intimidation." .

Each job is composed of a sequence of operations to be performed on different machines. A legal schedule is one in which within each job, operations are carried out in order, and each machine performs at most one operation in any unit of time. If D denotes the length of the longest job, and C denotes the number of time units requested by all jobs on the most loaded machine, then clearly lb = max[C,D] is a lower bound on the length of the shortest legal schedule. A celebrated result of Leighton, Maggs, and Rao shows that if all operations are of unit length, then there always is a legal schedule of length O(lb), independent of n and m. For the case that operations may have different lengths, Shmoys, Stein and Wein showed that there always is a legal schedule of length , where the notation is used to suppress terms. We improve the upper bound to . We also show that our new upper bound is essentially best possible, by proving the existence of instances of acyclic job shop scheduling for which the shortest legal schedule is of length . This resolves (negatively) a known open problem of whether the linear upper bound of Leighton, Maggs, and Rao applies to arbitrary job shop scheduling instances (without the restriction to acyclicity and unit length operations)." .

Due to stationarity the flux of angular momentum which is transported through any sphere by the circulations must be cancelled by the flux of angular momentum due to turbulent friction. If the circulation goes equatorward at the outer surface the law of rotation must be such that angular momentum is transported in outward direction through the sphere." .

A method is proposed, enabling the user to obtain this result provided the curve—and the law of motion—are described by means of two listsX i andY i. This general method is applied to two particular cases. First, a linear interpolator is described: two possible implementations are suggested. An algorithm is then presented, allowing to generate conics by means of adding operations only; the algo-rithm can lead to the realization of a second-order interpolator." .

Several courts have considered such hypotheses but few of them have nullified provisions pertaining to the formal constitution. Scholarly debates remain highly controversial and convincing explanations for one or another solution seem to be wanting. This paper addresses the puzzle from both the point of view of legal theory and at the level of comparative constitutional law in the perspective of analytic normativism. It makes the claim that this approach allows to better analyse the underlying question as a problem of complex hierarchies, which can provide solutions to cases in legal orders as different as Austria, France, Germany or Israel. Traditionally, the constitution is seen as one bloc on top of the legal system. But what this means remains often mysterious or unclear. If there could be something above this highest element, it could be considered from a moral perspective or in line with legal realism, a mere question of case-law. According to the conception set forth here, whether different levels of legal norms exist and what normative relations apply between them, is a question of positive law. Hence there may be several layers above what is usually considered primary legislation, if there are several legal forms, differentiated by their mode of production. The truly difficult problem, then, is to find out whether these differences are related to organized derogatory superiority, such that lower deficient norms can be nullified. Such structures appear more and more frequently in contemporary law. To better grasp this, we use the concept ofnon-equivalent polymorphism. The problem of whether courts are competent to annul lower level constitutional provisions is presently not explicitly settled in formal constitutions. It can—and should—nonetheless be solved through means of constitutional interpretation." .

I consider the discourses of vulnerability that surround the different legal regimes and whether the emerging theoretical vulnerability literature can assist in developing more nuanced legal responses. I argue that the inherent jurisdiction and Care Act 2014 provide an opportunity to move away from the focus on inherent features of vulnerability such as mental disability towards a more nuanced, situational and embodied account of what it means to safeguard ‘vulnerable adults’. This has the potential to be developed in England through the new legal framework of the Care Act and can be achieved through targeting interventions against the situational causes of vulnerability, for example the perpetrators of sexual violence." .

It may not result in a finding of the lack of distinctive character of a sign identical to a national trade mark, as such, by eliminating the national protection of marks, would be incompatible with the above-mentioned coexistence of the Community trade marks and national trade marks.5.For such cases, Article 8(2)(a)(ii) expressly requires that national trade marks be taken into consideration as earlier trade marks.6.Consequently, it is necessary to acknowledge a certain degree of distinctiveness of an earlier national mark on which an opposition against the registration of a Community trade mark is based." .

In this respect, medico-legal examination is an essential part of the investigation process, determining in a scientific way the cause(s) and manner of unexpected and/or unnatural death or bringing clinical evidence in case of physical, psychological, or sexual abuse in living people. From a legal perspective, these types of investigation must meet international standards, i.e., it should be independent, effective, and prompt. Ideally, the investigations should be conducted by board-certified experts in forensic medicine, endowed with a solid experience in this field, without any hierarchical relationship with the prosecuting authorities and having access to appropriate facilities in order to provide forensic reports of high quality. In this respect, there is a need for any private or public national or international authority including non-governmental organizations seeking experts qualified in forensic medicine to have at disposal a list of specialists working in accordance with high standards of professional performance within forensic pathology services that have been successfully submitted to an official accreditation/certification process using valid and acceptable criteria. To reach this goal, the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) has elaborated an accreditation/certification checklist which should be served as decision-making support to assist inspectors appointed to evaluate applicants. In the same spirit than NAME Accreditation Standards, European Council of Legal Medicine (ECLM) board decided to set up an ad hoc working group with the mission to elaborate an accreditation/certification procedure similar to the NAME’s one but taking into account the realities of forensic medicine practices in Europe and restricted to post-mortem investigations. This accreditation process applies to services and not to individual practitioners by emphasizing policies and procedures rather than professional performance. In addition, the standards to be complied with should be considered as the minimum standards needed to get the recognition of performing and reliable forensic pathology service." .

In particular, it is proved that the First Law of Thermodynamics leads directly to the following statement: For every system of whatever complexity there exists an extensive function of state S defined from dS = δqrev/T, where δqrev is the infinitesimal quantity of heat exchanged reversibly between the system and the surroundings and T is the absolute temperature of the system. Thus, for reversible adiabatic processes we readily have from the First Law that dS = 0.

Conclusion During a period of strength the Canadian labor movement was able to secure enduring legislation providing for their institutional protection. In the 1940s Justice Rand justified his decision by invoking the spirit underlying the operationalization of a collective bargaining regime. In the 1990s the Canadian Supreme Court continued this tradition by refusing to hollow out unions’ rights to a secure financial base and autonomy in decision making. Between the 1940s and the 1990s, the unions' voice was heard in legislatures throughout the country through the NDP. Canadian unions now benefit from, among other things, first-contract arbitration, job protection for striking workers, and a card process of union certification. Thus, although current Canadian attitudes towards unions show considerable detachment, the embeddedness of legal protections helps hold such challenges as RTW in Alberta at bay. During the same years, American labor was unable to translate its strength of numbers into gains in public policy: in fact, as union density peaked, legislation such as the Taft-Hartley Act and Landrum-Griffin Act eroded union institutional protections." .

Analytical solution lends one distinct value of generalized Reynolds number at the inlet to a nozzle below which the air core is not formed. Experiments reveal that there exist two limiting values of such generalized Reynolds number regarding the formation of air core in a nozzle. One value being the upper limit below which steady flow occurs without air core, the other one is the lower limit above which steady flow with fully developed air core persists. In between these two limiting values, there prevails a transition zone through which fully developed air core is set up within the nozzle. For all the nozzles, theoretical results are in fair agreement with the experimental values of upper limit of generalized Reynolds numbers with respect to steady flow without air core. Amongst all the pertinent independent geometrical parameters of a nozzle, the orifice-to-swirl chamber-diameter ratio has the remarkable influence on generalized Reynolds number describing the initiation of air core." .

The processes of the two periods are analyzed at both the international and domestic levels of decision making. At the domestic level, the process is divided into three areas—decision-making factors, the decision itself, and the process itself—to clarify the comparison. It is concluded that Japan’s decision in 1997 may have been effective in mediating between the United States and the EU for a short time, but not in the last phase of the negotiation when countries started bargaining toward an agreement. The process may also not be suitable if Japan wants to take the lead in the climate-change debate. To overcome these weaknesses it is necessary to make changes in the decision-making process to involve more domestic stakeholders in the process, and to strengthen the capacity of such stakeholders." .

Employers who harass, pass over for promotion, and even terminate workers because they care for children, elderly parents or spouses, or disabled family members have been sued with more frequency and have been paying increasing amounts in verdicts. Recently, the EEOC took an important step toward ending this discrimination by issuing enforcement guidelines that will educate employers and employees about family responsibilities discrimination and caregivers’ rights and responsibilities. The Guidelines explain how federal equal employment opportunity laws apply to workers who struggle to balance work and family, and what firms can do to avoid potential legal problems and accompanying liabilities with respect to family responsibilities and caregiving discrimination." .

There are three basic equations in mechanics for treating collisions: the law of impact, kinematic compatibility, and energetic consistency. In this paper, the conditions are examined under which a natural extension of the dynamics at an impact is possible without taking additional impact laws, and which additional assumptions have to be made to solve the impact for different classes of systems. It will be shown that Newton’s law of impact for two colliding point masses can be derived from the concept of energy conservation and the principle of maximum dissipation, and has therefore not to be regarded as an independent equation. Moreover, it can be assigned to single-contact impacts in multibody systems as soon as the classical definition of perfect constraints is being extended to impulsive dynamics and unilateral contacts. It will further be shown that the principle of maximum dissipation leads to a unique post-impact velocity in the case of multi-contact collisions. In all other cases, however, the velocities remain undetermined, and laws of impact have to be postulated as additional and independent equations, whereas the classic definition of the restitution coefficient as a dissipation parameter can still be kept." .

VDI Guidelines published in German and English language serve as the German point of view in the European standardisation process.

Leading Feminists, among them Camille LeGrand and Susan Brownmiller, have proposed new hypotheses both on rape and the rapist which differ significantly from traditional theories on the crime. Some of the Feminists’ hypotheses, particularly those which presuppose very high levels of rape and assume massive underreporting of the crime by its victims, do not receive much support in empirical surveys. But one aspect of the Feminists’ perspective on rape—that rape is an act against both person and property—is substantiated by empirical analysis of UCR data. The data suggest that the crime of rape shares significant commonalities with the crimes of property, as well as crimes of violence, and rape statistics act to hold together these two, otherwise different, categories of crime." .

Violators get private signals about their individual probabilities of apprehension after they committed a crime. Since violators will self-report if and only if the signal is above a specific threshold, the possibility of self-reporting has an option value that leads to a higher crime rate if the authority's effort remains unchanged. We demonstrate that self-reporting nevertheless increases social welfare even under the restriction that the crime rate must not be higher than without self-reporting." .

In particular, I examine closely the rationale for the U.K. Financial Services Authority, created in 1998, because it might serve as a regulatory model.

Teipel et al. [1], [2], and K. Wierzcholski [3]. They restricted, however, their investigations to the cylindrical journal bearings only. Moreover, the authors assumed the width of the bearing to be infinite in order to reduce a three-dimensional problem to the two-dimensional one. In this paper an attempt is made to study the non-isothermal flow of a power law lubricant through the gap of a conical journal bearing. At first, the more general equations in curvilinear coordinates are derived which describe the flow of a power law lubricant in the bearing gap of a quite arbitrary geometry. Afterwards, as a special case, a conical bearing gap is considered. It seems to the authors that they succeeded in omitting the necessity of using numerical procedures and obtained a relatively simple, analytical solution to the problem discussed." .

Loosely speaking, such a process has a semimartingale decomposition such that in the interior of the orthant the process behaves like a Brownian motion with a constant drift and covariance matrix, and at each of the (d-1)-dimensional faces that form the boundary of the orthant, the bounded variation part of the process increases in a given direction (constant for any particular face) so as to confine the process to the orthant. For historical reasons, this “pushing” at the boundary is called instantaneous reflection. In 1988, Reiman and Williams proved that a necessary condition for the existence of such a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) is that the reflection matrix formed by the directions of reflection be completely-L. In this work we prove that condition is sufficient for the existence of an SRBM and that the SRBM is unique in law. It follows from the uniqueness that an SRBM defines a strong Markov process. Our results have potential application to the study of diffusions arising as approximations tomulti-class queueing networks." .

The threshold level of production at which regulation is implemented is unknown to the firms in the industry, and future rights to produce in the regulated situation are made dependent on current production. Hence, a firm produces in order to earn profit in the current period, and to secure property rights in the future; this latter motive is a form of rent-seeking behavior, and will tend to raise current production even though the aim of regulation may be to reduce it. The beneficial effects of an increase in current production must be weighed against the raised probability that regulation will be implemented in order to determine equilibrium production. We characterize this equilibrium, and look at the comparative static effects of changing various policy variables. We consider how a regulator can achieve a current production target and at the same time pursue his own private goals. For example, a regulator who cares about his image or probability of re-election may not wish to pursue a strict regulation policy for the industry in question. We show that a production target can be achieved whilst following a seemingly relaxed regulation policy due to the history dependence of the allocation rule. This provides a new justification for the use of history-dependent allocations in quantity regulation; these are widespread in practice, even though they may lead to various undesirable phenomena." .

In this essay, I seek to argue that unlike what his critics have argued, it included a comprehensive and procedure-based understanding of the legitimacy of law and political authority, which he also saw as the basis for democratic constitutionalism. Kelsen’s procedural form of legitimacy is an attempt to depoliticise law, and as an attempt to distinguish form and substance in law in order to make that kind of depoliticisation feasible. However, that also meant that Kelsen was forced to accept that sometimes controversial aspects of judicial discretion were justified only through their procedural necessity, not by any substantive idea of political morality." .

Corrections to the scattering’s cross section that adjust the Rayleigh law to the case of a potential flow around inhomogeneities are calculated. It is shown that, when microinhomogeneities are moving in a viscous medium, the characteristics of discrete scatterers may considerably deviate from the Rayleigh law. Based on the data on the velocity and size distribution of falling drops of water in air, refinements are proposed for the laws of low-frequency sound scattering by rain." .

The purpose of this article is to show the conditions under which a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding will lead to the termination of a labor contract. Our results suggest that (a) legal rulings that reduce the costs of bankruptcy will increase the number of contractual dissolutions and (b) a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is more likely to occur when a firm operates in a climate of uncertain expectations." .

However, despite the undoubted significance of the judgment, it represents a missed opportunity to more fully reflect issues of gender. The article argues that in order to capture the plurality of gendered experiences it is necessary to foreground a social understanding of harm. Drawing on civil party oral testimony, the article begins to surface gendered experiences of the social harms of familial separation and starvation of family members, harms that have often remained silenced in international criminal law. In doing so it seeks to contribute to emerging feminist discourse on broader gendered harms and illustrates the need for further scrutiny of the approach of the ECCC." .

In the present paper, a model for the FSDP wave number dependence of the ratio (log A)/n has been proposed and a good agreement has been found with the experiments. By using the concept of bond fluctuation in superionic conductors, the results have been successfully explained, leading to the conclusion that the universal aspect of the power law reflects the universal pattern of the potential barrier at intermediate length scales. The result reconfirms that the ion transport in glasses is intimately related with the FSDP wave number." .

With increasing access to modern facilities, market opportunities and changes in the legal framework, pastoral systems in the Himalaya are undergoing an unprecedented change. Questionnaire-based qualitative surveys were conducted in five villages of northern Bhutan, to understand how the recent changes in the legal framework for Cordyceps (known as caterpillar fungus) collection have caused specific changes in yak farming practices. Survey results revealed that women were increasingly involved in yak husbandry and household work, after the legalization of Cordyceps collection in 2004. After legalization, the Cordyceps business overtook yak farming as the main income-earning activity. Post-legalization saw a decline in the overall grassland condition and most herders migrated a month earlier to the summer grazing land. Legalization also led to increase in the number of households buying commercial feeds for yaks. Yak mortality increased and fodder scarcity became more acute, which is a major constraint to yak farming. Despite the good income from the Cordyceps business, yak farming was the preferred earning activity over Cordyceps due to herders’ confidence in yak farming as a reliable source of livelihood. Of several measures proposed by yak herders to improve yak farming, increasing grassland productivity and providing subsidies for feed purchases were the most important measures. The study concluded that yak farming practices have undergone a few positive but more undesirable changes after the legalization of Cordyceps collection in 2004. The results suggest multi-disciplinary approaches to address adequately the emerging issues of yak farming e.g. introducing schemes to make yak farming attractive to the mountain youth. The paper suggests interventions to strengthen yak farming and help herders make informed choices in the high altitude rangelands of Bhutan. Essentially, yak farming is at a crossroads where a firm decision is needed to either encourage and strengthen the farming practices or witness the gradual extinction of the age-old tradition." .

Two other characterizations go via a simple duality concept and “small” subspaces. The correspondence to arrangements is obtained indirectly via a new characterization of uniforom oriented matroids: a range space (X, ℛ) naturally corresponds to a uniform oriented matroid of rank |X|—d if and only if its VC-dimension isd,R∈ℛ impliesX - R∈ℛ, and |ℛ| is maximum under these conditions." .

We consider a stochastic process with the weakest mixing condition: the so called α. For any fixed n-string we prove the following results. (1) The hitting time has approximately exponential law. (2) The return time has approximately a convex combination between a Dirac measure at the origin and an exponential law. In both cases the parameter of the exponential law is λ(A)ℙ(A) where ℙ(A) is the measure of the string and λ(A) is a certain autocorrelation function of the string. We show also that the weight of the convex combination is approximately λ(A). We describe the behavior of this autocorrelation function. Our results hold when the rate of mixing decays polinomially fast with power larger than the golden number." .

Such constraints can be natural, originating from spontaneous formulation of the problem, or artificial, expressing some program motion in control theory. On the basis of corresponding Lagrange’s equations, a general law of the change in energy dɛ/dt was formulated for such systems by the help of which it has been shown that here there exist two types of laws of conservation of energy, depending on the structure of work of these reaction forces. Also, the condition for existence of this second type of the law of conservation of energy has been formulated in the form of the system of differential equations. The results obtained are illustrated by a number of examples, with natural nonlinear constraints, as well as with artificial ones that express some program motion." .

It uses the thermodynamic of irreversible processes formalism and the phenomenological aspects of isotropic damage. It gives the damage rate as a function of its associated variable, the strain energy density release rate and the accumulated plastic strain rate. Associated with different plastic constitutive equations, this damage law takes into account brittle damage, ductile damage, low and high cycle fatigue and creep damage. In this paper we mainly focus on creep-fatigue interaction and high cycle fatigue. Associated to a viscoplastic constitutive equation having kinematic hardening, the damage law gives the non linear creep-fatigue interaction. The agreement with experiments is good. Associated to plastic constitutive equations also having kinematic hardening but introduced in a micromechanical two scale model based on the self-consistent scheme, it models the non linear accumulation of damage induced by a succession of sequences of different amplitudes as well as the effect of the mean stress and the influence of non proportional loading." .

At first, multiplications of the latter laws by proper physical fields are introduced, together with identical expansions. We then point out that the results of these mathematical manipulations, while being of the form of the general differential balance law again, are characterized by a possible lack of integrability with respect to volume production terms in the presence of a singular surface, the production terms being necessary for consistency. Lack of integrability is not to be expected when the general law is specified to the fundamental laws of balance of mass, momentum, total energy and entropy. When it must be supposed that integrability could be missing, however, the integral form of the general law of balance cannot be written down for a region containing a singular surface, and the so-called pillbox procedure fails for deriving the general relation of jump at the singular surface. The specific relations of balance and jump then have to be derived from proper relations that follow from consistent mathematical manipulations of the general differential law of balance and the general law of jump. In the present paper, these general relations are listed explicitly for balance of scalar and vectorial entities, multiplied and expanded by scalar, vector or tensor fields, respectively. Based on this rationale, various important formulations on configurational forces known from the literature on the mechanics in material space are recalled: The specific relation of balance of pseudomomentum, the configurational forces and the driving force at an interface are derived from the above general relations by involving the fundamental laws of balance and jump of linear momentum. The driving traction at an interface is then set into connection with the derived relations of balance and jump of kinetic, internal and free energy, respectively. The latter relations follow from the general relations by involving the fundamental laws of balance of linear momentum, total energy and entropy. As a result, we present relations between the driving traction at an interface and the surface production terms that appear in the various relations of jump, which should allow new interpretations of configurational formulations." .

It is found that most of the decays are favourable for experimental measurements (i.e., $T_{1/2}<10^{30}$ s) and this observation will serve as a guide to future experiments. Our study reveals the role of doubly magic 208Pb daughter nuclei and near doubly magic nuclei in the cluster decay process. In order to make a comparison with CPPM we also calculated the logarithmic half-lives using the Universal formula for the cluster decay (UNIV) by Poenaru et al., the Universal Decay Law (UDL) and the Scaling Law of Horoi et al., and they are found to be in good agreement.

This will streamline the working of the architecture by removing the need for correctives to either prevent misallocation or reassign cases that have been misallocated. Moreover, and just as importantly, the resolution of this problem will improve the application of the principle of subsidiarity in merger cases and bring to an end the multiple notification issue, thereby strengthening the operation of the one-stop shop approach. The changes to the architecture and how they interact to virtually end the misallocation problem and thereby bring about the aforementioned benefits are revealed. More specifically, it demonstrates how the use of the three or more Member state notification rule and the distinct market test, the retention of the existing two Community Dimension tests and the two-thirds rule, as well as the shared competence of the Competition Directorate and Member state regulators to apply EU merger law, albeit intentionally in different situations, reinforce each other to resolve the stated problem. Moreover, this limited sharing of the right to apply EU merger law—currently the EU Commission has the exclusive right—allied with other forms of envisaged cooperation between the regulators is not just simply a reinterpretation of the Commission’s most appropriate authority goal but also the possible beginnings of a more cooperative architecture, relative to the current architecture of separate jurisdictional zones, aimed at improving the efficacy and efficiency of merger control within the Union." .

The complex exhibits absorption maximum around 519 nm. Based on this complexation reaction, a rapid, sensitive and selective Spectrophotometric method is developed for the determination of osmium. The Beer's law is valid over the concentration range 0.25–7.5 ppm for osmium(VIII) and 0.25–8.0 ppm for osmium(VI). The molar absorptivities are 2.4×104 1 mol−1 cm−1 and 1.8×104 1 mol−1 cm−1 for osmium (VIII) and osmium(VI), respectively. The effects on the reaction of experimental conditions, such as time, temperature, acidity, order of addition of reactants, reagent concentration, and diverse ions, are reported. The sensitivity of the proposed method, as evaluated from the Beer's law data, was 7.0 ng cm−2 for osmium (VIII) or 9.2 ng cm−2 for osmium(VI). The analyses of sample solutions containing 2.0 ppm of osmium (VIII) and 3.0 ppm of osmium(VI) showed that the recovered amounts of the analytes had relative standard deviations of 0.0018 and 0.0022 ppm, respectively, for ten replicate determinations.

Much of this reform was in direct response to the weaknesses revealed in the pre-crisis system. The new “macroprudential” approach to financial regulations focuses on risks arising in financial markets broadly as well as the potential impact on the financial system that may arise from financial distress at systemically important financial institutions. Systemic risk is the key factor in financial stability, but our current understanding of systemic risk is rather limited. While the goal of using regulation to maintain financial stability is clear, it is not obvious how to design an effective regulatory framework that achieves the financial stability objective while also promoting financial innovations. This article discusses academic research and expert opinions on this vital subject of financial stability and regulatory reforms. Specifically, among other issues, it discusses the impact of increasing public disclosure of supervisory information, effectiveness of bank stress testing as a tool to enhance financial stability, whether the financial crisis was caused by TBTF, and whether the DFA resolution regime would be effective in achieving financial stability and ending TBTF." .

It is shown that conversion from a mechanical block model of a medium, which has finite block dimensions, to an idealized model consisting of blocks of zero dimensions (a plane with a thickness equal to zero), occurs with retention of the directions of simple shears and simple elongations, or the directions of the slip planes (a slip plane is a plane, along the normal to which simple elongation occurs; two simple shears occur in two mutually orthogonal directions falling in the plane). Symmetry of simple shears does not follow from the symmetry of the strain tensor. The components of the vector {ie306-1} are referenced from states of pure shear. Dynamic manifestations of the model under consideration for a medium will be discussed in the next part of the study." .

Corporate activity creates a large number of victims and yet this area is neglected in the literature. Evidence indicates that business kills, maims and poisons; that we are dealing with organizational deviance; but that iy is difficult, legally and organizationally, to pin down precisely the motives and behhaviour of managers in suchh cases. Significant corporate violence is rooted in a multiplicity of situational factors, the embeddness of socio-economic activity and post-hoc rationalizations. The paper highlights one specific strand in business deviance; how structure and culture shape the managerial mind and influence behaviour in ways that foster deviance and cause harm. A range of social-psychological processes are examined that open opportunities, and rationalizations, for rule-breaking. Corporations can create and environment that leads to risk-taking, and even recklessness, resulting in high casualties and severe harm. Companies then get away with ``murder'' because the law and the courts are not geared to organizational deviance and corporate violence. The organization causes the deviance and then forms the legal and institutional defence against facing up to the full consequences of the deaths, injuries and suffering among victims." .

I split the injury up into components of harm and wrong, and consider their rectification separately. First, I show that pecuniary compensation for the harm is practically plausible, because money acts as a mediator between the damaged interest and other interests. I then argue that this is also a morally plausible approach, because it does not claim too much for compensation: neither can all harms be compensated, nor can it be said when compensation is paid that the status quo ante has been restored. I argue that there is no conceptual reason for any particular agent paying this compensation. I then turn to the wrong, and reject three proposed methods of rectification. The first aims to rectify the wrong by rectifying the harm; the second deploys punitive damages; the third, punishment. After undermining each proposal, I argue that the wrong can only be rectified by a full apology, which I disaggregate into the admission of causal and moral responsibility, repudiation of the act, reform, and, in some cases, disgorgement and reparations, which I define as a good faith effort to share the burden of the victim’s harm. I argue, further, that only the injurer herself can make a full apology, and it is not something that can be coerced by other members of society. As such, whether rectification of the wrong can be a matter of corrective justice is left an open question." .

We propose a sufficiently simple multichain model of ordered β-sheets, composed of extended macromolecules with rigid elements. The effective constants of intra- and interchain interactions describe primary and secondary structures of proteins, respectively. It is found that the long-range correlation of orientations of chain elements decreases with the separation along the same chain or between different chains according to the same asymptotic power law. The exponent in this law is determined by the ratio of the energy of thermal motion and the geometric mean of the energies of intra- and interchain interactions. The characteristic scale parameters are obtained, which define the crossover of the intra- and interchain correlation functions from the exponential law of decrease to the power one. The power law for intrachain correlations leads to a non-Gaussian behavior of the mean-square dimensions of chains. Several types of asymptotic dependences of mean-square dimensions of a chain in the β-sheet on the number of chain elements are found. Peptide chains may exist in different conformations: from extended ones to random Gaussian coils. Long-scale statistical properties of polymer systems with interchain interactions and those for polymer chains with excluded volume effects are compared." .

Strengthening patent protection decreases the amount of common knowledge, which has two asymmetric effects on incentives to innovate. First, as competitors cannot freely use technological information, it helps successful innovators earn higher profits. Second, less disclosure of information reduces R&D productivity. The model shows that the relative importance of patents versus trade secrets determines whether the former positive effect dominates the latter negative effect. As a result, strengthened patent protection can increase economic growth when the risk of leakage of trade secrets is high. Conversely, when the risk is low, stronger patent protection hinders growth. Similar opposing results are also found in welfare analysis." .

This essay argues that neither setting prominent and principled priorities nor a case-by-case approach are likely to be defensible as general solutions. The main reasons concern how best to realize all human rights for all. Conflicts among human rights are more defensibly addressed (1) by checking whether the conflict has been correctly diagnosed: Do human rights as a whole get due priority? Have feasibility considerations inherent in human rights been considered, and the possibility of bringing in additional dutybearers? (2) If a conflict among human rights is genuine, formal principles for priority setting are of some help. Sometimes, it is clear that these should be “upgraded” to substantive principles and sometimes that they should not. Many cases, however, are as yet unclear and will need further investigation." .

While the United States Supreme Court has not yet involved itself in adjudicating issues of sexual favoritism, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, however, has issued guidelines. The California Supreme Court recently addressed the “sexual favoritism as sexual harassment/discrimination” issue and, absent better guidance from the federal courts, the California decision provides interesting insights for the legal and business communities. This article explores key issues involving workplace romances, sexual favoritism, and Title VII’s prohibition of sexual harassment as an illegal form of discrimination based on sex. We use the recent California Supreme Court decision in Miller to illustrate the legal and managerial challenges facing policy makers and management practitioners. We conclude with a discussion of policy alternatives for creating a discrimination- and harassment-free workplace while effectively managing workplace romances and instances of sexual favoritism." .

The morally charged nature of this controversy is reflected in the disparate results reported by various researchers who analyze the effects of these laws, and also by the especially intense methodological scrutiny that follows published research. A National Science Academy review of existing gun policy research issues methodological recommendations which may help resolve scientifically the question of whether or how “right to carry” licensing effects rates of lethal firearm violence. Similar efforts have been published previously, but this study improves upon those earlier efforts by increasing the sample cross-section, by further refining the model specification, and by distinguishing conceptually “shall issue” RTC laws from “may issue” RTC laws.

Juvenile courts represent one stakeholder group whose values can affect the delivery of services to young offenders with or at risk of emotional disturbances. This research uses statewide data from Tennessee to assess the mental health orientation (MHO) of juvenile courts, their use of treatment options for offenders, and whether MHO influences the treatment referral decision. Results show that courts have a positive MHO, but this subjective orientation does not correspond to higher treatment referral rates. Moreover, service referrals are at a considerably lower rate than estimates of need for this population of youth would predict. While positive MHO suggests a basis for nurturing the shared vision required for effective systems of care, other factors must be considered to account for courts' underutilization of treatment options for juvenile offenders." .

Forecasting failure events is one of the most important problems in fracture mechanics and related sciences. In this paper, we use the Molchan scheme to investigate the error diagrams in a fracture model which has the notable advantage of displaying two completely different regimes according to the heterogeneity of the system. In one regime, a characteristic event is observed while for the second regime a power-law spectrum of avalanches is obtained reminiscent of self-organized criticality. We find that both regimes are different when predicting large avalanches and that, in the second regime, there are non-trivial temporal correlations associated to clustering of large events. Finally, we extend the discussion to seismology, where both kinds of avalanche size distributions can be seen." .

The null hypothesis stated was: Both systems do not differ with respect to marginal and internal accuracy. Materials and methodsIn 14 patients, 13 molars and 1 premolar were prepared. Each preparation was scanned intraorally with two different digital impression systems, Lava COS and Cerec AC. On the basis of these data, Lava DVS crowns [DVS] and Vita Rapid Layering Technique crowns [RLT] were fabricated, respectively. Both systems contained of a zirconia framework and a digitally fabricated silicate ceramic veneering. The marginal and internal fit of the crowns was documented by a replica technique. The replicas were examined under microscope with a magnification of ×200. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied in order to test if the values of the two systems showed significant differences at p ≤ 0.05. ResultsThe results were as follows in micrometers (±standard deviation): at the marginal gap, 51 (±38) for [DVS] and 83 (±51) for [RLT]; mid-axial, 130 (±56) for [DVS] and 128 (±66) for [RLT]; axio-occlusal, 178 (±55) for [DVS] and 230 (±71) for [RLT]; and centro-occlusal, 181 (±41) for [DVS] and 297 (±76) for [RLT]. According to the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the results differed significantly at the marginal, axio-occlusal, and centro-occlusal gaps. ConclusionsThe null hypothesis had to be rejected. Clinical relevanceThe exclusively digital workflow on the basis of intraoral digital impressions delivered clinically satisfying results for single crowns with both systems." .

In order to discuss this question, this paper invokes the challenge-visée of a plausible reinvention of Law’s autonomous project (a reinvention which may be capable of critically re-thinking and re-experiencing Law’s constitutive cultural-civilizational originarium in a «limit-situation» such as our own). The discussion is developed by recognising that the claim to universality is not only incompatible with a substantive conception of juridicalness as validity but also sustained with difficulty by a procedural representation of discourse and rationality (a representation which, against its own conclusion-claims, could also be said to be culturally and civilizationally bounded). Not forgetting some specific features of contemporary juridical pluralism—namely that which emerges from the counterpoint between semiotic groups or interpretative communities (and their differently assumed claims of intersemioticity concerning the signifier law)—this train of reflection diagnoses briefly a sequence of complementary main difficulties (as «obstacles» to recognising Law’s demand as an unmistakable cultural project), namely those arising from the formalistic normativistic inheritance (confounding legal autonomy with isolationism), from the challenges and seductions of practical holism (justifying a continuum in which Law’s project loses its sense and autonomy), and also from the familiar debate between exclusive and inclusive versions of positivism and non-positivism (a debate which establishes-consecrates an equivocal counterpoint between Law and Morality)." .

The woman question requires a judicial or quasi-judicial body to always put woman at the centre of any decision with a view to addressing the historically disadvantaged position of women in society. Asking the African woman question means examining how the peculiar experiences of African women have been ignored by laws rooted in patriarchy across the region. Although the Commission has handled few cases directly dealing with women’s rights, the paper suggests that the Commission can draw inspiration from decisions of other regional and international human rights bodies such as the European Court on Human Rights and the Committee on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) on how to ask the woman question. The paper recommends that in line with feminist reasoning, there is a need for the African Commission to develop a consistent gender-sensitive approach in dealing with cases that may have implications for women. In essence, the African Commission must ask the African woman question when dealing with cases on the enjoyment of women’s fundamental rights." .

A lack of clarity, however, in treating measurement uncertainties and in setting specification limits for compliance may sometimes lead to drastic consequences. Examples concerning conformity assessment, particularly in the measurement of trace quantities (Cd in plastics and antibiotic trace residues in shrimps), are amongst cases identified in the ongoing EU project MetroTrade, which can be significant impediments to international trade. This paper considers the present status of the role of measurement uncertainty in conformity testing, covering both recent work in international standardisation and physical metrology (e.g. OIML recommendations on weighing). One conclusion is that, while much has been achieved, there still exists some work to be done in order to facilitate acceptance of conformity from both customer and supplier and avoid perceived barriers to trade and serious international trade disputes." .

The extended model is evaluated against the standard power-law using two measures, the Deviance Information Criterion and Bayes factor. The extended model captures deviations in the data from the standard power-law but reduces to the standard power-law when that model is adequate. The standard power-law is inadequate for 26% of the rivers while the extended model provides an adequate fit in all of those cases and for the remaining 74% of the rivers the extended model and the power-law model both give adequate fit with almost identical estimates." .

The bolus frequently extended into the mouth, trachea, and bronchial tree or esophagus. In all cases small amounts of aspirated material were observed in the deeper parts of the bronchial tree. The most commonly observed bolus was not masticated meat or a meat product. In adults and the elderly the bolus was often too large to pass the physiological narrowings of the hypopharynx. It was commonly lodged above the arytenoid cartilages. Forty-five of the bolus events were observed by bystanders. In 43 of the victims vital reactions were observed by bystanders or at the autopsy.

A review of the reported court opinions indicates that plaintiff employees often encounter difficulty in these cases. Some plaintiffs are unable to prove that they are “qualified” employees at the time of the adverse employment action, and other plaintiffs find it difficult to prove that a determinative factor in the adverse employment action was the disability of the associate or relative. However, plaintiffs have achieved some success as evidenced in the 2008 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals holdings in Dewitt v. Proctor Hospital and Trujillo v. PacifiCorp. This paper describes reported U. S.

We study simultaneous price drops of real stocks and show that for high drop thresholds they follow a power-law distribution.

By addressing the question of exactly when a prohibited retaliatory action has been taken against an employee, the United States Supreme Court’s June 2006 decision in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Sheila White ended a significant disagreement among the various appellate courts on the issue. The Supreme Court answered two specific questions regarding retaliation for raising a claim of sexual discrimination. First, the Court decided that the retaliatory conduct need not take place within the employment setting; and, second, it held that a materially adverse action requires only that a reasonable employee would be deterred from making, filing, or supporting a claim of workplace discrimination to the EEOC, the courts, or the employer.

MethodsA systematic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1996–2007) was performed as well as a national surgeon survey by questionnaire (May–December 2006). ResultsLaparoscopic entry criteria involving 10 steps were established based on the systematic literature search and evidence-based critical appraisal. The national survey had 226 respondents, with the majority aware of the Middlesbrough consensus or Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG]-sourced guidance. There was considerable variation in preferred laparoscopic entry techniques. Currently, there is clear judicial guidance on the medicolegal stance toward laparoscopic entry-related complications. ConclusionsDespite widespread awareness of laparoscopic entry guidelines, there remains considerable variation in the techniques adopted in clinical practice. Unless practice concurs with recommended guidance, women undergoing laparoscopy will be exposed to increased unnecessary operative risk. Laparoscopic entry-related injury in an uncomplicated woman is considered negligent practice according to UK legal case law." .

Let Σ be a fixed alphabet and let p,n be integers such that $p\\leq \\frac{n}{2}$ . A length-n string over Σ, α=(α 1,…,α n ), has the property Period(p) if for every i,j∈{1,…,n}, α i =α j whenever i≡j (mod p). For an integer parameter $g\\leq \\frac{n}{2},$ the property Period(≤g) is the property of all strings that are in Period(p) for some p≤g. The property $\\mathit{Period}(\\leq \\frac{n}{2})$ is also called Periodicity. An ε-test for a property P of length-n strings is a randomized algorithm that for an input α distinguishes between the case that α is in P and the case where one needs to change at least an ε-fraction of the letters of α to get a string in P. The query complexity of the ε-test is the number of letter queries it makes for the worst case input string of length n. We study the query complexity of ε-tests for Period(≤g) as a function of the parameter g, when g varies from 1 to $\\frac{n}{2}$ , while ignoring the exact dependence on the proximity parameter ε. We show that there exists an exponential phase transition in the query complexity around g=log n. That is, for every δ>0 and g≥(log n)1+δ , every two-sided error, adaptive ε-test for Period(≤g) has a query complexity that is polynomial in g. On the other hand, for $g\\leq \\frac{\\log{n}}{6}$ , there exists a one-sided error, non-adaptive ε-test for Period(≤g), whose query complexity is poly-logarithmic in g. We also prove that the asymptotic query complexity of one-sided error non-adaptive ε-tests for Periodicity is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n\\log n}\\,)$ , ignoring the dependence on ε." .

The modern corporation is characterized by the conflict that ensues when ownership and control are independent. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), in theory, serve to realign these disparate interests between the owners and managers of the firm. This article will explore the mechanisms by which ESOPs serve to empower those who possess ownership rights in the corporation. The application of trusteeship theory serves to explain the agency problem that may arise when managers serve as both trustee and beneficiary. Workplace, ownership, and corporate rights are integrated into a stakeholder perspective of rights conflicts." .

This prerequisite can be met only by ensuring that legal measurements are accurate and traceable to national or international standards. Consequently, an outline of the organizational structure of the Romanian National Institute of Metrology (INM) for ensuring uniformity, consistency and accuracy of all measurements including legal measurements performed in chemical laboratories is presented. Since reliable measurements can only be accomplished within an appropriate traceability chain, the experience of the INM in identification and evaluation of measurement uncertainty in legal activities concerning the environment and health is reviewed. Practical examples of measurement uncertainty evaluation in spectrophotometric determination of five analytes, commonly determined in environmental and clinical chemistry are described. The implications of measurement uncertainty for interpretation of regulatory compliance are discussed." .

Nonexponential behaviour is obtained for very short and very long times. The uncertainty principle precludes observation of the short-time deviation from the exponential (as we demonstrate); this is the resolution of a proposed paradox. The long-time deviation becomes substantial only after an enormous number of lifetimes and is thus not observable in practice." .

For a Gaussian chain, this relation implies the Mooney–Rivlin constitutive law, while for non-Gaussian chains it results in novel constitutive equations. Based on a three-chain approximation, a formula is derived for the strain energy of a chain with excluded-volume interactions between segments. It is demonstrated that for self-avoiding chains with a stretched exponential distribution function of end-to-end vectors, the strain energy density of a network is described by the Ogden law with two material constants. For the des Cloizeaux distribution function, a constitutive equation is derived that involves three adjustable parameters. The governing equations are verified by fitting observations at uniaxial tension–compression and biaxial tension of elastomers. Good agreement is demonstrated between the experimental data and the results of numerical analysis." .

An experiment is described in which student Beer’s law data are treated in several ways to find out if transformation errors are significant. The conclusion is that if the absorbance values obtained for the calibration data exceed A=1, then nonlinear regression or weighted linear regression is indicated." .

In turn, this allows us to provide a notion of solution to the conservation law with a gradient constraint. The proof of existence is based on a time-stepping technique, and an L 1-contraction estimate follows from stability results of Karlsen and Risebro." .

These constitutive equations are combined, in a one dimensional shearing problem, with the second law of thermodynamics and condition of thermodynamic stability. The results are that a phase change occurs when the von Mises yield condition is reached because the material is also thermodynamically unstable. The second law of thermo-dynamics forces the deformations that occur to be nonhomogeneous on a small scale. Therefore the model is in agreement with experimental data. This type model therefore can be used to unify the continuum theories of plasticity with those with a more “physical” basis because deformations occur at two different scales." .

Three years later, the ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal rendered its award that declared China’s historic rights claim within the U-shaped line unlawful and that none of the Spratly Islands including Itu Aba (Taiping Island) are “islands” entitled to an EEZ. Although the ROC/Taiwan was not the Philippines’ intended party in the case, it was brought into the proceedings and became a de facto party. This paper will illustrate how Taiwan became relevant to the South China Sea arbitration and analyze possible legal and political implications for Taiwan. It is suggested that the Philippines-initiated arbitration may have more serious political implications for Taiwan’s future claim and position in the South China Sea dispute. In particular, Taiwan should carefully manage the One-China/South China Sea/cross-straits policy triangle after the South China Sea arbitration." .

This crucial assignment leads the EURL for Chemical Elements in Food of Animal Origin (EURL-CEFAO) to plan PTs that include various chemical element/matrix/concentration combinations in order to organize a profitable exercise for its network. The purpose of this paper was to describe the “step-by-step” preparation of a PT material and the efforts of an EURL to provide proper test items to national laboratories (NRLs). The exercise was tailored to train participants and give them the opportunity to practice around the maximum levels (MLs) set in EU legislation, values at which sample acceptance is the critical issue. The EURL strategy has been chosen considering the role of the NRLs that could be summoned as third party in legal controversies. A PT on the determination of cadmium and lead in freeze-dried liver was then scheduled. The goal was to achieve a sample with a mass fraction (w) of the elements around the ML (0.50 mg/kg for both). Preliminary studies allowed the EURL to calculate the amount of spike to reach the target mass fractions. The target Cd and Pb mass fractions were in good agreement with the contents found in the frame of the homogeneity test as well as with the consensus values derived from the results reported by the PT participants. This proved the suitability of the production procedures and the quality of the delivered PT test items." .

The concept of the histione, an elementary unit of multicellularity, is introduced. The concepts, rules, and symbols required for description of divisions of functions in this unit are proposed. For quantitative characteristics of such division, sensible and experimentally determined parameters are used. Based on this, it is shown that the development of communities follows the periodic law. Classification of communities looks like a periodic table. This table takes into account two developmental types (progressive and deviant) and reflects the main developmental laws, cyclicity, directedness, and parallelisms. In addition, the table enables prediction of the composition and structure of communities in future development and estimation of the last." .

The crack faces are open under tension and closed under compression. When the crack faces are closed, they may slide against one another following Coulomb’s law of dry friction. The micromechanics models provide analytical expressions of the tensile and compressive moduli for both static and dynamic cases. It is found that the tensile and compressive moduli are different. Further, under dynamic loading, both compressive and tensile moduli are frequency dependent. As a by-product, the micromechanics models also predict wave attenuation in the dynamic case. Numerical simulations using the finite element method are conducted to validate the micromechanics models." .

Far from being a mere codification of the regime on established and non-established services and service providers developed by the Court, it brings some important changes to the law in this area. Most apparently, the central Article 16 Services Directive curtails the reasons of justifications Member States may invoke to defend national measures. It is argued that the Services Directive should not be read to introduce to the services regime the equivalent of the distinction between selling arrangements and products requirements known from the free movement of goods. Rather, for the first time, some national measures seem to be expressly excluded from the scope of the freedoms. The legality of the Services Directive has been discussed controversially, mainly on account of Article 16. It is submitted that it is the Directive’s compliance with its legal basis of Article 47 EC which is decisive and that such conformity is doubtful. The Directive does not function in the same way as other harmonization measures since it fails to provide the substance required to deprive Member States of the possibility to justify their national laws. The Services Directive regulates in an area of law where the jurisprudence of the Court continues to be inconsistent. This is the case with the regime on mandatory requirements and derogations for the justification of restrictions and discriminations. It is shown that especially Article 16 Services Directive provides the Court with an option to either consolidate the case law or introduce further fragmentation. It is unclear whether the Services Directive is the complete regulation on indirect discriminations within its scope of application or whether the Treaty regime will apply beside of it. In the first case, the regulation of indirect discrimination would be disconnected from restrictions concerning available reasons of justifications. In the second case, the Directive would cause huge fragmentation regarding the treatment of national law. This and all other ambiguities in the Services Directive will be for the Court to resolve. Thus, codification in this case will probably not greatly diminish the role of the judiciary." .

The issues overlap with issues others experienced when trying to conduct randomized experiments in clinical practice, but are complicated because MST takes place in a legal context. The complex juvenile justice system makes it difficult to come up with a simple system of randomization. Problems encountered are the complexity of the referral process in this type of intervention, legal issues and the ethical concerns raised by clinicians. Our experiences might be useful to others planning to carry out a randomized efficacy study within the juvenile justice system. Firstly, other researchers might feel supported if they realize that others experience similar problems, and, secondly, we provide some concrete suggestions concerning the following: selecting the procedures and determining the moment of randomization, dealing with and overcoming the resistance of institutions involved, maintaining the cooperation of both the institution and the sample, and keeping turnover of research staff to a minimum." .

Thermomechanical properties of the circular plate are distributed across the thickness based on a power law function. The governing equations of the plate are obtained by means of the classical plate theory. A conventional Winkler-type foundation is assumed to be in contact with the plate which acts in compression as well as in tension. Proper boundary conditions are chosen after pre-buckling analysis of the plate, and stability equations are established via the adjacent equilibrium criterion. To analyze the thermal stability problem, the plate is divided into two sections, a foundation-less domain and an in-contact region. An exact procedure is presented to accurately predict the critical buckling temperature as well as the buckled configuration of the plate. Analysis of various involved parameters including the Winkler parameter, foundation radius, power law index, and loading type is presented. It is concluded that while the loading is symmetric, in many cases, the buckled configuration of the plate is asymmetric." .

Such projects raise a number of ethical, legal, and social (ELS) issues that should be considered. In this study, we set out to discover how these issues are being handled across different jurisdictions. MethodsWe examined informed consent (IC) forms from 30 cancer genome sequencing studies to assess (1) stated purpose of sample collection, (2) scope of consent requested, (3) data sharing protocols (4) privacy protection measures, (5) described risks of participation, (6) subject re-contacting, and (7) protocol for withdrawal. ResultsThere is a high degree of similarity in how cancer researchers engaged in WGS are protecting participant privacy. We observed a strong trend towards both using samples for additional, unspecified research and sharing data with other investigators. IC forms were varied in terms of how they discussed re-contacting participants, returning results and facilitating participant withdrawal. Contrary to expectation, there were no consistent trends that emerged over the eight year period from which forms were collected. ConclusionExamining IC forms from WGS studies elucidates how investigators are handling ELS challenges posed by this research. This information is important for ensuring that while the public benefits of research are maximized, the rights of participants are also being appropriately respected." .

Forty to 51% of women experience some type of violence in their lifetime including child abuse, physical violence, rape and domestic violence. The perpetrator is most likely to be a current or former partner. Such violence stems from historical views of women as property and may flourish because of the public’s reluctance to get involved in family matters. The concept of violence has been expanded to include non-traditional types such as sexual harassment, breeches of fiduciary trust and stalking. Treatment of victims of violence must include ensuring their safety, encouraging them to make healthy choices and helping them to understand they are not at fault. Education at all levels is required to change attitudes which perpetuate violence despite laws which forbid it." .

As the paper further elaborates, Capote’s work paved new ways for challenging the conventional boundaries between “reality” and “fiction” with regard to the representation of law-related events. The paper will also maintain that in addition to its contribution to the law and literature discourse, In Cold Blood can be also seen as an early prototype to the digital legal spectacles that are now common. Revisiting In Cold Blood reveals not only its standing as originating model of many present-day cultural representations of the legal system in action, but also the essential difference between the almost unrestrainedly produced digital law-related content, to a artistic enterprise, characterized by poetic distinctiveness." .

It has been a profitable source of study for academics in several disciplines, and practitioners from both sides of the labor bar have contributed generously to the literature. For persons doing current work in the field, this vast accumulation of research and analysis provides an invaluable point of departure. Unfortunately, these materials are often somewhat difficult to find. Combing the traditional indices of legal and periodic literature is a time-consuming task, and a specialized bibliography has heretofore been lacking. Hopefully, this will supply the need. Notwithstanding my best efforts at thoroughness in compiling this bibliography, I will admit that I use the term “comprehensive” with great trepidation, for it is in the nature of things that persons who make such claims are soon taught their folly. Given the scope and popularity of the topic, it is inevitable that I overlooked some worthy books and articles. The bibliography is divided into broad and sometimes overlapping categories, and where a book or article was placed was often a close decision. Within each category, the materials are listed in chronological order." .

Despite of these differences, judges in both legal traditions in adjudicating cases have a common task, which is the application of legal rules to the facts of cases pending for judgments. The tension between the certainty and the “discretion” is universal for any legal system and, to a certain extent, it poses a hard dilemma for the rhetoric of rule of law. In the transitional countries such as China where rapid social changes and transformations take place, the judiciary and judges can not escape from taking more active roles in interpreting or even law making process. It arouses much controversy, particularly in continental legal traditions, for the judiciary is deemed to perform a mechanical role in adjudicating cases. This article intends to analyze the needs for judicial law-making function in China and its reasons. It reveals that judicial interpretation constitutes an important source of law despite its ambiguous legislative position. The article argues that judicial activism is inevitable against the transitional nature of current Chinese society." .

This paper explores some features of commands that tend to remain largely invisible in social action, as well as largely under-theorized in the scholarly literature. The analysis draws on early reflection by Elias Canetti and tries to clarify the dynamics of the relationship between law and commands from a sociological perspective. The main claim is that command cannot be reduced to a linguistic entity, but has to be considered in the more complex frame of a direct relationship among subjects and their bodies within a shared space. Explanation of commands is made even more difficult by the fact that they take place in a space that is located ambiguously in between the realm of the subjective and that of the objective, in between passions and institutions." .

MethodsWe selected forensic pediatric autopsies at the Netherlands Forensic Institute, whereby the subject underwent PMCT between 1-1-2008 and 31-12-2012. Cause of death was independently scored by a radiologist and a pathologist. Cause of death was classified (1) in categories being natural, unnatural, and unknown; (2) according to the ICD-10; and (3) according to institutional classification. ResultsIn the study period, 189 pediatric forensic autopsies were performed. Fifteen were excluded because of putrefaction. Of the remaining 174 autopsies, 98 (56 %) underwent PMCT. PMCT and autopsy identified the same category in 69/98 cases (70 %, kappa 0.49). They identified the same cause of death in 66/98 cases (67 %, kappa 0.5) using ICD-10; in 71/98 (72 %, kappa 0.62) using a forensic classification. PMCT performed better in unnatural deaths (59–67 % agreement) than in natural deaths (0 % agreement). If no cause of death was detected with autopsy, PMCT failed to identify a cause of death in 98 % (39/40). ConclusionsPediatric PMCT does identify the majority of unnatural causes of death, but does not identify new diagnoses (true positives) if no cause of death is found during autopsy. Diagnostic accuracy in natural deaths is low. Key points• The case mix is an important predictor for the concordance between PMCT and autopsy.• In case of an unnatural death, 72–-81 % of PMCT results matches autopsy results.• In case of a natural death, 0 % of PMCT results matches autopsy results.• If no cause of death is identified with autopsy, 98 % of PMCT results concurs." .

Above all, the International Criminal Court started recently the hearings in its very first case. Reading the document containing the charges against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a militia leader accused of horrendous war crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the question of why to punish perpetrators of atrocity crimes seems almost ludicrous. However, concerns that international prosecutions inadvertently prolong or even exacerbate conflicts do require a response. Most proponents of international criminal tribunals argue that prosecutions have a deterrent effect. This article reviews the deterrence argument, highlights its inherent complexities, and proposes a refined approach to meet both the realities of atrocity crimes and international prosecutions." .

The four main results are, first, a higher seizure rate does not always decrease imitation rate in the South. Second, a higher seizure rate does not always encourage innovation in the North. Third, although a sufficiently high seizure rate is required to enhance economic growth, such a policy reform would deteriorates welfare in both the North and South. Finally, unlike seizure, prohibiting imports of illegal imitations from the South always lowers illegal imitation." .

Although the value of video registration is recognized, medicolegal concerns regarding the privacy of patients and professionals are growing. A clear understanding of the legal framework is lacking. Therefore, this research aims to provide insight into the juridical position of patients and professionals regarding video recording in health care practice. MethodsJurisprudence was searched to exemplify legislation on video recording in health care. In addition, legislation was translated for different applications of video in health care found in the literature. ResultsThree principles in Western law are relevant for video recording in health care practice: (1) regulations on privacy regarding personal data, which apply to the gathering and processing of video data in health care settings; (2) the patient record, in which video data can be stored; and (3) professional secrecy, which protects the privacy of patients including video data. Practical implementation of these principles in video recording in health care does not exist. ConclusionPractical regulations on video recording in health care for different specifically defined purposes are needed. Innovations in video capture technology that enable video data to be made anonymous automatically can contribute to protection for the privacy of all the people involved." .

The SCSL and the ECC have often been referred to as “mixed” or “hybrid” tribunals in which there are significant domestic and international components. The tribunals include a combination of domestic and international judges, utilize domestic and international laws and are administered by a prosecutorial team composed of domestic and international lawyers. Many of these institutional changes have been brought about because of criticisms of the ICTY and the ICTR. The fundamental question of this article is whether these mixed tribunals are a more effective mechanism for providing justice and reconciliation than purely international solutions. This is an important question because both the international community and states are moving in the direction of mixed tribunals." .

This paper investigates how the threat of a pollution tax fosters voluntary arrangements under private information and how such arrangements (of the take-it-or-leave-it type) will look like. The objective is (i), to address a topical and policy relevant problem, and (ii), to highlight that the optimal contracts exhibit substantial variations, degrees of complexity and uncommon features. If the pollutee offers an arrangement (and this is the more likely and also more interesting case) the spectrum of solutions covers six different cases: 'no distortion at the top', 'no distortion at the bottom', 'no distortion in the interior' and a boundary solution (a pseudo contract of duplicating the tax outcome) applicable either in all instances of the agent's benefit or coupled with one of the conventional mechanisms. If the polluter offers a contract, the optimal incentive scheme is countervailing with the consequence that the signs of the payments are reversed, that the property of no distortion holds at both ends and that the polluter's best strategy is to duplicate the tax outcome if the actual damage is around the expected value. The government's threat encourages contracting and improves the allocation beyond what an actual intervention could achieve. This provides a potential role for governments in an otherwise Coasean framework." .

Many watermarking techniques have been proposed for digital video and digital broadcast video. In general, they address the seller's or broadcaster's concerns, such as copyright-violation deterrence, copyright-violation detection and copy protection. Some of them provide for data integrity (tamper proofing), which is a shared concern of both subscriber and broadcaster. In all these cases, the watermark generation and embedding is performed or controlled by the seller or broadcaster. Therefore, a broadcaster with malicious intentions could, with manipulation, falsely implicate an innocent subscriber in copyright violation. This could be a major concern for subscribers. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution to manage the broadcaster's copyright and subscriber's false-implication concern (subscriber's rights) for digital video broadcasts. The proposed novel approach makes use of interactive watermarking techniques and protocols to help protect digital rights of all parties involved in video broadcasting." .

Findings suggest that housing people with complex behavioral health issues reduces the likelihood of further criminal justice involvement." .

It has resulted in the need to reduce allocations in some local communities, and to date government policy has relied on economic instruments to take the lead in developing equitable processes to do this. A series of community-based justice studies were undertaken and demonstrated that it is possible to derive a package of actions, which reflect the fairness judgments of the vast majority of the community. However, the implementation of these actions within the decision-making process has proven to be a more complex matter. This paper discusses four professional, methodological, and ethical challenges for all justice researchers. It concludes by noting the applicability of this form of research in other natural resource allocation dilemmas. Therefore it is imperative that justice researchers confidently insert themselves in to environmental policy debates. Only in this way will the social criteria for “triple bottom line” accounting for sustainable development be adequately represented." .

In particular, Monte Carlo modelling of electron beam lithography is considered and the backscattering coefficient η addressed, in case of a general substrate layer, in the elastic regime and in the energy range 5 to 100 keV. The many variables involved (electron energy, substrate physical constants and thickness) are demonstrated to ultimately enter in determining η through asingle dimensionless parameter Π0. Thus, a scaling law is determined, an important guide in microsystem designing, indicating, if any part of the configuration is modified, how the other parameters should change (or “scale”) without affecting the result. Finally, a simple law η=83 Π0 is shown to account for all variations of the parameters over all substrates of the periodic table." .

For the case of revenue maximizing governments, we show that introducing profit shifting will not generally increase downward pressure on tax rates. We find that profit shifting decreases the tax-base sensitivity of the low tax jurisdiction while increasing the sensitivity of the high tax jurisdiction. Tax rates will converge as a result of additional profit shifting opportunities. This will be the case even though in general equilibrium tax rates in both jurisdictions may decrease or increase." .

Analysis of behaviours of principal actors in the Bangladeshi corporate governance scenario, using new institutionalism as a theoretical foundation, then reveals that such adoption may be prompted by exposure to legitimacy threats rather than efficiency reasons." .

As the constant revival of the topos ‘living law’ shows, underlying common models of law, and of the legitimacy of law, is, though often implicitly, the view that law is or should be particular, near to the facts, flexible, susceptible to realities, and as a consequence accessible to modernisations. However, this article proposes an immanent critique of similar hopes or fears, and it argues that modern positive law can not be responsive to any other ‘order’ or context because it constitutes an order of its own. The article seeks to give an explanation of the specific character and forms of the juridical operating and to explain more specifically how decisions are produced. The article in this regard also investigates the importance and role of imagination, fiction and performativity. Underlining the fact that the juridical exceeds legal propositions by asserting itself as a distinct form of social communication, it calls for a shift from the representational to the performative analysis in the study of law." .

Theorists debate (among other things) the meaning of “rights,” the priority of rights, whether collective rights are universal, the foundations of rights, and whether there are universal human rights at all. These debates are of relatively greater interest to theorists; however, a given meaning of “human rights” implies a corresponding theory of change and through that can be an important guide to the practice of human rights activists and their funders. In practice, any organization can describe their work as “rights based.” This article clarifies the practices of human rights activists and their funders that are consistent with a theory of human rights as (1) universal, (2) interdependent across groups and categories of people, (3) indivisible across issue areas and claims, and (4) measured by the enjoyment of rights." .

A key concept of the LORE method is the introduction of irreducible loop integrals (ILIs) which are evaluated from the Feynman diagrams by adopting the Feynman parametrization and ultraviolet-divergence-preserving (UVDP) parametrization. It is then inevitable for the ILIs to encounter the divergences in the UVDP parameter space due to the generic overlapping divergences in the four-dimensional momentum space. By computing the so-called αβγ integrals arising from two-loop Feynman diagrams, we show how to deal with the divergences in the parameter space with the LORE method. By identifying the divergences in the UVDP parameter space to those in the subdiagrams, we arrive at the Bjorken–Drell analogy between Feynman diagrams and electrical circuits. The UVDP parameters are shown to correspond to the conductance or resistance in the electrical circuits, and the divergence in Feynman diagrams is ascribed to the infinite conductance or zero resistance. In particular, the sets of conditions required to eliminate the overlapping momentum integrals for obtaining the ILIs are found to be associated with the conservations of electric voltages, and the momentum conservations correspond to the conservations of electrical currents, which are known as the Kirchhoff laws in the electrical circuits analogy. As a practical application, we carry out a detailed calculation for one-loop and two-loop Feynman diagrams in the massive scalar ϕ 4 theory, which enables us to obtain the well-known logarithmic running of the coupling constant and the consistent power-law running of the scalar mass at two-loop level. Especially, we present an explicit demonstration on the general procedure of applying the LORE method to the multiloop calculations of Feynman diagrams when merging with the advantage of Bjorken–Drell’s circuit analogy." .

Proponents argued that the reform would improve screening and boost employment whereas opponents dubbed it the “Kleenex contract.” We show that the new contract can produce an incentive to dismiss even suitable workers but that this harmful effect could be mitigated by instituting public ratings of firms according to their propensity to dismiss young workers. Informed workers could then respond to job offers according to firms’ layoff records, which in turn would restore promotion incentives and efficient screening." .

Although (like many other students of employee rights) the authors did not conceptualize rights adequately, they advanced understanding of employee rights by linking the analysis of concrete rights to the larger social context. Further, by directing attention to the processes of social construction which affect the relationship betweende jure andde facto rights, the articles help to fill an important gap in the existing literature. Some implications for research on employee rights (and applied social science more generally) driven by social issues rather than theories are explored." .

The Constitutional Tribunal also makes reference to this in numerous rulings. Paradoxically, however, that concept is not very popular in legal theory. It might seem that Polish legal theoreticians and philosophers do not appreciate the concept of interpretation of a constitution devised through practice with the support of constitutional law doctrine. It might, however, mean that opinions on autonomous interpretation of Polish Constitution are nothing more than rhetorical arguments formulated ad hoc not a coherent concept or a theory. This text is an attempt to analyse this concept and its potential in discussions surrounding application of the Polish Constitution." .

The development of small towns is an important way to Chinese urbanisation. Land use plays a very important role in the development of small towns. However there are many problems in the development of small towns, esp. in land use. The paper first discusses the land problems in the development of small towns. Such as much cultivated land lies idle, under-utilization and waste of land, increasing illegal use of land, unstable contractual relationship for land use. The relationship between the development of small towns and land use is also studied. Then the guidelines for the land system innovations of small towns are put forward. Namely the sustainability of social and economic development, the balance between land reservation and land utilization, the provision of service to village, agriculture and farmer, the management of land resource and land assets, the parsimonious and legal use of land. The basic framework of land system innovations of small towns is put forward finally. It include the land replacement policy for small towns and the permanent tenancy of farmland, the overall plan for land uses and other plans in harmony, the establishment of a flexible system of land supplies, using land with payments, the transfer of agricultural land and refining the land law related to the construction of small towns." .

The Treaty of Nice and especially the conventional Treaty revision procedures were criticised heavily. The Laeken declaration of the European Council of December 2001 committed the EU to improve democracy, transparency and efficiency. A European Convention was established, presided over by former President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. It consisted of Members the European Parliament and of the Parliaments not only of the then 15 Member States but also from candidate countries (including Turkey) and representatives of the governments of these States. The Convention elaborated a Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which was the basis for the following Intergovernmental Conference, which agreed after difficult negotiations and some modifications of the draft on a text. There was an intensive debate on the Constitution of Europe, but more scholarly than in the public and even the national politicians. The European Union/Community had in fact and according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice just a \"Constitution\" by the existing Treaties. Supporters said that this Constitution had to be put on a new basis having in mind the deepening and widening of the European Union opponents said that the European Union being not a State is not ready to get a Constitution. The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed in Rome on 29 October 2004. To enter into force it needed to be ratified by all 27 Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The Treaty has been ratified by 17 Member States but was rejected by national referenda in France and the Netherlands in 2005. The term \"Constitution\", which had been thought to be an incentive for integration, obviously had the contrary effect. The special problem of a rejection by the people of two founding Member States led to a period of reflection. At the June 2007 summit of the European Council under German Presidency EU leaders agreed after harsh negotiations, especially the Polish veto against the double majority rule for Council decisions (55 % of Member States and 65% of the population of the European Union) which could be dispelled by a compromise regarding the entry into force of these rules, on a detailed mandate to finalise the text of a new Treaty to reform the institutions of the EU. The new \"Reform Treaty\" shall amend the existing Treaties, the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty, revised by the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice), which will keep its present name, and the Treaty Establishing the European Community (former European Economic Community), which will be called Treaty on the Functioning of the Union. The constitutional concept, which consisted in repealing all existing Treaties and replacing them by a single text called \"Constitution\", is abandoned. The \"Constitution\" label was discarded. All provisions, which could suggest that the European Union should become a \"State\" like the symbols (flag, anthem, motto) or the denominations \"laws\" and \"framework laws\" instead the existing denominations \"regulation\" and \"directive\", were not introduced into the Reform Treaty. The expressive provision of the Constitution on the supremacy of Union law over the law of the Member States will not be reproduced in the Reform Treaty but there will be a Declaration relying on the well-settled Costa/ENEL-jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. In substance, however, the Reform Treaty will introduce into the existing Treaties (with some modifications) the innovations resulting from the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference, which were as shown above the basis for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. Therefore (with the exception of the British government) supporters as well as opponents are right saying that the Reform Treaty is the Constitution by any other name. The United Kingdom reserved a (questionable) opt-out clause regarding the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is connected with the Treaty only by a cross-reference but with the same legal value. New elements are according to new challenges references on climate change and energy solidarity. The Intergovernmental Conference was opened on 23 July 2007. The Portuguese Presidency has presented a detailed Draft Treaty amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. The final agreement on the Reform Treaty has been reached at the European Council summit in Lisbon on 18/19 October 2009. The Treaty of Lisbon, as it is now named officially, was signed on 17 December 2007. The Treaty of Lisbon shall entry into force on 1 January 2009 if it has been ratified by all 27 Member States. But it remains uncertain whether this project will run or not. There have been early attempts to reach re-negotiations, which have been rejected. And it is uncertain if in some countries will be referenda, which are obligatory in Ireland and (under certain circumstances) in Denmark. Nevertheless: The history of European unification has always been a matter of uncertainty and surprise – and, up to now, in the end a story of success." .

Foreign practice reflects indigenous forms but faces criticisms similar to that in the USA: that it is ineffective, antidemocratic, and counterproductive. The essay meets these criticisms, first, by recasting US public law litigation as a form of politics that challenges the status quo by forging alliances, changing discursive frames, and disciplining private and public decision making. Looking abroad, the essay emphasizes public law litigation as a meditative institution that facilitates political action and aids in regulatory enforcement where administrative mechanisms are weak or regulation requires ongoing elaboration. Finally, the essay suggests that criticisms of public law litigation tend to neglect three factors: the actual and not assumed comparative advantages of different institutional actors, the role of temporal conditions in affecting social change, and the ubiquity of complex, not dichotomous, relations." .

The implementation of a new law for regulating the fuel sector had enforced the quality control of fuels sold to public. This resulted in several accredited fuel-testing laboratories to emerge. Thus, a scheme to evaluate their proficiency in measurements became an important requirement. The inter-laboratory comparison scheme LABKAR for gasoline, diesel oil, LPG, lubricating oil and biodiesel samples have evolved to fulfill this need. In this paper, LABKAR is introduced; the results obtained from the program are analyzed and discussed. The kernel densities of the participants’ results show that the use of robust mean as a consensus value is appropriate for fuel samples. Although the number of rounds is not enough to derive strict conclusions, it is seen that the performance of the scheme based on the standard deviations and coefficient of variations is improving in each round. It has been observed that the number of laboratories receiving “action” or “warning” is decreasing, which indicates that they are benefiting from the scheme." .

Euthanasia, defined as an intentional termination of life by somebody else at an individual's request, is done in 1.8% of deaths. Only 4% of Dutch physicians would never perform or refer for euthanasia, and over 50% have performed euthanasia. Around 25 000 Dutch patients per year bring up euthanasia as a possibility in case suffering becomes unbearable; around 10% will finally have euthanasia performed. On the basis of these opinions and data the Dutch legislation has recently been reformed. Euthanasia remains a crime and each case will be reviewed by the district attorney. Court decisions, however, have confirmed the view that in some cases of euthanasia the physician may be confronted with conflicting obligations and therefore will not be punished. As a consequence, cases fulfilling a number of requirements will not be prosecuted. In conclusion, MDEL including euthanasia are considered ethically justifiable and legally permissible if they are part of an open, honest and careful approach to patients with unbearable suffering, in particular in the case of cancer." .

The specific focus of ethical and legal frameworks on competent adults (which serve as the paradigmatic research subject), however, has created an ambivalent attitude towards pediatric clinical research. On one hand, minors are regarded as a vulnerable population that deserves additional protection against the risks and burdens involved in clinical research. On the other hand, the population of minors should not be denied (or not get timely) access to the benefits of clinical research. In this paper, we will explore the legal regulation and ethical guidance that currently governs pediatric clinical research in the European Union and discuss the future challenges in this field. In addition, we will discuss major ethical concerns in pediatric clinical research, with a focus on the acceptability of research risks and the informed consent process. In the discussion, we will address key concerns in both regulating pediatric clinical research and implementing ethical and legal requirement in the actual pediatric research conduct." .

The passage of HR 4011 effectively marked a new and notable phase within U.S. foreign policy, in which the issue of human rights was directly linked to the issue of North Korean nuclear non-proliferation in a Helsinki-style framework. Relating to the Act, this paper argues from cross-cultural, security, and legal perspectives that HR 4011 may encounter specific limitations, which may hinder the Act from reaching its stated objectives of furthering “respect for and protection of fundamental human rights in North Korea” and “to promote a more durable humanitarian solution to the plight of North Korean refugees.” Although improving human rights is a fundamentally important issue, linking human rights with DPRK nuclear non-proliferation through HR 4011’s explicit Helsinki-style approach may exacerbate rather than eradicate North Korean human rights violations as well as the DPRK’s ongoing nuclear standoff with the international community." .

We identify three distinct phases of that relationship, noting that in the most recent phase, since 9/11, the US has moved from passive support of the international human rights regime to a direct attack of that regime. Realist and liberal regime theories suggest that the human rights regime is relatively weak, and is unlikely to withstand such an attack. We find that the regime has not only continued to persist, but has flourished even as US support has faltered. The human rights regime is surprisingly strong. We argue it is the ideological nature of the regime that explains its resilience, which suggests that constructivist theory is necessary to fully understand the human rights regime." .

Relatively few ethnic minorities in Europe have been recognized as indigenous. A consequence of globalization is that knowledge of rights gained by indigenous groups in different parts of the world has led to explicit or implicit claims for indigenous status by organized groups within some European ethnic or regional minorities. An example from the Northern Isles of Scotland is the Shetland and Orkney Udal Law group (SOUL), which includes on its website links to legal decisions supporting indigenous rights in Canada and Australia. SOUL argues for greater local autonomy regarding the use of resources. The islands were inhabited by Norse settlers from Scandinavia from the 9th century AD and came under Scottish rule in the 1460s. Certain elements of Norse law related to land tenure, in particular foreshore rights, have survived to the present as a form of customary law referred to as udal law. Udal law has been the subject of court cases in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It has been presented as symbolizing Orkney and Shetland identity, and brought into public debates on matters of concern to Orcadians and Shetlanders. Udal law is invoked to support a claim for local control over the surrounding sea and seabed, important for fishing, salmon-farming and oil exploitation. These issues are examined in relation to definitions of indigenous peoples applied by the United Nations, International Labour Organisation, and World Bank." .

To this end he makes use of Ludwig Wittgenstein's picture theory of the proposition as set out in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. The conclusion is that in order to reconcile the two conceptions, the legal system itself must be conceived of as consisting of three sub-systems, namely, (i) a sub-system of perceptible legal judgments, (ii) a sub-system of valid legal conditions, and (iii) a sub-system of observable social practices." .

In this context, laboratories require suitable calibration standards and matrix certified reference materials (CRMs) for method development, validation and quality control in order to survey related threshold and limit values. Unfortunately, CRMs are subject to the same technical trade barriers as they should help to overcome. Similar problems exist when the production of a CRM touches intellectual property rights (IPR), e.g. in case of GMOs, or when regionally banned veterinary drugs have to be monitored. Another often under-estimated problem is the liability and legal responsibility of the CRM-producer. This paper discusses different aspects of these legal pitfalls and suggests some approaches to overcome these difficulties." .

A single-degree-of-freedom system is first studied for the bending problem of the visco-damage spring. The strong analogy between the behavior of such a system and the one of an imperfection sensitive viscoelastic column, with specific references to the buckling of columns is shown. In particular, the saddle-node bifurcation is clearly recognized in the bifurcation diagram. Large displacement analysis is considered when the true collapse mode is studied. The continuous beam is then studied with a local damage constitutive law. It is shown that the evolution problem, composed of a loading range and the creep test, is well posed for this statically determinate beam. It appears that it is not necessary to introduce some non-locality in the constitutive law, in order to regularize the evolution problem. The stability analysis at the structural level leads to a similar conclusion. There is a limit point in the bifurcation diagram (which is a functional space for this continuous problem). This limit point is obtained via analytical arguments. The limit load depends on the geometrical and material characteristics of the problem but does not depend on the viscosity of the local constitutive law. Numerical simulations illustrate the collapse mode." .

L. No. 96-510, 94 Stat. at Large 2767, codified as amended at 42 USC §§ 9601-9675) in the way in which the Superfund may be used to remediate “orphaned” National Priorities List (NPL) sites and “orphaned” brownfield sites. Under both the existing law and numerous proposals for the reauthorization of CERCLA, while the Superfund may be used for the remediation of orphaned NPL sites, it may not be used for the remediation of orphaned brownfield sites. In each situation, however, an absent, insolvent, defunct, bankrupt or judgment-proof party has created a situation in which remediation costs must be borne by the public. The study concludes that there is no fundamental policy reason for treating these orphans differently and presents recommendations to facilitate the remediation and redevelopment of both NPL sites and brownfield sites." .

MethodsIn November 2013, a stakeholders’ survey was carried out. The questionnaire included questions about legal documents and non-legislative measures relevant to WHP, institutions and other bodies/organizations working in the field, WHP conception/definition, and implementation of WHP activities according to the enterprises’ size. ResultsOnly Finland has adopted a specific law on occupational health care (separate from occupational safety). ILO conventions No. 161 (Occupational Health Services Convention) and No. 187 (Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention) are ratified only in Finland. In Finland, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health acts as one ministry, while two Baltic countries have two separate ministries (one for health and another for social affairs). None of the countries has legally approved a definition of WHP. Latvia and Lithuania tend to separate WHP from other activities, whereas Finland integrates WHP into other occupational health and safety elements. ConclusionsFinland has a more extensive legislative and organizational background to WHP than Latvia and Lithuania. In defining WHP, all the countries refer to the Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion in the European Union. Finland’s practice of integrating WHP into other occupational health and safety elements is important." .

We also establish explicit exact solutions for specific values of the parameter. The results reduce to the Neo-Hookean solution when the power law exponent is set to unity." .

This involves extraction of the palladium complex into iso-amyl alcohol in presence of 0.3 to 2N hydrochloric acid and 0.45 to 1.4M ammonium sulfate. The color is very stable and is highly selective for palladium. At 380 nm it obeys Berr's law in the concentration range of 1 to 9μg of Pd per ml; the optimum range being 4 to 8μg. The sensitivity and molar absorptivity of the reaction are 0.019μg of palladium per cm2 and 5600±70 respectively. The continuous variation and molar ratio methods indicate that palladium forms 1∶2 complex with the ligand." .

The object of this article is to explore the damaging effects of a hostile legal context on female Syrian refugees in Turkey. I base my analysis on scholarship that theorises immigration legislation as a system of legal violence and I argue that the Temporary Protection Regulation and the Law on Foreigners and International Protection that govern the legal status of refugees in Turkey inflict legal violence on Syrian female refugees. This legislation keeps them in the regime of temporary protection and prevents their access to international protection. The temporary protection regime serves furthermore as the main determinant for other forms of legal violence inflicted by various actors. I explore the effects of the Turkish government’s inaction in terms of preventing and sanctioning the abuse of Syrian female refugees as unpaid sex and household workers. I show that the extended legal limbo on the conditions of employment of Syrian refugees secures female Syrians as the most precarious workforce for Turkey’s various sectors. Finally I claim that the forced confinement of Syrian beggars in refugee camps is instrumentalised for their disciplinary regulation." .

Request for patents has increased exponentially in order to legalize the intellectual property. Measuring economical value of each patent has been widely studied in the literature. Majority of the research in this field is focused on the patent driver prospect handled for the patent offices. There are a variety of criteria affecting decisions on each patent right; and predicting the possibility of grant may help the researchers to take some precautions. Objective of this study is to propose a robust model to determine if the appeal has a chance of approval. A case study is run on the patents that are accepted and rejected in home appliance industry to construct an intelligent classification model. The support vector machine, Back-Propagation Network and Bayes classification methods are compared on the proposed model. The proposed model in this study will help the decision makers to predict whether the patent appeal will be accepted. The study is unique with the approach that helps the candidate patent owners." .

This result is consistent with the notion that as the separation of cash flow rights from control rights increases, controlling owners have larger incentives to expropriate the wealth of minority shareholders and low corporate disclosure constitutes a mechanism to facilitate controlling owners in masking their private benefits of control. The negative association between voluntary disclosure and the separation of cash flow rights from control rights is less pronounced for firms with greater external financing needs. This result suggests that for firms with high separation of cash flow rights from control rights, those with greater external financing needs undertake higher firm-level voluntary disclosure to reduce information asymmetry. We also find that the negative association between voluntary disclosure and the separation of cash flow rights from control rights is less pronounced for firms that have a large non-management shareholder. Our result supports the role of large non-management shareholder in mitigating agency problems associated with the separation of ownership and control." .

For a stationary random product measure, almost all sequences are uniformly distributed with probability one. The discrepancy is estimated byN −1/2log3 N for sufficiently largeN. Thus the metric predominance of uniformly distributed sequences is stated, and a further explanation for Benford's law is provided. The results can also be interpreted as estimates of the empirical distribution function for non-identical distributed samples." .

First, we provide background on the theory of soft law, its terms of applicability, and the standards by which to judge its success. Second, we analyse the content and context of the White Paper according to soft law principles. We find that the conditions under which the White Paper was adopted were exactly those suited to a soft law approach and highly determined by the European multi-level governance context. As such, the White Paper has managed to achieve several of the common objectives of soft law in particular in setting up processes allowing information-sharing and subsidiarity. However it has failed to achieve several others especially in fostering the commitment of the states, and in moving the European Union in the direction of binding regulation. Further strategy development will be required to fix these deficiencies." .

The proof is constructive, providing a specific sequence {T n }. The random vector X is said to be in the generalized domain of attraction (GDOA) of a necessarily operator-stable law γ if there exist {T n } and {υ n } such that ℒ(T n (S n −υ n ))→γ. We characterize the GDOA of every operator-stable law, thereby extending previous results of Hahn and Klass; Hudson, Mason, and Veeh; and Jurek. The characterization assumes a particularly nice form in the case of a stable limit. When γ is symmetric stable, all marginals of X must be in the domain of attraction of a stable law. However, if γ is a nonsymmetric stable law then X may be in the GDOA of γ even if no marginal is in the domain of attraction of any law." .

First, a theory of singular causal statements attributing causal responsibility for a particular harm to a particular agent based on the conjunction of a positive condition (necessitation) and a negative condition (avoidability) which captures the notions of sufficiency and necessity in intuitive ideas about agent causation better than traditional conditio sine qua non based theories. Second, a theory of representation of causal issues in the law. The conceptual framework is that of Game Trees and Games in Extensive Form. Causal conditions are defined set-theoretically over Game Trees; causal issues and fundamental distinctions (dependent versus independent intervening causes, foreseeability or not of harm etc.) arising in legal cases are accommodated by the device of a probability distribution over the game-tree representation of cases." .

This apparent arbitrariness raises a number of questions: What is the relation between ad bellum and in bello principles? Why are there so many of the former and so few of the latter? What order is there among the various principles? To answer these questions, I first draw on some recent work by Jeff McMahan to show that ad bellum and in bello principles are not, as often portrayed, independent—the justice of conduct in war largely presupposes the justice of the recourse to war. Undermining this independence claim is one important step toward revealing the unified logical structure of just war theory. I then argue that we can see the dependence of the jus in bello upon the jus ad bellum, not just in the content of certain principles, but also in the structure of the two sets of principles: I construct a one-to-one mapping between ad bellum and in bello principles. In doing so, I argue also that the shared structure successfully finds place for the questions central to the evaluation of the morality of war: what is a sufficient provocation to use force, what objectives may be sought by force, why or for what ends, who has authority to decide to use force, and when or in what circumstances? Despite variations in expression, the theory allows for a coherent and comprehensive evaluation of morality in warfare." .

Austria does not record any statistical and epidemiological data concerning medical malpractice cases. Data from 7,211 autopsy cases from the Department of Forensic Medicine in Vienna covering the period from 1990 to 2000 were analyzed. Fifty-five autopsy reports that were filed as suspected medical malpractice were recorded and analyzed. Thirty cases were classified as surgical incidents, 19 cases as negligence, and 6 cases as medication incidents. Out of a total of 40 cases from available court files, 36 cases were dropped, there were 2 acquittals and only two resulted in convictions. The number of instances of medical malpractice leading to iatrogenic deaths in Austria seems to be very low in comparison to other countries. The possibility that many cases go unnoticed needs to be taken into consideration." .

The case concerned a class action by a consumer organization against a commercial bank. The decision makes a breakthrough in two related respects. First, the Court not only interprets the national law in the light of the EU Directive on Unfair Contract Terms, but also adopts rules of interpretation and reasoning that run parallel to the latest European discussion on unfair contract terms. Second, in an unprecedented manner for Greek case law, it declares a large number of contractual clauses to be unfair, hence broadening consumer protection significantly. Most commercial banks in Greece are now under an obligation to modify their pre-formulated contracts in order to comply with the Court's interpretation of the provision on unfair terms in the Consumer Protection Act." .

Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data are transferred across political borders. To address this problem, we developed a framework called “requirements water marking” that business analysts can use to align and reconcile requirements from multiple jurisdictions (municipalities, provinces, nations) to produce a single high or low standard of care. We evaluate the framework in two empirical case studies covering a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws and medical record retention laws. In these studies, applying our framework reduced the number of requirements a company must comply with by 76 % across 8 jurisdictions and 15 % across 4 jurisdictions, respectively. We show how the framework surfaces critical requirements trade-offs and potential regulatory conflicts that companies must address during the reconciliation process. We summarize our results, including surveys of information technology law experts to contextualize our empirical results in legal practice." .

An (ε, q)-test for P is a randomized algorithm that queries at most q places of an input f and distinguishes with probability 2/3 between the case that f has the property and the case that at least an ε-fraction of the places of f need to be changed in order for it to have the property. Here we concentrate on labeled, d-dimensional grids, where the grid is viewed as a partially ordered set (poset) in the standard way (i.e. as a product order of total orders). The main result here presents an (ε, poly(1/ε))-test for every property of 0/1 labeled, d-dimensional grids that is characterized by a finite collection of forbidden induced posets. Such properties include the “monotonicity” property studied in [9,8,13], other more complicated forbidden chain patterns, and general forbidden poset patterns. We also present a (less efficient) test for such properties of labeled grids with larger fixed size alphabets. All the above tests have in addition a 1-sided error probability. This class of properties is related to properties that are defined by certain first order formulae with no quantifier alternation over the syntax containing the grid order relations. We also show that with one quantifier alternation, a certain property can be defined, for which no test with query complexity of O(n 1/4) (for a small enough fixed ε) exists. The above results identify new classes of properties that are defined by means of restricted logics, and that are efficiently testable. They also lay out a platform that bridges some previous results." .

An overview of mechanistic and functional accounts of stimulus generalisation is given. Mechanistic accounts rely on the process of spreading activation across units representing stimuli. Different models implement the spread in different ways, ranging from diffusion to connectionist networks. A functional account proposed by Shepard analyses the probabilistic structure of the world for invariants. A universal law based on one such invariant claims that under a suitable scaling of the stimulus dimension, generalisation gradients should be approximately exponential in shape. Data from both vertebrates and invertebrates so far uphold Shepard's law. Some data on spatial generalisation in honeybees are presented to illustrate how Shepard's law can be used to determine the metric for combining discrepancies in different stimulus dimensions. The phenomenon of peak shift is discussed. Comments on mechanistic and functional approaches to generalisation are given." .

The latter is encoded in a parameter γ such that γ=1 restores the usual ∇ ν T μν =0 law. We test Rastall’s theory in cosmology, on a flat Robertson–Walker metric, investigating a two-fluid model and using the type Ia supernovae Constitution dataset. One of the fluids is pressure-less and obeys the usual conservation law, whereas the other is described by an equation of state p x =w x ρ x , with w x constant. The Bayesian analysis of the Constitution set does not strictly constrain the parameter γ and prefers values of w x close to −1. We then address the evolution of small perturbations and show that they are dramatically unstable if w x ≠−1 and γ≠1, i.e. General Relativity is the favored configuration. The only alternative is w x =−1, for which the dynamics becomes independent from γ." .

Previous definitions of sexual expression have incorporated a broad range of behaviors including sexual intercourse, solo and partnered masturbation, oral sex, personal grooming, touch, and displays of affection, companionship, and romance (DeLamater and Karraker 2009; Hajjar and Kamel 2003a, b). Inconsistencies in responses to such behaviors cause concern regarding legal and ethical boundaries and responsibilities, and raise questions regarding whether thwarting sexual expression is a violation of residents’ rights (Black et al. 2005). Given the toll on residents, caregivers, and family members, sexual expression in residential and care settings poses significant policy implications. In this paper, we suggest a theoretical perspective and identify gaps in the empirical research which must be addressed in order to support institutional strategies and ultimately, consistent and ethical caregiver responses to sexual expression among older adults in long-term care settings. Extrapolating from this specific application, discussion focuses on future directions for research and policy work related to the field of sexuality among older adults." .

It grew from theological natural law doctrines after which international law acquired a more secular and positivist orientation due to European industrialization. However, European states’ unequal treaties with Asian Kingdoms and colonialism initially failed to establish a truly universal rule of law. In 1920, the Covenant of the League of Nations attempted to establish a legal community of the mankind. This experiment failed to prohibit the use of force nevertheless. The subsequent establishment of the UN gave rise to the hope of a universal rule of law again. Unfortunately, the ensuing Cold War and the post-Cold War trends so far have belied these hopes. The veto power at the Security Council seldom accords with the world’s common interests. However a true rule of law that promotes equality between states and equity between classes is still possible. This article examines and evaluates the possibility of a true rule of law." .

Value capture is a broad term used to describe the process of extracting the additional value that accrues to a property following specific public investment. As the increased value results from public action, the value capture is usually undertaken by a public agency to bring about or pay for a public purpose. The value capture process comprises four key elements, namely, the creation of the value, the calculation of the additional value created, the capturing of this value and finally the use of the funds resulting from the captured value. While the previous paper addressed the first two components, this paper focuses on the last two, namely the capture and use of value in the current legal context. The paper concludes that legally, value capture is possible in South Africa, but that the legislation is vague and inconsistent at times. Furthermore, the paper finds that value capture is most successful when the policy objectives are clear, the mechanisms are correctly defined, favourable market conditions prevail and solid administrative systems are in place." .

Associate to each X i (0) an independent mean-one Poisson clock. Every time a clock rings replace that X-variable by an independent copy and restart the clock. In this way, we obtain i.i.d. stationary processes {X i (t)} t ≥0 (i=1,2,···) whose invariant distribution is the law ν of X 1(0). Benjamini et al. (2003) introduced the dynamical walk S n (t)=X 1(t)+···+X n (t), and proved among other things that the LIL holds for n↦S n (t) for all t. In other words, the LIL is dynamically stable. Subsequently (2004b), we showed that in the case that the X i (0)'s are standard normal, the classical integral test is not dynamically stable. Presently, we study the set of times t when n↦S n (t) exceeds a given envelope infinitely often. Our analysis is made possible thanks to a connection to the Kolmogorov ɛ-entropy. When used in conjunction with the invariance principle of this paper, this connection has other interesting by-products some of which we relate. We prove also that the infinite-dimensional process converges weakly in to the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process in For this we assume only that the increments have mean zero and variance one. In addition, we extend a result of Benjamini et al. (2003) by proving that if the X i (0)'s are lattice, mean-zero variance-one, and possess (2+ɛ) finite absolute moments for some ɛ>0, then the recurrence of the origin is dynamically stable. To prove this we derive a gambler's ruin estimate that is valid for all lattice random walks that have mean zero and finite variance. We believe the latter may be of independent interest." .

Three basic approaches, the welfare-based, the legal-based, and the capability-based approaches, are assessed. From this assessment, this study suggests the recognition of shared humanity as an entry point for advocacy, which offers a cosmopolitan understanding of rights and duties, and the most comprehensive protection for FDP. The main argument of this study is that if the demand for recognition is not heard, relief for refugees and other displaced people will lack an essential dimension. It is the demand to be recognized as human beings that engenders responsibility for forced migrants. Instead of prescribing a list of what to do, or not to do, this reflection has rather suggested a way of being and dealing with the forcibly displaced. This stance goes beyond the facility of typical responses that are known in advance." .

It becomes increasingly important to understand these practices, in part to reduce the likelihood of misunderstanding in collaborations among authors from different disciplines and fields. Moreover, there is also evidence of widespread satisfaction with collaborative and co-authoring experiences. In some cases the dissatisfactions are more in the realm of bruised feelings and miscommunication but in others there is clear exploitation and even legal disputes about, for example, intellectual property. Our paper is part of a multiyear study funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and draws its data from a representative national survey of scientists working in 108 Carnegie Doctoral/Research Universities—Very High Research Activity (n = 641). The paper tests hypotheses about the determinants of collaboration effectiveness. Results indicate that having an explicit discussion about co-authorship reduces the odds of a bad collaboration on a recent scholarly article. Having co-authors from different universities also reduces the odds of a bad collaboration, while large numbers of co-authors have the reverse effect. The results shed some systematic, empirical light on research collaboration practices, including not only norms and business-as-usual, but also routinely bad collaborations." .

It is assumed that an enforcement agency can make use of a costless inspection process, which would provide a free, but possibly inaccurate, assessment of the subject's behavior. The agency also has some power of punishment. When should evidence be collected by the agency, and how should it be used? How can an enforcement system be structured so as to maximize the level of compliance? How does compliance depend on the subject's private gain for violation, the level of punishment, the risk of errors (of both kinds) in the inspection report, and other parameters?

The shear modulus is assumed to have a power-law dependence on depth from the plane of the crack. Moreover, both a general and a power-law behavior in time for the shear modulus are considered. A simple closed form expression for the normal component of stress in front of the propagating crack is derived which exhibits explicitly the form of the stress singularity and its material dependency. The crack profile is examined and its dependence on the spatial and time behavior of the shear modulus is determined." .

When the channel is not straight and when the Reynolds number is not negligible, additional terms appear in this relation. Some previous authors investigated the first three coefficients in the expansion of $${|\\overline{\\nabla p}|}$$ in the powers of $${\\overline{u}}$$ and they showed that the coefficient of $${\\overline{u}^2}$$ vanishes for moderate $${\\mathcal{R}}$$. Other authors demonstrated that this coefficient can be non-zero. This question is addressed and solved. It is demonstrated that both cases occur; Forchheimer’s law has a cubic correction for small $${\\mathcal{R}}$$ and a quadratic one for large $${\\mathcal{R}}$$. Two analytical–numerical algorithms are constructed to prove this property. These algorithms are applied to the Navier–Stokes equations in three-dimensional channels enclosed by two wavy walls whose amplitude is proportional to $${b{\\varepsilon}}$$, where 2b is the mean clearance of the channels and $${\\varepsilon}$$ is a small dimensionless parameter. The first algorithm is applied for small $${\\mathcal{R}}$$ by representing the velocity and the pressure in terms of a double Taylor series in $${\\mathcal{R}}$$ and $${\\varepsilon}$$. The accuracy $${O(\\mathcal{R}^2)}$$ and $${O(\\varepsilon^6)}$$ following Padé approximations yield analytical approximate formulae for Forchheimer’s law. The first algorithm is applied to symmetric channels on the theoretical level (all terms on $${\\mathcal{R}}$$ and $${\\varepsilon}$$ are taken into account) to show that $${|\\overline{\\nabla p}|}$$ is an odd function of $${\\overline{u}}$$. This observation yields, in particular, a cubic correction to Darcy’s law. Numerical examples for non-symmetrical channels yield the same cubic correction. The second algorithm is based on the analytical–numerical solution to the Navier–Stokes equations for arbitrary $${\\mathcal{R}}$$ up to $${O(\\varepsilon^{3})}$$. This algorithm yields, in particular, a quadratic correction to Darcy’s law for higher $${\\mathcal{R}}$$." .

To determine the current and potential future impact of sexting, more information about the behavior and the attitudes and beliefs surrounding it must be gathered, particularly as it relates to sexting by minors. The present study was designed to provide preliminary information about this phenomenon. Participants were 606 high school students (representing 98 % of the available student body) recruited from a single private high school in the southwestern U.S. Nearly 20 % of all participants reported they had ever sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone while almost twice as many reported that they had ever received a sexually explicit picture via cell phone and, of these, over 25 % indicated that they had forwarded such a picture to others. Of those reporting having sent a sexually explicit cell phone picture, over a third did so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences attached to the behavior. Given the potential legal and psychological risks associated with sexting, it is important for adolescents, parents, school administrators, and even legislators and law enforcement to understand this behavior." .

The International Criminal Court (ICC), in the situation of Kenya, does not regard acts of forced nudity, forcible circumcision and penile amputation as sexual violence when they are motivated by ethnic prejudice and intended to demonstrate the cultural superiority of one tribe over another. The Court argues that not every act of violence that targets parts of the body commonly associated with sexuality should be considered an act of sexual violence. This recent interpretation of what counts as sexual violence provides another example of the complicity of international criminal law institutions in the ongoing construction process of female subordination. The ICC, in the Kenya situation, implicitly confirms the mutilation of female agency by interpreting penile amputation as a kind of power game between males, and by instrumentalizing the male sexual organ as an indicator of masculinity and manhood." .

Adequate compliance testing is possible only if limits are clearly defined, taking measurement and sampling uncertainty into consideration. Furthermore, decisions on compliance must be based on samples which reflect the composition of the quantity to be evaluated. The resulting sample sizes are normally regarded by food inspection authorities as being much larger than acceptable. Consequently, an alternative strategy should be developed. Autocontrol data (i.e. inspection results obtained by the factory) in principle provide an adequate data basis for decisions on compliance. However, they must be reliable and the food inspection authority must have access to these data on request. Using these data and on condition that they show an approximate normal distribution, an inspection strategy based on arithmetic mean and standard deviation can be developed. Reliable and transparent decisions on compliance can thus be made. In many cases an adequate verification of food authenticity requires a comparison of raw material and product composition. Maximum acceptable differences, taking the relevant sources of variation into consideration, have to be defined and should be used instead of limits." .

Particular emphasis is placed upon the proof that the permeability tensor is symmetric. In addition, it is shown that there is a one-to-one relationship between the local and macroscopic velocity fields. This leads to the interesting phenomenological observation that the local velocity vector at any given point must always lie either on a fixed line or in a fixed plane. All of this holds true for an incompressible homogeneous Newtonian fluid moving slowly through a rigid porous medium with uniform porosity under isothermal and steady state conditions. The question whether Darcy's law is applicable under nonsteady or compressible flow conditions, or when the medium has nonuniform porosity, is also discussed. Finally, it is shown that the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, as well as the expression describing Couette flow between parallel plates, can be derived from the equations presented in this work and may thus be viewed as special cases of Darcy's law." .

BAP is a non-trivial optimization problem, and only sophisticated algorithms are currently available for solving it. The issue is: are they “writable” as an actual law? Citizens rightly demand simple, easy to understand, voting systems. The alternative, though, seems to have simple, but unsound electoral laws. We propose the following way out of this dilemma: leave to a mathematically sophisticated algorithm the task of producing an optimal apportionment, but attach to it a “certificate of optimality”, that is, describe a simple procedure whereby anybody can check, through some elementary operations, that the seat allocation output by the algorithm is indeed an optimal apportionment. We discuss one such certificate, based on the Max flow- min cut Theorem, relative to a parametric max flow method of ours for BAP." .

The resultant kinetic model can produce a response that overshoots, quickens, and eventually saturates as the input intensity is increased. The possible model behavior ranges parametrically from non-adaptive (compression hypothesis) to weakly adaptive (limited Weber's law)." .

ERA consists of the preparation of a periodic environmental balance sheet and the statement of physical input and output, where key terminologies such as environmental assets, environmental liabilities, and (net) environmental capital are defined in terms of the functional theory of resources and of physical and legal characteristics constraining an accounting entity’s management of environmental resources. Illustrative examples clearly show an advantage of public trust management over public domain management in enabling government to take precautionary action and the useful role of ERA in supplying physical and legal information complementing the current public development corporation’s financial accounting system. The paper also discusses how ERA is related to two representative modification systems of national accounting." .

While most virtual worlds have adopted subscription models there is an increasing trend toward selling digital items directly to users. This arises from the emergent markets linking real world currency to items existing on company servers. This practice has resulted in controversial and unresolved legal issues. Communities that arise from virtual worlds can be classified according to level and type of control. Lack of control can lead to a Hobbesian world of predation and vigilantism. Strong developer control can be exerted to protect users but communities adopting shared governance with users are likely to become more common." .

A consistent pattern of Ag-positive NORs was found in each individual. Ninety percent of the individuals have a modal number of 8–10 Ag-positive NORs per cell. The frequency of Ag-positive NORs is similar in all five acrocentrics. A statistically nonsignificant lower frequency is found in chromosome 22. Ag-negative NORs on both homologues were found in four cases. The observed frequency distribution of individuals with homozygous NOR-positive, heterozygous, and homozygous negative acrocentric chromosomes was in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg law in all five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes as well as in total. No sex difference was observed in our material." .

(Comput Mech, 2017. doi:10.1007/s00466-017-1404-5), concerning a newly developed Virtual element method (VEM) for 2D continuum problems. The first part of the work proposed a study for linear elastic problem. The aim of this part is to explore the features of the VEM formulation when material nonlinearity is considered, showing that the accuracy and easiness of implementation discovered in the analysis inherent to the first part of the work are still retained. Three different nonlinear constitutive laws are considered in the VEM formulation. In particular, the generalized viscoelastic model, the classical Mises plasticity with isotropic/kinematic hardening and a shape memory alloy constitutive law are implemented. The versatility with respect to all the considered nonlinear material constitutive laws is demonstrated through several numerical examples, also remarking that the proposed 2D VEM formulation can be straightforwardly implemented as in a standard nonlinear structural finite element method framework." .

But the developments are not uniform. As international health law takes consumer protection into account, it tends to increase the gap between a “Western international law” and a “Third World international law,” and to emphasize the negative harmonization approach towards international health protection. Another problem concerns the unification of the rules of international health law and those of international consumer law. This problem is particularly difficult to solve, as the rules of international consumer law themselves are still far from being unified." .

However, these issues have not been studied properly in Portugal. Materials and methodThis study is a survey of 450 Portuguese oncologists by postal means and personal contact. ResultsThe response rate was 33% (143). Only 13% would practise euthanasia with the present law in force forbidding such practise, and 24% would do so if it were legalised; 39% favoured its legalisation and 36% would like to have the option of euthanasia if they had a terminal disease. About assisted suicide, 15% would do it with the current law in force forbidding such action and 25% would do so if it were made legal; 32% favoured its legalisation and 24% would like to have that option if they had a terminal disease. There was one case of euthanasia and no cases of assisted suicide. The most important factor related with the acceptance of euthanasia and assisted suicide was religion, with non-practising Catholics accepting such practises more often than practising Catholics. The Portuguese oncologists have a very positive view on the potential role of palliative care in preventing many requests for euthanasia and assisted suicide. ConclusionPortuguese oncologists are mainly against the practise of euthanasia and assisted suicide and the number of requests is also relatively low; consequently, the number of episodes of assisted death is also apparently very low." .

Whereas burdening them with legal liability for misconducts that benefit those who resort to their services actually discourages wrongdoings—as will be clarified in the article—an alienation effect can also arise. The gatekeeper might become more interested in covering up the illegal behavior. This article studies the problem with respect to tax evasion by firms in a principal-agent framework. It highlights the role of legal rules pertaining to liability for tax evasion in shaping the choices of the parties, as concealment costs vary according to whether the risk-neutral principal or the riskaverse agent is held responsible when tax evasion is detected. The main result of the analysis is that there is a simple ex post test that can be carried out to infer whether harnessing the agent was socially beneficial." .

While warning against the use of tobacco and striving for a smokeless society the U.S. government subsidizes the growth of tobacco. The economic impact of smoking is, on balance, negative for users, nonusers and society. The federal government does not legislate the use of tobacco but most states and many municipalities have smoking laws. Although such laws vary they normally attempt to protect the rights of both smokers and nonsmokers. Workplace smoking policies also vary but generally focus on applicable laws, health research findings, employee preferences, involvement in policy determination, formalization and communication, and smoking cessation programs." .

To discuss the law and economics of corporations, their performance on the market and management control by legislation and government, is to discuss Corporate Governance. Now, Corporate Governance is being challenged by a new concept to conceive the role of corporations in the world and to control their managers: this is the concept of Corporate Social Responsibilty (CSR). This concept focuses on other than merely profit centered functions of corporations; rather, performance of corporations is measured by criteria of good corporate citizenship. In the Non-Profit sector, corporations also play a major role, although organizations in this sector typically differ from business corporations in several aspects. Yet, deficits of transparency and control of NPO are being discussed here as well. The tendency is to draw from the concept of corporate governance to develop appropriate remedies. Furthermore, the discussion of Corporate Social Responsibilty has also made its way to the NPO sector." .

Positivity of σ 2 is proved for nonconstant f under fairly general conditions, and the range of Â is shown to be dense in 1⊥. A functional law of the iterated logarithm is proved when the (2+δ)th moment of f in the range of Â is finite for some δ>0 (Theorem 2.7(a)). Under the additional condition of convergence in norm of the transition probability p(t, x, d y) to m(dy) as t → ∞, for each x, the above results hold when the process starts away from equilibrium (Theorems 2.6, 2.7 (b)). Applications to diffusions are discussed in some detail." .

It is the purpose of this paper to show why the solutions to continuous systems, whether conservative or nonconservative, stationary or nonstationary, cannot be achieved from the Galerkin formulation by means of the simple power series with the simplicity now demonstrated in our published papers. Hamilton's law and Hamilton's principle are discussed. The Galerkin formulation is applied to the differential equation. The source of the differential equation is immaterial. The result is compared to the Ritz method applied to Hamilton's law which is called the Hamilton-Ritz formulation. The result clearly demonstrates why our direct analytical solutions for continuua, except for easily identifiable special cases, have not been and cannot be obtained through a correct, direct application of the Galerkin method." .

This study tested this law on an oral sample by analysis of a transcribed interview which had been conducted for an unrelated study. A second purpose was to test whether the law holds differently for open- vs closed-class words. The words in the interview were tabulated by frequencies and numbers of words at each frequency, and separated by syntactic class. As Zipf found for written samples, the law provides a reasonable summary of the data for the less frequently used words but predicts fewer different words among the most frequently used words than were actually found. Linear regressions performed for each syntactic class revealed that the regression equation for open-class words provided the best fit to Zipf's law. The sample of closed-class words, containing a much smaller proportion of low frequency words, revealed a poor fit to Zipf's law." .

For Hegel, the purpose of a remedy is to vindicate the human right to self-determination by refuting the claim to validity implied in intentional or negligent acts that infringe this right. Accordingly, in determining the civil effect of legislation, a distinction must be made between statutes that effectuate pre-existing rights and those which create new rights in the attempt to maximize aggregate welfare. The former should confer a civil right of action, the latter should not. Statutes that impose a duty of affirmative action should be enforced civilly if their purpose is to protect individual autonomy in circumstances where one person has gained control over the welfare of another. And statutes that protect persons from exposure to unreasonable risk should confer a civil right of action provided that the conditions of ordinary negligence liability are met. These conditions ought to supplant those connected with the legislative intent theory of statutory torts." .

The proposition is repeated in short, then some practical consequencies are demonstrated. The ideal gas law will take on a simpler form and the molar heat capacities will turn into dimensionless quantities. The universal gas constant and the Boltzmann constant are shown to be superfluous conversion factors. It is further demonstrated how an empirical scale for the Boltzmann temperature can be established and how dimensional analysis can be performed. Some examples from statistical mechanics show that the Boltzmann temperature is well suited when deducing the basic relations in this field. It is emphasized that the proposition does not affect the theory of thermodynamics, it only draws conclusions from well known facts. In traditional thermodynamics the so-called barometric equation is taken to actually measure the Boltzmann constant. Such measurement has no meaning in the Boltzmann temperature idiom, the result of the measurement is in this notion the Loschmidt (Avogadro) number. The molar entropy becomes a pure, dimensionless number, a property which corresponds well to the real nature of entropy. The relation to the thermodynamic probability of a state is established, and a different form of the Boltzmann equation S=k In W is given." .

These attempts to overcome formalism are processes, judicially acknowledged as such, and as yet far from complete. At the conceptual center of the development of substantive equality is the legal realization of human dignity: not an abstract, individualistic notion, but a concept about the relation between the individual and state, and individual and group, which is circumscribed by concern, respect and consideration. But substantive equality is not possible only through the case law. The current issues surrounding intersectional discrimination and the contextual appreciation of a claimant’s circumstances are urgent reminders that the methods and remedies afforded by the structure of litigation of equality rights claims simply cannot accommodate many instances which call for relief. The fact that these inadequacies of court enforced claims are beginning to be laid bare by some of the problems being faced by the Courts in equality claims is perhaps not a failing of equality law and the concept of dignity, but its strength. The methodology of human rights litigation in countries like Canada and South Africa supports a dialogue between court and legislature. As substantive equality develops in these jurisdictions, the limits of judicial development will be challenged. That is ultimately to be welcomed, if the legislatures are responsive to the definition of human dignity and substantive equality in development judicially, and respond with efforts to support and promote these developments." .

The appropriate growth scale of N relative to t is of the form , where the rate function H0(t) is a certain asymptotic version of the function (case B) or (case A). We have found two critical points, λ1<λ2, below which the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, respectively, break down.

Since the existence of a fair (as in envy-free) allocation is not generally guaranteed, due to the restrictions on the money transfers, the concept of fairness is weakened, and a new concept of fairness is introduced. This concept is called weak fairness. This paper defines an allocation rule that implements weakly fair allocations and demonstrates that it is coalitionally strategy-proof. In fact, under a mild regulatory condition and quasi-linear utility functions, it is demonstrated that this is the only coalitionally strategy-proof allocation rule that implements a weakly fair allocation." .

We show the steady-state distribution obeys an exponential law when the saving factor is set uniformly, and a power law when the saving factor is set diversely. The power distribution can also be obtained by proposing a new model where the preferential spending behavior is considered. The association of the distribution with the probability of money to be exchanged has also been discussed." .

As a member of the health care team, the pediatric nephrologist may be asked to guide therapeutic intervention with parents, family members, and other care-givers. We present a case study that illustrates some of the difficulties that may arise when conflicting social and economic pressures, as well as public opinion and legal authority, enter the decision-making process. Clinical, theoretical, legal, and economic considerations involved in the ethical decision process are presented. Some tentative guidelines for approaching such dilemmas are offered bearing in mind a goal of consensual decision making." .

Should the ground movements be the result of landslide movements, proving the cause or even the occurrence of the landslide may often be the main area of dispute. In this paper the definition of a 'landslide' suitable for legal purposes is examined and the various causes of landslides are briefly reviewed. The legal difficulties of proving the cause and occurrence of a landslide are then explored through three legal case studies involving damage, or potential damage, resulting from landslide movements." .

Woodward that Dartmouth College, even though originally chartered by government, was legally akin to a private corporation. This landmark decision was the founding legal document of what has become the American private nonprofit sector. While the decision has attained hagiographic status, this paper explores what the US nonprofit sector would look like if the Supreme Court had ruled the other way. Using alternate history and scenario writing as research methodologies, it highlights the invisible losses due to the decision and depicts what a public nonprofit sector would have looked like." .

This paper discusses the current availability of employee rights in the United States on the basis of marital status to same-sex couples, and both the direct and indirect economic consequences to organizations of providing such rights. Despite legal recognition in some states and by many employers in the private sector, the availability of marital rights in the workplace for same-sex couples remains tenuous, at most. Although the direct economic consequences of same-sex relationships remain a matter of debate, the indirect economic advantages are several, including being an employer of choice and having a favorable reputation in the consumer, stockholder, and applicant marketplace. Employers should counterbalance indirect economic benefits with opposition to same-sex relationships, including product boycotts. The issue cannot be ignored from a legal or economic perspective." .

Therefore, a medical and judicial process of transition has been regulated accordingly. However, this has not resulted in either the legalization of sex change surgery, nor in the recognition of transsexual identity within Iranian substantive law. Sex change surgery is allowed through Islamic law, rather than substantive law, in response to the existing social facts and norms, on the one hand, and structural cooperation with medical system, on the other. In this article, I argue that the Iranian heteronormative law’s understanding of transsexuality has amounted to the misrecognition of trans persons’ status within law and society. Using semi structured interviews, intersectional content analysis, and feminist methodologies, the findings indicate that transsexual bodies have gained meaning through religious and medical discourses within a framework of power relations, and that Iranian transsexual persons have reconstructed and redefined gender and gender relations in a way that informs their understanding of gender and sexuality beyond the existing Islamic legal and social norms. Moreover, intersectional analysis of the interviews demonstrates how the legal misrecognition of transsexuality creates space for a discourse which in itself leads to the misrecognition of other gendered identities, such as homosexuals and transwomen." .

It critically examines the ideology of privatization and argues for alternative guidelines of reform. The central contention is that a healthy market economy does not require domination of private property; rather it relies on apposite political-legal-ideological power and regulatory-monitoring regimes of accumulation and distribution socially legitimated within a given public culture. Rejecting the fallacies of ownership determinism and precision requirement on property rights for morality and efficiency, this essay clarifies distinction between the notion of exclusive properties and the vision of their socialized utility and management. Justifications for reforming state and private sectors alike in accordance with a unifying commons of social defense and feasibilities of innovative reform measures and policy proposals in that direction, will be elaborated in a third essay titled “Overcoming Privatization: A Strategic and Institutional Argument”." .

Measurable changes in both inclusion dimensions and fluid densities occur; densities decrease from ≈1.0 to ≈0.7 g/cc. Stretching is fastest along 〈100〉, and slower along 〈001〉 and 〈010〉. The dislocation microstructure around the inclusions suggests that creep mechanisms operate. Uncertainties in the experimental determinations of stretching rates result from optical resolution limits, errors inherent in measuring homogenization temperatures, uncertainties in the fluid equation of state, and changes in fluid chemistry during the heat-treatment. Inclusion stretching by dislocation creep can be treated using a model developed for hot isostatic pressing. In this model, we assume spherical symmetry of plastic flow, that the material yields by steady-state power-law creep, and that the parameters for the constitutive law and fluid equation of state are known. Stretching rates are predicted to depend on the difference between the fluid pressure and the external pressure, the temperature, the constitutive law governing power-law creep, and geometry. Predicted stretching rates show fair, but not exact, agreement with experimentally measured rates. The amount of stretching predicted by the model is in rough agreement with estimates based on dislocation microstructures around natural inclusions, if xenolith ascent rates are of the order of 1 cm/s or faster." .

The discussion proceeds along three main lines. First, the focus of attention on the potential risks to the financial system is typically on the systemic risk arising from the payments system. Since issuers of electronic money automatically become part of the payments system we consider if the arguments relating to systemic risk originating in the payments system apply in the case of electronic money. Second, we examine the sharp divergence in regulatory approaches between the US and the EU, and suggest that a useful way of reconciling this divergence is to note the existence of a tradeoff between the efficiency of the financial system and the amount of risk assumed by the public sector. This means that there is not necessarily a “correct” answer to the desirability of regulation. Third, technological advances and financial innovations have made it easier for firms to engage in regulatory arbitrage. Competitive pressures may have encouraged financial centres to engage in competitive deregulation, resulting in a less than socially optimal level of regulation overall. It is therefore important that national authorities coordinate and harmonise their regulatory policies." .

Despite its general recognition in various international legal instruments there is, however, an ongoing search for its concrete meaning. Recent documents adopted under the auspices of the Council of Europe (CoE) have tried to specify standards for the organization of judicial administration. Unfortunately, however, some of these documents exhibit flaws and misconceptions in the conceptualization of judicial independence. This article identifies these imperfections and argues that future standardsetting on judicial independence in Europe should direct more attention to comparative constitutional analysis and to experience gained in the course of judicial reforms in the Council of Europe's member states.

The components of finite strain due to different independent mechanisms have been measured for these rocks. The total strain is split up into two major components: $$\\varepsilon ^t = \\varepsilon ^p + \\varepsilon ^d .$$ The finite natural strain caused by dislocation creep (ɛ d ) is measured by a new technique using folded and stretched rutile needles which are good strain markers within the quartz crystals. Pressure solution strain (ɛ p ) is measured from the ratio of the area of new crystals and fibers to the whole rock area in principal sections. Grain boundary sliding is a dependent process which accompanies both mechanisms. Pressure solution obeys a linear Newtonian flow law, $$\\left| {\\dot \\gamma _0^p } \\right| = A_p \\left| {\\tau _0 } \\right|$$ , while dislocation creep obeys a power law of the form $$\\left| {\\dot \\gamma _0^d } \\right| = A_d \\left| {\\tau _0 } \\right|^n $$ where $$\\dot \\gamma _0^p ,\\dot \\gamma _0^d $$ are octahedral shear strain rates, τ0 is the octahedral shear stress and A p , A p and n are constants. A direct correlation between finite strain measurements and the operating flow laws can be made. Application of these methods and principles to a few field examples indicates that the rocks obey a flow law partly governed by each mechanism. Any set of physical conditions defines a unique flow law and there is a transition in creep behavior from dominantly Newtonian to a power law with increasing strain rate." .

One such principle is the “Aut dedere aut iudicare” principle, which has been also codified into SUA Convention, at art. 6 par. 4. This obligation comes from an international treaty, so it cannot be disregarded by any state (short of becoming susceptible to international liability), neither can it be amended by a national law. If a state party has inadequate law resources to establish its jurisdiction, or if unable or unwilling to prosecute the pirate, then such state party has no choice but extradite the pirate. If we consider the above principle as a conventional obligation, then it should be limited only to state parties, and it should be applied only under conditions stated by SUA Convention. Instead, if we consider it as a customary law principle, because piracy—as crimen iuris gentium—offends international community as a whole, then such principle shall be binding without any limit or condition." .

Philanthropy has begun to grow as well, albeit more slowly. The non-profit and voluntary sector and the state, each face important challenges as development of the sector accelerates. The state has sought both to encourage growth of non-profit, voluntary and philanthropic institutions, but also to control the pace and directions of that growth. Those dual aims are reflected in the state's regulation of the sector since the mid-1980s. This article provides detailed information on the development of the non-profit sector in Vietnam. It examines some common problems many of the new non-profits and voluntary organisations face and discusses the rapidly changing environment for philanthropy in Vietnam. The article also reviews the developing legal environment for non-profits and philanthropy, compares the situation in Vietnam to other countries in transition, and situates the functions of the non-profit sector in Vietnam in the context of the emerging scholarly literature on functions and models of the non-profit sector and government/non-profit relations." .

We model the supplier’s trade-off between the option value to defer the contract execution and the penalty payment in the event of delays. We also take into account the issue of penalty enforcement, which in turn depends on both the discretion of the court of law in voiding contractual clauses and the “efficiency” of the judicial system (i.e. the average length of civil trials). We test our main results on Italian public procurement data showing that the supplier’s incentive to delay is greater the higher the volatility of production costs and the lower the “efficiency” of the judicial system. We then calibrate the model using parameters that mimic the Italian scenario on public works procurement and calculate the maximum amount that a supplier is “willing to pay” (per day) to postpone the delivery date and infringe the contract provisions. Our calibration results are consistent with the theoretical model’s predictions and the empirical findings." .

The assignment includes an introduction to the terminology associated with starting a company based on intellectual property and to nondisclosure agreements. After this, the students write a draft patent application. With over 150,000 United States patents issued annually, the role of intellectual property is prominent and becoming increasingly important in current corporations and in the formation of new businesses, as well as in government and academic settings." .

The definition of ‘shared aquifer’ is more complex than the mere physically shared body of groundwater flowing from country A to country B. The border between Ethiopia and Kenya is characterized by low-volume groundwater storage and low transboundary flows. However, groundwater has visible environmental, social and economic functions. The characteristics of groundwater flow and storage in aquifers shared between Ethiopia and Kenya are different from those used in setting the foundation of the international legal framework on shared aquifers. By describing the characteristics of the groundwaters that are shared between Ethiopia and Kenya, this work demonstrates that the international legal framework is inadequate when applied in this region. The main inadequacies are: (1) international law does not specify the minimum volume of transboundary flow in an aquifer for it to qualify to be treated under the law, and (2) the physical aspects of water get more emphasis than the functions of groundwater. A more adequate international legal framework would be one that considers specific types of groundwater and local needs." .

It discusses the role of the European Central Bank as a bank supervisor and the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The article then critically analyses the draft Directive on Bank Recovery and Resolution (RRD) and argues that it is inadequate to serve as one of the pillars of banking union. The article reviews the difficulties of Member States in implementing the RRD by analysing the United Kingdom’s resolution framework as a case study. Finally, the article suggests that although strengthened powers for national resolution authorities are necessary to enhance the RRD, the logic of banking union demands further centralisation of sovereign authority in the Euro area in order to manage more effectively the resolution and recovery of financial institutions and to establish more institutional coherence with the ECB/SSM as bank supervisor. Further centralisation of banking supervision and resolution powers, however, could result in a deepening split in the EU internal market between member states not participating in banking union and participating states." .

It is shown how memory can be modeled within this framework and fading memory is given as an example. The restrictions that the second law of thermodynamics on the constitutive laws for materials with fading memory are found using the Coleman–Noll procedure. It is shown that materials with fading memory, when undergoing a process that is long and slow enough can be approximated in some sense. Finally, equilibrium states are considered and under weak assumptions the familiar relations from thermostatics are obtained." .

The wild-type, mutants defective in phototropism, mutants defective in carotene regulation, and newpic mutants specifically defective for photocarotenogenesis were examined. The results indicate that photocarotenogenesis depends on a single sensory pathway which shares its earlier steps (governed by genesmadA andmadB) with the sensory pathway for phototropism. It shares its later steps (probably governed by genescarA andpicB) with one of the pathways for carotene regulation, and includes at least one specific step (governed by genepicA) not known to be involved in other responses." .

This unification was subsequently extended to polar spaces of arbitrary rank. The first part of this paper deals with a method of constructing intriguing sets of one polar space from those of another via field reduction. In the second part of this paper, we generalise an ovoid derivation of Payne and Thas to a derivation of intriguing sets." .

One of the most important legal developments to emerge from this has been the creation of the office of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences (UN Special Rapporteur), as part of a series of developments at the UN level that finally accorded explicit recognition to violence against women as a human rights concern. In May 2015, Dr. Daniela Nadj interviewed UN Special Rapporteur, Professor Rashida Manjoo, during her visit to give the annual lecture at the Criminal Justice Centre, Queen Mary, University of London. The interview, an edited version of which is presented here, addressed broad themes including the meaning of liberation for women, especially in a post-conflict setting, the pervasive socio-economic inequality faced by women as an enduring obstacle to equality around the world, the normativity gap on violence against women, academic activism, and the politics of legal information." .
