Abstract An effective method was proposed for correcting the seasonal—interannual prediction of the summer climate anomaly. The predictive skill can be substantially improved by applying the method to the seasonal—interannual prediction carried out by a coupled ocean—atmosphere model. Thus the method has the potential to improve the operational summer climate predictions.
