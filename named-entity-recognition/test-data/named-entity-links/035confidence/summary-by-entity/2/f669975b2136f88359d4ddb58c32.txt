Abstract The dependence of the magnetic field of a flaw on the distance to the surface of a tested article has been studied for rectangular slot-type flaws. For flaws with a small opening width, it can be considered that their magnetic field decreases in inverse proportion to this distance, but with an increase in the flaw width, the field decreases more slowly.
