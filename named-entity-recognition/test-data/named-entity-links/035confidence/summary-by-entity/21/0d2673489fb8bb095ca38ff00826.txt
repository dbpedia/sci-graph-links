Abstract The conditioning effect of cyclic photoperiods was studied in 9 experiments. Quail after 1 day of age were exposed to repeated cycles of 6 hr of light and 18 hr of darkness during their first 4 weeks.Afterwards the groups were established to study the effect of (a) ahemeral (unnatural daylength); (b) phase shifted, and (c) abbreviated photoperiods. The quail were kept on such regimens for 3 weeks. The results based on the 7-week testicular weights indicated that quail did not respond to a phase shift in the light period but responded to an abbreviation of a previously established photoperiod.Quail responded to unnatural daylength even when the actual and relative length of the dark period increased.
