Summary.  Films whose water contact angle is higher than 150Â° have been the subject of great interest and enthusiastic study in recent years. These films, which are called super-hydrophobic, are fabricated by combining appropriate surface roughness with surfaces of low surface energy. Here we briefly review the fundamental theories on the wettability of a hydrophobic rough solid surface, together with recent works on the processing and properties of super-hydrophobic films. Though the practical application of these films is still limited, the obstacles to application are gradually being surmounted, providing a great opportunity for the development of various industrial products.
