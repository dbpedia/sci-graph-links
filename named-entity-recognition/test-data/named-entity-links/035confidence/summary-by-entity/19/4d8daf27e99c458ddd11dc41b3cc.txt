Abstract To evaluate the ability to generate mental images and its relations to artistic training, 44 undergraduates were presented with a list of selected fragments from 40 characters in the Roman alphabet. Subjects provided those letters suggested by the fragments for as many items as possible within a 90-second interval. It was hypothesized that students who had received college training in studio art would be able to produce a greater number of candidate images than students not trained in art, resulting in more correct answers and higher scores. Results confirmed the hypothesis. Trained subjects completed significantly more of the letters on the image-generation task than did those not trained in art (p=.0001). This suggests that superior ability to generate images is associated with artistic training. Further, these results imply that, to the degree to which artistic training reflects ability, image generation may also be related to artistic ability.
