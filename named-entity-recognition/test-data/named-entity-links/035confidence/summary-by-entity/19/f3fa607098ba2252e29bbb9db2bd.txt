Abstract Because dance/movement therapists must respond and make therapeutic decisions in the moment, they need to have integrated a body of knowledge that is both broad and evaluative. The purpose of this paper is to describe elements of role and group development theories that can serve these needs of dance/movement therapists. Excerpts from a group dance/movement therapy session are used to illustrate the usefulness of this knowledge to the therapist's processing of the group.
