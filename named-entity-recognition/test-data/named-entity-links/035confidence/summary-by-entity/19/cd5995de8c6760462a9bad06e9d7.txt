Abstract The model describing one stage of the thin film growth — the island growth and coalescence —is suggested in the present work. The completely random distribution of condensation centers is assumed over the substrate. The computer was used for the numerical solution with strongly simplified suppositions according to [9]. The computer results and the analytical ones (in the latter, the regular distribution of condensation centers was supposed [9]) point out two extremes; the experimentally found results would lie between them.
