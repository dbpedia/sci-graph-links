Abstract A preschool movement through dance program is a way to open the door to numerous cultural benefits and opportunities, and preschool skill facilitation. Creating new contexts for learning enrich young children and offer them different opportunities to understand and negotiate the world. Inclusive curricular integration and parent and community participation are important components of a cultural arts experience that deepen the childrenâ€™s repertoire of behavior and responses to the world. Early childhood education practitioners are encouraged to creatively explore their community and develop rich cultural learning experiences for children.
