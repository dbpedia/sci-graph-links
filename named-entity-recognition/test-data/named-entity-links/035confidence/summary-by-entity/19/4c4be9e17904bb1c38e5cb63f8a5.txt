Abstract To determine if the response rate of many individuals can be regulated collectively by the use of techniques similar to those used to condition one organism operantly, members of two and three-man units of normal adult males were individually instructed to produce as many light flashes as possible by pushing a button during 5 daily sessions of 3 hours eachâ€”the reinforcement being radio music. Ss were in separate rooms, but their responses were tallied collectively and they were programmed as teams under various DRL and DRH schedules. The lights (conditioned reinforcement) were intermittently paired with the radio music (primary reinforcement) on a variable ratio schedule. The collective rate response stabilized under the various DRL and DRH schedules. The DRL schedules systematically decreased the collective team response rate until usually only one member of the team was responding, while the DRH schedules increased the team response rate until at least two out of three members were responding at a rate higher than operant level. DRL response rates were much easier to shape than the DRH response rates. In general, team regulation conformed to the principles of reinforcement manifested in schedules of reinforcements used on individual subjects.
