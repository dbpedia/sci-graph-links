Abstract A common presumption of secondary education is that what occurs in-school impacts students after they exit school. Previous researchers found transition-services received in school by students with autism spectrum disorder predicted their post-school success with regards to employment and independent living. This secondary analysis of the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 sought to understand the relationship between curriculum—functional versus non-functional—and seven measures of post-school outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder. The main results of the study include low rates of receipt of a functional curriculum, poor post-school outcomes, and the lack of relationship between curriculum and post-school outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorder.
