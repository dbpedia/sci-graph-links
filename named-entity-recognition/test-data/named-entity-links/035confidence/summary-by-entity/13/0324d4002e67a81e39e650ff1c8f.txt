Abstract The aim of this review was to locate research in educational settings incorporating responses from children with or without disabilities or special educational needs, and to describe how the research was conducted. The review was guided by a literature review outline and inspired by a thematic analysis. It encompasses 24 empirical articles published between 1983 and 2012 inclusive. The researchers who involved childrenâ€™s responses in their research obtained the data by adopting traditional data collection methods such as interviews, observations and questionnaires, and by adopting innovative data collection methods such as visualisations, writing, child-directed tours and informal discussions. The researchers offered special support to children with disabilities or special educational needs which created opportunities for those children to opinion-share. The special support was relational and material such as assistance from an adult or peer, the use of picture symbols and child preferences, and the exclusion of difficult questions. Implications for theory and practice are offered.
