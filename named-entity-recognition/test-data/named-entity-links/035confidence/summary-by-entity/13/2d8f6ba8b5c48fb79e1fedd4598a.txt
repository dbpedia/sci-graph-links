Abstract This study investigates early childhood prospective teachers’ attention to geometrical tasks while designing and using them in the classroom. This is explored in the context of the teaching practice of 11 prospective teachers who taught geometry in early childhood classrooms during the last semester of their university studies. The teaching practice was organized into four stages: design of a lesson plan; classroom implementation; discussion of the lesson with the school practice instructor; and self-assessment report and revision of the lesson. Analysis of data using the Teaching Triad framework (Jaworski, 1994) shows that although the prospective teachers attended to issues of mathematical challenge, sensitivity to students, and management of learning in their planning, in their actual teaching and after class reflection, their attention was focused mainly on management issues. The findings also show that prospective teachers’ attention on geometrical tasks can be developed through a process of reflection on their teaching.
