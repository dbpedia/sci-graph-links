A computational and experimental assessment of the sensitivity of structural materials to stress concentration under high-cycle asymmetrical loading by tensionâ€“compression, bending, and torsion has been performed. A proposed limiting state model is used in the solution. A satisfactory agreement of the calculation results with the experimental data has been obtained.
