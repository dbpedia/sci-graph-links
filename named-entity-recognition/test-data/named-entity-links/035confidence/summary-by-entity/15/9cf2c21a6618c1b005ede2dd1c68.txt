Abstract The opportunities of the information age present a real challenge to business management today. To meet this challenge, and to realize the true benefits of information technology, management must get involved and provide leadership in defining the business direction for an enterprise. It is through this involvement that the enterprise can apply technology to make the maximum impact on how business is conducted. Major information system development projects at General Dynamics Fort Worth will impact the way product definition data is managed and provide an example of how information technology can change the way we do business.
