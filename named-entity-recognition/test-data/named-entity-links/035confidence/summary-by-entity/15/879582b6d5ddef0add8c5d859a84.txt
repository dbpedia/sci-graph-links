Abstract Six papers drawing on Hirschman's (1970) Exit, Voice, and Loyalty model are discussed with regard to two themes: (a) relationship to the original work (specifically focusing on variations in the definition and operationalization of the “loyalty” component), and (b) the development of the loyalty construct itself. A concerted effort is called for to pursue a better understanding of loyalty, including an improved appreciation of the depth and breadth of the construct, its antecedents and outcomes, and its operationalizations in organizational settings.
