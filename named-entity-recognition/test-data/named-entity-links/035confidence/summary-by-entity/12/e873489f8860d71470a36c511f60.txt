Abstract The architectural design and construction of a new imaging department is one of the most complex challenges in healthcare architecture. When a client also plans a simultaneous change in basic operating system technology from film-based to filmless imaging, the challenge for both hospital management and the facility/technology design team is even more complicated. A purposeful planning process plus a carefully composed team of internal and external experts are the two essentials for success in executing this difficult conversion of both facility and technology.
