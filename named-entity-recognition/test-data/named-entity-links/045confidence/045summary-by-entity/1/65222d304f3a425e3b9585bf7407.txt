Summary. We study the asymptotic behaviour of disconnection and non-intersection exponents for planar Brownian motionwhen the number of considered paths tends to infinity. In particular, if η n (respectively ξ (n, p)) denotes the disconnection exponent for n paths (respectively the non-intersection exponent for n paths versus p paths), then we show that lim n →∞ η n /n = 1 2 and that for a > 0 and b > 0,lim n →∞ ξ ([na],[nb])/n = (√ a + √ b) 2 /2.
