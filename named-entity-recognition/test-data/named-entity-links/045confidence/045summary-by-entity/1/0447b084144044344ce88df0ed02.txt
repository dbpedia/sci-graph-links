Abstract The goal of the present work is to find all the possible objects Ïˆ which transform linearly and intransitively under arbitrary transformations of coordinates in an x-space. As a result of these investigations it was established that there exist, in all, three types of geometric entities: transors, tensors, and M-objects. While transors and tensors are described by a finite number of components, M-objects are described only by an infinite number of components. 1 is found that some dimensionality constant of length plays an important role in the transformation properties of M-objects.
