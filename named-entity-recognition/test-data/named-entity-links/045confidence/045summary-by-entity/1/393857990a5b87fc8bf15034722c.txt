Abstract Formulas for computing the Cartesian components of the static (DC) fields of horizontal electric dipoles (HEDs) and vertical electric dipoles (VEDs) located in the central zone of a three-layer horizontally stratified medium are derived and presented in a summary form suitable for immediate computation. Formulas are given for the electric and magnetic field components in the upper and central regions. In the general case the computation involves the summation of a convergent infinite series. For the particular case of an infinitely thick central region (corresponding to the twolayer problem), the analysis produces relatively simple closed-form equations for the field components which are suitable for a ‘hand calculation’. Specimen calculations for dipoles in seawaters are included and the derived results are compared with computations made using an ac model.
