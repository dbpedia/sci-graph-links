Abstract. The Schrödinger equation of a two-dimensional three-electron quantum dot has been solved accurately. Features of the structures of low-lying states have been extracted from the wave functions. The states are classified according to their geometric characters and their internal modes of motion. The effect of symmetry is emphasized. Rotation bands have been found.
