Summary A numerical solution for the three dimensional transient motion of a marine cable during installation is presented for the case of a cable laying vessel arbitrarily chaning speed and direction while paying out cable with seabed slack. The cable transient behaviour is governed by the numerical solution of a set of non-linear partial differential equations with the solution methodology incorporating both spatial and temporal integration. The space integration is carried out by dividing the cable inton straight elements with equilibrium relationships and geometric compatibility equations satisfied for each element. The position of each element is described by its elevation and azimuth angles and, therefore, a system of 2n non-linear ordinary differential equations is established. The time integration of this set of equations is performed using a high order Runge-Kutta technique. Results are presented fro the cable tension and element elevation and azimuth angles as functions of time and for transient cable geometries when the cable ship executes horizontal planar manoeuvres.
