Abstract In defense of Europe. A crucial, not openly revealed and analyzed aspect of the 2Â years crisis affecting the world economy, financial system, labour market, welfare and development is the fact that impact had not been a wave affecting all the main areas and regions in the same way. The emerging countries were not hit as we were supposing, Europe managed quite well the governance of the macroeconomic and financial impact of the earthquake coming from the USA, Russia has shown to be very vulnerable to external negative factors, innovative countries have reached the highest developments of R&D and ranking worldwide. The Great European world region (EU 27 plus almost other 20 neighboring countries) has shown a better capability to operate, via the European Central Bank, in a counter policy against the negative financial cycle policy than expected. FDIs were lagging but M&A were still quite robust. Eastern countries, by the way, showed capabilities to overcome unbalances and worst fall outs of the real economy recession. Social implications were quite severe but even so not as much as predicted in January 2009. The paper intends to demonstrate that Europe is now becoming the main international player and competitor in the 2020 worldwide competition.
