In the present study, the effect of the polyurethane foam-filled lattice core sandwich panel on the energy absorption and the compression strength was investigated. In the compression tests, it was found that the foam-filled sandwich panels have a greater load-carrying capacity compared to the sum of the unfilled specimens and the filled polyurethane block. Moreover, the energy absorption efficiency of foam-filled sandwich panels with higher relative density (5.1 and 5.7%) lattice cores was lower than that of the unfilled specimen when the compressive strain was small, whereas it was superior when the compressive strain reached about 0.1, and this superiority became more pronounced with the strain increase. Moreover, the energy absorption of foam-filled sandwich panels with lower relative density (4.43%) lattice cores was superior to that of the unfilled specimen.
