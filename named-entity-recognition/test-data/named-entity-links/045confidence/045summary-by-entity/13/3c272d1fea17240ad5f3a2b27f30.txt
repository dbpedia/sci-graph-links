Abstract A sound system of competent measurements, underpinned by standards and accreditation, is an essential component of the infrastructure of any modern society. Proficiency Testing is an indispensible tool for developing and maintaining this infrastructure. It is used to verify compliance with standards, for ongoing monitoring of laboratory performance, for demonstration of competence, and for evaluating the performance of measurement procedures; it is used to indicate performance problems that might not be detected otherwise; and it is used as a tool for education and self-improvement. The new International Standard, ISO/IEC 17043, contains requirements and recommendations to make optimal use of this important tool.
