Abstract This study examines adult students enrolled in pipe trades preapprenticeship training to identify distinguishing features of the mathematical activity within their program and sources of their mathematics-related difficulties. Two closely related sociocultural perspectives, specifically cultural historical activity theory and the theory of knowledge objectification, frame this investigation. Like workplace mathematics practices reported elsewhere, mathematics within this preapprenticeship program was inextricably tied to the efficient production of objects of workplace activity, in this case, the design and fabrication of a limited number of well-defined objects of pipe trades production. This form of mathematical activity was also mediated intensely by semiotic tools and norms of practice specific to the pipe trades. The contribution of this study is the finding that the great majority of the mathematics difficulties encountered by students can be attributed to their novice levels of awareness of the objects of pipe trades production and related ways of working rather than the mathematics understandings that they brought to this endeavor. Implications are identified for the teaching of mathematics in skilled trades training generally, developing studentsâ€™ mathematical subjectivities within trades training, and the mathematics preparation of secondary school students who will be entering skilled trades. Questions are also raised for further research.
