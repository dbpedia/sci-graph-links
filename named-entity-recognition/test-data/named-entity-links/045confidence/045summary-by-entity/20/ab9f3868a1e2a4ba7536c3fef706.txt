A TG relationship between mass and temperature is derived on the basis of migration behavior of bubbles generated in bulk of sample system, and superposed on that derived on the basis of kinetics of the 4\\super th\\nosupersub order event, which is superposed on the experimental TG data obtained from three reference papers. This suggests that these TG data are reflecting migration of bubbles. A dependence of TG behavior on heating rate, which is contrary to usual that, is shown and is explained in terms of event-rate determination by boiling. \\par }
