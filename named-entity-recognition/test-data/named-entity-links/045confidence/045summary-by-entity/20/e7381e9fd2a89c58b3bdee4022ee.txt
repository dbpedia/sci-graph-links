Summary Due to the criticism of the non-isothermal kinetic at a single heating rate, in the last period, data obtained at different heating rates are processed by means of elevated methods like Friedmanâ€™s (FD) differential-isoconversional method or the one suggested by Budrugeac and Segal (BS). The non-parametric kinetics (NPK) method, suggested by Serra, Nomen and Sempere offers two major advantages: the possibility of separation of two or more steps of a complex decomposition reaction; and the possibility of discrimination between the conversion, with regard to the temperature functions of a rate equation. Comparative data of FD, BS and modified version of NPK method are presented for decomposition of three compounds used as polyisocyanate stabilizer.
