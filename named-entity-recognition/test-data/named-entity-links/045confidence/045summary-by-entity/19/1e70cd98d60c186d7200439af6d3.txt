Abstract Teaching to meet the diverse learning needs of twenty-first century, global learners can be challenging, yet a growing body of research points to the proved successes of arts-infused and integrated curricula, especially for building capacity for learning and motivation. This article presents the ArtsIN: Arts Integration and Infusion framework, a both/and approach to arts-based learning. This means that it incorporates both arts infused learning essential for process and skill development in an art form, such as art disciplines of visual arts, dance, drama, music and media arts and integrated learning experiences embedded in children’s daily experience to generate rich meaningful cognitive connections to other disciplines into the classroom. Section “WHY ARTS? Key Concepts to Support an ArtsIN Framework” details four key concepts of the framework: global universality, embodiment, arts as multi-literacies and language, and the value of arts for advancing development. The mind–body connection of the arts to understand human interactions is explained through the capacities of five aesthetic operations—repetition, formalization, dynamic variation, and surprise. Section “ HOW ARTS? Implementing an ArtsIN Framework” provides examples and explains how arts infusion and integration can be implemented in early childhood settings through dynamic teacher roles as artist, researcher, designer, co-constructor, and advocate to meet students’ learning needs while connecting and collaborating with diverse cultural contexts that include families, artists, and community.
