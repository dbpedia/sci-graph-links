Abstract This paper describes how the creative arts can provide an alternative approach to computer programming that may benefit students in the humanities in general. It focuses on creative arts projects using text, graphics and music that allow students to encounter the same programming concepts from a number of different perspectives. It also discusses the importance of symbolic programming for the arts and how the creative arts can provide a particularly rich environment for developing approaches to object-oriented programming.
