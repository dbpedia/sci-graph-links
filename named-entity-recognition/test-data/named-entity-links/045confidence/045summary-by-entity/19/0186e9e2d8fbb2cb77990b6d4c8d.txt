Abstract One of a collection of six scholarly essays solicited by this journal to celebrate the first half-century of the American Dance Therapy Association, this paper looks at current practices in dance therapy education, clinical practice, and professional leadership as inclusive of, or excluding to, individuals who identify as a person of color. Recommendations for more inclusive attitudes and practices are provided.
