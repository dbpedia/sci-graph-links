Abstract The correlation between film and dream has an extensive theoretical basis in both cognitive science and cinematic literature. Biographical and autobiographical reports from film makers document antidotal descriptions of the use of dream in creative aspects of screen writing, acting and directing film. However, no systematic or analytic approach has been used in the attempt to document dream utilization in film making. Film makers attending the Sundance Film Institute Screenwriter and Director Labs from 1995-7 were asked to complete a previously validated questionnaire regarding dream recall and incorporation into a spectrum of awake behaviors. Compared to a previous general population study, all responses to questions assessing reported dream effects on awake behaviors and recall were significantly higher for the film makers. An in-group study of film makers found that reported dream recall and effects on waking behavior for the Creative group (Directors, Screen writers, Actors) were significantly higher than for the Working group (Crew). Responses from the Professional Group (Producers, Editors and Cinematographers) were intermediate. Within the Creative Group, reported specific dream effects on behavior varied significantly with creative role.
