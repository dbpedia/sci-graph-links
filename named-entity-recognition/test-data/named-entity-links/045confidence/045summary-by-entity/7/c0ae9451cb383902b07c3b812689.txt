Abstract Large fires and their impacts are a growing concern as changes in climate and land use proceed. The study of large-fire controls remains incipient in comparison with other components of the fire regime. Improved understanding of large-fire size drivers can disclose fire–landscape relationships and inform more sustainable and effective fire management. We used boosted regression tree modeling to identify the variables influent on large-fire size (100–23,219 ha, n = 609) in Portugal (1998–2008) and quantify their relative importance, globally and across the fire-size range. Potential explanatory variables included metrics pertaining to fire weather and antecedent rainfall, burned area composition, fuel connectivity, pyrodiversity (from fire recurrence patterns), topography, and land development. Large fires seldom occurred in the absence of severe fire weather. The fire-size model accounted for 70% of the deviance and included 12 independent variables, of which six absorbed 91% of the explanation. Bottom-up influences on fire size, essentially fuel-related, largely outweighed climate–weather influences, with respective importance of 85 and 15%. Fire size was essentially indifferent to land-cover composition, including forest type, and increased with high fuel connectivity and low pyrodiversity. Relevant synergies between variables were found, either positive or negative, for example, high pyrodiversity buffered the effects of extreme weather on fire size. The relative role of fire-size drivers did not vary substantially with fire size, but fires larger than 500 ha were increasingly controlled by fuel-related variables. The extent of an individual large fire is mainly a function of factors that land-use planning and forest and fuel management can tackle.
