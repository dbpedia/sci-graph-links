Abstract  Internal audits inherently effect quality improvement, and concrete results can be expected by careful planning. As audits should improve the quality system in situ, the development of audits should not be neglected. ISO/IEC 17025 describes the objectives of internal audits and management reviews in more detail compared to the former standards EN 45001 and ISO/IEC Guide 25, although the main features are unchanged. This addresses continuous surveillance of the current practice. A brief questionnaire on vertical audits was distributed to 74 of 120 employees at a Finnish private medical laboratory, Medix Laboratories Ltd. A positive feed-back was received from the current management of audits. However, the study revealed that continuous supervision of audits is needed. Many employees were not willing to perform audits if they had no previous experience. Additionally, audits performed at the workbench were not considered as the best possible for fruitful discussions.
