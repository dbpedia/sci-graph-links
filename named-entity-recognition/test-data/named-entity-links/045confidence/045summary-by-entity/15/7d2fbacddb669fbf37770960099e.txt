Abstract The United States Sentencing Commission promulgated federal organizational sentencing guidelines in 1991. The final product eroded the guidelines’ original severity, as drafts were rejected over a period of 4 years. The initial goal of the Commission was to implement organizational guidelines that were on par with individual-level sanctions in order to remove any suggestion that powerful corporations receive lesser penalties than individuals convicted of “street crimes”. This study analyzes the erosion of the Commission’s stated goal by evaluating the organizational structures, individual and group characteristics, and the social, political, economic, and historical contexts involved in the evolution of federal sentencing guidelines for organizations. Results indicate that, while structural-level variables played a large part in explaining the development of the guidelines, a more accurate and complete understanding of this process is possible by including an analysis of the individual-level characteristics of Commissioners, including their professional backgrounds, ideological perspectives, styles of leadership, and future goals.
