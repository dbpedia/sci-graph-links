Abstract This article reviews and critiques the literature covering the functions, structure, and viability of the nonunion grievance procedure. The authors give several arguments in support of their position that the benefits outweigh the costs of such a procedure for unorganized staff whether viewed in terms of society, the employee, or the labor market parties. Next the article briefly summarizes the empirical literature reporting on the operation of nonunion grievance procedures in a number of private-sector firms. These results are linked to the two conceptual models of an effective grievance procedure advanced by Yenney and Epstein. The authors, based on their assessment of organizational practice, identify several potential and real problems with the presently operating nonunion grievance systems in most American firms. Finally, the article concludes with a set of research propositions that systematically address both the current criticisms of the viability of such a procedure and whether most grievance procedures covering unorganized employees meet the standards of due process and organizational justice generally found in union grievance systems.
