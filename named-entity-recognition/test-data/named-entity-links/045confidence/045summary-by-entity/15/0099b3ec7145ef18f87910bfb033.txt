Conclusion Although there is an extensive research literature on union mergers, our research agenda points to some fundamental questions that remain unanswered. Research on mergers has evolved without a common direction or unifying theories and propositions. Investigators rarely replicate or extend each otherâ€™s work in articles, books, and dissertations. Interpretations of the dynamics of union mergers and conclusions about merger trends are not being critically appraised at conferences. There is no consensus among researchers on issues beyond the fundamental reasons for mergers and the forms of mergers. The result of all of this is that the research community that has little to offer legislators trying to regulate union merger activity, federation officers proposing merger policies or trying to fit mergers into their prescriptions for union revival, union officers and staff considering merger invitations, and union members evaluating claims made during merger campaigns.
