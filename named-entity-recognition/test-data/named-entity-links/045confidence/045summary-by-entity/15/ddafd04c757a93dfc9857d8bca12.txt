Abstract Let {X n } be a Markov chain with transition probability $$p_{ij} = a_{j - (i - 1)^ + } ,\\forall i,j \\geqslant 0$$, where a j = 0 provided j < 0, a 0 > 0, a 0 + a 1 < 1 and Σ n=0∞ a n = 1. Let µ = Σ n=1∞ na n . It is known that {X n } is positive recurrent when µ < 1; is null recurrent when µ = 1; and is transient when µ > 1. In this paper, the integrability of the first returning time and the last exit time are discussed.
