Abstract This article identifies personal factors that influence group home employeesâ€™ attitudes towards the sexuality of individuals with disabilities. Seventy-one individuals currently employed in group homes in a single state in the United States completed two surveys: a demographics survey and the Attitudes to Sexuality Questionnaire-Individuals with an Intellectual Disability. Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests due to the non-normal nature of the data. Results indicate that having an in-service training on sexuality has a positive influence on attitudes towards sexuality for individuals with an intellectual disability. In addition, personal factors (having an immediate family member with an intellectual disability, gender) also influenced attitudes towards sexuality and intellectual disability. However, data suggested no relationship between age or level of education and attitudes towards sexuality and intellectual disability. This study provides new information about factors that influence attitudes towards the sexuality of individuals with intellectual disabilities. It also provides data to support previous research on the topic.
