Abstract. In this paper we model the population dynamics of the worm Nais elinguis, which reproduces by division into two unequal parts. By using renewal theory we derive the asymptotic behaviour of a Naidis elinguis population. In particular we prove a certain relation between the fraction of the population that was born small (respectively the fraction that was born large) and the inter-division times.
