Abstract Cloud storage is an important cloud computing service, it allows data users to store and access their files anytime, from anywhere and with any device. To ensure the security of the outsourced data, it also must allow data user to periodically verify integrity of the data which was outsourced to an untrusted cloud server at a relatively low cost. To solve this problem, most recent auditing protocols are mainly based on the traditional-public key infrastructure. In this infrastructure, the auditor must validate the certificates of data user before auditing data integrity. Thus, it results in a large amount of computation cost and is not suitable to the multi-user setting. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose two efficient ID-based public auditing protocols for the outsourced data by combing Water’s signature and public auditing for the outsourced data. And the two protocols are provably secure in the standard security model. Especially, our optimized protocol has constant communication overhead and computation cost. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first ID-based auditing for data integrity in the standard security model. By comparison with Wang et al.’s scheme and Tan et al.’s scheme, our protocols have the large advantages over the other two schemes in terms of communication cost and computation cost. Simulation results show that our proposed ID-based auditing protocols are the most efficient among three schemes in terms of computation cost.
