Abstract In this work we define the notion of a mapf:X→Y to be ann-equivalence modulo a classC of groups. Then we show an equivalent condition, which is more close to a homological condition, in order to a mapf:X→Y to be ann-equivalence modulo a classC of groups. Finally, at least for a complexK which is finite and is a suspension of a connected space, the notion above is also given in terms of the mapf #: [K, X]→[K, Y].
