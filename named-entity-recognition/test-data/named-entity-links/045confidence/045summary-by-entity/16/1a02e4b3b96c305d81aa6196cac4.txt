Abstract Consumer cooperatives were born together with industrial capitalism and its social classes, being a reaction against miserable economic conditions and disgracefully low positions of farmers and workers. Nowadays, the traditional, class-based motives have lost their importance, but still many consumers are attracted by consumer cooperatives and each year numerous consumers stand for election to the committees of consumer cooperatives. A recent survey amongst newly elected and newly retired committee members in Denmark reveals three major motivating factors: cooperative ideology, survival of local shops, and nutrition. Therefore it seems wise for consumer cooperatives to emphasize activities related to these motives, and by doing so they may eventually succeed in their search for a new identity.
