Abstract We prove that the Katětov order on Borel ideals (1) contains a copy of 𝓟(ω)/Fin $\\mathcal {P}(\\omega )/\\mathbf {Fin}$, consequently it has increasing and decreasing chains of lenght 𝔟; (2) the sequence F i n α (α < ω 1) is a strictly increasing chain; and (3) in the Cohen model, Katětov order does not contain any increasing nor decreasing chain of length 𝔠, answering a question of Hrušák (2011).
