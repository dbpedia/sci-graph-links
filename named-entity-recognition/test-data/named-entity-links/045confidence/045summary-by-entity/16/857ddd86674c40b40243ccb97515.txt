Abstract Parental participation in schools has become a goal for many principals in light of theoretical and empirical work suggesting that increased school-parent interaction can result in significant educational benefits. This study examined the principal-parent relationship in three types of schools: those serving a homogeneous high-SES parent clientele, a heterogeneous middle-SES parent clientele, and a homogeneous low-SES parent clientele. The main question posed in this paper is whether the principal-parent relationship in schools with a heterogeneous parent clientele differs from the relationships in homogeneous schools, regardless of social class, or whether social class is the determining factor in the principal-parent relationship. Discriminant analysis of 250 elementary school principals indicated two significant functions: one according to the social class of the parents and the other according to the homogeneity of the parent clientele. The differences in the relationships, as suggested by the significant discriminating variables, are in the areas of parental involvement, the organization of parent groups, and principals' response strategies to this involvement. The results suggest how principals interact with different types of parents to capitalize on areas where parents can help without allowing excessive interference in the school's functioning.
