Abstract This paper explores the function of transportation in modern urban life, and suggests the more active use of transportation investment planning as a tool for advancing urban planning objectives other than the satisfaction of estimated travel demand. Since unrestrained supply of transportation facilities to meet projected desires appears to be likely to fail both in environmental preservation and the long-term satisfaction of travel demand, strategies for reduction and redirection of that demand are emphasized.
