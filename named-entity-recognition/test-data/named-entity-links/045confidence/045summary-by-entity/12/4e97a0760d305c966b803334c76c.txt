Conclusion Jet geotechnology has entered construction practice and has prospects of wider use. According to the information about the works performed by various organizations — from wide practical use to research and development — the following aspects of using jet geotechnology in construction are known: jet grouting, by means of which various geotechnical problems are solved, including the construction of grout curtains, stabilization of soils, creation of supporting and retaining members in the foundations of structures and in the construction of underground structures; excavation of frozen ground by forming workings of various purposes (for supports, for uncovering places of damage to underground supply lines, etc.) or separating the ground into blocks with their subsequent removal by earthmoving or underground mechanisms; construction of various types of drainage, increasing the operating efficiency of water wells; compaction of collapsing soils by soaking, including with the use of limiting the sections being compacted by cuts; trenchless laying of pipelines and other supply lines. In addition to this, jet geotechnology is used in mining, for instance, for mining sandy soils. Jet geotechnology can be used both as an independent type of work and together with other technologies. Compared with alternative methods, jet geotechnology has a number of technical and economic advantages such as high output, mobility of equipment, possibility of conducting works both during new construction and in the foundations of existing structures, and in a number of cases unique problems can be solved with the use of this technology. All this permits hoping for the wide use and development of jet geotechnology in construction.
