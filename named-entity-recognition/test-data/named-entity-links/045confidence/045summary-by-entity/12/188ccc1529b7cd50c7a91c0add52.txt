Abstract People living in the villages located in the west of the city of Mashhad 1,400–1,900 m above sea level immigrate to cities much more than other villages because they are located in valleys and mountainous regions. The research done on 200 families from seven villages shows that these villages are faced with a shortage of flat land suitable for farming and other activities and as a result the villagers, specially the youth, having no job as a source of income, have to emigrate to cities. With the young force leaving the villages and shortage of means of production, the villages are now faced with a population decrease. In some cases, the villages have been totally abandoned in spite of the fact that they have the potential for economic activities specially tourism. By planning and actualizing the potential of these villages, it is possible to create jobs and return the villagers or to prevent further emigration.
