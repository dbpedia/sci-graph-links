Abstract The act of rape violates two deeply held values of American culture: the right to justice and the right of physical integrity. Despite this fact, thousands of women are raped each year. The victim of rape often becomes the target of blame; in one aspect or another she is held accountable for her victimization. Through the use of rape myths, which are grounded in patriarchal expectations of gender role behavior, our culture unites the apparently dichotomous opposites of the rights to justice and physical integrity. While rape myths have received extensive attention from behaviorists, their communication through the mass media has been ignored. This study focuses on the use of, and opposition to, rape myths in prime-time television dramas, as well as discusses the implications of those depictions.
