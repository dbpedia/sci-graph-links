Summary A temperature departure index utilizing mean monthly temperatures for the period 1940â€“1983 is established for all months of the year. Using 193 sites divided into ten regions across the contiguous United States, index values show that December 1983 was the most unusual December for all but the Southwest and the three easternmost regions. In fact, the December 1983 conditions were the most extreme for any month of the year in the 44-year period for the Central and Southern Rockies/High Plains regions and the second most unusual for the Northern Plains and South Central regions. Of the 5280 index values calculated for the ten regions for all months over the 44-year period, December 1983 accounted for four of the top 20 values including the single highest value (which occurred in the Central region).
