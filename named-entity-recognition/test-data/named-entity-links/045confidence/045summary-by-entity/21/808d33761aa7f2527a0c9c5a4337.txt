Abstract Military families experience considerable stress, periods of long separation, and changes to the family system due to family members planning to enter a war zone, actively living in a war zone, and reuniting after being in a war zone. Anticipation and understanding of the stages of deployment improves family, couple and individual functioning. The issues that the family and the couple are confronting at each stage of deployment: pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment are presented. Clinical interventions for the family and the couple are presented at each stage of deployment. Additionally, the impact of the service memberâ€™s war time experience on the family, couple, and her/himself is discussed.
