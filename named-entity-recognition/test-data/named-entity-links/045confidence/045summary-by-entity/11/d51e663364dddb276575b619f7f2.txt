Abstract Ocular pain and related symptoms are frequent manifestations of primary and secondary headache disorders. Neurologists are often the first physician to evaluate patients affected by these clinical features. The cause of eye pain may be attributed both to pathological disorders with abnormal neurologic and neuro-ophthalmologic findings and to diseases with no apparent eye disturbances. A thorough clinical approach is necessary for an appropriate diagnosis and a correct specific management.
