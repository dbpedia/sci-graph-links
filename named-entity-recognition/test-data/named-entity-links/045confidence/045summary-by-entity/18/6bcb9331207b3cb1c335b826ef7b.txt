Abstract The problem is examined of tracing a generic curve following a preassigned law of motion. A method is proposed, enabling the user to obtain this result provided the curve—and the law of motion—are described by means of two listsX i andY i. This general method is applied to two particular cases. First, a linear interpolator is described: two possible implementations are suggested. An algorithm is then presented, allowing to generate conics by means of adding operations only; the algo-rithm can lead to the realization of a second-order interpolator.
