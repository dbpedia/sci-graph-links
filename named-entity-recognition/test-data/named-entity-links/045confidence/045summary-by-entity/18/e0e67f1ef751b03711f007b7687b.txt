Abstract We consider the height process of a Lévy process with no negative jumps, and its associated continuous tree representation. Using Lévy snake tools developed by Le Gall-Le Jan and Duquesne-Le Gall, with an underlying Poisson process, we construct a fragmentation process, which in the stable case corresponds to the self-similar fragmentation described by Miermont. For the general fragmentation process we compute a family of dislocation measures as well as the law of the size of a tagged fragment. We also give a special Markov property for the snake which is of its own interest.
