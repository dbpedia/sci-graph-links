AbstractThe compensation law in polymer relaxations is briefly reviewed along with some transition state theories often used in that context. Some experimental data illustrating the compensation law in some polymers are shown. A modified Kramers equation is proposed to explain the compensation law and it is shown that the compensation temperature corresponds to the limits of two different friction regimes in one given relaxation. The possible relation with multi-excitation entropy theory is also discussed. Graphical abstract
