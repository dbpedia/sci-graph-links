The proposed architecture utilizes a class of optimal extension fields (OEF) GF(q m ) where the field characteristic is a Mersenne prime q = 2 n  − 1 and m = n. The main advantage of our architecture is that it achieves extension field modular multiplication in the discrete Fourier domain with only a linear number of base field GF(q) multiplications in addition to a quadratic number of simpler operations such as addition and bitwise rotation. We achieve an area between 25k and 50k equivalent gates for the implementations over OEFs of size 169, 289 and 361 bits. With its low area and high speed, the proposed architecture is well suited for ECC in small device environments such as sensor networks. The work at hand presents the first hardware implementation of a frequency domain multiplier suitable for ECC and the first hardware implementation of ECC in the frequency domain." .

On the one hand, they aim for the interworking and integration of classical telecommunications and data communications services. On the other, they are focusing on universal service access from a variety of end-user systems. Many of the technical problems, resulting from the service integration, and service personalisation have been solved during the last years. However, all these systems are driven by the concept of providing several technologies to users by keeping the peculiarity of each service.  Looking at humans’ communication behaviour and their communication space, it is obvious that human beings interact habitually in a set of contexts with their environment. The individual information preferences and needs, persons to interact with, and the set of devices controlled by each individual define their personal communication space. Following this view, a new approach is to build communication systems not on the basis of specific technologies, but on the analysis of the individual communication spaces. The result is a communication system adapted to the demands of each individual (I-centric). The communication system will act on behalf of users’ demands, reflecting recent actions to enable profiling and self-adaptation to contexts and situations.  In this paper, we introduce I-centric Communications, an approach to design communication systems that adapt themselves to the individual communication space and individual environment and situation. In this context “I” means I, or individual, “Centric” means adaptable to I requirements and a certain user environment." .

The SIP protocol is insecure for being an open text-based protocol inherently. Different solutions have been presented in the last decade to secure the protocol. Recently, Zhang et al. authentication protocol has been proposed with a sound feature that authenticates the users without any password-verifier database using smart card. However, the scheme has a few limitations and can be made more secure and optimized regarding cost of exchanged messages, with a few modifications. Our proposed key-agreement protocol makes a use of two server secrets for robustness and is also capable of authenticating the involved parties in a single round-trip of exchanged messages. The server can now authenticate the user on the request message received, rather than the response received upon sending the challenge message, saving another round-trip of exchanged messages and hence escapes a possible denial of service attack." .

However, the HARQ mechanism neither retransmits the packet to the receiver in time when the packet cannot be recovered by the FEC scheme nor dynamically adjusts the number of FEC redundant packets according to network conditions. In this paper, the Adaptive Hybrid Error Correction Model (AHECM) is proposed to improve the HARQ mechanism. The AHECM can limit the packet retransmission delay to the most tolerable end-to-end delay. Besides, the AHECM can find the appropriate FEC parameter to avoid network congestion and reduce the number of FEC redundant packets by predicting the effective packet loss rate. Meanwhile, when the end-to-end delay requirement can be met, the AHECM will only retransmit the necessary number of redundant FEC packets to receiver in comparison with legacy HARQ mechanisms. Furthermore, the AHECM can use an Unequal Error Protection to protect important multimedia frames against channel errors of wireless networks. Besides, the AHECM uses the Markov model to estimate the burst bit error condition over wireless networks. The AHECM is evaluated by several metrics such as the effective packet loss rate, the error recovery efficiency, the decodable frame rate, and the peak signal to noise ratio to verify the efficiency in delivering video streaming over wireless networks." .

Most would agree that security and privacy have both a crucial role to play toward this goal. In this context, the current paper revolves around a key question: Do modern mobile applications respect the privacy of the end-user? The focus is on the iPhone platform security and especially on user’s data privacy. By the implementation of a DNS poisoning malware and two real attack scenarios on the popular Siri and Tethering services, we demonstrate that the privacy of the end-user is at stake." .

The most important need for WSNs is energy efficient routing protocol that consumes optimal energy. It provides extension to the network’s life period. Nowadays a number of energy efficient routing protocols are proposed by various researchers in WSNs. However, security and energy efficiency in data collection and transmission in WSNs should be simultaneously considered for security challenges and to overcome limitation of WSNs. In this paper, we propose a new and effective routing protocol named, “Intelligent Energy Aware Secured Algorithm for Routing (IEASAR)” which is secure by using a Trust based approach and is Energy efficient at the same time. For this purpose, a new energy efficient protocol using Fuzzy C-means has been proposed in this paper. Moreover, a modified minimum spanning tree approach is applied here to identify the minimum distance path between the sender node and the destination node and hence an optimal and secured routing path is selected. Extensive simulations have been conducted in this work to verify the validity of our claims." .

Our video content indexing method consists in computing trends of behaviors of points of interest and then to assign them a label of behavior. Two methods are proposed to assign the labels: one uses heuristic tresholds and the other one uses a clustering algorithm. Such an indexing approach has several interesting properties: it provides a rich, compact and generic description, while labels of behavior provide a high-level description of the video content. A dedicated online retrieval method for copy detection is described, compared and evaluated on a large video database (1,000 h). This evaluation is done on a framework proposed for video copy detection: ViCopT displays excellent robustness to various severe signal transformations and the ability to accurately identify copies from highly similar videos. Other evaluation focuses on the flexibility of ViCopT due to the asymmetry of the video description. This allow the system to be highly scalable and very flexible regarding the situation faced: searching for copies on the internet or monitoring TV stream." .

The protocol allows each host to update the data it previously submitted in a way that is suitable for free competition scenarios like comparative shopping or distributed auction and for highly dynamic environments like stock markets. The set of hosts can be visited several times in random order and a short message digest allows for the integrity verification of all the collected data." .

On-demand routing protocol such as AODV may suffer from frequent topological changes. Due to frequent communication failures, multipath MANET is preferred than single-path MANET in many applications as former is used for achieving robustness and load balancing and improving reliability. Although multipath MANET is attractive solution, there are still some major flaws that prevent commercial growth. Security is one of these main barriers; MANETs are known to be particularly vulnerable to security attack. The paper presents a design of robust and secure framework for multipath MANET. In this paper, we propose not only a robust multipath routing protocol but also an extended security scheme. We discuss security analysis for proposed security scheme. And we also conduct simulation to evaluate such a framework through different performance metrics. Results show that the proposed routing protocol achieves better performance in terms of various metrics than other protocols." .

The existing solutions can neither satisfy the privacy requirement nor have an effective message verification scheme on vehicles.

However, due to the characteristics of surveillance systems, e.g., resource constraints, diverse privacy requirements and large-scale network, the existing anonymity mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the problem of source-location privacy protection. There is an imbalance on network load and transmission latency for most of the existing anonymity schemes, which causes “funnel effect” and conflicts with anonymity. This paper proposes the dynamic optimal mix-ring-based source-location anonymity protocol, DORing. In this scheme, we first set the dynamic optimal mix-ring to collect and mix the network traffic, which can satisfy the diverse QoS requirements for all the packets. Secondly, we propose the sector-based anonymity assess to control the process of mixing in order to filter out the dummy packets and deliver the authentic packets to sink. Finally, the location of mix-ring is adjusted to balance network energy consumption, prolong the lifetime of the network and resist global attack. The simulation results demonstrate that DORing is very efficient in balancing energy consumption and transmission latency and can significantly prolong survival period of the network and ensure security as well as latency to satisfy the packets’ requirements." .

In addition, algorithms for so-called persistent and continuous variants of these queries are provided. The algorithms are based on the indexing of object positions represented as linear functions of time. The results of empirical performance experiments are reported." .

Extension of this principle with an additional iterative feedback loop to the demapping function has proven to provide substantial error performance gain at the cost of increased complexity. However, this complexity overhead constitutes commonly an obstacle for its consideration in real implementations. This article illustrates the opposite of what is commonly assumed and proposes a complexity adaptive iterative receiver performing iterative demapping with turbo decoding (TBICM-ID-SSD). Targeting identical error rate, the article shows that for certain system configurations TBICM-ID-SSD presents lower complexity than TBICM-SSD (without iterative demapping). This original result is obtained when considering the equivalent number of iterations through detailed analysis of the corresponding computational and memory access complexity. The analysis is conducted for different parameters in terms of modulation orders and code rates and independently from the architecture for a fair comparison. Considering the proposed adaptive receiver which is able to perform both TBICM-ID-SSD and TBICM-SSD modes, results demonstrate a reduced complexity with TBICM-SSD for high modulation orders. However, for low modulation orders as for QPSK, results show a reduction in arithmetic operations and read access memory up to 45.9% and 47%, respectively for using the TBICM-ID-SSD mode rather than TBICM-SSD performing six turbo decoding iterations over Rayleigh fading channel with erasures." .

Nonetheless, combining data from different sources could potentially reveal person-specific sensitive information. In VLDBJ 2006, Jiang and Clifton (Very Large Data Bases J (VLDBJ) 15(4):316–333, 2006) propose a secure Distributed k-Anonymity (DkA) framework for integrating two private data tables to a k-anonymous table in which each private table is a vertical partition on the same set of records. Their proposed DkA framework is not scalable to large data sets. Moreover, DkA is limited to a two-party scenario and the parties are assumed to be semi-honest. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to securely integrate private data from multiple parties (data providers). Our first algorithm achieves the k-anonymity privacy model in a semi-honest adversary model. Our second algorithm employs a game-theoretic approach to thwart malicious participants and to ensure fair and honest participation of multiple data providers in the data integration process.

In a video-on-demand (VOD) environment, disk arrays are often used to support the disk bandwidth requirement. This can pose serious problems on available disk bandwidth upon disk failure. In this paper, we explore the approach of replicating frequently accessed movies to provide high data bandwidth and fault tolerance required in a disk-array-based video server. An isochronous continuous video stream imposes different requirements from a random access pattern on databases or files. Explicitly, we propose a new replica placement method, called rotational mirrored declustering (RMD), to support high data availability for disk arrays in a VOD environment. In essence, RMD is similar to the conventional mirrored declustering in that replicas are stored in different disk arrays. However, it is different from the latter in that the replica placements in different disk arrays under RMD are properly rotated. Combining the merits of prior chained and mirrored declustering methods, RMD is particularly suitable for storing multiple movie copies to support VOD applications. To assess the performance of RMD, we conduct a series of experiments by emulating the storage and delivery of movies in a VOD system. Our results show that RMD consistently outperforms the conventional methods in terms of load-balancing and fault-tolerance capability after disk failure, and is deemed a viable approach to supporting replica placement in a disk-array-based video server." .

An on-board unit (OBU) is required to transfer data collected from sensors to the back-end server through various wireless networks, such as DSRC/WAVE, cellular networks, WiMAX, and WLAN/Wi-Fi. However, in any of such deployment, OBU should be equipped with an expensive transmitter. After transmitted to the server, those data can be further processed for many applications, such as automated traffic enforcement, Pay-as-You-Drive insurance, electronic toll pricing, and traffic statistics. Such raw data always contains vehicle and driver’s private information. Considering both cost and privacy concerns, we propose a new vehicle urban sensing infrastructure. Instead of deploying an expensive transmitter on OBU, we choose to use smartphone to transfer data through cellular network, which can be communicated with OBU equipped with a cheaper Bluetooth transmitter. To achieve privacy, we design an efficient protocol among OBU, smartphone, and back-end server by using some cryptographic techniques.

However, the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem, known as the the most popular and deployed public key algorithm, is still hardly implemented on embedded devices because of the intense computation required from its inherent arithmetic operations. Even though, different methods have being proposed for more efficient RSA implementations such as utilizing the Chinese remainder theorem, various modular exponentiation methods, and optimized modular arithmetic methods. In this paper, we propose an efficient multiplication for long integers on the sensor nodes equipped with 16-bit microcontrollers. Combined with this efficient multiplication, we obtain a faster Montgomery multiplication. The combined optimized Montgomery multiplication, the Chinese remainder theorem, and the m-ary exponentiation method allowed for execution times of less than 44.6 × 106 clock cycles for RSA decryption, a new speed record for the RSA implementation on MSP430 microcontrollers." .

In particular, the scalability of the reliable multicast mechanisms used for supporting the consistency of replicas is of crucial importance. Reliable multicast may propagate updates in a pre-defined order (e.g., FIFO, total or causal). Since total order needs more communication rounds than causal order, the latter appears to be the preferable candidate for achieving multicast scalability, although the consistency guarantees based on causal order are weaker than those of total order. This paper provides a historical survey of different scalability approaches for reliable causal multicast protocols." .

Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition or removal of storage devices to increase storage capacity and bandwidth or retire older devices. Assuming random placement of data objects across multiple storage devices of a storage pool, our optimization objective is to redistribute a minimum number of objects after scaling the pool. In addition, a uniform distribution, and hence a balanced load, should be ensured after redistribution. Moreover, the redistributed objects should be retrieved efficiently during the normal mode of operation: in one I/O access and with low complexity computation. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm called random disk labeling (RDL), based on double hashing, where storage can be added or removed without any increase in complexity. We compare RDL with other proposed techniques and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimentation." .

A secure cloud storage service has to satisfy five security requirements: consistency, ciphertext indistinguishability, trapdoor indistinguishability and resist off-line keyword guessing attacks (including off-line outside keyword guessing attack and off-line inside keyword guessing attack). Moreover, due to the characteristics of extended chaotic maps and session key establishment, which allow two communication parties to agree a common session key and the agreed session key is only known by the data sender and the authorized data receiver. Therefore, in this paper, we integrated the concept of session key establishment and extended chaotic maps into our proposed scheme which aims to resist the off-line keyword guessing attacks not only from the outside cloud attackers but also from an inside malicious cloud server. To the best of our knowledge, none of the recently proposed secure keyword search schemes can resist inside keyword guessing attacks and this work is the first attempt to provide a secure keyword search scheme without inside keyword guessing attacks in cloud storage services." .

However, the access structure of CP-ABE scheme is outsourced to the cloud storage server, resulting in the disclosure of access policy privacy. In addition, there are multiple authorities that coexist and each authority is able to issue attributes independently in the cloud storage system. However, existing CP-ABE schemes cannot be directly applied to data access control for multi-authority cloud storage system, due to the inefficiency for user revocation. In this paper, to cope with these challenges, we propose a decentralized multi-authority CP-ABE access control scheme, which is more practical for supporting the user revocation. In addition, this scheme can protect the data privacy and the access policy privacy with policy hidden in the cloud storage system. Here, the access policy that is realized by employing the linear secret sharing scheme. Finally, the security and performance analyses demonstrate that our scheme has high security in terms of access policy privacy and efficiency in terms of computational cost of user revocation." .

Many cryptographic schemes have been introduced for practical applications. In the multi-receiver encryption (MRE) scheme, a sender is allowed to generate the same ciphertext for a designed group of receivers. Any receiver can get the plaintext by decrypting the ciphertext; however, the real identity of receiver cannot be known by other receivers. Due to the above advantage, the MRE scheme can be used to protect the receiver’s privacy. Recently, the certificateless anonymous multi-receiver encryption (CLAMRE) scheme using the bilinear paring was introduced to solve the certificate management problem existing in MRE schemes based on the public key infrastructure and the private key escrow problem existing in MRE schemes based on identity-based cryptography. However, previous CLAMRE scheme using the bilinear paring is not suitable for mobile devices because the number of bilinear paring operations and Hash-to-Point (HTP) operations executed by the sender increases linearly as the increase of the receivers’ number. In this paper, an efficient CLAMRE scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography for mobile devices is proposed to improve performance. Because no bilinear paring or HTP operation is involved in the process of encryption, the proposed CLAMRE scheme has much less computation cost than the latest CLAMRE scheme. Security analysis shows the proposed CLAMRE scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model." .

In fact, we show that this extension is, in a sense to be made more precise later on, unique. Moreover, the structure of this class of UDMs allows us to answer some open conjectures by Tavildar, Viswanath, and Doshi in the positive, and it also allows us to formulate an efficient decoding algorithm for this class of UDMs. It turns out that our construction yields a coding scheme that is essentially equivalent to a class of codes that was proposed by Rosenbloom and Tsfasman.

In such an environment, the secondary M2M system intends to share the primary spectrum on the condition that the secondary transmitter (ST) has to relay the primary message. However, the ST is a low-energy device which adopts the energy harvesting technique to power itself. In particular, we focus on secure information transmission for the primary system when the secondary users (SUs) are the potential eavesdroppers. We aim to jointly design power splitting and secure beamforming to maximize the secondary M2M system data rate subject to the secrecy requirement of the primary system and the ST power constraint. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a computationally efficient two-stage optimization approach. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves a significant transmission rate of the secondary M2M system while provides a high secrecy rate for the primary system compared to the scheme without energy harvesting." .

In this paper, we propose a deviation-based query exchange (DQE) scheme that obfuscates the users’ query point to mitigate trajectory disclosure in mobile social networks (MSNs). The user finds a best matching user (BMU) in an MSN to exchange queries when a query request is issued. The DQE scheme can prevent the attacker from reconstructing the user’s trajectory by collecting data from the LBS server which records only the user’s ID and his BMUs’ locations (fake locations). By virtue of the private matching algorithm based on the matrix confusion, the DQE scheme allows LBS users to enjoy the service while preserving their privacy. In order to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme, we carried out extensive security and performance analyses under various conditions. The results of the experiments show that the proposed DQE scheme can protect users’ trajectory privacy effectively and reduce the overhead of the LBS server." .

However, existing techniques such as random perturbation do not fare well for simple yet widely used and efficient Euclidean distance-based mining algorithms. Although original data distributions can be pretty accurately reconstructed from the perturbed data, distances between individual data points are not preserved, leading to poor accuracy for the distance-based mining methods. Besides, they do not generally focus on data reduction. Other studies on secure multi-party computation often concentrate on techniques useful to very specific mining algorithms and scenarios such that they require modification of the mining algorithms and are often difficult to generalize to other mining algorithms or scenarios. This paper proposes a novel generalized approach using the well-known energy compaction power of Fourier-related transforms to hide sensitive data values and to approximately preserve Euclidean distances in centralized and distributed scenarios to a great degree of accuracy. Three algorithms to select the most important transform coefficients are presented, one for a centralized database case, the second one for a horizontally partitioned, and the third one for a vertically partitioned database case. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach." .

The state of the art protocols assume that the contents of files stored on a server (or multiple servers) are directly accessible. However, this makes such protocols unsuitable for any environment where the documents themselves are sensitive and cannot be openly read. Essentially, this assumption limits more practical applications, e.g., detecting plagiarized documents between two conferences, where submissions are confidential. We propose novel protocols to detect similar documents between two entities where documents cannot be openly shared with each other. The similarity measure used can be a simple cosine similarity on entire documents or on document fragments, enabling detection of partial copying. We conduct extensive experiments to show the practical value of the proposed protocols. While the proposed base protocols are much more efficient than the general secure multiparty computation based solutions, they are still slow for large document sets. We then investigate a clustering based approach that significantly reduces the running time and achieves over 90% of accuracy in our experiments. This makes secure similar document detection both practical and feasible." .

In this paper, we propose a novel form of inverted list, namely the IDList; the IDList for keyword $$k$$ consists of ordered nodes that directly or indirectly contain $$k$$. We then show that finding keyword query results based on the smallest lowest common ancestor and exclusive lowest common ancestor semantics can be reduced to ordered set intersection problem, which has been heavily optimized due to its application in areas such as information retrieval and database systems. We propose several algorithms that exploit set intersection in different directions and with or without using additional indexes.

Only authorized users are allowed to access the data. Nobody else, including the service provider, should be able to view the data. For instance, a real-estate company that owns a large database of properties wants to allow its paying customers to query for houses according to location. On the other hand, the untrusted service provider should not be able to learn the property locations and, e.g., selling the information to a competitor. To tackle the problem, we propose to transform the location datasets before uploading them to the service provider. The paper develops a spatial transformation that re-distributes the locations in space, and it also proposes a cryptographic-based transformation. The data owner selects the transformation key and shares it with authorized users. Without the key, it is infeasible to reconstruct the original data points from the transformed points. The proposed transformations present distinct trade-offs between query efficiency and data confidentiality. In addition, we describe attack models for studying the security properties of the transformations.

The computation should be carried out in a secure way, meaning that no coalition of corrupted parties should be able to learn more than specified or somehow cause the result to be “incorrect.” Typically, corrupted parties are either assumed to be semi-honest (meaning that they follow the protocol specification) or malicious (meaning that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol). However, in many settings, the assumption regarding semi-honest behavior does not suffice and security in the presence of malicious adversaries is excessive and expensive to achieve. In this paper, we introduce the notion of covert adversaries, which we believe faithfully models the adversarial behavior in many commercial, political, and social settings. Covert adversaries have the property that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat, but do not wish to be “caught” doing so. We provide a definition of security for covert adversaries and show that it is possible to obtain highly efficient protocols that are secure against such adversaries. We stress that in our definition, we quantify over all (possibly malicious) adversaries and do not assume that the adversary behaves in any particular way. Rather, we guarantee that if an adversary deviates from the protocol in a way that would enable it to “cheat” (meaning that it can achieve something that is impossible in an ideal model where a trusted party is used to compute the function), then the honest parties are guaranteed to detect this cheating with good probability. We argue that this level of security is sufficient in many settings." .

It uses a 31-bit representation of the state and also stores the rotation through which each state was first found. Its memory consumption is remarkably small, considering that 3,674,160 × 31 bits is about 14.2 million bytes. Getting below this number was made possible by sharing common parts of states. Obviously, it is not possible to reduce memory consumption without limit. We derive an information-theoretic hard average lower bound of 6.07 million bytes that applies in this setting.

Traitor tracing schemes constitute a useful tool against piracy in the context of digital content distribution. They are encryption schemes that can be employed by content providers that wish to deliver content to an exclusive set of users. Each user holds a decryption key that is fingerprinted and bound to his identity. When a pirate decoder is discovered, it is possible to trace the identities of the users that contributed to its construction. In most settings, both the user population and the set of content providers are dynamic, thus scalable user management and scalable provider management are crucial. Previous work on public-key traitor tracing did not address the dynamic scenario thoroughly: no efficient scalable public-key traitor tracing scheme has been proposed, in which the populations of providers and users can change dynamically over time without incurring substantial penalty in terms of system performance and management complexity. To address these issues, we introduce a formal model for Scalable Public-Key Traitor Tracing, and present the first construction of such a scheme. Our model mandates for deterministic traitor tracing and unlimited number of efficient provider and user management operations. We present a formal adversarial model for our system and we prove our construction secure, against both adversaries that attempt to cheat the provider and user management mechanism, and adversaries that attempt to cheat the traitor tracing mechanism." .

The moving mass is traversing on the plate’s surface at arbitrary trajectories. Eigenfunction expansion method is employed to solve the constitutive equation of motion for various boundary conditions. Approximate and exact expressions of the inertial effects are adopted for the problem formulation. In the approximate formulation, only the vertical acceleration component of the moving mass is considered while in the exact formulation all the convective acceleration components are included in the problem formulation as well. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effects of moving mass weight and velocity as well as its trajectory on the dynamic response of a simply supported plate. Rectilinear and orbiting paths are considered in the parametric studies as the two limiting cases for any possible moving mass trajectories. The obtained results demonstrate the importance of the moving mass inertia with respect to the moving load in most of the cases considered. In case of the rectilinear path, the approximate formulation underestimates the plate’s maximum response for mass velocities above certain limits. Furthermore, increasing the plate’s aspect ratio or the moving mass weight further reduces the range of velocities in which the approximate formulation can be used instead of the exact formulation. For the case of an orbiting path, the approximate formulation can capture the resonance excitation frequencies of the load reasonably well, even for large mass weight and radius of the orbiting mass. Considering small orbiting mass radii, the approximate formulation would provide an upper bound for the true response of the system for all orbiting frequencies as well as the mass weights. However, for larger radii, the maximum response values resulting from the approximate formulation are considerably lower than that of the exact one, especially for frequencies near to the resonance frequencies." .

As an underlay network of conventional cellular networks (LTE or LTE-Advanced), D2D communications have shown great potential in improving communication capability, erasing communication delay, reducing power dissipation, and fostering multifarious new applications and services. However, security in D2D communications, which is essential for the success of D2D services, has not yet been seriously studied in the literature. In this paper, we explore a security architecture for D2D communications under the framework of 3GPP LTE. We further investigate potential security threats and specify security requirements accordingly. Existing security solutions in D2D communications are seriously surveyed and evaluated based on the specified security architecture and requirements in order to figure out open research issues and motivate future research efforts." .

To protect patients’ privacy, sensitive EHR information has to be encrypted before outsourcing. However, this makes effective data utilization, such as fuzzy keyword search and data sharing, a very challenging problem. In this paper, aiming at allowing for securely storing, sharing and effectively utilizing the EHR, a new cloud-based EHR system is proposed. A binary tree is utilized to store the encrypted records in the proposed scheme, and an attribute-based encryption scheme is applied to encrypt the secret keys. The proposed system is very efficient because only symmetric encryption is introduced to encrypt the records. To support effectively retrieve patients’ records, an efficient fuzzy keyword search over encrypted data is proposed without reliance on heavy cryptographic operations, which greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files. With rigorous security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure, while it realized privacy-preserving data sharing and fuzzy keyword search. Extensive experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed solution." .

This model allows for investigation of the tradeoffs/ bottlenecks with respect to the communication bandwidth (modeled by the shared memory size m ) and the number of processors p . The model is quite simple and allows the design of optimal algorithms without losing the effect of communication bottlenecks. We have focused on the PPRAM complexity of problems that have $\\tilde{O}$ (n) sequential solutions (where n is the input size), and where m ≤ p ≤ n . We show essentially tight time bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for several problems in this model such as summing, Boolean threshold, routing, integer sorting, list reversal and k -selection. We get typically two sorts of complexity behaviors for these problems: One type is $\\tilde{O}$ (n/p + p/m) , which means that the time scales with the number of processors and with memory size (in appropriate ranges) but not with both. The other is $\\tilde{O}$ (n/m) , which means that the running time does not scale with p and reflects a communication bottleneck (as long as m < p ). We are not aware of any problem whose complexity scales with both p and m (e.g. $O(n/\\sqrt{m \\cdot p})$ ). This might explain why in actual implementations one often fails to get p -scalability for p close to n ." .

As the reliability of NAND flash memory continues degrading, conventional error correction codes have become increasingly inadequate. LDPC code is highly desirable, due to its powerful correction strength. However, in order to maximize the correction strength, LDPC codes demand fine-grained memory sensing, leading to a significant read latency penalty. To address the drawbacks caused by soft-decision LDPC decoding, this paper proposes a hybrid hard-/soft-decision LDPC decoding strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed approach could reduce the read latency penalty and hence improve the decoding throughput up to 30 %, especially in early lifetime of NAND flash memory, compared with the conventional decoding with equivalent area." .

Each node in the network pledges to help its neighbours by passing packets to and fro, in return of a similar assurance from them. All is well if all participating nodes uphold such an altruistic behaviour. However, this is not always the case and often nodes are subjected to a variety of attacks by other nodes. These attacks range from naive passive eavesdropping to vicious battery draining attacks. Routing protocols, data, battery power and bandwidth are the common targets of these attacks. In order to overcome such attacks a number of routing protocols have been devised that use cryptographic algorithms to secure the routing mechanism, which in turn protects the other likely targets. A limiting requirement regarding these protocols is the reliance on an omnipresent, and often omniscient, trust authority. In our opinion, this reliance on a central entity is against the very nature of ad-hoc networks, which are supposed to be improvised and spontaneous. We present in this paper, a trust-based model for communication in ad-hoc networks that is based on individual experience rather than on a third party advocating trust levels. The model introduces the notion of belief and provides a dynamic measure of reliability and trustworthiness in pure ad-hoc networks." .

With the advent of the Web, digital libraries have been able to reach constituencies previously unanticipated. Because of the wide deployability of Web-accessible digital libraries, the potential for privacy violations has also grown tremendously. The much touted Semantic Web, with its agent, service, and ontology technologies, is slated to take the Web to another qualitative level in advances. Unfortunately, these advances may also open doors for privacy violations in ways never seen before. We propose a Semantic Web infrastructure, called SemWebDL, that enables the dynamic composition of disparate and autonomous digital libraries while preserving user privacy. In the proposed infrastructure, users will be able to pose more qualitative queries that may require the ad hoc collaboration of multiple digital libraries. In addition to the Semantic Web-based infrastructure, the quality of the response would rest on extraneous information in the form of a profile. We introduce the concept of communities to enable subject-based cooperation and search speedup. Further, digital libraries’ heterogeneity and autonomy are transcended by a layered Web-service-based infrastructure. Semantic Web-based digital library providers would advertise to Web services, which in turn are organized in communities accessed by users. For the purpose of privacy preservation, we devise a three-tier privacy model consisting of user privacy, Web service privacy, and digital library privacy that offers autonomy of perspectives for privacy definition and violation. We propose an approach that seamlessly interoperates with potentially conflicting privacy definitions and policies at the different levels of the Semantic Web-based infrastructure. A key aspect in the approach is the use of reputations for outsourcing Web services. A Web service reputation is associated with its behavior with regard to privacy preservation. We developed a technique that uses attribute ontologies and information flow difference to collect, evaluate, and disseminate the reputation of Web services." .

Our results are both theoretical and empirical. Our main theoretical results are (1) a polynomial time algorithm for finding a near-optimal migration plan in the presence of space constraints when a certain number of additional nodes is available as temporary storage, and (2) a 3/2-approximation algorithm for the case where data must be migrated directly to its destination.

Normally, the wholesaler has real servers which host products and services from different locations, provide the end-users to simply log on to the network and perform transaction processing. However, the dynamic data update after transaction processing in cloud does not provide an optimal security framework. Besides, the cloud data storage is not focusing on maximizing the security on performing the transactions over cloud servers. In order to overcome such limitations in cloud, a novel framework named conditional source trust attribute encryption with particle swarm-based transaction optimization (CSTAE-PSTO) is proposed. The conditional attributes are encrypted using the conditional source trust attribute encryption technique along with the bilinear mapping transformation function in CSTAE-PSTO framework to improve the security level through unique secured identity number. The PSTO technique on cloud applications optimizes the result with minimal transaction completion time. Experiment is conducted based on factors such as throughput level on transaction, security rate on data layer and transaction completion time. Experimental analysis shows that the CSTAE-PSTO framework is able to improve the security rate on data layer and reduce the transaction completion time when compared to the state-of-the-art works." .

Discrete-time partially observed linear systems perturbed by stochastic unbounded additive disturbances are studied. Unlike the classic theory, the sensor signals are communicated to the estimator over a limited capacity noisy digital link modeled as a stochastic discrete memoryless channel. It is shown that the capability of the noisy channel to ensure state estimation with a bounded in probability error is identical to its capability to transmit information with as small probability of error as desired. In other words, the classic Shannon capacity of the channel constitutes the boundary of the observability domain. It is shown that whenever the Shannon capacity bound is met, a reliable observation can be ensured by means of a state estimator consuming a bounded (as time progresses) computational complexity and memory per unit time. The corresponding state estimator is constructed explicitly and is based on the classic block coding approach, so that traditional block encoding–decoding procedures can be employed for its implementation." .

However, as several user studies have shown, a high percentage of search tasks are exploratory, and focalized search very commonly leads to inadequate interactions and poor results. This paper proposes exploiting static and dynamically mined metadata for enriching web searching with exploration services. Online results clustering, which is a mining task of dynamic nature since it is based on query-dependent snippets, is useful for providing users with overviews of the top results and thus allowing them to restrict their focus to the desired parts. On the other hand, the various static metadata that are available to a search engine (e.g., domain, language, date, and filetype) are commonly exploited only through the advanced (form-based) search facilities that some WSEs offer (and users rarely use). We propose an approach that combines both kinds of metadata by adopting the interaction paradigm of dynamic taxonomies and faceted exploration, which allows the users to restrict their focus gradually using both static and dynamically derived metadata. Special focus is given on the design and analysis of incremental algorithms for speeding up the exploration process. The experimental evaluation over a real WSE shows that this combination results to an effective, flexible, and efficient exploration experience. Finally, we report the results of a user study indicating that this direction is promising in terms of user preference, satisfaction, and effort." .

For protecting user privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing. This makes secure data deduplication a challenging task. Although convergent encryption is used to securely eliminate duplicate copies on the encrypted data, these secure deduplication techniques support only exact data deduplication. That is, there is no tolerance of differences in traditional deduplication schemes. This requirement is too strict for multimedia data including image. For images, typical modifications such as resizing and compression only change their binary presentation but maintain human visual perceptions, which should be eliminated as duplicate copies. Those perceptual similar images occupy a lot of storage space on the remote server and greatly affect the efficiency of deduplication system. In this paper, we first formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy image deduplication while maintaining user privacy. Our solution eliminates duplicated images based on the measurement of image similarity over encrypted data. The robustness evaluation is given and demonstrates that this fuzzy deduplication system is able to duplicate perceptual similar images, which optimizes the storage and bandwidth overhead greatly in cloud storage service." .

The expected time for generating a prime is only slightly greater than the expected time required for generating a pseudoprime of the same size that passes the Miller-Rabin test for only one base. Therefore our algorithm is even faster than algorithms presently used for generating only pseudoprimes because several Miller-Rabin tests with independent bases must be applied for achieving a sufficient confidence level. Heuristic arguments suggest that the generated primes are close to uniformly distributed over the set of primes in the specified interval. Security constraints on the prime parameters of certain cryptographic systems are discussed, and in particular a detailed analysis of the iterated encryption attack on the RSA public-key cryptosystem is presented. The prime-generation algorithm can easily be modified to generate nearly random primes or RSA-moduli that satisfy these security constraints. Further results described in this paper include an analysis of the optimal upper bound for trial division in the Miller-Rabin test as well as an analysis of the distribution of the number of bits of the smaller prime factor of a random k-bit RSA-modulus, given a security bound on the size of the two primes." .

Our approach performs heuristic-based algebraic transformations on XPath queries, represented as PAT algebraic expressions, to achieve query optimization. This article first presents a comprehensive set of general equivalences with regard to XML documents and XML queries. Based on these equivalences, we developed a large set of deterministic algebraic transformation rules for XML query optimization. Our approach is unique, in that it performs exclusively deterministic transformations on queries for fast optimization. The deterministic nature of the proposed approach straightforwardly renders high optimization efficiency and simplicity in implementation. Our approach is a logical-level one, which is independent of any particular storage model.

However, it involves relatively high decoding complexity. Owing to different convergence behaviors of variable nodes, the nodes detected early can be deleted from the Tanner graph, which reduces the size of the parity-check matrix iteration by iteration and thus the decoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new decoding algorithm for LDPC-coded modulation with reduced complexity. In addition, by deleting the converged bits from the modulation constellation and updating the bit metrics of the demapper with the reduced constellation, more accurate estimation of the bits can be achieved. Simulation results show that, compared with conventional decoding schemes, the proposed method not only greatly reduces the overall decoding complexity for LDPC-coded modulation but also significantly improves decoding performance." .

A device that performs private key operations (signatures or decryptions), and whose private key operations are protected by a password, can be immunized against offline dictionary attacks in case of capture by forcing the device to confirm a password guess with a designated remote server in order to perform a private key operation. Recent proposals for achieving this allow untrusted servers and require no server initialization per device. In this paper we extend these proposals to enable dynamic delegation from one server to another; i.e., the device can subsequently use the second server to secure its private key operations. One application is to allow a user who is traveling to a foreign country to temporarily delegate to a server local to that country the ability to confirm password guesses and aid the user’s device in performing private key operations, or in the limit, to temporarily delegate this ability to a token in the user’s possession. Another application is proactive security for the device’s private key, i.e., proactive updates to the device and servers to eliminate any threat of offline password guessing attacks due to previously compromised servers." .

Perturbative masking methods propose the distortion of the original data sets before publication, tackling a difficult tradeoff between data utility (low information loss) and protection against disclosure (low disclosure risk). In this paper, we describe how information loss and disclosure risk measures can be integrated within an evolutionary algorithm to seek new and enhanced masking protections for continuous microdata. The proposed technique constitutes a hybrid approach that combines state-of-the-art protection methods with an evolutionary algorithm optimization. We also provide experimental results using three data sets in order to illustrate and empirically evaluate the application of this technique." .

Novel security mechanisms can provide the means to extend existing solutions in order to provide a more sophisticated security approach. As critical infrastructures get increasingly accessible from public networks they show up on attackers’ radars. As a consequence, establishing cyber situational awareness on a higher level through incident information sharing is vital for assessing the increased risk to national security in the cyber space. But legal obligations and economical considerations limit the motivation of companies to pursue information sharing initiatives. To support companies and governmental initiatives, novel security mechanisms should inherently address limiting factors. One novel approach, AECID, is presented that accounts for the limitations of many common intrusion and anomaly detection mechanisms; and which further provides the features to support privacy-aware information sharing for cyber situational awareness." .

The designed ciphers operate efficiently with different plaintext lengths, 64 and 128-bit, for Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128, respectively. Both of them use very simple key scheduling that defines high performance, especially in the case of frequent key refreshing. A novel feature of Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128 is the use of the Switchable Operations which prevent the weak keys. The offered high-level security strength does not sacrifice the implementation performance, of both ciphers. Architecture, design and hardware implementation of the two ciphers are presented. The synthesis results for both FPGA and ASIC implementations prove that Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128 are very flexible and powerful new ciphers, especially for high-speed networks. The achieved hardware performance and the implementation area cost of Cobra-H64 and Cobra-H128 are compared with other ciphers, used in security layers of wireless protocols (Bluetooth, WAP, OMA, UMTS and IEEE 802.11). From these comparisons it is proven that the two proposed are flexible new ciphers with better performance in most of the cases, suitable for wireless communications networks of present and future." .

Many security schemes have been proposed that depend on cooperation amongst the nodes in a MANET for identifying nodes that are exhibiting malicious behaviors such as packet dropping, packet modification, and packet misrouting. We argue that in general, this problem can be viewed as an instance of detecting nodes whose behavior is an outlier when compared to others. In this paper, we propose a collaborative and trust-based outlier detection algorithm that factors in a node’s reputation for MANETs. The algorithm leads to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate." .

DICOM is now evolving to provide a standard for electronic communication between radiology and other parts of the hospital enterprise. In a completely integrated filmless radiology department, there are 3 core computer systems, the picture archiving and communication system (PACS), the hospital or radiology information system (HIS, RIS), and the acquisition modality. Ideally, each would have bidirectional communication with the other 2 systems. At a minimum, a PACS must be able to receive and acknowledge receipt of image and demographic data from the modalities. Similarly, the modalities must be able to send images and demographic data to the PACS. Now that basic DICOM communication protocols for query or retrieval, storage, and print classes have become established through both conformance statements and intervendor testing, there has been an increase in interest in enhancing the functionality of communication between the 3 computers. Historically, demographic data passed to the PACS have been generated manually at the modality despite the existence of the same data on the HIS or RIS. In more current sophisticated implementations, acquisition modalities are able to receive patient and study-related data from the HIS or RIS. DICOM Modality Worklist is the missing electronic link that transfers this critical information between the acquisition modalities and the HIS or RIS. This report describes the concepts, issues, and impact of DICOM Modality Worklist implementation in a PACS environment." .

However, due to the open nature of BitTorrent protocol and lack of any security mechanism, number of attacks against BitTorrent has significantly increased. Sybil, Collusion, Lying-Piece, Fake-Block, and Chatty-Peer are attack types which have been considered in this paper to secure BitTorrent against them. These attacks can decrease the download performance of BitTorrent clients considerably. In this paper a new reputation based trust management system to cover aforementioned attack types is presented. The proposed approach calculates a local score at peers and a global score at the tracker for each peer. First, peers are sorted according to their cumulative score at the tracker and then top 10 % of these peers are used to determine other peers global score. These local and global scores are used to find attackers. In addition, a novel formula has been utilized to calculate peers local score. Using the global score concept makes our mechanism robust and swift to detect collusion attack which has not been considered in most of similar previous works. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, several simulation and real experiments in the Emulab testbed were performed. The outcomes indicate that our method is highly effective in detection of rogue peers and Free-Riders; moreover, performance of honest peers has significantly improved." .

An efficient method for embedding LPOS information into tape servo signals that is robust to LPOS detection errors is presented. The proposed concept is based on the serial concatenation of three data-processing stages: a lossless compression stage with a fixed compression ratio, an error-correction coding (ECC) stage and a runlength-limited coding stage. Various algorithms have been designed to compress and decompress the LPOS information. Error-correction codes, such as Hamming codes, Reed–Solomon codes and Golay codes, are used to protect LPOS and manufacturing information from detection errors. Finally, the random-error and the burst-error performance of various compression/ECC schemes are evaluated by computing the LPOS word error rate for servo signals corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise and by determining the burst-error correction capability of the proposed LPOS formats, respectively." .

However, flash storage has many unique characteristics that make existing data management/analytics algorithms designed for magnetic disks perform poorly with flash storage. For example, while random reads can be nearly as fast as sequential reads, random writes and in-place data updates are orders of magnitude slower than sequential writes. In this paper, we consider an important fundamental problem that would seem to be particularly challenging for flash storage: efficiently maintaining a very large random sample of a data stream (e.g., of sensor readings). First, we show that previous algorithms such as reservoir sampling and geometric file are not readily adapted to flash. Second, we propose B-File, an energy-efficient abstraction for flash storage to store self-expiring items, and show how a B-File can be used to efficiently maintain a large sample in flash. Our solution is simple, has a small (RAM) memory footprint, and is designed to cope with flash constraints in order to reduce latency and energy consumption. Third, we provide techniques to maintain biased samples with a B-File and to query the large sample stored in a B-File for a subsample of an arbitrary size. Finally, we present an evaluation with flash storage that shows our techniques are several orders of magnitude faster and more energy-efficient than (flash-friendly versions of) reservoir sampling and geometric file. A key finding of our study, of potential use to many flash algorithms beyond sampling, is that “semi-random” writes (as defined in the paper) on flash cards are over two orders of magnitude faster and more energy-efficient than random writes." .

However, there are wide privacy concerns as personal health information is outsourced to untrusted cloud servers. It is a promising method to encrypt the health data before outsourcing, but how to do diagnosis computations on the encrypted health data remains an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a general architecture of the mobile healthcare network, and define three typical secure medical computations, which include the average heart rate, the long QT syndrome detection, and the chi-square tests. To achieve computations on the ciphertext, we leverage fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to encrypt the health data. Different from previous related works, we use more efficient Dowlin’s FHE scheme to implement above three medical computations. In our implementation of the average heart rate, only one ciphertext is sent back to the receiver, so homomorphic decryption is needed once. We take an efficient l-bits comparator to implement the long QT syndrome detection, which only needs l XOR operations and one homomorphic multiplication. We first implement the chi-square tests by homomorphic additions and homomorphic multiplications, which can be used to study whether varicose veins is relevant to overweight. Extensive simulations and analytical results show the scalability and efficiency of our proposed scheme." .

We propose new algorithms for the insertion, deletion, and equality search of variable-length strings in a disk-resident B-trie, as well as novel splitting strategies which are a critical element of a practical implementation. We experimentally compare the B-trie against variants of B-tree on several large sets of strings with a range of characteristics.

It serves as a basic component in many real-world applications, such as facial recognition, DNA matching and music retrieval. Motivated by the newly emerging secure outsourced computing, in this paper we proposed protocols to realize these functionalities in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, we constructed exact and approximate matching protocols, and both of them ensure that the party holds the text (with length of n) learns noting about the pattern (with length of m). We composed a novel idea to combine secret sharing scheme with oblivious transfer (OT), such as to transform the secure pattern matching problem into reconstructing of a shared secret, which means that if a shared secret can be correctly reconstructed, it indicates the pattern indeed exists in the text. Our protocol for approximate pattern matching is generated in the cloud-assisted setting, where the reconstruction phase is outsourced to an honest-but-curious cloud server. Using oblivious transfer extension technique, a powerful method to use few integrated OTs to implement large-scale single OTs, our protocol is efficiently constructed. Both of the protocols are secure in semi-honest model, and we present a detailed secure simulation-based proof in this paper." .

Indexing XML documents for twig query processing is of fundamental importance to supporting effective information retrieval. In practice, many XML documents on the web are heterogeneous and have their own formats; documents describing relevant information can possess different structures. Therefore some “user-interesting” documents having similar but non-exact structures against a user query are often missed out. In this paper, we propose the RRSi, a novel structural index designed for structure-based query lookup on heterogeneous sources of XML documents supporting proximate query answers. The index avoids the unnecessary processing of structurally irrelevant candidates that might show good content relevance. An optimized version of the index, oRRSi, is also developed to further reduce both space requirements and computational complexity. To our knowledge, these structural indexes are the first to support proximity twig queries on XML documents. The results of our preliminary experiments show that RRSi and oRRSi based query processing significantly outperform previously proposed techniques in XML repositories with structural heterogeneity." .

Even if system security has been established, if personal privacy is infringed, most people will not use electronic identification (eID) cards. In the present paper, a method of reinforcing personal information protection for eID cards was considered. As a major solution, the problem was approached from the viewpoint of not storing any personal information per se in eID cards using the secret sharing technique, and a structure in which no information whatsoever on the original can be known from only the secret share in the card was proposed. With these characteristics, the proposed scheme ensures safety even when eID cards have been lost, as well as against power analysis attacks, client masquerading, skimming, and sniffing." .

For any polynomial $$\\ell $$ ℓ , we can instantiate these schemes so as to tolerate up to $$\\ell $$ ℓ bits of leakage. While there has been much prior work constructing such leakage-resilient cryptosystems under concrete number-theoretic and algebraic assumptions, we present the first schemes under general and minimal assumptions. In particular, we construct:Leakage-resilient public-key encryption from any standard public-key encryption.Leakage-resilient weak pseudorandom functions, symmetric-key encryption, and message-authentication codes from any one-way function. These are the first constructions of leakage-resilient symmetric-key primitives that do not rely on public-key assumptions. We also get the first constructions of leakage-resilient public-key encryption from “search assumptions,” such as the hardness of factoring or CDH. Although our schemes can tolerate arbitrarily large amounts of leakage, the tolerated rate of leakage (defined as the ratio of leakage amount to key size) is rather poor in comparison with prior results under specific assumptions. As a building block of independent interest, we study a notion of weak hash-proof systems in the public-key and symmetric-key settings. While these inherit some of the interesting security properties of standard hash-proof systems, we can instantiate them under general assumptions." .

The problem is motivated by secure data outsourcing applications where a client may store his/her data on a remote server in encrypted form and want to execute queries using server’s computational capabilities. The solution approach is to compute a secure indexing tag of the data by applying bucketization (a generic form of data partitioning) which prevents the server from learning exact values but still allows it to check if a record satisfies the query predicate. Queries are evaluated in an approximate manner where the returned set of records may contain some false positives. These records then need to be weeded out by the client which comprises the computational overhead of our scheme. We develop a bucketization procedure for answering multidimensional range queries on multidimensional data. For a given bucketization scheme, we derive cost and disclosure-risk metrics that estimate client’s computational overhead and disclosure risk respectively. Given a multidimensional dataset, its bucketization is posed as an optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the risk of disclosure while keeping query cost (client’s computational overhead) below a certain user-specified threshold value. We provide a tunable data bucketization algorithm that allows the data owner to control the trade-off between disclosure risk and cost. We also study the trade-off characteristics through an extensive set of experiments on real and synthetic data." .

These are intended to ensure efficient and unbiased estimation protecting a respondent’s privacy when it touches a person’s socially stigmatizing feature like rash driving, tax evasion, induced abortion, testing HIV positive, etc. Lanke (Int Stat Rev 44:197–203, 1976), Leysieffer and Warner (J Am Stat Assoc 71:649–656, 1976), Anderson (Int Stat Rev 44:213–217, 1976, Scand J Stat 4:11–19, 1977) and Nayak (Commun Stat Theor Method 23:3303–3321, 1994) among others have discussed how maintenance of efficiency is in conflict with protection of privacy. In their RR-related activities the sample selection is traditionally by simple random sampling (SRS) with replacement (WR). In this paper, an extension of an essential similarity in case of general unequal probability sample selection even without replacement is reported. Large scale surveys overwhelmingly employ complex designs other than SRSWR. So extension of RR techniques to complex designs is essential and hence this paper principally refers to them. New jeopardy measures to protect revelation of secrecy presented here are needed as modifications of those in the literature covering SRSWR alone. Observing that multiple responses are feasible in addressing such a dichotomous situation especially with Kuk’s (Biometrika 77:436–438, 1990) and Christofides’ (Metrika 57:195–200, 2003) RR devices, an average of the response-specific jeopardizing measures is proposed. This measure which is device dependent, could be regarded as a technical characteristic of the device and it should be made known to the participants before they agree to use the randomization device." .

Therefore, public-key infrastructure eventually becomes a target of SCA. In this paper, we investigate the security of RSA cryptosystem using the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) in the sense of SCA. Novak first proposed a simple power analysis (SPA) against the CRT part using the difference of message modulo p and modulo q. In this paper, we apply Novak’s attack to the other CRT-based cryptosystems, namely Multi-Prime RSA, Multi-Exponent RSA, Rabin cryptosystem, and HIME(R) cryptosystem. Novak-type attack strictly depends on how to implement the CRT. We examine the operations related to CRT of these cryptosystems, and show that an extended Novak-type attack is effective on them. Moreover, we present a novel attack called zero-multiplication attack. The attacker tries to guess the secret prime by producing ciphertexts that cause a multiplication with zero during the decryption, which is easily detected by power analysis. Our experimental result shows that the timing with the zero multiplication is reduced about 10% from the standard one. Finally, we propose countermeasures against these attacks. The proposed countermeasures are based on the ciphertext blinding, but they require no inversion operation. The overhead of the proposed scheme is only about 1–5% of the whole decryption if the bit length of modulus is 1,024." .

Due to the high frequency in location updates and the expensive cost of continuous query processing, server computation capacity and wireless communication bandwidth are the two limiting factors for large-scale deployment of moving object database systems. Many techniques have been proposed to address the server bottleneck including one using distributed servers. To address both scalability factors, distributed query processing techniques have been considered. These schemes enable moving objects to participate in query processing to substantially reduce the demand on server computation, and wireless communications associated with location updates. Most of these techniques, however, assume an open-space environment. Since Euclidean distance is different from network distance, techniques designed specifically for an open space cannot be easily adapted for a spatial network. In this paper, we present a distributed framework which can answer moving query over moving objects in a spatial network. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we study two representative moving queries, namely, moving range queries and moving k-nearest-neighbor queries. Detailed algorithms and communication mechanisms are presented. The simulation studies indicate that the proposed technique can significantly reduce server workload and wireless communication cost." .

However, this access control system requires mobile users’ certificate information and may fail due to their privacy. In light of the growing privacy concerns, this paper proposes a certificate-aware framework for online access control system in mobile computing, where users are compensated for their privacy certificate and operation disclosure and are motivated to present more certificate information. In this framework, a broker pays a trust degree to users and virtual authentication coordinators for disclosing more certificate information. This paper models the interactions among virtual authentication coordinators, the authentication broker and mobile users as a three-stage game, where every player aims at maximizing its own utility, and the trust allocation is achieved by G value learning. Numerical results have shown that the proposed certificate-aware framework is effective, as it enables all players to maximize their utilities and improve the degree of the trust of mobile computing systems." .

This process is described as a multi-facet innovation, involving actors from different policy fields shifting over time. The eID process started in the late ‘90s in the context of eGovernment and eCommerce with the legislation on e-signatures, which were supposed to allow for online authentication of citizens. When after 5 years it was recognized that this was not the case, a new digital ID card, which had meanwhile been announced, was chosen as token for the eID. This process was dominated by the concerns for visual inspection and border control, including the storage of digital fingerprints. Under the leadership of the Ministry of the Interior (BMI) and technical guidance of the Federal Agency for Information Security (BSI), technical specifications have to a large extent been adopted from the electronic passport, which had been smoothly introduced 2 years before. However, in the legislative process some concern regarding digital fingerprints on the eID card was raised and led to an opt-in solution. In 2009, a bill on the new ID card was passed which regulates the eID function for online authentication as well. This is characterized as a radical innovation by introducing a double-sided, mutual authentication of the citizen and the service provider and implementing the principle of proportionality regarding the access of service providers to data on the chip. At the time of writing, field tests are conducted. Roll-out of the new eID card is to start in November 2010. Therefore no figures about adoption can be provided here." .

Buyers hope that they can buy their favorite goods or services through trading, and merchants hope that they can obtain a reasonable profit. If friends or family of a buyer are interested in the same commodity or service, they can often buy at a lower price by buying in volume. This concept is referred to as group buying. Although the profit on a single commodity decreases for a merchant, the overall profits are increased due to volume. Traditionally, buyers and merchants trade through a group buying service company. However, sometimes transaction disputes arise. This might happen because a buyer has already paid through a group buying service company but has not received the merchandise or because a merchant has delivered merchandise to a buyer but has not been paid. Transaction disputes arise. We propose a fair group buying system. The proposed scheme uses secure computing theory to meet the security requirements such as mutual authentication, integrity of transaction data and anonymity of buyer. We propose a fair and secure group buying system based on arbitration computing mechanism to provide a comprehensive method for arbitrating an appeal. We create a win/win situation for the buyers, the merchants and the group buying service companies." .

Yet, it is often disregarded that the utility of the anonymized results provided by differential privacy is quite limited, due to the amount of noise that needs to be added to the output, or because utility can only be guaranteed for a restricted type of queries. This is in contrast with $$k$$ k -anonymity mechanisms, which make no assumptions on the uses of anonymized data while focusing on preserving data utility from a general perspective. In this paper, we show that a synergy between differential privacy and $$k$$ k -anonymity can be found: $$k$$ k -anonymity can help improving the utility of differentially private responses to arbitrary queries. We devote special attention to the utility improvement of differentially private published data sets. Specifically, we show that the amount of noise required to fulfill $$\\varepsilon $$ ε -differential privacy can be reduced if noise is added to a $$k$$ k -anonymous version of the data set, where $$k$$ k -anonymity is reached through a specially designed microaggregation of all attributes. As a result of noise reduction, the general analytical utility of the anonymized output is increased. The theoretical benefits of our proposal are illustrated in a practical setting with an empirical evaluation on three data sets." .

The compression method is based on pre-processing and vector quantization. First, the CFA raw data are low pass filtered and rearranged during pre-processing. Then, pairs of pixels are vector quantized into macros of 9 bits by applying block partition and index mapping in succession. These macros are entropy compressed by Joint Photographic Experts Group-Lossless Standard (JPEG-LS) finally. The complex step of codeword searching in Vector Quantization (VQ) is avoided by a predefined partition rule, which is suitable for hardware implementation. By control of the pre-processor and VQ scheme, either high quality compression under unfiltered case or high ratio compression under filtered case can be realized, with the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) more than 43dB and 37dB respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method and the previously proposed method, our compression approach outperforms in compression performance as well as in flexibility." .

QSBC-LDPC codes are special block-circulant LDPC codes with quasi-systematic parity-check matrices. The memories for encoders of QSBC-LDPC codes are limited, and the encoding process can be carried out in a simple recursive way with low complexities.

Privacy of statistical learning, i.e., user and sensitive data, is significant problem of performing computation, especially outsourcing cloud computing. Some fully homomorphic encryption schemes can achieve computation on the encrypted data, but most of them are lack of efficiency. Fully homomorphic encryption based on learning with errors over rings (RLWE) supports a finite number of addition and multiplication on the encrypted data, thus can be viewed as the polynomial computation in cyclotomic fields. Computation on the encrypted data can be converted into computation associated with polynomial. So, fully homomorphic encryption from RLWE is very efficient relative to other schemes. Our contribution includes two aspects. Firstly, we show a scheme to represent the training and testing data for statistical learning. The proposed scheme firstly transforms the data into integer and then encodes them into polynomial so that the encryption, decryption and homomorphic operation can be performed efficiently. We also carefully choose the parameters of fully homomorphic encryption from RLWE to meet the requirement of efficiency. User only needs to upload the encrypted data to cloud server, and then the server trains and tests the encrypted data, returns the analysis and prediction results to user. Secondly, we present a comparison scheme on the encrypted data for statistical learning algorithms, which is security on the known plain-text attack and ciphertext only attack model." .

In a large wireless network, however, the cost of computing the betweenness of every node is impractically high. In this paper, we introduce a new representation of a node’s vicinity, called the expanded ego network (shortly, x-ego network) of that node. We also propose an approach that calculates the x-ego betweenness of a node (i.e., the betweenness of that node in its x-ego network) and use it as an estimate of the true betweenness in the entire network. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm that quickly computes x-ego betweenness by exploiting structural properties of x-ego networks. Our evaluation results show the benefits and effectiveness of the above approach using trace data obtained from real-world wireless networks." .

Many applications, protocols, and network wide functions rely on correct neighborhood discovery. Malicious nodes that taint neighborhood information using wormholes can significantly disrupt the operation of ad hoc networks. Protocols that depend only on cryptographic techniques (e.g, authentication and encryption) may not be able to detect or prevent such attacks. In this paper we propose SECUND, a protocol for creating a SECUre NeighborhooD, that makes use of discrepancies in routing hop count information to detect “true” neighbors and remove those links to nodes that appear to be neighbors, but are not really neighbors. SECUND is simple, localized and needs no special hardware, localization, or synchronization. We evaluate SECUND using simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in the presence of multiple and multi-ended wormholes. Lastly, we present approaches to improve the efficiency of the SECUND process." .

The fault tolerance of these devices in radiation environments is traditionally analyzed and increased by means of soft error protection mechanisms as EDAC codes or physical interleaving. As Communication System interleavers are mainly implemented using memories, a similar protection against soft errors to the one used for memory devices could be performed, as a conventional solution, when they are used in critical missions. In this paper, the knowledge of the system is used to apply the communication interleaving pattern as physical interleaving employing the inherent redundancy (added by previous modules of the Communication System) of the data processed by the interleaver as an error correction mechanism. Therefore a similar protection to the conventional solutions is obtained but with a reduced cost." .

However, low SNR NMR-logging data lead to a great uncertainty of T2 distribution, and therefore, analyzing the uncertainty of T2 distribution has a guiding significance for NMR-logging evaluation. For regularized solution from linear inversion, the mean square error which jointly determined by variance and bias can be used to measure its uncertainty. The variance of regularized T2 distribution can be calculated from the variance of the noise level of measured data. Since the true T2 distribution is unknown, the bias of regularized T2 distribution cannot be accurately calculated. This paper calculated the upper and lower boundaries of the bias of regularized T2 distribution for analyzing the uncertainty of regularized T2 distribution based on the frequentist method, using the NMR echo amplitudes, T2 distribution amplitudes, T2 distribution slopes, and T2 distribution curvatures as prior information to restrict the range of T2 distribution amplitude. The results indicate that as the noise level of measured data increases, the T2 distribution uncertainty increases and the confidence interval of T2 distribution broadens. The confidence interval width of T2 distribution from the norm-smoothing method is narrower than that of from the curvature-smoothing method." .

However, it supports only ANN search over plaintext in traditional locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). How to perform ANN search over encrypted data becomes a new challenging task. In this paper, we make an attempt to formally address the problem. We propose a new secure and efficient ANN search scheme over encrypted data based on SortingKeys-LSH (SK-LSH) and mutable order-preserving encryption (mOPE). In our construction, a secure index is generated by incorporating SK-LSH with mOPE, which can simultaneously achieve efficient ANN search and ensure data confidentiality. Furthermore, the proposed solution can achieve efficient range query on encrypted data. Security analysis demonstrates that our construction can achieve the desired security properties." .

This enhanced HTML content includes a malicious attack vector for Web-related attacks. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are presently the most exploited security problems in modern Web applications and activated by an attacker to utilize the vulnerabilities of the poorly written Web application source code. Users across all over the popular social networking Web sites are exposed to XSS attacks. These attacks are generally caused by the malicious scripts, which do not validate the user-injected input appropriately and exploit the vulnerabilities in the source code of the Web applications. It results in the loss of confidential information such as stealing of cookies, theft of passwords, and other private credentials. In this paper, we propose a robust framework known as XSS-SAFE (Cross-Site Scripting Secure Web Application FramEwork), which is a server-side automated framework for the detection and mitigation of XSS attacks. XSS-SAFE is designed based on the idea of injecting the features of JavaScript and introduced an idea of injecting the sanitization routines in the source code of JavaScript to detect and mitigate the malicious injected XSS attack vectors. We repeatedly inject the feature content, generate rules, and insert sanitization routines for the discovery of XSS attacks. We have evaluated our approach on five real-world JavaServer Pages (JSP) programs. The results indicate that XSS-SAFE detects and mitigates most of the previously known and unknown XSS attacks with minimum false positives, zero false-negative rate, and low runtime overhead." .

In this paper, we propose a new TWS that is based on computing the average term occurrences of terms in documents and it also uses a discriminative approach based on the document centroid vector to remove less significant weights from the documents. We call our approach Term Frequency With Average Term Occurrence (TF-ATO). An analysis of commonly used document collections shows that test collections are not fully judged as achieving that is expensive and maybe infeasible for large collections. A document collection being fully judged means that every document in the collection acts as a relevant document to a specific query or a group of queries. The discriminative approach used in our proposed approach is a heuristic method for improving the IR effectiveness and performance and it has the advantage of not requiring previous knowledge about relevance judgements. We compare the performance of the proposed TF-ATO to the well-known TF-IDF approach and show that using TF-ATO results in better effectiveness in both static and dynamic document collections. In addition, this paper investigates the impact that stop-words removal and our discriminative approach have on TF-IDF and TF-ATO. The results show that both, stop-words removal and the discriminative approach, have a positive effect on both term-weighting schemes. More importantly, it is shown that using the proposed discriminative approach is beneficial for improving IR effectiveness and performance with no information on the relevance judgement for the collection." .

Service composition provides us a promising way to cooperate various sensors to build more powerful IoT applications over sensor networks. However, the limited capability of sensor node poses great challenges not only to trustworthy service composition but also to secure data aggregation. The complex composite structure, computation-intensive evaluation, and massive data transmission become burdens for service composition in sensor networks. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a distributed approach to enable efficient trustworthy service composition with secure data transmission in sensor networks. By analyzing dependency relationships, the rules for computing service trust and data trust are proposed based a multi-level trust model. Then, each target component service can be evaluated independently through a model checker. Moreover, an identity-based aggregate signature is introduced in the composite evaluation to guarantee the secure data transmission among different components. The experimental results show that our approach not only achieves efficient trustworthy service composition with complex invocation structures, but also reduces the costs in the secure data transmission." .

The relative simplicity of access to digital communications nowadays and the simultaneous increase in the available bandwidth are leading to the definition of new telematic services, mainly oriented towards multimedia applications and interactivity with the user. In the near future, a decisive role will be played in this scenario by the providers of interactive multimedia services of the on-demand type, which will guarantee the end user a high degree of flexibility, speed and efficiency. In this paper, some of the technical aspects regarding these service providers are dealt with, paying particular attention to the problems of storing information and managing service requests. More specifically, the paper presents and evaluates a new storage technique based on the use of disk array technology, which can manage both typical multimedia connections and traditional requests. The proposed architecture is based on the joint use of the partial dynamic declustering and the information dispersal algorithm, which are employed for the allocation and retrieval of the data stored on the disk array. We also define efficient strategies for request management in such a way as to meet the time constraints imposed by multimedia sessions and guarantee good response times for the rest of the traffic. The system proposed is then analyzed using a simulation approach." .

However, traditional DRMs are achieved with individual function modules of cryptography and watermarking. Therefore, all digital contents are temporarily disclosed in perfect condition via decryption process in the user-side risking illegal redistribution. This paper describes the basic idea of a novel DRM method composed of an incomplete cryptography using invariant Huffman code length feature and the user identification mechanism to control the quality of digital contents. The proposed incomplete cryptography consists of two processes: the incomplete encoding and the incomplete decoding. These processes are presented by randomly selecting the coefficients that belong to the same category or different category of Huffman code. In our scheme, the copyright information is embedded into the decoded content during the decoding process, and the size of digital contents are invariant during the process. Experimental results with simulation confirmed that the modified codes are compatible with standard JPEG format, and revealed the proposed method to be suitable for DRM in the network distribution system." .

Because encryption/decryption for video packets are time-consuming processes to protect real-time video streaming services from eavesdropping, our observation is that the playback buffer occupancy (PBO) can simply indicate time availability to adjust security level to affect the packet sending rate. In this paper, we present an end-to-end buffer-aware feedback control from client PBO for effectively securing media streaming for heterogeneous clients over ubiquitous Internet. That is, security-level adjustments can be applied further to keep PBO running away from overflow and underflow to pursue an effective leverage between QoS and QoP. To further boost the protection, we also apply the Diffie-Hellman key negotiation method to provide the dynamic key changes. Moreover, since the running PBO will vary on the dynamics of Internet from access time, client devices and access networks, the different applied security levels and key changes during the video streaming session will make eavesdropper more difficult to recover all the encrypted videos delivered in public networks. We demonstrate the leverage performance in preserving both QoS and QoP for ubiquitous video streaming in our proposed schemes by comprehensive experiments on a true VoD system. The experimental results show our secure VoD scheme can achieve cost-effective leverage of QoS and QoP from different inserted network dynamics, even if client buffer size is limited to 256 KB only." .

Not only do these challenge a basic tenet underlying the advancement of science by posing substantial obstacles to the sharing of data to validate research results, but they are obstacles to conducting certain research projects in the first place. Geospatial cryptography involves the specification, design, implementation and application of cryptographic techniques to address privacy, confidentiality and security concerns for geographically referenced data. This article defines geospatial cryptography and demonstrates its application in cancer control and surveillance. Four use cases are considered: (1) national‐level de‐duplication among state or province‐based cancer registries; (2) sharing of confidential data across cancer registries to support case aggregation across administrative geographies; (3) secure data linkage; and (4) cancer cluster investigation and surveillance. A secure multi-party system for geospatial cryptography is developed. Solutions under geospatial cryptography are presented and computation time is calculated. As services provided by cancer registries to the research community, de-duplication, case aggregation across administrative geographies and secure data linkage are often time-consuming and in some instances precluded by confidentiality and security concerns. Geospatial cryptography provides secure solutions that hold significant promise for addressing these concerns and for accelerating the pace of research with human subjects data residing in our nation’s cancer registries. Pursuit of the research directions posed herein conceivably would lead to a geospatially encrypted geographic information system (GEGIS) designed specifically to promote the sharing and spatial analysis of confidential data. Geospatial cryptography holds substantial promise for accelerating the pace of research with spatially referenced human subjects data." .

The improvement is reached not only due to a reduction of the integral file size, but mainly because data compression reduces or even can eliminate a cache conflict in data transfer from the hard drive to the main computer memory. Thus, the conventional SCF algorithm with the data compression becomes very efficient and permits to carry out large-scale Hartree-Fock calculations. The largest Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed for RNA 433D structure from the PDB data bank with 6080 basis functions formed from 6-31G basis on a workstation with 1 GHz Alpha processor." .

Traditional data models and query languages do not provide appropriate support for this information. Such data are typically stored in file systems, which do not provide the security, integrity, or query features of database management systems. The hypertext model has emerged as a good interface to this information; however,finding information using hypertext browsing does not scale well. We developed a query interface that serves as an extension of the browsing model of hypertext systems. These queries minimize the repeated user interactions required to locate data in a standard hypertext system. HyperFile is a prototype data server interface.

The acquired information is essential to optimize the measurement method, indicating the most significant components to work with. This approach works for any discrete relative change in the uncertainties of the inputs, whether positive or negative, and was developed for the cases of independent and correlated quantities. Examples of both cases are treated. The results agree with that provided by direct calculation and are consistent with the ideas in EA 4/16. We propose the use of the expression “sensitivity of combined standard uncertainty to changes in uncertainty components” as a uniform quantitative reference to the individual importance of the components that form the combined uncertainty.

In future smart cities, new applications can take advantage of cloud computing; for example, a cloud-based home health-care system can provide immediate disease management by analyzing medical images. However, if the size of cloud data is large (e.g., medical images), their transition through the Internet is time consuming. Cloud data authentication is another problem that should be addressed. To address the aforementioned problems, this study presents a novel data hiding method based on the block truncation coding (BTC) image compression technique. This method has two advantages: reduces image size and increases security. This study also proposes a block classification scheme for determining smooth blocks, complex_1 blocks, and complex_2 blocks in an image. Secret data are embedded in these three block types using different approaches. To improve the quality of images without damaging the secret data, we propose a progressive data hiding strategy and integrating an iteration-based halftoning method into BTC. When decoding, the secret data are extracted without recalling the original image. According to experimental results, the proposed method outperforms existing methods in both embedding capacity and image quality evaluations." .

However, it is mandatory to ensure a secure data transmission and in case of a node failure, the system should not fall down. This fact is important because several vital systems could depend on this infrastructure. On the other hand, a cloud does not have infinite computational and storage resources in its infrastructure or would not provide all type of services. For this reason, it is important to establish an interrelation between clouds using communication protocols in order to provide scalability, efficiency, higher service availability and flexibility which allow the use of services, computing and storage resources of other clouds. In this paper, we propose the architecture and its secure protocol that allows exchanging information, data, services, computing and storage resources between all interconnected mHealth clouds. The system is based on a hierarchic architecture of two layers composed by nodes with different roles. The routing algorithm used to establish the connectivity between the nodes is the shortest path first (SPF), but it can be easily changed by any other one. Our architecture is highly scalable and allows adding new nodes and mHealth clouds easily, while it tries to maintain the load of the cloud balanced. Our protocol design includes node discovery, authentication and fault tolerance. We show the protocol operation and the secure system design. Finally we provide the performance results in a controlled test bench." .

In this paper, we revisit pervasive content caching and propose an algorithm for cache replacement at ICN routers by incorporating principles from network coding, a technique used to achieve maximum flow rates in multicast. By introducing a low computational cost in the system, network-coded caching better utilizes the available small storage space at the routers to cache more effectively in the network. Results of our experiments on the global enterprise for network innovations (GENI) testbed demonstrating the performance of our algorithm on a real network are included in the paper. We evaluate the algorithm in two different traffic scenarios (i) video-on-demand (VoD) (ii) Zipf-based web traffic. Working with the named data networking implementation of ICN, we also present the additional headers and logical components that are needed to enable network-coded caching. In a nutshell, we show that an integrated coding-and-caching strategy can provide significant gains in latency and content delivery rate for a small computational overhead." .

By allowing mobile users to interact with potential friends around the real world, it enables new social interactions as a complement to Web-based online social networks.

By exploring the fact that sharing encounters indicate common activities and interests, our scheme can help people make friends with like-minded strangers nearby. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to take advantage of the encounter history in friend discovery. We provide peer-to-peer confidential communications with the location privacy and encounter privacy being strictly preserved. Unlike most existing works that either rely on a trusted centralized server or existing social relationships, our algorithm is designed in an ad hoc model with no such limitation. As a result, our design is more suitable and more general for mobile social scenarios.

In this paper, an incentive mechanism based on credit is introduced into the distributed K-anonymity, and only providing assistance to the others, a user can gain and accumulate his credit. Based on the fuzzy logic in the soft computing, a probability threshold is introduced to reflect a user’s reputation, and only when a user’s reputation reaches this threshold, can he get the assistance from other neighbors. Security analysis shows that our scheme is secure with respect to various typical attacks. And because of not relying on a trusted third party, our scheme can avoid the security issue resulting from its breach. Extensive experiments indicate that the time to form the anonymity set is short and it increases slowly as the value of K increases. Finally, the additional traffic introduced by this scheme is very limited." .

In this article, we develop a new methodology to address the long-term integrity of digital archives using rigorous cryptographic techniques. Our approach involves the generation of a small-size integrity token for each object, some cryptographic summary information, and a framework that enables cost-effective regular and periodic auditing of the archive’s holdings depending on the policy set by the archive. Our scheme is very general, architecture and platform independent, and can detect with high probability any alteration to an object, including malicious alterations introduced by the archive or by an external intruder. The scheme can be shown to be mathematically correct as long as a small amount of cryptographic information, in the order of 100 KB/year, can be kept intact.

If what they search for is unavailable in the database, the system will return an empty result or, worse, erroneous mismatch results. We call this problem the MisMatch problem. In this paper, we solve the MisMatch problem in the context of XML keyword search. Our solution is based on two novel concepts that we introduce: target node type and Distinguishability. Target Node Type represents the type of node a query result intends to match, and Distinguishability is used to measure the importance of the query keywords. Using these concepts, we develop a low-cost post-processing algorithm on the results of query evaluation to detect the MisMatch problem and generate helpful suggestions to users. Our approach has three noteworthy features: (1) for queries with the MisMatch problem, it generates the explanation, suggested queries and their sample results as the output to users, helping users judge whether the MisMatch problem is solved without reading all query results; (2) it is portable as it can work with any lowest common ancestor-based matching semantics (for XML data without ID references) or minimal Steiner tree-based matching semantics (for XML data with ID references) which return tree structures as results. It is orthogonal to the choice of result retrieval method adopted; (3) it is lightweight in the way that it occupies a very small proportion of the whole query evaluation time. Extensive experiments on three real datasets verify the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our approach.

To deploy data-oriented applications for mobile terminals, the wireless application protocol (WAP) has provided a promising solution. However, as in the World Wide Web (WWW), the increasing information leads to the problem of information overload. One way to overcome such a problem is to build intelligent recommender systems to provide customised information services. By analyzing the information collected from the user, a customised recommender system is able to reason his personal preferences and to build a model of predictions. In this way, only the information predicted as user-interested can reach the end user. This paper presents a multi-agent framework in which a decision tree-based approach is employed to learn a user’s preferences. To assess the proposed framework, a mobile phone simulator is used to represent a mobile environment and a series of experiments are conducted. The experimental studies have concentrated on how to recommend appropriate information to the individual user, and on how the system can adapt to a user’s most recent preferences. The results and analysis show that based on our framework the WAP-based customised information services can be successfully performed." .

The efficiency of string data structures used for this task is of paramount importance for applications such as in-memory databases, text-based search engines and dictionaries. The burst trie is a leading choice for such tasks, as it can provide fast sorted access to strings. The burst trie, however, uses linked lists as substructures which can result in poor use of CPU cache and main memory. Previous research addressed this issue by replacing linked lists with dynamic arrays forming a cache-conscious array burst trie. Though faster, this variant can incur high instruction costs which can hinder its efficiency. Thus, engineering a fast, compact, and scalable trie for strings remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical solution that carefully combines a trie with a hash table, creating a variant of burst trie called HAT-trie. We provide a thorough experimental analysis which demonstrates that for large set of strings and on alternative computing architectures, the HAT-trie—and two novel variants engineered to achieve further space-efficiency—is currently the leading in-memory trie-based data structure offering rapid, compact, and scalable storage and retrieval of variable-length strings." .

Based on the theory of censored data in statistics, we propose a ‘censored’ maximum-likelihood estimator (CMLE) for decoding the input in an unbiased way when the spike activity is observed over time windows of finite length. Compared with a rate-based, moment estimator, the CMLE is proved consistently more efficient, particularly with nonstationary inputs. Using our approach, we show that a dynamical input to a group of neurons can be inferred accurately and with high temporal resolution (50 ms) using as few as about one spike per neuron within each decoding window. By applying our theoretical results to a population coding setting, we then demonstrate that a spiking neural network can encode spatial information in such a way to allow fast and precise tracking of a moving target." .

Privacy-preserving access control means that the service provider can neither learn what access rights a customer has nor link a request to access an item to a particular customer, thus maintaining privacy of both customer activity and customer access rights. Flexible access rights allow a customer to choose a subset of items or groups of items from the repository, obtain access to and be charged only for the items selected. And portability of access rights means that the rights themselves can be stored on small devices of limited storage space and computational capabilities such as smartcards or sensors, and therefore the rights must be enforced using the limited resources available. In this paper, we present and compare two schemes that address the problem of such access rights. We show that much can be achieved if one allows for even a negligible amount of false positives – items that were not requested by the customer, but inadvertently were included in the customer access right representation due to constrained space resources. But minimizing false positives is one of many other desiderata that include protection against sharing of false positives information by unscrupulous users, providing the users with transaction untraceability and unlinkability, and forward compatibility of the scheme. Our first scheme does not place any constraints on the amount of space available on the limited-capacity storage device, and searches for the best representation that meets the requirements. The second scheme, on the other hand, has (modest) requirements on the storage space available, but guarantees a low rate of false positives: with O(mc) storage space available on the smartcard (where m is the number of items or groups of items included in the subscription and c is a selectable parameter), it achieves a rate of false positives of m −c ." .

After performing the round function for $$T$$ T iterations, the processed image is denoted as the encrypted image. We analyse the security of Wang and Guo image encryption scheme, especially from cryptographic point of view, in line with the designers’ approach in their security analyses.

Given a set of customers with different preferences on the features of the products, we want to select at most $$k$$ k products from a pool of candidate products such that their total number of potential customers is maximized. Two versions of the problem are defined according to whether the competitive existing products are given. For solving this NP-hard problem, we first propose an incremental greedy approach to find an approximate solution of the problem with quality guaranteed. For further speeding up this basic greedy approach, we exploit several properties of the top-$$t$$ t queries and skyline queries to reduce the solution space of the problem. In addition, an upper bound of the potential customers is estimated to reduce the cost of computing the reverse top-$$t$$ t queries for the candidate products. Finally, when the candidate products are formed from multiple component tables, we propose a strategy to reduce the number of the accessed tuples in the component tables such that only the tuples that are possibly components of the top-$$t$$ t favorites of the customers need to be accessed. By applying these pruning strategies, we propose another faster greedy approach. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed pruning strategies work very well and make the faster greedy algorithms for both versions of the problem achieve excellent performance on both efficiency and memory utilization." .

The critical fracture parameters providing an equilibrium configuration of the system are determined from a sufficient strength criterion representing a system of two equations, one of which specifies the absence of partial overlapping of the upper and lower surfaces of the contact zone, and the other is a deformation criterion of critical opening of the ellipse.

The first approach is based on a simple thresholding strategy after the multiscale representation is computed. The second approach employs a dynamical discarding strategy, where small coefficients are already discarded during the computation of the approximate multiscale representation. We analyse the (additional) error which comes with either compression and provide numerical experiments using topographical data of the earth." .

However, in heterogeneous WS, the shift from the mobile client consumer approach to the mobile service hosting approach is insufficiently studied. With the advancement of storage and processing capabilities of these devices, coupled with the high availability of the Web, this research focuses on the use of the mobile devices as hosts of WS in a mHealth domain. In this paper, a cloud-centric middleware technique is employed to enable access to the mobile hosts. The paper presents mobile hosting of medical data which are modeled as light-weight WS which is deployed in a real-world system. Further, a workflow authorization model is proposed to ensure privacy and the prevention of unauthorized modification of data on the mobile hosts. A data encryption technique is also put forward to enforce security and privacy of the mobile hosted data. Our current implemented project, called SOPHRA, supports mobile communication over HTTP in a Wi-Fi environment." .

However, information on the WWW is in general too chaotic, not reliable enough and specific material often too difficult to locate that it cannot be considered a serious digital library. In this paper we concentrate on the question how we can retrieve reliable information from the Web, a task that is fraught with problems, but essential if the WWW is supposed to be used as serious digital library. It turns out that the use of search engines has many dangers. We will point out some of the possible ways how those dangers can be reduced and how dangerous traps can be avoided. Another approach to find useful information on the Web is to use “classical” resources of information like specialized dictionaries, lexica or encyclopaedias in electronic form, such as the Britannica. Although it seemed for a while that such resources might more or less disappear from the Web due to attempts such as Wikipedia, some to the classical encyclopaedias and specialized offerings have picked up steam again and should not be ignored. They do sometimes suffer from what we will call the “wishy-washy” syndrome explained in this paper. It is interesting to note that Wikipedia which is also larger than all other encyclopaedias (at least the English version) is less afflicted by this syndrome, yet has some other serious drawbacks. We discuss how those could be avoided and present a system that is halfway between prototype and production system that does take care of many of the aforementioned problems and hence may be a model for further undertakings in turning (part of) the Web into a useable digital library." .

Because of its decentralized operation, these nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Video transmission over MANETs is more challenging than over conventional wireless networks due to rapid topology changes and lack of central administration. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume that all nodes are working within a cooperative and friendly network context. However, misbehaving nodes that exhibit abnormal behaviors can disrupt the network operation and affect the network availability by refusing to cooperate to route packets due to their selfish or malicious behavior. In this paper, we examine the effect of packet dropping attacks on video transmission over MANETs. We also study the effects of mitigation using intrusion detection systems to MANET in presence of video traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study multimedia over such environments. We propose a novel intrusion detection system, which is an adaptive acknowledgment scheme (AACK) with the ability to detect misbehaved nodes and avoid them in other transmissions. The aim of AACK scheme is to overcome watchdog weaknesses due to collisions and limited transmission power and also to improve TWOACK scheme. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme, simulation experiments are performed. The results of our experiments show that MPEG4 is more suitable for our simulation environment than H264 video traffic. The simulation results show that AACK scheme provides better network performance with less overhead than other schemes; it also shows that AACK outperforms both TWOACK and watchdog in video transmission applications in the presence of misbehaving nodes." .

The delocalization, density and degeneracy-based index of aromaticity, D3BIA, is an electronic aromaticity index from QTAIM that is not reference dependent and can be used for aromatic, homoaromatic, sigma aromatic and other aromatic systems with varying ring size containing hetereoatoms or not. We used B3LYP, MP2 and MP3 methods to search for linear relations between well-known aromaticity indices and D3BIA for a series of acenes. We found that the D3BIA versus FLU correlation exceeded 91 % and reasonably good correlations exist between D3BIA and HOMA and between D3BIA and PDI. Previous works have shown that D3BIA can be used for homoaromatic systems and tetrahedrane derivatives (sigma aromaticity), but no previous work has validated D3BIA for benzenoid systems. This is the first time we have shown that D3BIA can be used successfully for benzenoid systems, for example, acenes. This work supports and validates the use of D3BIA in classical aromatic systems.

There are, however, also weaknesses of this type of e-commerce, often called mobile e-commerce, or m-commerce. Due to their small size and easy portability mobile devices can easily be lost or stolen. Whereas the economic values and privacy threats protected with Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) are not particularly high for normal voice-enabled mobile phones, this is not true any more when phones have developed to Personal Trusted Devices (PTDs). Still, PINs are used also in this new context for authorization and identification purposes. PINs are currently used both for protection of the devices and for authentication, as well as authorization of the users. It is commonly recognized that not many techniques of storing the PINs into the memory of the device or on the SIM card are safe. Even less sophisticated thieves might uncover the PIN inside the stolen mobile devices and for sophisticated thieves uncovering the PIN stored “safely” might be possible. In this paper we propose a new scheme to cope with the problem of uncovering the PIN that reduces the risks of m-commerce. The basic idea is that instead of storing the entire PIN digits (or some hash value) in the mobile device, we store part of the PIN in a remote machine in the network. The PIN verification then involves both the mobile device and the remote machine, which must verify their respective parts of the PIN. Also, the improvements of the security over the existing schemes are shown using a probabilistic model. In the best case, where the probability of discovering the PIN irrespective of the storage scheme is negligible in relation to directly uncovering it, the increase in security is over 1000%." .

Such corporations might want to integrate their data to provide more precise and reliable recommendations. However, due to privacy, legal, and financial concerns, they do not desire to disclose their private data to each other. If privacy-preserving measures are introduced, they might decide to generate predictions based on their distributed data collaboratively. In this study, we investigate how to offer hybrid CF-based referrals with decent accuracy on cross distributed data (CDD) between two e-commerce sites while maintaining their privacy. Our proposed schemes should prevent data holders from learning true ratings and rated items held by each other while still allowing them to provide accurate CF services efficiently. We perform real data-based experiments to evaluate our proposals in terms of accuracy. The results show that the proposed methods are able to provide precise predictions. Moreover, we analyze our schemes in terms of privacy and supplementary costs. We demonstrate that our schemes are secure, and online overhead costs due to privacy concerns are insignificant." .

However, if an end point host moves to different wireless access networks, it will have a problem in many situations. For example, consideration of contents like the level of required service quality for network search, handoff, connection and call time, and caching and load balancing is necessary. Unlike previous studies, this article analyzes additional costs related to Fast Handover and compares the performance of group of pictures and data transmission delay time. For this, first, the total additional cost was divided into signaling cost and packet transmission cost, and results of the comparison calculated for video data transmission delay time and traffic overhead are presented. This article proposes service quality improvement methods by acquiring multiuser channel state information for multicast video-streaming transmission with a method implemented between network layers. Channel state information of each user in the multicast group is used as information for the transmission of multicast packets. Thus, through simulation like real-time traffic, the optimum traffic transmission state is maintained. As a result of the simulation, we found that video-streaming service performance for multicast users improved by applying the approach method between layers. This article proposes optimization methods of a cross-layered approach for wireless network multimedia communication systems and video-streaming application services." .

This paper provides a methodology together with a Multi-Metrics approach to evaluate the system SPD level during both the design and running processes.

Power supply and power demand are closely interconnected with the need to maintain the power grid in a stable state with a sufficient quality of power. This requires energy-relevant information to be exchanged through the so called Energy Information Network. Communication, however, is challenging within the Energy Information Network due to privacy, security, resiliency, and quality-of-service requirements. Particularly, the resilience of communication within the Energy Information Network needs to be considered to maintain the power grid in a stable and controlled state. This paper suggests a Virtualised Energy Information Network (VEIN), where the Energy Information Network is divided into multiple virtual networks that run over a common substrate network. Furthermore, this paper discusses benefits of this approach in terms of privacy, security, and resilience and points out open research questions." .

The non-full-fledged protocols typically suffer de-synchronization, impersonation and tracking attacks, and usually lack scalability. The full-fledged protocols, supporting cryptographic functions, are designed to overcome these weaknesses. This paper examines several elliptic-curve-cryptography (ECC)-based full-fledged protocols. We found that some still have security and privacy issues, and others generate excessive communication costs between the tag and the back-end server. Motivated by these observations, we construct two novel protocols, PI and PII. PI is designed for secure environments and is suitable for applications, including E-Passport and toll payment in vehicular ad-hoc networks. PII is for hostile environments and can be applied in pseudonymous payment and anti-counterfeiting services. After analysis, we conclude that PII can resist many attacks, outperform previous ECC-based proposals in communication efficiency, and provide mutual authentication function and scalability." .

In this scheme, we combine MPR technique with network coding. Only multipoint relay (MPR) nodes perform coding using a rateless code. Rather than waiting for a large number of encoded packets to be received before MPR nodes could decode and resend coded packets, we design a new degree distribution that enables the nodes to start decoding even when small number of encoded packets are received. Thus, we decrease the delay introduced at the intermediate nodes. The main advantage of using a rateless code for encoding instead of using a random linear combination of the previously received packets is to reduce significantly the encoding and decoding complexities. We provide a performance evaluation using a simulation to demonstrate the efficiency of our code even under mobility condition." .

The PVC simplifies the traditional video coder by removing the transform and the motion estimation parts and modifies the quantizer and entropy coder. Two novel coding algorithms, the adaptive quantizer and the modified windowed Huffman-like coder, are used in the PVC to encode the video data with a quality picture at a high compression ratio. The video quality of the proposed coder is as good as that of the MPEG coder when the input is a low-resolution and slow-motion video, and the computational complexity of the PVC is much lower than that of the Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG). Since no compression hardware is needed for the PVC to encode and decode video data, the cost and complexity of developing multimedia applications, such as video phone and multimedia e-mail systems, can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, some networking issues, such as error control and flow control, are discussed in connection with applying the PVC to implement the Popular Phone." .

However, as processor technology evolves, said algorithms are often unable to derive the maximum achievable performance on these modern architectures. In this paper, we examine the performance of frequent pattern mining algorithms on a modern processor. A detailed performance study reveals that even the best frequent pattern mining implementations, with highly efficient memory managers, still grossly under-utilize a modern processor. The primary performance bottlenecks are poor data locality and low instruction level parallelism (ILP). We propose a cache-conscious prefix tree to address this problem. The resulting tree improves spatial locality and also enhances the benefits from hardware cache line prefetching. Furthermore, the design of this data structure allows the use of path tiling, a novel tiling strategy, to improve temporal locality. The result is an overall speedup of up to 3.2 when compared with state of the art implementations. We then show how these algorithms can be improved further by realizing a non-naive thread-based decomposition that targets simultaneously multi-threaded processors (SMT). A key aspect of this decomposition is to ensure cache re-use between threads that are co-scheduled at a fine granularity. This optimization affords an additional speedup of 50%, resulting in an overall speedup of up to 4.8. The proposed optimizations also provide performance improvements on SMPs, and will most likely be beneficial on emerging processors." .

Various authentication methods are used such as ID/PW, biometric, and OTP authentications. One of the popular authentications is ID/PW authentication. As an inputted password is transferred by one-way hash function and then stored in DB, it is difficult for the DB administrator to figure out the password inputted by the user. However, when DB is leaked, and there is the time to decode, the password can be hacked. The time and cost to decode the original message from the hash value corresponding a short password decrease. Therefore, if the password is short, then attacking cost is low, and password crack possibility is high. In the case where an attacker utilizes pre-computing rainbow tables, and the hash value of short passwords is leaked, the password that the user inputted can be cracked. In this research, to block rainbow table attacks, when the user generates a short password, by adding additional messages of identification information of a system or the user and extending the length of the password, we try to resolve the vulnerability of short passwords. By proposing a model to minimize the length of the password and the authority accordingly in mobile devices on which inputting passwords is not easy, we take security into consideration. Our proposal model is strong against rainbow table attack and provides efficient password system to users. It contributes to resolving password vulnerability and upgrades mobile users’ convenience in typing passwords." .

Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a promising communication technology in this regard. Preservation of privacy is crucial in these services to foster their acceptance. Previous approaches have mainly focused on PKI-based or ID-based cryptography. However, these works have not fully addressed the minimum information disclosure principle. Thus, questions such as how to prove that a driver is a neighbour of a given zone, without actually disclosing his identity or real address, remain unaddressed. A set of techniques, referred to as Attribute-Based Credentials (ABCs), have been proposed to address this need in traditional computation scenarios. In this paper, we explore the use of ABCs in the vehicular context. For this purpose, we focus on a set of use cases from European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Basic Set of Applications, specially appropriate for the early development of smart cities. We assess which ABC techniques are suitable for this scenario, focusing on three representative ones—Idemix, U-Prove and VANET-updated Persiano systems. Our experimental results show that they are feasible in VANETs considering state-of-the-art technologies, and that Idemix is the most promising technique for most of the considered use cases." .

It is well known that this feasibility problem can be transformed into a maximum flow problem. It is also well known that there is no feasible flow in the networkG if and only if there is a subsetS of nodes such that the net supplies of the nodes inS exceeds the capacity of the arcs emanating fromS. Such a setS is called a“witness of infeasibility” (or, simply, awitness) of the network flow problem. In the case that there are many different witnesses for an infeasible problem, a small cardinality witness may be preferable in practice because it is generally easier for the user to assimilate, and may provide more guidance to the user on how to identify the cause of the infeasibility. Here we show that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality witness is NP-hard. We also consider the problem of determining aminimal witness, that is, a witnessS such that no proper subset ofS is also a witness. In this paper, we show that we can determine a minimal witness by solving a sequence of at mostn maximum flow problems. Moreover, if we use the preflow-push algorithm to solve the resulting maximum flow problems and organize computations properly, then the total time taken by the algorithm is comparable to that of solving a single maximum flow problem. This approach determines a minimal cardinality witness in O(n 2 m 1/2) time using simple data structures and in O(nm logn) time using the standard implementation of the dynamic tree data structures. We also show that the recognition version of the minimal witness problem is equivalent to a recognition version of a related problem known as theminimum rooted cut problem. © 1998 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.

Compression and decompression are done in a block-wise fashion; larger blocks usually result in better compression rates. With the currently used algorithms for decompression, 4n bytes of auxiliary memory for processing a block of n bytes are needed, 0<n<232. This may pose a problem in embedded systems (e.g., mobile phones), where RAM is a scarce resource. In this paper we present algorithms that reduce the memory need without sacrificing speed too much. The main results are: Assuming an input string of n characters, 0<n<232, the reverse Burrows-Wheeler transformation can be done with 1.625 n bytes of auxiliary memory and O(n) runtime, using just a few operations per input character. Alternatively, we can use n/t bytes and 256 t n operations. The theoretical results are backed up by experimental data showing the space-time tradeoff." .

It supports energy producers and energy consumers efficiently by supporting the estimation and provision of the proper amount of electricity at the proper time. The most serious threat to a smart grid system may be when information is altered or forged by attackers; the system could malfunction and could collapse. In some cases, the attackers could waste system resources on purpose and this could lead to disastrous results. In this paper, we propose security system architecture to provide the secure and reliable smart grid service. It includes a data authentication process to verify the aggregated data and virtual network management to detect a compromised area or node. It detects a false data injection attack and further prevents a denial of service attack efficiently with less overhead for the individual devices comprising the smart grid system." .

At present, in mobile communication, though access authentication methods of various access networks are different from each other, they are all based on the unique authentication algorithm in (U)SIM, which results in several drawbacks and cannot fulfill the requirements of the future mobile communications. The underlying reason is the authentication algorithm is not extensible and the authentication framework is not independent of the communication technologies. In order to solve this problem, we propose a uniform access authentication framework. Making use of the extensive authentication protocol EAP, we add a media-independent authentication layer in USIM which outputs the uniform keys after an authentication, and a key adaptation layer is designed in the terminals which transforms the output keys accordingly to meet the specific requirements of various communication modules. In such a method, USIM is extensible in authentication algorithms and the authentication framework is independent of the communication technologies. Our analysis indicates that the proposed scheme is of great advantages over the current one." .

A remarkable contribution of the approaches is that the result of the fusion is an ordered list of indistinguishable groups of documents. This kind of output represents a good compromise between understandability and accuracy of the result.

Social networks widely expand the area of people’s social connections and make communication much smoother than ever before. In a social network, there are many social groups established based on common interests among persons, such as learning group, family group, and reading group. People often describe their profiles when registering as a user in a social network. Then social networks can organize these users into groups of friends according to their profiles. However, an important issue must be considered, namely many users’ sensitive profiles could have been leaked out during this process. Therefore, it is reasonable to design a privacy-preserving friends-finding protocol in social network. Toward this goal, we design a fuzzy interest matching protocol based on private set intersection. Concretely, two candidate users can first organize their profiles into sets, then use Bloom filters to generate new data structures, and finally find the intersection sets to decide whether being friends or not in the social network. The protocol is shown to be secure in the malicious model and can be useful for practical purposes." .

This paper deals with two of the main challenges: (i) the lack of security expertise in development teams and (ii) the inadequacy of existing methodologies to support developers who are not security experts. The security standard ISO 14508 Common Criteria (CC) together with secure design techniques such as UMLsec can provide the security expertise, knowledge, and guidelines that are needed. However, security expertise and guidelines are not stated explicitly in the CC. They are rather phrased in security domain terminology and difficult to understand for developers. This means that some general security and secure design expertise are required to fully take advantage of the CC and UMLsec. In addition, there is the problem of tracing security requirements and objectives into solution design, which is needed for proof of requirements fulfilment. This paper describes a security requirements engineering methodology called SecReq. SecReq combines three techniques: the CC, the heuristic requirements editor HeRA, and UMLsec. SecReq makes systematic use of the security engineering knowledge contained in the CC and UMLsec, as well as security-related heuristics in the HeRA tool. The integrated SecReq method supports early detection of security-related issues (HeRA), their systematic refinement guided by the CC, and the ability to trace security requirements into UML design models. A feedback loop helps reusing experience within SecReq and turns the approach into an iterative process for the secure system life-cycle, also in the presence of system evolution." .

Previous work empirically showed that individual data values can be approximately reconstructed from the perturbed values, using spectral filtering techniques.

In particular, we first derive an upper bound for the reconstruction error using matrix perturbation theory. Attackers who use spectral filtering techniques to estimate the true data values may leverage this bound to determine how close their estimates are to the original data. We then derive a lower bound for the reconstruction error, which can help data owners decide how much noise should be added to satisfy a given threshold of the tolerated privacy breach." .

The $e^+$-jet invariant mass spectrum produced in the reaction $e^+ p \\rightarrow e^+ X$ has been studied at a center-of-mass energy of 300 GeV. The data were collected using the ZEUS detector operating at the HERA collider, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $47.7$ pb$^{-1}$. The observed mass spectrum is in good agreement with Standard Model expectations up to an $e^+$-jet mass of $210$ GeV. Above this mass, some excess is seen. The angular distribution of these events is typical of high-$Q^2$ neutral current events and does not give convincing evidence for the presence of a narrow scalar or vector state. Limits are presented on the product of cross section and branching ratio for such a state and are interpreted as limits on leptoquark or R-parity-violating squark production. Specific leptoquark types are ruled out at 95% confidence level for coupling strength $\\lambda=0.3$ for masses between 150 and 280 GeV." .

Many organizations distribute non-aggregate personal data for research, and they must take steps to ensure that an adversary cannot predict sensitive information pertaining to individuals with high confidence. This problem is further complicated by the fact that, in addition to the published data, the adversary may also have access to other resources (e.g., public records and social networks relating individuals), which we call adversarial knowledge. A robust privacy framework should allow publishing organizations to analyze data privacy by means of not only data dimensions (data that a publishing organization has), but also adversarial-knowledge dimensions (information not in the data). In this paper, we first describe a general framework for reasoning about privacy in the presence of adversarial knowledge. Within this framework, we propose a novel multidimensional approach to quantifying adversarial knowledge. This approach allows the publishing organization to investigate privacy threats and enforce privacy requirements in the presence of various types and amounts of adversarial knowledge. Our main technical contributions include a multidimensional privacy criterion that is more intuitive and flexible than previous approaches to modeling background knowledge. In addition, we identify an important congregation property of the adversarial-knowledge dimensions. Based on this property, we provide algorithms for measuring disclosure and sanitizing data that improve computational efficiency several orders of magnitude over the best known techniques." .

The wavelength excursion for both chirp terms is well characterized by the phase rate equation model that describes the chirp behavior. In this study, the effect of gain compression and linewidth enhancement factor, below and above threshold, on the chirp characteristics is investigated by simulation. We have observed the trade-off between the two chirp terms i.e., transient part of the chirp is reduced by the strong damping introduced by gain compression, while as the adiabatic part increases with gain compression. We have observed that above threshold the α-factor increases with bias current, which is attributed to the enhancement of gain compression coefficient. It is shown that the higher the maximum gain, the lower the effects of gain compression and lower the α-factor. Finally, the effects of gain compression on the transmission characteristics are investigated." .

In our model, purpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of the data element. A key feature of our model is that it allows multiple purposes to be associated with each data element and also supports explicit prohibitions, thus allowing privacy officers to specify that some data should not be used for certain purposes. An important issue addressed in this article is the granularity of data labeling, i.e., the units of data with which purposes can be associated. We address this issue in the context of relational databases and propose four different labeling schemes, each providing a different granularity. We also propose an approach to represent purpose information, which results in low storage overhead, and we exploit query modification techniques to support access control based on purpose information. Another contribution of our work is that we address the problem of how to determine the purpose for which certain data are accessed by a given user. Our proposed solution relies on role-based access control (RBAC) models as well as the notion of conditional role which is based on the notions of role attribute and system attribute." .

The experiments in previous literatures indicate that social information is very effective in improving the performance of traditional recommendation algorithms. However, most of existing social recommendation methods only take one kind of social relations—trust information into consideration, which is far from satisfactory. Furthermore, most of the existing trust networks are binary, which results in the equal treatment to different users who are trusted by the same user in these methods. In this paper, based on matrix factorization methods, we propose a new approach to make recommendation with social information. Its novelty can be summarized as follows: (1) it shows how to add different weights on the social trust relationships among users based on the trustee’s competence and trustworthiness; (2) it incorporates the similarity relationships among users as a complement into the social trust relationships to enhance the computation of user’s neighborhood; (3) it can balance the influence of these two kinds of relationships based on user’s individuality adaptively. Experiments on Epinions and Ciao datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of mean absolute error and root mean square error, in particular for the users who rated a few items." .

In these architectures, the application servers are protected by a defense perimeter where only traffic from entities called servlets are allowed to pass. End users must be authorized and can only communicate with entities called access points (APs). APs relay authorized users’ requests to servlets, which in turn pass them to the servers. The identity of APs are publicly known while the servlets are typically secret. All communications are done through the public Internet. Thus all the entities involved form an overlay network. The main component of this distributed system consists of n APs and m servlets. A design for a network is a bipartite graph with APs on one side, and the servlets on the other side. If an AP is compromised by an attacker (or fails), all the servlets that are connected to it are subject to attack. An AP is blocked, if all servlets connected to it are subject to attack. We consider two models for the failures: In the stochastic model, we assume that each AP i fails with a given probability p i . In the adversarial model, we assume that there is an adversary that knows the topology of the network and chooses at most k APs to compromise. In both models, our objective is to design the connections between APs and servlets to minimize the (expected/worst-case) number of blocked APs. In this paper, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem in the stochastic model when the number of servlets is a constant. We also show that if the probability of failure of each AP is at least 1/2, then in the optimal design each AP is connected to only one servlet (we call such designs star-shaped), and give a polynomial-time algorithm to find the best star-shaped design. We observe that this statement is not true if the failure probabilities are small. In the adversarial model, we show that the problem is related to a problem in combinatorial set theory, and use this connection to give bounds on the maximum number of APs that a perfectly failure-resistant design with a given number of servlets can support. Our results provide the first rigorous theoretical foundation for practical secure overlay network design." .

The technical elements of the model are based on the features of personal health devices, health data repositories, and interoperability standards that already exist. For the automated collection of data from patients’ personal health devices (such as wireless glucometers or smartphone-based applications), the model suggests a set of content standards developed by the Continua Alliance and already implemented in a number of commercial products. For the sharing of collected data with providers’ EHRs, the model specifies a secure transport layer based on the DIRECT Project’s secure email standards and an application data layer based on HL7 v2.5.1 query-response messages combined with the clinical document architecture Release 2.0 personal healthcare monitoring report implementation guide. All of these standards have been implemented and are in current use, although they have not yet been combined to meet the specific use case of sharing patient-generated health information with providers EHRs.

In digital photography, copyright protection is very crucial. Visible signatures distract from the meaning of the photograph as well as they are easy to be removed by using advanced softwares. Invisible watermarks provide protection, offer a better look to photographs than visible watermarking, and prevent the photographs from unauthorized manipulations. A robust multiple watermarking scheme is required which could invisibly protect the content and also should survive the manipulations for later verification and restoration. In this paper, a robust and imperceptible multimedia authentication and restoration scheme is proposed. The security of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is utilized to make an encrypted watermark. The encrypted watermark is then embedded into photographs in the salient regions by proposed Feature-Closest Point Transform (F-CPT) algorithm. The second watermark is generated by wavelet decomposition and embedded in the second and third level wavelet sub-bands of the cover photographs. Several security attacks are performed e.g. noise attack, compression attack, resizing attack, rotation attack, collage attack, and cropping attack on multiple watermarked photographs to examine the system robustness by normalized cross correlation (NCC) for retrieved authentication watermarks.

Wireless LAN is a stable and reliable technique to provide network access for mobile devices. The Wireless LAN Access Points(APs) have been densely deployed so that a user can access the Internet almost everywhere. However, this fact brings some new challenges. Since the regular AP association strategy is signal-based when a user receive the signals of multiple APs. The APs with strong signal will be too overloaded while the bandwidth resource in other APs is wasted. The throughput of the whole WLAN is not optimized. Moreover, the diverse bandwidth demands among users further exacerbate the situation. In this paper, aiming at optimizing the throughput over the whole WLAN, a joint AP association and bandwidth allocation problem is formulated. The different users’ bandwidth demands are added as new constraints. We comprehensively analyze the solution space and prove the problem NP-hard. Our trace-driven evaluations show that the throughput is improved about 23.1 % compared to the conventional schemes." .

The interaction between recursion (descendants-axis) in xpath queries and recursion in dtds makes it challenging to answer xpath queries using rdbms. We present a new approach to translating xpath queries into sql queries based on a notion of extended XP ath expressions and a simple least fixpoint (lfp) operator. Extended xpath expressions are a mild extension of xpath, and the lfp operator takes a single input relation and is already supported by most commercial rdbms. We show that extended xpath expressions are capable of capturing both dtd recursion and xpath queries in a uniform framework. Furthermore, they can be translated into an equivalent sequence of sql queries with the lfp operator. We present algorithms for rewriting xpath queries over a (possibly recursive) dtd into extended xpath expressions and for translating extended xpath expressions to sql queries, as well as optimization techniques. The novelty of our approach consists in its capability to answer a large class of xpath queries by means of only low-end rdbms features already available in most rdbms, as well as its flexibility to accommodate existing relational query optimization techniques.

For the success of mobile agent applications, secure, portable, and efficient execution platforms for mobile agents are crucial. However, popular mobile agent systems do not meet the high security requirements of electronic commerce applications, are not portable, or cause high overhead. Currently, the majority of mobile agent platforms is based on Java. These systems simply rely on the security model of Java, although it is not suited to protect agents and service components from each other. In contrast, J-SEAL2 is a mobile agent system designed to meet the high security, portability, and performance requirements of large-scale electronic commerce applications. J-SEAL2 extends the Java environment with a model of strong protection domains. The core of the system is a micro-kernel fulfilling the same functions as a traditional operating system kernel: protection, communication, domain termination, and resource control. For portability reasons, J-SEAL2 is implemented in pure Java. This paper focuses on the design of the new communication model in J-SEAL2, which allows convenient, efficient, and mediated communication in a hierarchy of strong protection domains." .

In this paper the plaintext is first divided into number of blocks and each block are first encrypted by Recursive Positional Substitution on Prime-Nonprime of Cluster (RPSPNC) and then the resultant blocks are encrypted by Triangular Encryption (TE). In RPSPNC source stream is divided into blocks and a generating function is applied on each block to generate a same size of intermediate block t, repetition of this generating function for finite number of time regenerates the original block. In TE, source stream is broken into blocks of size n, and then XNOR operation is performed from MSB to LSB generating a block of size n − 1 and continues to form a triangle. Encryption is done in any of four types and decryption is done in similar method. Lastly combining all the encrypted blocks the ciphertext is generated. Thus applying cascaded approach much better result has been generated as compared to separate RPSPNC and TE. The results are also compared with State-of-art technique from literature, RCT, RMRO and much known RSA." .

This proximity service is usually offered by the network itself or by a third party service provider (SP) using location data acquired from the users. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical and experimental analysis of the existing solutions for the location privacy problem in proximity services. This is a serious problem for users who do not trust the SP to handle their location data and would only like to release their location information in a generalized form to participating buddies. The paper presents two new protocols providing complete privacy with respect to the SP and controllable privacy with respect to the buddies. The analytical and experimental analysis of the protocols takes into account privacy, service precision, and computation and communication costs, showing the superiority of the new protocols compared to those appeared in the literature to date. The proposed protocols have also been tested in a full system implementation of the proximity service." .

In this paper, we analyze this problem exploiting the loss expectation by illegal attack in a quantitative way. With one of the key cloud services, storage cloud services based on key–value pairs (SCSKP for short), we quantify the protection ability with the Markov model analysis on the possibilities of various illegal attack. The loss expectation caused by the illegal attack will be calculated based on the analysis and then be used to quantify the resistance ability of SCSKP against such attacks, which serves as a metric to evaluate the security of the cloud service. We provide three series of experiments are exploited to test the expectation of losses. The results show that our method is valid and able to reflect the security situation of the cloud service." .

In this paper, we analyze the requirements for a trustworthy index to support keyword-based search queries. We argue that trustworthy index entries must be durable—the index must be updated when new documents arrive, and not periodically deleted and rebuilt. To this end, we propose a scheme for efficiently updating an inverted index, based on judicious merging of the posting lists of terms. Through extensive simulations and experiments with two real world data sets and workloads, we demonstrate that the scheme achieves online update speed while maintaining good query performance. We also present and evaluate jump indexes, a novel trustworthy and efficient index for join operations on posting lists for multi-keyword queries. Jump indexes support insert, lookup and range queries in time logarithmic in the number of indexed documents." .

Feasibility of encryption/ decryption computation when the ciphertext involve pure random data is shown. The core element of the proposed approach for stream ciphering is a pseudo-random embedding of the random bits into the ciphertext and this embedding plays role of a homophonic encoding. The initial ciphertext with the embedded random bits is further on intentionally degraded by its exposure to a moderate noise which can be modelled as the binary symmetric channel effect. A security evaluation of the proposed approach implies that its security appears as a consequence of hardness of the LPN problem, as well. The developed design has potential of providing that complexity of recovering the secret key in the known plaintext attack scenario is close to the complexity of recovering the secret key via the exhaustive search, i.e. close to the maximal possible one for the given size of the secret key. The proposed approach can be considered as a trade-off between the increased security and decreased communications efficiency which in a number of scenarios appears as a suitable one." .

In a practical s-health system, security and privacy issues are of great importance and have to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a secure s-health system which realizes fine-grained access control on s-health cloud data and hence ensures users’ privacy protection. The key technique is a promising cryptographic primitive called ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption. In order to trace malicious behaviors in the proposed s-health system, two kinds of key abuse problems are considered: malicious key sharing among colluding users and key escrow problem of the semi-trusted authority. In the proposed s-health system, any malicious behavior of a user including illegal key sharing can be traced. For the semi-trusted authority, it can be accountable for its misbehavior including illegal key re-distribution. Particularly, the proposed system supports large universe and attributes do not need to be pre-specified during the system initialization phase. Besides, our system is proven fully secure in the random oracle model and it allows any monotonic access policies. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed s-health system is suitable for smart city environment." .

The relative computation cost of a pairing is approximately more than ten times of the scalar multiplication over elliptic curve group. So, to reduce running time, we first define a model of a secure MPMS scheme, then propose an IBMPMS scheme without using pairings. We also prove the security of our scheme against chosen message attack in random oracle model. Our scheme’s construction avoids bilinear pairing operations but still provides signature in the ID-based setting and reduces running time heavily.

The interdisciplinary approach is a unique feature and guarantees important new insights in the social, ethical and legal implications of these technologies for the individual and society as a whole. Its aim is to shed light on the tension between secrecy and transparency in the digital era. A special focus is put from the perspectives of psychology, medical ethics and European law on the contradiction between individuals’ motivations for consented processing of personal data and their fears about unknown disclosure, transferal and sharing of personal data via information and communication technologies (named the “privacy paradox”). Potential benefits and harms for the individual and society resulting from the use of computers, mobile phones, the Internet and social media are being discussed. Furthermore, the authors point out the ethical and legal limitations inherent to the processing of personal data in a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Finally, they seek to demonstrate that the impact of information and communication technology use on the individuals’ well-being, the latter being closely correlated with a high level of fundamental rights protection in Europe, is a promising feature of the socalled “e-democracy” as a new way to collectively attribute meaning to large-scale online actions, motivations and ideas." .

Matching twig pattern against XML data is a fundamental problem in querying information from XML documents. For a probabilistic XML document, each twig answer has a probabilistic value because of the uncertainty of data. The twig answers that have small probabilistic value are useless to the users, and usually users only want to get the answers with the k largest probabilistic values. To this end, existing algorithms for ordinary XML documents cannot be directly applicable due to the need for handling probability distributional nodes and efficient calculation of top-k probabilities of answers in probabilistic XML. In this paper, we address the problem of finding twig answers with top-k probabilistic values against probabilistic XML documents directly. We propose a new encoding scheme called PEDewey for probabilistic XML in this paper. Based on this encoding scheme, we then design two algorithms for finding answers of top-k probabilities for twig queries. One is called ProTJFast, to process probabilistic XML data based on element streams in document order, and the other is called PTopKTwig, based on the element streams ordered by the path probability values. Experiments have been conducted to study the performance of these algorithms." .

To ensure the security of the outsourced data, it also must allow data user to periodically verify integrity of the data which was outsourced to an untrusted cloud server at a relatively low cost. To solve this problem, most recent auditing protocols are mainly based on the traditional-public key infrastructure. In this infrastructure, the auditor must validate the certificates of data user before auditing data integrity. Thus, it results in a large amount of computation cost and is not suitable to the multi-user setting. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose two efficient ID-based public auditing protocols for the outsourced data by combing Water’s signature and public auditing for the outsourced data. And the two protocols are provably secure in the standard security model. Especially, our optimized protocol has constant communication overhead and computation cost. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first ID-based auditing for data integrity in the standard security model. By comparison with Wang et al.’s scheme and Tan et al.’s scheme, our protocols have the large advantages over the other two schemes in terms of communication cost and computation cost. Simulation results show that our proposed ID-based auditing protocols are the most efficient among three schemes in terms of computation cost." .

A crucial problem is how to efficiently track an object’s trajectory in real-time, in particular if the trajectory data is sensed at the mobile object and thus has to be communicated over a wireless network. We propose a family of tracking protocols that allow trading the communication cost and the amount of trajectory data stored at a MOD off against the spatial accuracy. With each of these protocols, the MOD manages a simplified trajectory that does not deviate by more than a certain accuracy bound from the actual movement. Moreover, the different protocols enable several trade-offs between computational costs, communication cost, and the reduction in the trajectory data: Connection-Preserving Dead Reckoning minimizes the communication cost using dead reckoning, a technique originally designed for tracking an object’s current position. Generic Remote Trajectory Simplification (GRTS) further separates between tracking of the current position and simplification of the past trajectory and can be realized with different line simplification algorithms. For both protocols, we discuss how to bound the space consumption and computing time at the moving object and thereby present an effective compression technique to optimize the reduction performance of real-time line simplification in general. Our evaluations with hundreds of real GPS traces show that a realization of GRTS with a simple simplification heuristic reaches 85–90% of the best possible reduction rate, given by retrospective offline simplification. A realization with the optimal line simplification algorithm by Imai and Iri even reaches more than 97% of the best possible reduction rate." .

These organizations may want to utilize all of the data to create more accurate predictive models while revealing neither their training data/databases nor the instances to be classified.

Data compression is one of the effective solutions, where reference-based compression strategies can typically achieve superior compression ratios compared to the ones not relying on any reference. ResultsThis paper presents a lossless light-weight reference-based compression algorithm namely LW-FQZip to compress FASTQ data. The three components of any given input, i.e., metadata, short reads and quality score strings, are first parsed into three data streams in which the redundancy information are identified and eliminated independently. Particularly, well-designed incremental and run-length-limited encoding schemes are utilized to compress the metadata and quality score streams, respectively. To handle the short reads, LW-FQZip uses a novel light-weight mapping model to fast map them against external reference sequence(s) and produce concise alignment results for storage. The three processed data streams are then packed together with some general purpose compression algorithms like LZMA. LW-FQZip was evaluated on eight real-world NGS data sets and achieved compression ratios in the range of 0.111-0.201. This is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art lossless NGS data compression algorithms. ConclusionsLW-FQZip is a program that enables efficient lossless FASTQ data compression. It contributes to the state of art applications for NGS data storage and transmission. LW-FQZip is freely available online at: http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/zhuzx/LWFQZip." .

LCCs are a stronger form of LDCs (Locally Decodable Codes) which have received a lot of attention recently due to their many applications and surprising constructions. In this work, we show a separation between linear 2-query LDCs and LCCs over finite fields of prime order. Specifically, we prove a lower bound of the form p Ω(δd) on the length of linear 2-query LCCs over F p , that encode messages of length d. Our bound improves over the known bound of 2 Ω(δd) [8,10,6] which is tight for LDCs. Our proof makes use of tools from additive combinatorics which have played an important role in several recent results in theoretical computer science. We also obtain, as corollaries of our main theorem, new results in incidence geometry over finite fields. The first is an improvement to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem over finite fields [14] and the second is a new analog of Beck's theorem over finite fields.

In this architecture, public channels are utilized to exchange information between end users and remote servers at anytime and anywhere. To achieve confidentiality and integrity for transferred data, the related parties have to authenticate each other and negotiate a secret session key to encrypt and decrypt exchanged messages. Since the Lamport’s pioneering authentication work in 1981, numerous mechanisms have been proposed to enhance security as well as reduce computation and payload data. Recently, Chuang and Chen proposed a multi-server authenticated agreement protocol employing a smart card and biometric data to eliminate the weaknesses caused by parameters related to low-entropy human-memorable passwords that are stored in a physical location. However, Mishra et al. showed that Chuang and Chen’s protocol is not only vulnerable to multiple attacks but also suffers from the drawback of variation of biometric data. To overcome these weaknesses, they proposed an enhanced three-factor authenticated key agreement protocol using the low-error rate Biohashing technique. Unfortunately, we found that Mishra et al.’s scheme is also vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack, the traceable user attack, the impersonation attack, and the pre-shared key attack. Furthermore, the protocol does not provide any user revocation mechanism to control user accesses. In this novel untraceable authenticated key agreement scheme, we adopt the Hamming distance to verify encrypted Biohash codes and a public-key technique to construct the revocation mechanism. Our scheme achieves not only zero errors of biometric verification but also secure against all known attacks." .

Energy efficiency and communication security will increase the confidence of the users in adopting such remote healthcare systems. Key agreement and authentication schemes play an important role in the security of remote healthcare systems. The nodes in a WBAN exchange information in order to complete the key agreement and authentication process. In the literature, numerous schemes have used heavy mathematical calculations or overloaded with excessive information exchange. This paper presents a bloom filter-based key agreement scheme using k-mean clustering for WBANs. The key agreement and authentication is performed in clustered environment using k-mean clustering. This makes the scheme more robust and energy efficient. The keys are generated from the EKG values of the human body. The proposed mechanism is energy efficient and secure, due to its more efficient key generation and less memory utilizations for remote healthcare systems. Moreover, the proposed scheme is analyzed and compared with a state-of-the-art scheme in terms of energy consumption, memory utilizations, processing complexity, and false positive rate (FPR).

We present the design of ObjectGlobe, a distributed and open query processor for Internet data sources.

The goal of the ObjectGlobe project is to establish an open marketplace in which data and query processing capabilities can be distributed and used by any kind of Internet application. Furthermore, ObjectGlobe integrates cycle providers (i.e., machines) which carry out query processing operators. The overall picture is to make it possible to execute a query with – in principle – unrelated query operators, cycle providers, and data sources. Such an infrastructure can serve as enabling technology for scalable e-commerce applications, e.g., B2B and B2C market places, to be able to integrate data and data processing operations of a large number of participants. One of the main challenges in the design of such an open system is to ensure privacy and security. We discuss the ObjectGlobe security requirements, show how basic components such as the optimizer and runtime system need to be extended, and present the results of performance experiments that assess the additional cost for secure distributed query processing. Another challenge is quality of service management so that users can constrain the costs and running times of their queries." .

Past work in this area have mainly focused on statically scaling homogeneous storage devices. However, heterogeneous devices are quickly being adopted for storage scaling since they are usually faster, larger, more widely available, and more cost-effective. We propose BroadScale, an algorithm based on Random Disk Labeling, to dynamically scale heterogeneous storage systems by distributing data objects according to their device weights. Assuming a random placement of objects across a group of heterogeneous storage devices, our optimization objectives when scaling are to ensure a uniform distribution of objects, redistribute a minimum number of objects, and maintain fast data access with low computational complexity. We show through experimentation that BroadScale achieves these requirements when scaling heterogeneous storage." .

One aspect of these codes is that the overhead (number of coded symbols beyond the number of information symbols required to achieve decoding completion with high probability) is linear in k. This work considers a new class of random codes which have the following advantages: (i) the overhead is constant (in the range of 5 to 10), independent of the number of data symbols being encoded (ii) the probability of completing decoding for such an overhead is essentially one (iii) the codes are effective for a number of information symbols as low as a few tens (iv) the only probability distribution required is the uniform distribution. The price for these properties is that the decoding complexity is greater, on the order of k 3/2. However, for the lower values of k where these codes are of particular interest, this increase in complexity might be outweighed by their advantages. The parity check matrices of these codes are chosen at random as windowed matrices, i.e. for each column an initial starting position of a window of length w is chosen and the succeeding w positions are chosen at random as zero or one. It can be shown that it is necessary that w=O(k 1/2) for the probabilistic matrix rank properties to behave as a non-windowed random matrix. The sufficiency of the condition has so far been established by extensive simulation, although other arguments strongly support this conclusion. The properties of the codes described depend heavily on the rank properties of random matrices over finite fields. Known results on such matrices are briefly reviewed and several conjectures needed in the discussion of the code properties, are stated. The likelihood of the validity of the conjectures is supported through extensive experimentation. Mathematical proof of the conjectures would be of great value for their own interest as well of the particular coding application described here." .

In this paper, we present the ArchIS system that achieves these objectives by supporting a temporally grouped data model on top of RDBMS. ArchIS’ architecture uses (a) XML to support temporally grouped (virtual) representations of the database history, (b) XQuery to express powerful temporal queries on such views, (c) temporal clustering and indexing techniques for managing the actual historical data in a relational database, and (d) SQL/XML for executing the queries on the XML views as equivalent queries on the relational database. The performance studies presented in the paper show that ArchIS is quite effective at storing and retrieving under complex query conditions the transaction-time history of relational databases, and can also assure excellent storage efficiency by providing compression as an option. This approach achieves full-functionality transaction-time databases without requiring temporal extensions in XML or database standards, and provides critical support to emerging application areas such as RFID." .

To perform well at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to be very close to the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, random regular LDPC code and a simple semialgebra LDPC (SA-LDPC) code are discussed in MLC with parallel independent decoding (PID).

While both issues are explored respectively in depth, they have not been studied together, that is, the problem of semantic cache for secure XML query answering has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we present an interesting joint of these two aspects and propose an efficient framework of semantic cache for secure XML query answering, which can improve the performance of XML database systems under secure circumstances. Our framework combines access control, user privilege management over XML data and the state-of-the-art semantic XML query cache techniques, to ensure that data are presented only to authorized users in an efficient way. To the best of our knowledge, the approach we propose here is among the first beneficial efforts in a novel perspective of combining caching and security for XML database to improve system performance.

This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm for session key exchange. The algorithm is designed based on most of the well-proven algorithms, including RSA, D-H, MAC authentication and SHA one-way function, and most of the popular security concepts such as digital signature, digital certificates and verifications under PKI. With an integration of these security concepts and algorithms, the proposed algorithm inherits the properties of these algorithms and realizes highly secure session key exchanging, to meet the required security level of institutions for sensitive communications. It not only improves the possible deficiencies of the algorithms that are singly based on RSA or D-H, but also expands the limits when a hybrid algorithm is applied. Moreover, using MAC codes to ensure the authenticity of the call itself (in addition to ensuring the authenticity of the call parties) meets the communications security concern (in addition to the information security concerns) which relevant algorithms might fail to consider." .

The GPRS and the UMTS architecture carry the heritage of the GSM's philosophy regarding the user/network authentication and the data ciphering. So, the corresponding three nodes (MS, VLR, and HLR) of these systems are involved as well in the authentication and data ciphering procedures. Moreover, the methods of the conventional cryptography have been adopted by all three systems. This paper describes in brief the subscriber authentication and data ciphering, as they are recommended by the Specifications for all three aforementioned systems. Based on what the specifications define, we pinpoint the vulnerable points of the systems, exposed to third party attacks, and propose asymmetric cryptography procedures for their coverage, consisting of the introduction of public–private key pairs for the transactions between the VLR-HLR, as well as the MS-VLR. On the other hand, the nature of the services constituting a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) renders the telecommunication operators the main candidates for the development of PKIs fully or partially fledged. The private–public key pair, stored by the PLMN operator in the SIM, for the GSM/GPRS case, or in the USIM for the UMTS case and created to deal initially with internal system functions, can easily be extended, adopted and employed in secure e/m-transactions, if bound to a digital certificate, in the case the PLMN operator supports PKI services as well." .

Our approach uses a probabilistic model of movie popularity in data distribution and replication to balance user requests with available disk I/O bandwidth.

Existing IBEKS schemes only focus on supporting efficient and complex queries for the private key holder, while the authority, who is in charge of the generation of the private keys for users, cannot efficiently search the encrypted data. However, some applications might require the authority to efficiently search the encrypted data intended for any user. To address this problem, in this paper, we introduce a new primitive named dual trapdoor identity-based encryption with keyword search (DTIBEKS). In this primitive, the authority can use a peculiar way to produce one more trapdoor, which allows the authority to search any identity’s encrypted data. We formally give the definition and security model for DTIBEKS, and then propose a novel DTIBEKS scheme. We further prove the security of our proposed DTIBEKS without random oracles. It is worth noting that our scheme can be easily transformed into identity-based encryption with fuzzy keyword search." .

XML database systems emerge as a result of the acceptance of the XML data model. Recent works have followed the promising approach of building XML database management systems on underlying RDBMS’s. Achieving query processing performance reduces to two questions: (i) How should the XML data be decomposed into data that are stored in the RDBMS? (ii) How should the XML query be translated into an efficient plan that sends one or more SQL queries to the underlying RDBMS and combines the data into the XML result? We provide a formal framework for XML Schema-driven decompositions, which encompasses the decompositions proposed in prior work and extends them with decompositions that employ denormalized tables and binary-coded XML fragments. We provide corresponding query processing algorithms that translate the XML query conditions into conditions on the relational tables and assemble the decomposed data into the XML query result. Our key performance focus is the response time for delivering the first results of a query. The most effective of the described decompositions have been implemented in XCacheDB, an XML DBMS built on top of a commercial RDBMS, which serves as our experimental basis. We present experiments and analysis that point to a class of decompositions, called inlined decompositions, that improve query performance for full results and first results, without significant increase in the size of the database." .

Due to the open nature of a WSN, it is relatively easy for an adversary to eavesdrop and trace packets in order to capture the receiver. Therefore, location privacy, particularly the location privacy of the sink node, requires ultimate protection because of its critical position in WSNs. In this paper, we propose a sink location privacy protection scheme by injecting fake packets, but every real packet is still routed along its shortest path. The fake packets are routed to some random destinations and some fake sinks in order to provide the path diversity. It is difficult for an attacker to distinguish the real packets from the fake packets. Thus, the chance of finding the real sink by packet-tracing attack is reduced. Privacy analysis shows that the sink location privacy can be protected better with higher successful probability. We examine the packet travel delay, safe time, and energy consumption by both mathematical analysis and simulations." .

However, in practice, data user’s access permission always dynamically varies with data owner’s preferences. Moreover, existing SE schemes which are based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) incur heavy computational burden through attribution revocation and policy updating. To allow data owner to flexibly grant access permissions, we design a secure cryptographic primitive called as efficient data owner authorized search over encrypted data scheme through utilizing identity-based encryption (IBE) technique.

The third is to let the network access users’ RFID tags while adhering to a privacy protocol (network model). The perception and reactions of future users to these three privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are compared in the present article and an attempt is made to understand the reasoning behind their preferences. The main conclusion is that users do not trust complex PETs as they are envisioned today. Instead, they prefer to kill RFID chips at store exits even if they appreciate after sales services. Enhancing trust through security and privacy ‘visibility’ as well as PET simplicity may be the road to take for PET engineers in UbiComp." .

However, if single power traces reveal some exponent bits with certainty, an attack by Fouque et al. (Power attack on small RSA public exponent. Springer, Berlin, pp 339–353, 2006) applies that recovers the exponent. Since this attack becomes infeasible if some of these assumed exponent bits are incorrect it has not been assumed to be a realistic threat in the context of side-channel attacks. In this paper we present three generic attack variants (basic attack, enhanced attack, alternate attack), which work in the presence of considerable error rates at each bit position, disproving the hypothesis that mere exponent blinding is always sufficient to protect SPA-resistant implementations against any type of power attacks. Simulation experiments confirm that for small blinding factors the basic attack permits error rates of more than $$25~\\%$$ 25% . The enhanced attack allows smaller error rates but requires much less power traces and computations. Unlike the basic attack and the enhanced attack the alternate attack (against ECC and RSA without CRT) cannot effectively be prevented by simply enlarging the blinding factor.

Unfortunately, these activities, services, information and devices are the targets of cybercrimes. Verifying the user legitimacy to use/access a digital device or service has become of the utmost importance. Authentication is the frontline countermeasure of ensuring only the authorized user is granted access; however, it has historically suffered from a range of issues related to the security and usability of the approaches. They are also still mostly functioning at the point of entry and those performing sort of re-authentication executing it in an intrusive manner. Thus, it is apparent that a more innovative, convenient and secure user authentication solution is vital. This paper reviews the authentication methods along with the current use of authentication technologies, aiming at developing a current state-of-the-art and identifying the open problems to be tackled and available solutions to be adopted. It also investigates whether these authentication technologies have the capability to fill the gap between high security and user satisfaction. This is followed by a literature review of the existing research on continuous and transparent multimodal authentication. It concludes that providing users with adequate protection and convenience requires innovative robust authentication mechanisms to be utilized in a universal level.

Nowadays XML plays a fundamental role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web. As XML allows designers to create their own customized tags, enables the definition, transmission, validation, and interpretation of data between applications, devices and organizations, lots of works in soft computing employ XML to take control and responsibility for the information, such as fuzzy markup language, and accordingly there are lots of XML-based data or documents. However, most of mobile and interactive ubiquitous multimedia devices have restricted hardware such as CPU, memory, and display screen. So, it is essential to compress an XML document/element collection to a brief summary before it is delivered to the user according to his/her information need. Query-oriented XML text summarization aims to provide users a brief and readable substitution of the original retrieved documents/elements according to the user’s query, which can relieve users’ reading burden effectively. We propose a query-oriented XML summarization system QXMLSum, which extracts sentences and combines them as a summary based on three kinds of features: user’s queries, the content of XML documents/elements, and the structure of XML documents/elements. Experiments on the IEEE-CS datasets used in Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval show that the query-oriented XML summary generated by QXMLSum is competitive." .

How to achieve the energy sellers and buyers’ interact efficiently is a challenging problem for smart grid. The auction requires energy buyers to provide their private bid information to the energy auction servers. However, energy buyers usually do not expect the real information of the bid get leaked out, especially known by other competitors. That means the energy sellers need to inquire suitable bids while preserving the privacy of the energy buyers. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving degree-matching (PPDM) multi-attribute auction scheme which the winner is generated by comparing sorted all of matching degree between sale solution supplied by energy sellers and biddings submitted by energy buyers. Also, the quantitative and qualitative attributes are classified as quantitative assessment finally in energy sellers and buyers’ bid. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme based on the difficulty of integer factorization assumption can secure auction privacy, multi-attribute matching, personalized search, and ranked search. Furthermore, performance evaluation shows that the PPDM can significantly reduce computation overhead and it also has moderate communication overhead." .

However, many public-key encryption schemes do not resist the side-channel attacks which can be applied to the encryption instances implemented on a chip or cloud to obtain partial information leakage about the secret states, as the traditional security model of public-key encryption does not capture this kind of attacks. Also, the adversary can inject fault to tamper with the secret key and observe the output of the public-key encryption scheme under this modified key which is called “related-key attacks”. Inspired by these, the models of key-leakage attacks and related-key attacks are formalized, respectively. In this paper, we present a method to construct public-key encryption schemes against both weak key-leakage attacks and linear related-key attacks from extractable hash proof systems (EHPS or XHPS). Specifically, we first transform ABOEHPS to weak leakage-resilient ABOEHPS and add Key Homomorphism and Fingerprinting properties to it. Then, based on this new ABOEHPS, we construct weak leakage-resilient adaptive trapdoor relation with these two properties and public-key encryption schemes against both weak key-leakage attacks and linear related-key attacks can be constructed from it.

Furthermore, the corresponding joint resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the optimization problems. The simulation results demonstrate that different optimization strategies have different resource allocation and performance for each user. The optimization strategy 1) performs the best in terms of average PSNR of all users, the optimization strategy 2) achieves more fair result, and the optimization strategy 3) achieves a good balance. The strategy 3) can improve the performance for users with bad channel condition, while little loss is caused for users with good channel condition." .

In particular, organizations are faced with the conflicting goals of (a) releasing this data and (b) protecting the privacy of the individuals to whom the data pertains. Especially, there is a conflict between the need to release precise geographic information (which is essential to many healthcare research fields such as spatial epidemiology) and the requirement to censor or generalize the same information for the sake of privacy protection. Ultimately, the challenge is to anonymize data in order to comply with government privacy policies while reducing the loss in geographic information as much as possible. In this paper, we present novel component approaches used to configure the Voronoi-Based Aggregation System (VBAS) as well as an in-depth comparison of their effectiveness. VBAS is a system which protects privacy by enforcing k-anonymity via the aggregation of regions of fine granularity into larger regions. We additionally discuss heuristics rooted in linear programming which we have also integrated in our system. Based on extensive comparisons, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches we tested. This enables us to make recommendations on how to satisfy user requirements via the selection of specific combinations of such approaches." .

In the first part of the paper we present two new families of list accessing algorithms. The first family is of optimal, 2-competitive, deterministic online algorithms. This family, called the MRI (MOVE-TO-RECENT-ITEM) family, includes as members the well-known MOVE-TO-FRONT (MTF) algorithm and the recent, more ``conservative'' algorithm TIMESTAMP due to Albers. So far MOVE-TO-FRONT and TIMESTAMP were the only algorithms known to be optimal in terms of their competitive ratio. This new family contains a sequence of algorithms { A(i) } i \\geq 1 where A(1) is equivalent to TIMESTAMP and the limit element A(∈fty) is \\mtf. Further, in this class, for each i , the algorithm A(i) is more conservative than algorithm A(i+1) in the sense that it is more reluctant to move an accessed item to the front, thus giving a gradual transition from the conservative TIMESTAMP to the ``reckless'' MTF. The second new family, called the PRI (PASS-RECENT-ITEM) family, is also infinite and contains TIMESTAMP. We show that most algorithms in this family attain a competitive ratio of 3. In the second, experimental, part of the paper we report the results of an extensive empirical study of the performances of a large set of online list accessing algorithms (including members of our MRI and PRI families). The algorithms' access cost performances were tested with respect to a number of different request sequences. These include sequences of independent requests generated by probability distributions and sequences generated by Markov sources to examine the influence of locality. It turns out that the degree of locality has a considerable influence on the algorithms' absolute and relative costs, as well as on their rankings. In another experiment we tested the algorithms' performances as data compressors in two variants of the compression scheme of Bentley et al. In both experiments, members of the MRI and PRI families were found to be among the best performing algorithms." .

Lots of researchers are investigating and designing novel authentication schemes to prevent such attacks. However, the biggest challenge is how to protect biometric data while keeping the practical performance of identity verification systems. For the sake of tackling this problem, this paper presents a novel finger vein recognition algorithm by using secure biometric template scheme based on deep learning and random projections, named FVR-DLRP. FVR-DLRP preserves the core biometric information even with the user’s password cracked, whereas the original biometric information is still safe. The results of experiment show that the algorithm FVR-DLRP can maintain the accuracy of biometric identification while enhancing the uncertainty of the transformation, which provides better protection for biometric authentication." .

For privacy considerations, private data must be encrypted before outsourcing, and this makes the method of plaintext keyword search infeasible. However, it is critical to enable encrypted data able to be searched. Considering the requirements of practical application scenarios, the function of efficient multi-keyword ranked search and similarity search based on relevance score is necessary for data users. There proposed a number of multi-keyword searchable encryption schemes to try to meet this demand. However, most existing schemes do not satisfy required dynamic update simultaneously. In this paper, a novel and efficient dynamic multi-keyword ranked search scheme improved from traditional secure kNN computation is proposed. The proposed scheme incorporates the similarity measure “coordinate matching” and “inner product similarity” to improve the relevance of search keywords to the relevant cloud files. A reverse data structure is introduced to allow users to perform dynamic operations on document collection, either inserting or deleting. The sparse matrix is used to replace the dense large-scale matrix in index encryption and query vector encryption to improve efficiency. Experiments show that the proposed scheme indeed reduces the overhead of computation and storage compared to MRSE scheme, concurrently guaranteeing privacy and efficiency." .

Some schemes raise privacy and security concerns as they reveal confidential information about the RFID tag bearer and allow their world-wide tracking. In this paper, we present a novel cryptographic authentication protocol that fills the security holes imposed by RFID technology.

With this model you can leave most of the content of your electronic wallet at the security of your residential electronic keeper, while roaming with your favorite mobile terminals. Emerging mobile handsets with both short range Bluetooth and cellular GPRS communications provide a sufficient communication platform for this electronic wallet architecture. However, new security requirements must be addressed, and new threats of attack must be carefully analyzed and met with appropriate security protocols. The proposed approach is fundamentally distinct from the remote wallet proposals, in that it protects important user requirements and takes a multiparty security approach using a fully decentralized architecture. Technically, the user remains in control of the input/output and usage of his credentials, likely carried by smart cards. At the same time, the model provides a solution to the pressing practical problem of the multitude of special-branded cards the user has to carry and sort. Currently used magnetic stripe and chip cards with applications such as debit and credit transactions are easily included within the architecture with minor enhancement to these legacy systems and their functionality. We show in this paper how an account-based payment system can be solved with the proposed architecture. Our claim is that users achieve payment mobility and independence of both terminals and payment service providers while maintaining secure access to their payment authorization credentials." .

In fact, the voter-side platform (voter’s PC) is easily vulnerable to malicious software (cyber-attacks) and can totally breach security of the entire voting protocol. We have proposed ESIV: an end-to-end secure internet-voting system that highly guarantees: voter and server-side platform’s security, verifiability, fairness, resistance to bribery/coercion and voting authorities collusion besides simultaneous election support while preserving eligibility, anonymity, privacy and trust. In addition, we utilize Java Card 3 technology as an independent secure web-server which is connected directly to network in order to send/receive HTTP(S) requests using high-speed interfaces. This technology brings about independence from utilizing any trusted device at voter-side and provides end-to-end security.

This is realized by equipping vehicles with capacity to talk to each other. Vehicular communication security and privacy are viewed as a major obstacle to widely deploy VANET. Most existing works devote to the authenticity and identity anonymity of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate secure vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications for applications in which a traffic monitoring center collects information about the traffic and road status through VANET. We propose a scalable privacy-enhanced traffic monitoring (SPETM) framework. In this framework, the traffic monitoring center can collect authenticated individual vehicle driving status and the road usage information, with the help of the distributed roadside units (RSUs) who can simultaneously obtain local view of the traffic in their respective domains. Neither external attackers, malicious vehicles nor compromised RSUs can know the identity of the reporting vehicles, which guarantees enhanced privacy for vehicles. However, misbehaving vehicles abusing the privacy mechanisms can be jointly traced by the semi-trusted vehicle management authorities, which provides desirable liability in privacy-preserving vehicular reports. We instantiate a concrete SPETM scheme with well-established cryptographic technologies. Thorough analyses show that our scheme is secure and practical for deployment." .

In this paper, we analyze the security of a protocol which has been recently proposed by Lo and Yeh (2010). Despite the designers’ claim, which is optimal security, however, we present a passive attack which can retrieve all secret parameters of the tag efficiently. The cost of this attack is eavesdropping only one session of protocol between the tag and a legitimate reader and 216 PRNG-function evaluations in off-line. In addition, we show that an active adversary can retrieve secret parameters more efficiently, that is, with the complexity of two consequence sessions of protocol and without the need for PRNG-function evaluation. The success probability of the given attacks are “1”. To counteract such flaws, we propose an enhanced EPC-compliant protocol entitled YAYA, by applying some minor modifications to the original protocol so that it provides the claimed security properties." .

The proposed protocol, called Noent, is based on cryptographic puzzles to avoid the indiscriminate disclose of the confidential information stored on tags and on an innovative role reversal distance-bounding protocol to distinguish between honest and rogue readers. The protocol provides moderate privacy protection (data and location) to single tags but its effectiveness increases hugely when it is used to protect a large population of tags (e.g., protection against inventory disclosure). Moreover, in comparison with classical approaches, Noent does not require an on-line database, which facilitates key updating and mitigates desynchronization attacks." .

Due to the high complexities of encryption and decryption, users are burdened with large computation cost. Fortunately, outsourcing technologies can be used to reduce the computation overhead for the ABE schemes. In the recent decade, the achievements of the outsourced ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) schemes are inspiring. But, the outsourcing encryption algorithms for CP-ABE schemes are not addressed properly since the encryption exponents are dynamic. In this paper, we present an efficient outsourced CP-ABE scheme with checkability, where the number of the exponential operations in the encryption can be reduced to a constant by introducing a blinding algorithm. Meanwhile, the ciphertext size is not increased. Furthermore, to guarantee the correctness of our scheme, we provide the verification mechanism based on a collision-resistance hash function, which allows the users to efficiently check the validity of messages and outsourced computation results. Besides, the proposed scheme is secure against replayable chosen ciphertext attacks based on Green’s outsourcing security model.

Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson have already shown that no deterministic algorithm can solve the agreement problem on asynchronous networks if any processor fails during the execution of the algorithm. Therefore, we consider only channel failures. The type of channel failure we consider in this paper is Byzantine failure, that is, channels fail by altering messages, sending false information, forging messages, losing messages at will, and so on. There are no restrictions on the behavior of a faulty channel. Therefore, a faulty channel may act as an adversary who forges messages on purpose to prevent the successful completion of the algorithm. Because we assume an asynchronous network, the channel delays are arbitrary. Thus, the faulty channels may not be detectable unless, for example, the faulty channels cause garbage to be sent. We present the first known agreement and leader election algorithm for asynchronous complete networks in which the processors are reliable but some channels may be Byzantine faulty. The algorithm can tolerate up to $$\\left[ {\\frac{{n - 2}}{2}} \\right]$$ faulty channels, where n is the number of processors in the network. We show that the bound on the number of faulty channels is optimal. When the processors terminate their corresponding algorithms, all the processors in the network will have the same correct vector, where the vector contains the private values of all the processors." .

Consider a collection of supermarket transactions that contains detailed information about items bought together by individuals. Even after removing all personal characteristics of the buyer, which can serve as links to his identity, the publication of such data is still subject to privacy attacks from adversaries who have partial knowledge about the set. Unlike most previous works, we do not distinguish data as sensitive and non-sensitive, but we consider them both as potential quasi-identifiers and potential sensitive data, depending on the knowledge of the adversary. We define a new version of the k-anonymity guarantee, the k m -anonymity, to limit the effects of the data dimensionality, and we propose efficient algorithms to transform the database. Our anonymization model relies on generalization instead of suppression, which is the most common practice in related works on such data. We develop an algorithm that finds the optimal solution, however, at a high cost that makes it inapplicable for large, realistic problems. Then, we propose a greedy heuristic, which performs generalizations in an Apriori, level-wise fashion. The heuristic scales much better and in most of the cases finds a solution close to the optimal. Finally, we investigate the application of techniques that partition the database and perform anonymization locally, aiming at the reduction of the memory consumption and further scalability. A thorough experimental evaluation with real datasets shows that a vertical partitioning approach achieves excellent results in practice." .

The publish/subscribe paradigm is a popular model for allowing publishers (i.e., data generators) to selectively disseminate data to a large number of widely dispersed subscribers (i.e., data consumers) who have registered their interest in specific information items. Early publish/subscribe systems have typically relied on simple subscription mechanisms, such as keyword or ”bag of words” matching, or simple comparison predicates on attribute values. The emergence of XML as a standard for information exchange on the Internet has led to an increased interest in using more expressive subscription mechanisms (e.g., based on XPath expressions) that exploit both the structure and the content of published XML documents. Given the increased complexity of these new data-filtering mechanisms, the problem of effectively identifying the subscription profiles that match an incoming XML document poses a difficult and important research challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel index structure, termed XTrie, that supports the efficient filtering of XML documents based on XPath expressions. Our XTrie index structure offers several novel features that, we believe, make it especially attractive for large-scale publish/subscribe systems. First, XTrie is designed to support effective filtering based on complex XPath expressions (as opposed to simple, single-path specifications). Second, our XTrie structure and algorithms are designed to support both ordered and unordered matching of XML data. Third, by indexing on sequences of elements organized in a trie structure and using a sophisticated matching algorithm, XTrie is able to both reduce the number of unnecessary index probes as well as avoid redundant matchings, thereby providing extremely efficient filtering. Our experimental results over a wide range of XML document and XPath expression workloads demonstrate that our XTrie index structure outperforms earlier approaches by wide margins." .

Previous solutions either require an index of size exponential in k or need Ω(m k ) time for searching. Motivated by the indexing of DNA, we investigate space efficient indexes that occupy only O(n) space. For k=1, we give an index to support matching in O(m+occ+log nlog log n) time. The previously best solution achieving this time complexity requires an index of O(nlog n) space. This new index can also be used to improve existing indexes for k≥2 errors. Among others, it can support 2-error matching in O(mlog nlog log n+occ) time, and k-error matching, for any k>2, in O(m k−1log nlog log n+occ) time." .

We propose a new multi-attribute index. Our approach combines the hB-tree, a multi-attribute index, and the $\\Pi$-tree, an abstract index which offers efficient concurrency and recovery methods. We call the resulting method the hB $^\\Pi$-tree. We describe several versions of the hB $^\\Pi$-tree, each using a different node-splitting and index-term-posting algorithm. We also describe a new node deletion algorithm. We have implemented all the versions of the hB $^\\Pi$-tree. Our performance results show that even the version that offers no performance guarantees, actually performs very well in terms of storage utilization, index size (fan-out), exact-match and range searching, under various data types and distributions. We have also shown that our index is fairly insensitive to increases in dimension. Thus, it is suitable for indexing high-dimensional applications. This property and the fact that all our versions of the hB $^\\Pi$-tree can use the $\\Pi$-tree concurrency and recovery algorithms make the hB $^\\Pi$-tree a promising candidate for inclusion in a general-purpose DBMS." .

In an ITS scenario, it is common to have a significant amount of onboard devices that comprise a cluster of nodes (a mobile network) that demand connectivity to the outside networks. This demand has to be satisfied without service disruption. Consequently, the mobility of the mobile network has to be managed. Due to the nature of mobile networks, efficient and lightweight protocols are desired in the ITS context to ensure adequate service performance. However, the security is also a key factor in this scenario. Since the management of the mobility is essential for providing communications, the protocol for managing this mobility has to be protected. Furthermore, there are safety-oriented services in this scenario, so user application data should also be protected. Nevertheless, providing security is expensive in terms of efficiency. Based on this considerations, we have developed a solution for managing the network mobility for ITS scenarios: the NeMHIP protocol. This approach provides a secure management of network mobility in an efficient manner. In this article, we present this protocol and the strategy developed to maintain its security and efficiency in satisfactory levels. We also present the developed analytical models to analyze quantitatively the efficiency of the protocol. More specifically, we have developed models for assessing it in terms of signaling cost, which demonstrates that NeMHIP generates up to 73.47% less signaling compared to other relevant approaches. Therefore, the results obtained demonstrate that NeMHIP is the most efficient and secure solution for providing communications in mobile network scenarios such as in an ITS context." .

Therefore, a secure and efficient payment system for general-purpose applications is undoubtedly becoming an important issue. Rivest and Shamir have proposed a micro-payment scheme which is user-specific and vendor-specific. However, in their scheme, it is required that the user generates a new payword chain for each vendor from which the user makes a purchase. In this paper, we propose a new micro-payment system that enables users to make purchases from multiple vendors. Only one payword chain has to be generated which makes this system very efficient. A sequence of payword chains which represents a set of small payments can be authenticated and payment can be made by an efficient method. A lower computation cost and improved system performance is also achieved. Therefore, the new micro-payment system has multiple practical applications." .

Security is defined in terms different from the requirements imposed on keys in classical cryptography. In quantum cryptography, the security of keys is expressed in terms of the closeness of the quantum state of an eavesdropper after key distribution to an ideal quantum state that is uncorrelated to the key of legitimate users. A metric of closeness between two quantum states is given by the trace metric. In classical cryptography, the security of keys is understood in terms of, say, the complexity of key search in the presence of side information. In quantum cryptography, side information for the eavesdropper is given by the whole volume of information on keys obtained from both quantum and classical channels. The fact that the mathematical apparatuses used in the proof of key security in classical and quantum cryptography are essentially different leads to misunderstanding and emotional discussions [1]. Therefore, one should be able to answer the question of how different cryptographic robustness criteria are related to each other. In the present study, it is shown that there is a direct relationship between the security criterion in quantum cryptography, which is based on the trace distance determining the distinguishability of quantum states, and the criterion in classical cryptography, which uses guesswork on the determination of a key in the presence of side information." .

In this research paper, secret sharing proxy signature could permit the shares of designated signers, called proxy signers, renew their own proxy shares periodically without changing the secret. In particular, our scheme applies the (t, n) threshold proxy signature scheme and allows any t or more then t signers to form a designated group from n proxy signers to sign messages on behalf of the original signer. In the proposed scheme, furthermore, a proxy signer can recover his/her own share from t other proxy shares without revealing any information about other proxy shares. Unless more than t other proxy signers cooperate and collude, the secret share algorithm is always secure. We compare the performance of four schemes: Hwang et al., Wen et al., Geng et al. and Fengying et al. with the performance of a scheme that has been proposed by the authors of this article earlier. In the proposed scheme, both the combiner and the secret share holder can verify the correctness of the information that they are receiving from each other. Therefore, the enhanced threshold proxy signature scheme is secure and efficient against notorious conspiracy attacks." .

Although early work concentrated on preserving sensitive node information and link information to prevent re-identification attacks, recent development has instigated a focus on preserving sensitive edge weight information such as shortest paths. Two types of privacy on edge weights have been proposed. One type of privacy attempts to add random noise edge weights to the graph while still maintaining the same shortest path. The other type of privacy, k-shortest path privacy, minimally perturbs edge weights so that there are at least k shortest paths. However, there might be insufficient paths that can be modified to the same path length. In this work, we present a new concept, called $$ k^{-}$$ k- -shortest path privacy, to allow anonymizing different numbers of shortest paths for different sources and destination vertex pairs. For a given privacy level k and a pair of source and destination vertices with $$k_i$$ ki paths between the two vertices, we propose a greedy-based algorithm trying to modify Never-Visited, Partially-Visited, and All-Visited edges, in sequence, from top$$-k$$ -k shortest paths (or $$k_i$$ ki available paths) so that all possess the same path length after modification. We use the weighted-proportional-based strategy to modify the edge weights. We also define a new privacy value to quantify the privacy level of $$k^{-}$$ k- -shortest path privacy. Numerical experiments showing the characteristics of the proposed algorithm are given. Comparison to k-shortest path privacy demonstrates that the proposed approach is more efficient and flexible than the previous model." .

Users enjoy services provided in PCEs only after their privacy issues being sufficiently addressed. That is, users could not be tracked down for wherever they are and whatever they are doing. However, service providers always want to authenticate the users and make sure they are accessing only authorized services in a legitimate way. In PCEs, such user authentication may include context authentication in addition to the entity authentication. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy enhanced anonymous authentication and access control scheme to secure the interactions between mobile users and services in PCEs with optional context authentication capability. The proposed scheme seamlessly integrates two underlying cryptographic primitives, blind signature and hash chain, into a highly flexible and lightweight authentication and key establishment protocol. It provides explicit mutual authentication and allows multiple current sessions between a user and a service, while allowing the user to anonymously interact with the service. The proposed scheme is also designed to be DoS resilient by requiring the user to prove her legitimacy when initializing a service session." .

In such entrusted management environment, security is an important issue for the user’s private data. The most basic solution is to encrypt user’s private data. However, if the encryption key is directly managed by cloud service provider (CSP) or PACS service provider (PSP), there is latent threat when it comes to the data loss or leakage which may be committed by malicious insiders. The ownership-guaranteed security framework (OGSF) divides encryption key into a single mandatory fragment and multiple optional fragments while mandating user to store the mandatory fragment in the user’s personal device and mandating CSP or PSP to manage the optional fragments. Because of this division of the management on the encryption key, the OGSF can resolve both threat from the malicious insider and the user’s mistake in same time." .

This study fuses concepts from stream processing and content-based image retrieval to construct a privacy-preserving framework for rapid development and deployment of video surveillance applications. Privacy policies, instantiated to as privacy filters, may be applied both granularly and hierarchically. Privacy filters are granular as they are applicable to specific objects appearing in the video streams. They are hierarchal because they can be specified at specific objects in the framework (e.g., users, cameras) and are combined such that the disseminated video stream adheres to the most stringent aspect specified in the cascade of all privacy filters relevant to a video stream or query. To support this privacy framework, we extend our Live Video Database Model with an informatics-based approach to object recognition and tracking and add an intrinsic privacy model that provides a level of privacy protection not previously available for real-time streaming video data. The proposed framework also provides a formal approach to implement and enforce privacy policies that are verifiable, an important step towards privacy certification of video surveillance systems through a standardized privacy specification language." .

However, recent developments in data mining present a new challenge for database security even when traditional database security techniques, such as database access control, are employed. This paper presents a data mining framework using semi-supervised learning that demonstrates the potential for privacy leakage in multi-relational databases. Many different types of semi-supervised learning techniques, such as the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method, can be used to demonstrate privacy leakage. However, we also introduce a new approach to semi-supervised learning, hyperclique pattern-based semi-supervised learning (HPSL), which differs from traditional semi-supervised learning approaches in that it considers the similarity among groups of objects instead of only pairs of objects. Our experimental results show that both the KNN and HPSL methods have the ability to compromise database security, although the HPSL is better at this privacy violation (has higher prediction accuracy) than the KNN method. Finally, we provide a principle for avoiding privacy leakage in multi-relational databases via semi-supervised learning and illustrate this principle with a simple preventive technique whose effectiveness is demonstrated by experiments." .

A proof of security of quantum key distribution with phase-temporal encryption is presented. This protocol provides the maximum critical error compared to other protocols up to which secure key distribution is guaranteed.

Tree patterns form a natural basis to query tree-structured data such as XML and LDAP. To improve the efficiency of tree pattern matching, it is essential to quickly identify and eliminate redundant nodes in the pattern. In this paper, we study tree pattern minimization both in the absence and in the presence of integrity constraints (ICs) on the underlying tree-structured database. In the absence of ICs, we develop a polynomial-time query minimization algorithm called CIM, whose efficiency stems from two key properties: (i) a node cannot be redundant unless its children are; and (ii) the order of elimination of redundant nodes is immaterial. When ICs are considered for minimization, we develop a technique for query minimization based on three fundamental operations: augmentation (an adaptation of the well-known chase procedure), minimization (based on homomorphism techniques), and reduction. We show the surprising result that the algorithm, referred to as ACIM, obtained by first augmenting the tree pattern using ICs, and then applying CIM, always finds the unique minimal equivalent query. While ACIM is polynomial time, it can be expensive in practice because of its inherent non-locality. We then present a fast algorithm, CDM, that identifies and eliminates local redundancies due to ICs, based on propagating ”information labels” up the tree pattern. CDM can be applied prior to ACIM for improving the minimization efficiency. We complement our analytical results with an experimental study that shows the effectiveness of our tree pattern minimization techniques." .

Multiple non-interfering channels are available in 802.11 and 802.15 based wireless networks. Capacity of such channels can be combined to achieve higher QoS performance than for single channel networks. The capacity of MANETs can be substantially increased by equipping each network node with multiple interfaces that can operate on multiple non-overlapping channels. However, new scheduling, channel assignment, and routing protocols are required to utilize the increased bandwidth in multichannel MANETs. In this paper, we propose an on-demand routing protocol M-QoS-AODV in multichannel MANETs that incorporates a distributed channel assignment scheme and routing discovery process to support multimedia communication and to satisfy QoS bandwidth requirement. The proposed channel assignment scheme can efficiently express the channel usage and interference information within a certain range, which reduces interference and enhances channel reuse rate. This cross-layer design approach can significantly improve the performance of multichannel MANETs over existing routing algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed M-QoS-AODV protocol can effectively increase throughput and reduce delay, as compared to AODV and M-AODV-R protocols." .

In two or more space dimensions, the dimension of the fundamental system is infinite, and may be identified with a ball. This set is referred to as the true fundamental locus. The fundamental system for a numerical scheme also forms a locus. As a first application, it is shown that a necessary condition for the uniform convergence of a numerical scheme is that the discrete locus should contain the true locus, and it is then shown it is impossible to satisfy this condition with a finite stencil. This shows that results of Shishkin concerning non-uniform convergence at parabolic boundaries are also generic for outflow boundaries. It is shown that the distance between the loci is related to the accuracy of the schemes provided that the loci are sufficiently close. However, if the loci depart markedly, then the situation is rather more complicated. Under suitable conditions, we develop an explicit numerical lower bound on the attainable relative error in terms of the coefficients in the stencil characterising the scheme and the loci." .

It can not only bring much convenience to patients, it also allows efficient sharing of medical information among researchers. As the medical data in PHR is sensitive, it has to be encrypted before outsourcing. To achieve fine-grained access control over the encrypted PHR data becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we provide an affirmative solution to this problem. We propose a novel PHR service system which supports efficient searching and fine-grained access control for PHR data in a hybrid cloud environment, where a private cloud is used to assist the user to interact with the public cloud for processing PHR data. In our proposed solution, we make use of attribute-based encryption (ABE) technique to obtain fine-grained access control for PHR data. In order to protect the privacy of PHR owners, our ABE is anonymous. That is, it can hide the access policy information in ciphertexts. Meanwhile, our solution can also allow efficient fuzzy search over PHR data, which can greatly improve the system usability. We also provide security analysis to show that the proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme." .

PGM is based on the prolific existence of certain kinds of factorization sets, calledlogarithmic signatures, for finite permutation groups. PGM is an endomorphic system with message space ℤ|G| for a given finite permutation groupG. In this paper we prove several algebraic properties of PGM. We show that the set of PGM transformations ℐ G is not closed under functional composition and hence not a group. This set is 2-transitive on ℤ|G| if the underlying groupG is not hamiltonian and not abelian. Moreover, if the order ofG is not a power of 2, then the set of transformations contains an odd permutation. An important consequence of these results is that the group generated by the set of transformations is nearly always the symmetric group ℒ|G|. Thus, allowing multiple encryption, any permutation of the message space is attainable. This property is one of the strongest security conditions that can be offered by a private-key encryption system." .

However, CMQV enjoys the security proof under gap Diffie-Hellman assumption as indicated by its creators.

Observing that the properties of Z-order space filling curves (or Z-order curves) perfectly match with the dominance relationships among data points in a geometrical data space, we, in this paper, develop and present a novel and efficient processing framework to evaluate skyline queries and their variants, and to support skyline result updates based on Z-order curves. This framework consists of ZBtree, i.e., an index structure to organize a source dataset and skyline candidates, and a suite of algorithms, namely, (1) ZSearch, which processes skyline queries, (2) ZInsert, ZDelete and ZUpdate, which incrementally maintain skyline results in presence of source dataset updates, (3) ZBand, which answers skyband queries, (4) ZRank, which returns top-ranked skyline points, (5) k-ZSearch, which evaluates k-dominant skyline queries, and (6) ZSubspace, which supports skyline queries on a subset of dimensions. While derived upon coherent ideas and concepts, our approaches are shown to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms that are specialized to address particular skyline problems, especially when a large number of skyline points are resulted, via comprehensive experiments." .

However, integrity and confidentiality of the data in cloud remains a challenge issue due to the loss of data possession. As a solution, some public data auditing schemes have been proposed in last several years. Most recently, Li et al. proposed an efficient public auditing scheme and claimed that it could reduce the cost of clients on generating verification metadata. In this paper, we analyze the security of Li et al.’s scheme and point out two weaknesses in it. We demonstrate that it cannot achieve the confidentiality for outsourced data and it is vulnerable to the proof forgery attack. To address these weaknesses, we propose an improved public auditing scheme, which can not only preserve the data privacy but also resist the proof forgery attack. Security analysis shows that our scheme is provably secure in a robust security model. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can overcome the weaknesses in Li et al.’s scheme at the cost of increasing computation overhead slightly." .

However, this kind of multimedia services needs to meet special requirements in terms of low complexity on both sides of the communication. Currently, most of mobile video communications are based on traditional codecs, which concentrates high complexity on the encoder side. Then, Distributed Video Coding tackles the problem of tougher complexity constraints for encoding algorithms at the expense of increasing decoder complexity. Taking into account the benefits of both paradigms, Distributed Video Coding to H.264 transcoding provides such multimedia systems with low complexity on both sides. Moreover, there is a H.264 extension called Scalable Video Coding which supports a variety of networks and devices. This proposed scheme moves the highly-complex processes to the transcoder, which has more resources. However, to achieve a low-delay transmission between mobile devices, transcoder time must be reduced. For this purpose, this paper focuses on reducing the complexity of the transcoder. To start with, the first transcoding stage is improved by means of a multicore processor, which executes the decoding algorithm in parallel. Then, the second stage uses the motion vectors generated during the first decoding stage to reduce the motion estimation complexity of the H.264 encoder and of its scalable extension as well. To support different Distributed Video Coding/H.264 patterns and profiles, the proposed transcoder includes a mapping between different kinds of frames and GOP lengths from both paradigms. As a result, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm to support mobile-to-mobile video communications which reduces the transcoding time about 70 % without significant rate-distortion penalty." .

One of the major challenges in designing a video encryption algorithm is to encrypt the vast amount of video data in real-time to satisfy the stringent time requirements. Video encryption algorithms can be classified according to their association with video compression into joint compression and encryption algorithms and compression-independent encryption algorithms. The latter have a clear advantage over the former regarding the incorporation into existing multimedia systems due to their independence of the video compression. In this paper we present the compression-independent video encryption algorithm Puzzle, which was inspired by the children game jigsaw puzzle. It comprises two simple encryption operations with low computational complexity: puzzling and obscuring. The scheme thereby dramatically reduces the encryption overhead compared to conventional encryption algorithms, such as AES, especially for high resolution video. Further outstanding features of Puzzle are a good trade-off between security demands and encryption efficiency, no impairment on video compression efficiency, and an easy integration into existing multimedia systems. This makes Puzzle particularly well-suited for these security-sensitive multimedia applications, such as videoconferencing, where maximal security and minimal encryption overhead are desired simultaneously." .

We propose a new cryptographic primitive called oblivious signature-based envelope (OSBE). Informally, an OSBE scheme enables a sender to send an envelope (encrypted message) to a receiver, and has the following two properties: (1) The receiver can open the envelope if and only if it has a third party’s (e.g., a certification authority’s) signature on an agreed-upon message. (2) The sender does not learn whether the receiver has the signature or not. We show that OSBE can be used to break policy cycles in automated trust negotiation (ATN) and to achieve oblivious access control. We develop a provably secure and efficient OSBE protocol for certificates signed using RSA signatures, as well as provably secure and efficient one-round OSBE protocols for Rabin and BLS signatures from recent constructions for identity-based encryption. We also present constructions for Generalized OSBE, where signatures on multiple messages (and possibly by different authorities) are required to open the envelope." .

When sharing data with a large number of entities described with fuzzy identities, the data owners must leverage a suitable encryption scheme to meet the security and efficiency requirements. (hierarchical) Identity-based encryption is a promising candidate to ensure fuzzy-entity data sharing while meeting the security requirement, but encounters the efficiency difficulty in multireceiver settings. We introduce the notion of subtree-based encryption (SBE) to support multireceiver data sharing mechanism in large-scale enterprises. Users in SBE are organized in a tree structure. Superior users can generate the secret keys to their subordinates. Unlike HIBE merely allowing a single decryption path, SBE enables encryption for a subset of users. We define the security notion for SBE, namely Ciphertext Indistinguishability against Adaptively Chosen-Sub-Tree and Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CST-CCA2). We propose two secure SBE schemes (SBEs). We first propose a basic SBEs against Adaptively Chosen-Sub-Tree and Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CST-CPA), in which we do not allow the attacker to get decryption results from other users in the security game. We then propose a CCA2-secure SBEs from the basic scheme without requiring any other cryptographic primitives. Our CCA2-secure scheme natively allows public ciphertext validity test, which is a useful property when a CCA2-secure SBEs is used to design advanced protocols and auditing mechanisms for fuzzy-entity data sharing." .

In this paper, we study the secure and efficient ECC speeding up algorithms for fast authentication in wireless sensor networks. We propose two fast algorithms based on constrained triple base number system to improve the efficiency for situations with and without precomputations. These new algorithms combine the sparsity of constrained TBNS with Yao algorithm to reduce the cost of scalar multiplication. Several experiments have been conducted using Magma software to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms.

One reaction to this situation is emerging: community-based efforts where citizens register and map surveillance cameras in their environment. Our study is inspired by this idea and proposes a user-specific and location-aware privacy awareness system. Using conventional smartphones, users not only can contribute to the camera maps, but also use community-collected data to be alerted of potential privacy violations. In our model, we define different levels of privacy awareness. For the highest level, we present a mechanism that allows users to directly interact with specially designed, trustworthy cameras.

A hardware security chip that is integrated into the camera is used to ensure authenticity, integrity and freshness of the provided camera status information." .

However, security requirements may compete with other requirements such as cost and usability. For this reason, they may only be satisfied partially and must be traded off against other requirements to achieve “good-enough security”. This paper proposes a novel approach to automate security requirements analysis in order to determine maximum achievable satisfaction level for security requirements and identify trade-offs between security and other requirements. We also propose a pruning algorithm to reduce the search space size in the analysis. We represent security concerns and requirements using asset, threat, and goal models, initially proposed in our previous work. To deal with uncertainty and partial requirements, satisfaction security concerns are quantified by leveraging the notion of composite indicators, which are computed through metric functions based on range normalisation. An SMT solver (Z3) interprets the models and automates the execution of our analyses. We illustrate and evaluate our approach by applying it to a substantive example of a service-based application for exchanging emails." .

Most averagecase analyses of nearest-neighbor searching algorithms are made under the simplifying assumption thatd is fixed and thatn is so large relative tod thatboundary effects can be ignored. This means that for any query point the statistical distribution of the data points surrounding it is independent of the location of the query point. However, in many applications of nearest-neighbor searching (such as data compression by vector quantization) this assumption is not met, since the number of data pointsn grows roughly as 2 d .Largely for this reason, the actual performances of many nearest-neighbor algorithms tend to be much better than their theoretical analyses would suggest. We present evidence of why this is the case. We provide an accurate analysis of the number of cells visited in nearest-neighbor searching by the bucketing andk-d tree algorithms. We assumem dpoints uniformly distributed in dimensiond, wherem is a fixed integer ≥2. Further, we assume that distances are measured in theL ∞ metric.

There are two streams of relevant research, targeting different privacy requirements. A large body of existing works focus on preventing node re-identification against adversaries with structural background knowledge, while some other studies aim to thwart edge disclosure. In general, the line of research on preventing edge disclosure is less fruitful, largely due to lack of a formal privacy model. The recent emergence of differential privacy has shown great promise for rigorous prevention of edge disclosure. Yet recent research indicates that differential privacy is vulnerable to data correlation, which hinders its application to network data that may be inherently correlated. In this paper, we show that differential privacy could be tuned to provide provable privacy guarantees even in the correlated setting by introducing an extra parameter, which measures the extent of correlation. We subsequently provide a holistic solution for non-interactive network data publication. First, we generate a private vertex labeling for a given network dataset to make the corresponding adjacency matrix form dense clusters. Next, we adaptively identify dense regions of the adjacency matrix by a data-dependent partitioning process. Finally, we reconstruct a noisy adjacency matrix by a novel use of the exponential mechanism. To our best knowledge, this is the first work providing a practical solution for publishing real-life network data via differential privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs well on different types of real-life network datasets." .

We adopt relaxed fault models in this paper, assuming the attacker can inject random single-byte faults into the penultimate round input of SHA-3. We also propose algorithms to find the lower bound on the number of fault injections needed to recover an entire internal state for the proposed attacks.

Internet broadcasting - the simultaneous distribution of live content streams to a large audience - has a number of interesting applications ranging from real-time broadcasts of audio/video streams for online concerts or sporting events to efficient and reliable large-scale software distribution. We identify three fundamental requirements for scalable broadcasting services: an efficient infrastructure for large-scale broadcasting, an ability to adapt the infrastructure to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications, and ease of deployment of the infrastructure. Although solutions such as the network-layer IP multicast approach and a slew of overlay distribution networks exist today, none of these technologies satisfactorily addresses all of the above concerns. In this paper, we argue that an application-customizable hybrid overlay is well suited to meet these challenges. To this end, we propose an architecture called scattercast that relies on a network of strategically located agents called ScatterCast proXies or SCXs. These agents collaboratively provide the broadcast service for a session. Clients locate a nearby SCX and tap into the session via that SCX. Scattercast constructs a hybrid overlay network composed of unicast links between SCXs that interconnect locally scoped multicast regions. Rather than define a single standardized service model for transmitting data on top of the overlay, scattercast builds a customizable transport framework that provides adaptability by leveraging application-defined semantics to drive the distribution of content. We demonstrate the ability of our architecture to provide efficient distribution via a set of simulation experiments. Finally, we present our experience with the adaptability of the framework by describing two applications, a real-time Internet radio and an online slide-presentation tool, both of which we have built on top of a prototype implementation of the architecture." .

These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information making the security issue one of the most important aspects to consider in this field. However, most of protocols optimize for the limited capabilities of sensor nodes and the application specific nature of the networks, but they are vulnerable to serious attacks. In this paper, a Secure Energy and Reliability Aware data gathering protocol (SERA) is proposed, which provides energy efficiency and data delivery reliability as well as security. The proposed protocol’s security was confirmed by a formal verification carried out using the AVISPA tool and analysis of the most common network layer attacks such as selective forwarding, sinkhole, Sybil, wormhole, HELLO flood, and acknowledgment spoofing attacks. Additionally, a visual simulation environment was developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol." .

The proposed technique results in 256 different S-boxes named as orbital S-boxes. Rigorous tests and comparisons are performed to analyse the cryptographic strength of each of the orbital S-boxes.

To alleviate network congestion and to reduce latency and workload on multimedia servers, the concept of multimedia proxy has been proposed to cache popular contents. Caching the data objects can relieve the bandwidth demand on the external network, and reduce the average time to load a remote data object to local side. Since the effectiveness of a proxy server depends largely on cache replacement policy, various approaches are proposed in recent years. In this paper, we discuss the cache replacement policy in a multimedia transcoding proxy. Unlike the cache replacement for conventional web objects, to replace some elements with others in the cache of a transcoding proxy, we should further consider the transcoding relationship among the cached items. To maintain the transcoding relationship and to perform cache replacement, we propose in this paper the RESP framework (standing for REplacement with Shortest Path). The RESP framework contains two primary components, i.e., procedure MASP (standing for Minimum Aggregate Cost with Shortest Path) and algorithm EBR (standing for Exchange-Based Replacement). Procedure MASP maintains the transcoding relationship using a shortest path table, whereas algorithm EBR performs cache replacement according to an exchanging strategy. The experimental results show that the RESP framework can approximate the optimal cache replacement with much lower execution time for processing user queries." .

As the network infrastructure of smart city, GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) can offer seamless network connection service for mobile subscribers. Whereas, because of the opening characteristics of wireless channel and various attacks, security becomes a vital issue in GLOMONET. Recently, Karuppiah and Saravanan proposed an enhanced user authentication for roaming service in GLOMONET. Unfortunately, their scheme lacks the features of session key update and perfect forward secrecy, and the session key can be revealed by home agent. Besides, their scheme faces clock synchronization problem and efficiency problem. In order to provide secure authentication service, a novel ECC (elliptic curve cryptosystem)- based user authentication scheme for roaming service in smart city is proposed in this manuscript. The security features of the proposed scheme are formally evaluated by using provable security method under random oracle model and also present informal analysis. In addition, comparative analysis is given among our scheme and relevant protocols.

In this article we present a systematic classification of available security regression testing approaches based on a solid study of background and related work to sketch which parts of the research area seem to be well understood and evaluated, and which ones require further research. For this purpose we extract approaches relevant to security regression testing from computer science digital libraries based on a rigorous search and selection strategy. Then, we provide a classification of these according to security regression approach criteria: abstraction level, security issue, regression testing techniques, and tool support, as well as evaluation criteria, for instance evaluated system, maturity of the system, and evaluation measures. From the resulting classification we derive observations with regard to the abstraction level, regression testing techniques, tool support as well as evaluation, and finally identify several potential directions of future research." .

The idea is based on a public-key cryptographical protocol, referred as zero-knowledge proof, which allows a user to prove that she has surely a valid biometric data without revealing the data. Hence, the scheme is free from the risk of disclosure of biometric data. Even if a malicious administrator has a privilege access to the private database, it is infeasible for him to learn the private template. This paper studies two well-known definitions, the cosine correlation and the Euclidean distance as similarities of given two feature vectors. Both similarities are defined with some multiplications and additions, which can be performed in privacy-preserving way because of the useful property of public-key commitment scheme, additive homomorphism. The estimation based on the experimental implementation shows that the private Euclidean distance scheme archives better accuracy in terms of false acceptance and rejection than the private cosine coloration scheme, but it requires about $$5/2 n \\ell$$ overhead to evaluate $$n$$-dimension feature vectors consisting of $$\\ell$$-bit integers." .

A wireless interconnection has turned out to be considerably more readily accessible these days. As individuals are growing mobile with regard to the fast lifestyle and working pattern, a new, smarter system came into existence that is termed as ‘Location Based Service’ (LBS). Such a system amalgamates the location data of a user with smart applications to deliver demanded services. Although LBS provide major openings for a large variety of markets and remarkable convenience to the end user, it also presents subtle privacy attack to user’s location information. Threat to the privacy sneaks into the system due to the prerequisite of sending user’s current location to the LBS provider to attain related services. Since the volume of data gathered from dynamic or stationary mobile users using LBS can be high, it is vital to outline the frameworks and systems in a manner that is secure and keep the location information private. In this paper, we perform an exploratory survey about the various techniques that have been suggested by many researchers based on centralized and distributed approaches, to preserve location privacy of the user. A large portion of these techniques has a trade-off between privacy, efficiency, applicability and quality of service. This paper details and analyses the various existing techniques for preserving location privacy of the participating user in LBS." .

In this paper, we propose a spectrum sharing scheme based on the cooperative energy and data transfer in both the time and space domains. When the primary base station (PB) transfers energy to the primary user (PU), the secondary user (SU) can transmit its own data simultaneously, and the interference of secondary data transmission becomes beneficial to improve the EH efficiency of the PU. Furthermore, the SU can assist the primary data relaying using the Alamouti coding technique to improve the link robustness through introducing the space diversity. With the energy and data cooperation from the SU, the primary data can be more quickly and reliably delivered, and hence more opportunities can be achieved for the spectrum sharing. Considering the dependence of the energy and data transfer, the throughput of both systems is investigated. The time allocation between EH and data transmission can be numerically determined by maximizing the throughput of secondary system under the throughput constraint of primary system. Performance results are presented to validate our theoretical analysis and provide some guidelines for the network configuration." .

The preprocessing construction of the search tree has a complexity ofO(n·log(n)) and requires only pointer swap operations. The query time to locate a start element for local search isO(log(n)) and the final point search by ‘point-in-polygon’ tests is independent of the total number of elements in the mesh and thus determined in constant time.

In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors consume most of their energy in data transmission and idle listening. Hence, efficient usage of energy can be ensured by improved protocols for topology control (i.e., coverage and connectivity), sleep scheduling, communication, and aggregation and compression of data. Though several protocols have been proposed for this purpose, they are not energy-efficient. We propose an integrated and energy-efficient protocol for Coverage, Connectivity, and Communication (C3) in WSNs. The C3 protocol uses received signal strength indicator to divide the network into virtual rings, defines clusters with clusterheads more probably at alternating rings, defines dings that are rings inside a cluster and uses triangular tessellation to identify redundant nodes, and communicates data to sink through clusterheads and gateways. The proposed protocol strives for near-optimal deployment, load balancing, and energy-efficient communication. Simulation results show that the C3 protocol ensures partial coverage of more than 90 % of the total deployment area, ensures one connected network, and facilitates energy-efficient communication while expending only one-fourth of the energy compared to other related protocols such as the coverage and connectivity protocol, and the layered diffusion-based coverage control." .

In many applications of WSN such as environmental monitoring and vehicle tracking, they may require to launch spatial queries for collecting and gathering sensory data for achieving certain goals. One such query is the $$K$$ K nearest neighbor (KNN) query, which aims to collect sensory data from $$k$$ k sensor nodes nearest to a certain query location. Techniques, namely the itinerary-based KNN query algorithms, are recently developed for facilitating KNN queries. Generally, these techniques propagate queries and collect data along a predetermined itinerary. However, query accuracy and boundary expansion are two challenges that are not well addressed. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel KNN query algorithm based on grid division routing in the setting of skewness distribution, where the itinerary is formed based on the connectivity of adjacent grid cells centers. This technique can achieve better query accuracy and cause less energy consumption by executing the query concurrently in subregions. Besides, the void region problem is well addressed based on the proximity of neighbor grid cells. Experiment result shows that our technique performs better in several aspects including query accuracy, data redundancy, and energy efficiency." .

Rolls and sheets of steel require a high level of customization depending on the specifications by the end user. This causes complexity in the management of finished goods, mainly due to the wide variety of dimensions of the rolls and sheets that are in the storage area. Due to the great variety of products built for stock, it is not possible to define a specific location in the storage area to place a product. For a company located in México, recent data show that the percentage of obsolete inventory (items stored more than 90 days) is 7 %. The objective of this work is to reduce this percentage to 0 %. From a time study, it was learned that searching for finished inventory averaged 15.5 min. This activity consumes a large amount of the available forklift operator time. This means that in situations during which the forklift operator is pressed for time, it may be necessary to abandon the search for the correct finished products in the storage, and instead ship products of more recent production. Over time, the repetition of this event generates increased rates of obsolete inventory. The proposal to solve the problem was to reduce the search times through the implementation of a system that identifies inventory using RFID technology. This will improve the quality of the stored information, and therefore reduce the rate of obsolescence." .

For instance, once the ubiquitous network in the smart city is attacked, all of the sensitive information and residents’ identities will be revealed. In many application scenarios, the anonymity of residents is a desirable security property. After all, nobody wants to be traced for his daily activity or personal habits. In this paper, we propose a generic identity-based broadcast encryption scheme which can satisfy information’s confidentiality and users’ anonymity simultaneously under chosen-ciphertext attacks. What is different from our previous work which was published in ACISP 2016 is that we present the proof of confidentiality and focus on the application environment. The generic IBBE construction has a desirable property that its public parameter size and private key size are constant as well as its decryption cost is independent of the number of receivers. Thus, no matter from which point of views, the construction is very appropriate for smart city information system." .

The basic idea is to select the different states of LFSR as the random entries of the measurement matrix and normalize these values to get independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with zero mean and variance $$\\frac{1}{N}$$ 1N , where N is the number of input samples. The initial seed for the LFSR system act as the key to the user to provide security. Since the measurement matrix is generated from the LFSR system, and memory overload to store the measurement matrix is avoided in the proposed system. Moreover, the proposed system can provide security maintaining the robustness to noise of the CS system. The proposed system is validated through different block-based CS techniques of images. To enhance security, the different blocks of images are measured with different measurement matrices so that the proposed encryption system can withstand known plaintext attack. A modulo division circuit is used to reseed the LFSR system to generate multiple random measurement matrices, whereby after each fundamental period of LFSR, the feedback polynomial of the modulo circuit is modified in terms of a chaotic value. The proposed secure robust CS paradigm for images is subjected to several forms of attacks and is proven to be resistant against the same. From experimental analysis, it is proven that the proposed system provides better performance than its counterparts." .

Through analysis and experimental validation, we show that (1) QFilter guarantees that only permissible portion of data is returned to the authorized users, (2) such access controls can be efficiently enforced without relying on security features of underlying storage system, and (3) such independency makes QFilter capable of many emerging applications, such as in-network access control and access control outsourcing." .

This survey gives an introduction and overview of promising methods that can be used for cooperative relaying: relay selection protocols, cooperative channel and network coding, and physical layer aspects such as cooperative modulation. The particular methods can be seen as building blocks that can be configured and optionally used for designing a system. They offer a large number of design options for relaying systems. Based on available hardware features, expected environment, and required services an efficient system needs to be tailored using the right subset of available methods." .

A related problem is that of ensuring privacy of the content owners while still maintaining an efficient index of distributed content. We address the problem of providing privacy-preserving search over distributed access-controlled content. Indexed documents can be easily reconstructed from conventional (inverted) indexes used in search. Currently, the need to avoid breaches of access-control through the index requires the index hosting site to be fully secured and trusted by all participating content providers. This level of trust is impractical in the increasingly common case where multiple competing organizations or individuals wish to selectively share content. We propose a solution that eliminates the need of such a trusted authority. The solution builds a centralized privacy-preserving index in conjunction with a distributed access-control enforcing search protocol. Two alternative methods to build the centralized index are proposed, allowing trade offs of efficiency and security. The new index provides strong and quantifiable privacy guarantees that hold even if the entire index is made public. Experiments on a real-life dataset validate performance of the scheme. The appeal of our solution is twofold: (a) content providers maintain complete control in defining access groups and ensuring its compliance, and (b) system implementors retain tunable knobs to balance privacy and efficiency concerns for their particular domains." .

The next-to-leading order cross section for the inclusive production of charm quarks in $\\gamma \\gamma $ collisions is calculated as a function of the transverse momentum $p_T$ and the rapidity y in approaches using massive or massless charm quarks. For the direct cross section we derive the massless limit from the massive theory with the result that this limit differs from the massless version with $\\overline{MS}$ factorization by finite corrections. Subtracting or adding these corrections allows us to compare the two approaches on equal footing. We establish massless and massive versions with 3 and 4 initial flavours which are shown to approach the massless approximations very fast with increasing $p_T$. With these results we calculate the inclusive $D^{*\\pm}$ cross section in $\\gamma \\gamma $ collisions using realistic evolved fragmentation functions with appropriate factorization scales and compare with recent data for $d\\sigma/dp_T$ from three LEP collaborations after single- and double-resolved contributions have been added." .

The generalized twig pattern (GTP) extends the TPQ model to include semantics related to output nodes, optional nodes, and boolean expressions which are part of the XQuery language. Preorder filtering holistic algorithms such as TwigStack represent a significant class of TPQ processing approaches with a linear worst-case I/O complexity with respect to the sum of the input and output sizes for some query classes. Another important class of holistic approaches is represented by postorder filtering holistic algorithms such as $$\\text{ Twig}^2$$Stack which introduced a linear output enumeration time with respect to the result size. In this article, we introduce a holistic algorithm called GTPStack which is the first approach capable of processing a GTP with a linear worst-case I/O complexity with respect to the GTP result size. This is achieved by using a combination of the preorder and postorder filterings before storing nodes in an intermediate storage. Additionally, another contribution of this article is an introduction of a new perspective of holistic algorithm optimality. We show that the optimality depends not only on a query class but also on XML document characteristics. This new view on the optimality extends the general knowledge about the type of queries for which the holistic algorithms are optimal. Moreover, it allows us to determine that GTPStack is optimal for any GTP when a specific XML document is considered. We present a comprehensive experimental study of the state-of-the-art holistic algorithms showing under which conditions GTPStack outperforms the other holistic approaches." .

Broadcast encryption has been considered as a useful tool to protect the data security and provide data access control. Most works in broadcast encryption are about the data security, while less attention is paid to the data access control and the identity privacy. In this paper, based on broadcast encryption, we present a scheme called Fully Privacy-Preserving and Revocable Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption, which preserves the data privacy and the identity privacy of the receiver as well as the revoked user. The data can be securely protected and only the authorized user can access the data. The revocation process does not reveal any information about the data contents and the receiver identity. The public learns nothing about the receiver identity and the revoked user identity. These properties lead to nice applications in the smart city where identity privacy is desirable. The security of our scheme is proved to be semantically secure in the random oracle model." .

It aims to perceive, collect, and process information from network coverage areas. The open nature of WSNs makes them easily exposed to a variety of attacks and brings many security challenges. Furthermore, because of the limited resources, some nodes may refuse to forward packets by dropping them to save their resources such as battery, cache, and bandwidth. To resist the attacks from these selfish nodes and to punish them, we propose a fuzzy-based dynamic trust model in this paper. The model uses fuzzy sets combining with grey theory to evaluate every node’s trust credibility based on direct trust and indirect trust relationship. Only those with higher trust values can be chosen to forward packets. Those untrustworthy nodes with lower trust values will be detected and excluded from the trust list. Thus, our proposal also produces an incentive to compel the selfish nodes to wellbehave again to participate in the WSN again. Additionally, we introduce the time slice scheme to guarantee a reliable node possess enough time to enjoy its services, which can solve the problem that a suddenly interrupted link causes a significant decrease of the trust value. Simulation results show that our dynamic trust model can not only demonstrate the effectiveness in detecting selfish nodes, but also possess better performance even if the bursty traffic exists." .

General DRM systems are designed to protect the copyright of contents and to trace the source of the illegal distributors based on the user-side watermarking. However, in the typical DRM systems, the original digital contents are temporarily disclosed without the watermarking information inside user’s system by the decryption process. Therefore, the user can copy the leaked original content inside the system and illegally redistribute via network without the permission of the content providers. Our work describes the idea of a DRM method which is composed of the incomplete cryptography based on permutation codes and user identification mechanism to control the quality of digital contents. There are two fundamental steps in our proposed cryptography: incomplete encoding and incomplete decoding. These two steps will create the scrambled content that is used as trial content and the watermarked content that is used to prevent unauthorized duplication or business of digital contents, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for DRM in the network distribution system." .

As most of these techniques apply the same principles, namely, the source, entropy, and hybrid coding fundamentals, these are explained in detail.

Although the communication resources provided, especially referring to bandwidth, enable multimedia streaming to mobile users, maintaining a high user perceived quality is still a challenging task. The main factors which affect quality in multimedia streaming over wireless networks are mainly the error-prone nature of the wireless channels and the user mobility. These factors determine a high level of dynamics of wireless communication resources, namely variations in throughput and packet loss as well as network availability and delays in delivering the data packets. Under these conditions maintaining a high level of quality, as perceived by the user, requires a quality oriented mobility management scheme.

To secure these holes and provide more efficiency, we propose SN-SEC, a 32-bit RISC secure wireless sensor platform with hardware cryptographic primitives. The choice of cryptographic primitives for SN-SEC is based on their compatibility with the constrained nature of WSNs and their security.

The principle of microaggregation is to aggregate original database records into small groups prior to publication. Each group should contain at least k records to prevent disclosure of individual information, where k is a constant value preset by the data protector. Recently, microaggregation has been shown to be useful to achieve k-anonymity, in addition to it being a good masking method. Optimal microaggregation (with minimum within-groups variability loss) can be computed in polynomial time for univariate data. Unfortunately, for multivariate data it is an NP-hard problem. Several heuristic approaches to microaggregation have been proposed in the literature. Heuristics yielding groups with fixed size k tends to be more efficient, whereas data-oriented heuristics yielding variable group size tends to result in lower information loss. This paper presents new data-oriented heuristics which improve on the trade-off between computational complexity and information loss and are thus usable for large datasets." .

Analogous to STRIDE, an information flow–oriented model of the system is leveraged to guide the analysis and to provide broad coverage. The methodology instructs the analyst on what issues should be investigated, and where in the model those issues could emerge.

Matoušek (Discrete Comput. Geom. 10:157–182, 1993) gave a partition tree method for d-dimensional simplex range searching achieving O(n) space and O(n 1−1/d ) query time. Although this method is generally believed to be optimal, it is complicated and requires O(n 1+ε ) preprocessing time for any fixed ε>0. An earlier method by Matoušek (Discrete Comput. Geom. 8:315–334, 1992) requires O(nlogn) preprocessing time but O(n 1−1/d log O(1) n) query time. We give a new method that achieves simultaneously O(nlogn) preprocessing time, O(n) space, and O(n 1−1/d ) query time with high probability. Our method has several advantages: It is conceptually simpler than Matoušek’s O(n 1−1/d )-time method. Our partition trees satisfy many ideal properties (e.g., constant degree, optimal crossing number at almost all layers, and disjointness of the children’s cells at each node).It leads to more efficient multilevel partition trees, which are needed in many data structuring applications (each level adds at most one logarithmic factor to the space and query bounds, better than in all previous methods).A similar improvement applies to a shallow version of partition trees, yielding O(nlogn) time, O(n) space, and O(n 1−1/⌊d/2⌋) query time for halfspace range emptiness in even dimensions d≥4. Numerous consequences follow (e.g., improved results for computing spanning trees with low crossing number, ray shooting among line segments, intersection searching, exact nearest neighbor search, linear programming queries, finding extreme points, …)." .

We analyze the maximum throughput that known classes of reliable multicast transport protocols can attain. A new taxonomy of reliable multicast transport protocols is introduced based on the premise that the mechanisms used to release data at the source after correct delivery should be decoupled from the mechanisms used to pace the transmission of data and to effect error recovery. Receiver-initiated protocols, which are based entirely on negative acknowledgments (naks) sent from the receivers to the sender, have been proposed to avoid the implosion of acknowledgements (acks) to the source. However, these protocols are shown to require infinite buffers in order to prevent deadlocks. Two other solutions to the ack-implosion problem are tree-based protocols and ring-based protocols. The first organize the receivers in a tree and send acks along the tree; the latter send acks to the sender along a ring of receivers. These two classes of protocols are shown to operate correctly with finite buffers.

We consider improvements in the performance of multimedia storage servers through data sharing between requests for popular objects, assuming that the I/O bandwidth is the critical resource in the system. We discuss a novel approach to data sharing, termed adaptive piggybacking, which can be used to reduce the aggregate I/O demand on the multimedia storage server and thus reduce latency for servicing new requests." .

Therefore, efficient search techniques on encrypted data are required. Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) is a public key encryption with keyword search scheme where a legal user can authorize a proxy to test whether a ciphertext includes some exact keywords without exposing the content of sensitive data to the proxy. However, the main obstacle to implementing existing ABKS schemes is that the computation cost is very heavy, namely linear with the number of required attributes. In this paper, we propose a new ABKS scheme with following features: (1) It supports AND and NOT gates; (2) the size of the searchable ciphertexts is constant; (3) the size of the trapdoors generated by legal users for the proxy is constant; (4) to encrypt a message, the computation cost is constant; and (5) the computation cost of the test algorithm is constant. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first ABKS which has constant-size ciphertext and supports AND and NOT gates." .

In this paper, we have presented a new ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) based mobile-banking application tool called m-BAT that runs in client–server environment, in which a user can connect to a bank server through a lightweight client tool running in the user’s mobile phone. The proposed m-BAT not only fulfills the above limitations of existing mobile-banking schemes, but also supports cost-effective solution for mobile handsets. In addition, the scheme includes a secure cash-deposit and withdrawal mechanism implementable through nearby kiosks.

Watermarking schemes embed information imperceptibly in digital objects and are proposed as primitives in various copyright protection applications, such as proofs of authorship, dispute resolving protocols or fingerprinting. In many applications, the presence of watermarks must be provable to any possibly dishonest party. Traditionally, watermark detection requires knowledge of sensitive information like the watermark or the embedding key. This is a major security risk, since this information is in most cases sufficient to remove the watermark and to defeat the goal of copyright protection. Zero-knowledge watermark detection is a promising approach to overcome security issues during the process of watermark detection: cryptographic techniques are used to prove that a watermark is detectable in certain data, without jeopardizing the watermark. This paper presents a formal definition of zero-knowledge watermark detection, discusses zero-knowledge watermark detection protocols and compares their properties." .

For every k, we prove a tight lower bound of Ω(n 1/(k−1)}) on the probabilistic communication complexity of pointer jumping in a k-layered tree, where the pointers of the i-th layer reside on the forehead of the i-th party to speak. The lower bound remains nontrivial even for k = (logn)1/2−ɛ parties, for any constant ɛ > 0. Previous to our work a lower bound was known only for k =3 (Wigderson, see [7]), and in restricted models for k>3 [2},24,18,4,13]. Our results have the following consequences to other models and problems, extending previous work in several directions. The one-way model is strong enough to capture general (not one-way) multiparty protocols with a bounded number of rounds. Thus we generalize two problem areas previously studied in the 2-party model (cf. [30,21,29]). The first is a rounds hierarchy: we give an exponential separation between the power of r and 2r rounds in general probabilistic k-party protocols, for any k and r. The second is the relative power of determinism and nondeterminism: we prove an exponential separation between nondeterministic and deterministic communication complexity for general k-party protocols with r rounds, for any k,r. The pointer jumping function is weak enough to be a special case of the well-studied disjointness function. Thus we obtain a lower bound of Ω(n 1/(k−1)) on the probabilistic complexity of k-set disjointness in the one-way model, which was known only for k = 3 parties. Our result also extends a similar lower bound for the weaker simultaneous model, in which parties simultaneously send one message to a referee [12]. Finally, we infer an exponential separation between the power of any two different orders in which parties send messages in the one-way model, for every k. Previous results [29, 7] separated orders based on who speaks first. Our lower bound technique, which handles functions of high discrepancy over cylinder intersections, provides a “party-elimination” induction, based on a restricted form of a direct-product result, specific to the pointer jumping function." .

To support efficient location-based data access in wireless data broadcast systems, a distributed spatial index (called DSI) is presented in this paper. DSI is highly efficient because it has a linear yet fully distributed structure that naturally shares links in different search paths. DSI is very resilient to the error-prone wireless communication environment because interrupted search operations based on DSI can be resumed easily. It supports search algorithms for classical location-based queries such as window queries and kNN queries in both of the snapshot and continuous query modes. In-depth analysis and simulation-based evaluation have been conducted. The results show that DSI significantly out-performs a variant of R-trees tailored for wireless data broadcast environments." .

We first present a public model for operation behaviors in cloud storage, in which a trusted third party is introduced to verify the integrity of operation behavior logs to enhance the credibility of forensic results as well as alleviate the burden of the forensic investigator. Further, we design a block-based logging approach to support selective verification and a hash-chain-based structure for each log block to ensure the forward security and append-only properties for log entries. Moreover, to achieve the tamper resistance of log blocks and non-repudiation of auditing proofs, we employ Merkle hash tree (MHT) to record the hash values of the aggregation authentication block tags sequentially and publish the root of MHT to the public once a block has been appended. Meanwhile, using the authentication property of MHT, our scheme can provide log-less verification with privacy preservation. We formally prove the security of the proposed scheme and evaluate its performance on entry appending and verification by concrete experiments and comparisons with the state-of-the-art schemes. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively achieve secure auditing for log files of operation behaviors in cloud storage and outperforms the previous ones in computation complexity and communication overhead." .

However, to ensure the security, data will be encrypted when outsourcing to the cloud. This brings some trouble for data search. Searchable encryption allows users to search over the encrypted data on cloud storage to retrieve the interested data without decryption. However, in most of the existing schemes all the encrypted data are treated in the same way. Every user can search for it. In this paper, a fine-grained searchable encryption scheme with two non-colluding cloud servers is proposed. In this scheme, the files can be retrieved if and only if user’s attributes satisfy the access policy and the required keyword agrees with the file keyword. And users can verify whether the cloud server executes the search all over the ciphertexts. Besides, the removed user cannot search again even if he/she colludes with one of the servers." .

The Enhanced Watermarking Approach for Data Integrity and Non-repudiation in Rational Databases (EWRDN) provides data security means as integrity, secrecy, non-repudiation and privacy using data watermarking and compression techniques. These capabilities may enhance the whole security and trust of service providers. It gives the data owners the ability to monitor and recover data, if required. Co-ordinations between different services for data storage, manipulation and retrieval over the Cloud represents the milestone in composing the Database as a Service. Until now and to the best of our knowledge, such a service is not yet realized in a real Cloud environment. In this article, a realization for a proposed EWRDN service with data traceability capabilities is elaborated with the required performance analysis which is the main contribution of this work. A Trusted Authority service co-ordination to operate the proposed service is introduced as well. The results have shown that, the proposed service co-ordination can provide the data traceability features and stands against most of the experienced data security threats through the experiments. Moreover, EWRDN service as a differentiated quality service has been proven to provide two different data compression qualities. It has been shown that within an EWRDN co-ordination, a fixed recovery ratio of compression has been achieved." .

Much important research has been invested in decreasing the number of collisions in order to obtain faster algorithms for communication in such networks. This paper proposes a novel approach for wireless communication, which embraces collisions rather than avoiding them, over an additive channel. It introduces a coding technique called Bounded-Contention Coding (BCC) that allows collisions to be successfully decoded by the receiving nodes into the original transmissions and whose complexity depends on a bound on the contention among the transmitters. BCC enables deterministic local broadcast in a network with $$n$$ n nodes and at most $$a$$ a transmitters with information of $$\\ell $$ ℓ bits each within $$O(a\\log {n}+a\\ell )$$ O(alogn+aℓ) bits of communication with full-duplex radios, and $$O((a\\log {n}+a\\ell )(\\log {n}))$$ O((alogn+aℓ)(logn)) bits, with high probability, with half-duplex radios. When combined with random linear network coding, BCC gives global broadcast within $$O((D+a+\\log {n})(a\\log {n}+\\ell ))$$ O((D+a+logn)(alogn+ℓ)) bits, with high probability. This also holds in dynamic networks that can change arbitrarily over time by a worst-case adversary. When no bound on the contention is given, it is shown how to probabilistically estimate it and obtain global broadcast that is adaptive to the true contention in the network." .

To save storage space and I/O cost, we want to get rid of this structural redundancy to the extent possible. While all known methods for the physical representation (storage) of XML documents proceed from the root via the element/attribute hierarchy (internal nodes) down to the leaves (values), we follow an upside-down approach which explicitly stores the values and only reconstructs the internal nodes, if needed. The cornerstones for such a solution are suitable node labels and a path synopsis which efficiently represents all path classes of an XML document. As a solution, we propose a compact internal storage format for native XML database systems where the inner structure of the stored documents is virtualized. Because this elementless storage format provides an efficient reconstruction of a document using its path synopsis, all processing properties are preserved and the semantics of navigational and declarative operations of XML languages remains unchanged. Adjusted indexes support the full spectrum of so-called content-and-structure single path queries. Apart from greatly reduced storage consumption, our approach demonstrates its superiority, compared to competing methods, not only for a substantial fraction of those queries, but also for storing, reconstructing, and navigating XML documents." .

We call this attack launched by the third party as the key replacement attack. In ACISP 2004, Yum and Lee proposed a generic construction of digital signature schemes under the framework of certificateless cryptography.

It is especially designed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) providing business-to-customers services. Our protocol allows the SME to outsource its services to a cloud to reduce the running cost. At the same time, it does not require any communication between the cloud and the SME during user authentication stage. That is, SME can be offline after users have been registered. Users directly deal with the cloud for gaining access. This helps the SME to save a lot of resources, including a large bandwidth connecting with the cloud and a strong firewall system. Meanwhile, the user database never leaves the SME. In addition, our protocol can withstand common attacks such as dictionary attacks for server and phishing attacks for client. Our security protection is especially important for mobile users as mobile devices are easily exposed to such attacks. Furthermore, our protocol provides user traceability to SME and it is very efficient for mobile devices." .

Using proxy servers or wireless peer-to-peer streaming techniques can help reduce the gateway load. However, these techniques, because they are data caching methods, do not save wireless resources. We instead consider a communication-sharing approach in this paper. Traditional stream sharing solutions depend on cooperation with the video server. However, in the wireless access network it is difficult to cooperate with online video sites. To address this problem in wireless mesh access networks, we propose a distributed video sharing technique called Dynamic Stream Merging (DSM). DSM is able to improve the robustness of the access network without cooperation from the online video site or the users and has the intelligence to handle sudden spikes in demand for certain videos due to specific events, thereby preventing adverse effects to other daily wireless traffic. The technique can also leverage the 80:20 data access pattern, common for many video applications, to substantially increase the service throughput. We explain the DSM technique, present the system prototype, and discuss the experimental results." .

Alice and Bob share no secret key initially, and their goal is to generate, after public discussion, a common information-theoretically secure key facing an active eavesdropper Eve. Under the condition εA<εE and εB<εE, code authentication (CA) can be used as part of a public discussion protocol to solve this problem. This authentication exploits parts of substrings received by Alice and Bob from the broadcasting center as authenticators to messages transmitted in a public discussion. Unfortunately, it happens to be ineffective because it produces a key of small length. We propose a hybrid authentication (HA) that combines both keyless code authentication and key authentication based on an almost strong universal class of hash functions. We prove a theorem that allows estimation of the performance evaluation of hybrid authentication. The selection algorithm for the main HA parameters, given security and reliability thresholds, is presented in detail." .

With these mobile devices, the human users may wish to exchange sensitive data with others (e.g., their friends or their colleagues) over a secure channel. Public key cryptography is a good solution for establishing this secure channel. However, it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack, if the entities have no shared information. A number of techniques based on human-assisted out-of-band channels have been proposed to solve this problem. Unfortunately, these works have a common shortcoming: The human users must be colocated in close proximity. In this paper, we focus on how to construct a distance-free channel, which is not location-limited for establishing a secure channel between two users (devices). The proposed distance-free channel provides identification and authentication of the devices at the different locations using taken pictures or pre-stored images. The human user participates in the authentication process by sending and verifying an image. We describe the prototype implementation operated on a smart phone and show the experimental results when actually two smart phones share a common key using Diffie–Hellman key agreement over the proposed distance-free channel." .

For these systems, which often involve communications among multiple organizations over various networks, high confidence and adaptability are of primary concern to ensure that users can access these systems anywhere and anytime through various devices, knowing that their security and privacy are well protected under various situations. In this paper, an adaptable distributed trust management framework for large-scale service-based systems is presented. This framework includes a meta-model with a formal specification language for situation-aware security policies, and tools for generating and deploying security agents to evaluate and enforce trust decisions based on security policies, credentials and situational information. With this framework, large-scale service-based systems can incorporate distributed trust management to meet their trustworthiness requirements under various situations." .

The input is a partially ordered set P, and solving the problem amounts to discovering an unknown linear extension of P, using pairwise comparisons. The information-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons needed in the worst case is log e(P), the binary logarithm of the number of linear extensions of P. In a breakthrough paper, Jeff Kahn and Jeong Han Kim (J. Comput. System Sci. 51 (3), 390–399, 1995) showed that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem achieving this bound up to a constant factor. Their algorithm invokes the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration for determining the next comparison, making it impractical. We develop efficient algorithms for sorting under partial information. Like Kahn and Kim, our approach relies on graph entropy. However, our algorithms differ in essential ways from theirs. Rather than resorting to convex programming for computing the entropy, we approximate the entropy, or make sure it is computed only once, in a restricted class of graphs, permitting the use of a simpler algorithm. Specifically, we present: 1.an O(n 2) algorithm performing O(logn·log e(P)) comparisons2.an O(n 2:5) algorithm performing at most (1+ɛ) log e(P)+O ɛ (n) comparisons3.an O(n 2:5) algorithm performing O(log e(P)) comparisons. All our algorithms can be implemented in such a way that their computational bottleneck is confined in a preprocessing phase, while the sorting phase is completed in O(q)+O(n) time, where q denotes the number of comparisons performed." .

Yet integrity in RFID has not received much attention as regular computer systems. When we evaluate an identification protocol for an RFID system for anti-counterfeiting, it is important to consider integrity issues. Moreover, many RFID systems are accessed by multiple level trust parties, which makes comprehensive integrity protection even harder. In this paper, we first propose an integrity model for RFID protocols. Then we use the model to analyze the integrity problems in Squealing Euros protocol. Squealing Euros was proposed by Juels and Pappu for RFID enabled banknotes that will support anti-forgery and lawful tracing yet preserve individual’s privacy. We analyze its integrity, we then discuss the problems that arise and propose some solutions to these problems. Then an improved protocol with integrity protection for the law enforcement is constructed, which includes an unforgeable binding between the banknote serial number and the RF ciphertext only readable to law enforcement. This same protocol can be applied in many other applications which require a privacy protecting anti-counterfeiting mechanism." .

One potential threat to fingerprinting is collusion, whereby a group of adversaries combine their individual copies in an attempt to remove the underlying fingerprints. Former studies indicate that collusion attacks based on a few dozen independent copies can confound a fingerprinting system that employs orthogonal modulation. However, in practice an adversary is more likely to collude with some users than with other users due to geographic or social circumstances. To take advantage of prior knowledge of the collusion pattern, we propose a two-tier group-oriented fingerprinting scheme where users likely to collude with each other are assigned correlated fingerprints. Additionally, we extend our construction to represent the natural social and geographic hierarchical relationships between users by developing a more flexible tree-structure-based fingerprinting system. We also propose a multistage colluder identification scheme by taking advantage of the hierarchial nature of the fingerprints. We evaluate the performance of the proposed fingerprinting scheme by studying the collusion resistance of a fingerprinting system employing Gaussian-distributed fingerprints. Our results show that the group-oriented fingerprinting system provides the superior collusion resistance over a system employing orthogonal modulation when knowledge of the potential collusion pattern is available." .

The usual conception of the digital divide as a bifurcation between the information ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ in fact does a poor job at describing the reality of the situation, which is characterized by multiple dimensions of digital divides in many contexts. Taking the lead from Albert Borgmann, it is recognized that the so-called information poor do possess a rich resource of information which needs to be fully accounted for in order to solve the global digital divide problem. In addition, making information transparent means, following the theory of development of Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, that information should be made available and accessible through a system of representation. Floridi’s account of information ethics thus needs to be supplemented by the realization that members of infosphere, which in his view consist of information objects, should be made transparent in order that the global digital divide be ameliorated. In other words there should be a system of information about information, namely semantic representation of objective information which enables the locals to make full use of their available informational resources." .

We give a formal definition of CDPBS and propose a concrete provably secure CDPBS scheme. The proposed scheme is efficient and secure, in which its unforgeability is the same as that of the Schnorr’s signature scheme and its untransferability relies on the hardness of the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. Furthermore, by letting the user’s private key be a common constant, the proposed scheme can be used as a normal partially blind signature scheme." .

The key is to obtain valid results, while providing guarantees on the nondisclosure of data. Support vector machine classification is one of the most widely used classification methodologies in data mining and machine learning. It is based on solid theoretical foundations and has wide practical application. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving solution for support vector machine (SVM) classification, PP-SVM for short. Our solution constructs the global SVM classification model from data distributed at multiple parties, without disclosing the data of each party to others. Solutions are sketched out for data that is vertically, horizontally, or even arbitrarily partitioned.

It aims at introducing architecture for regulating all kinds of interactions and data streams within an iTV environment, including the different parties and their individual interests. By modeling this kind of organizational infrastructure, the authors follow the intention of finding best compromises between the partly opposing interests. While the user is in need of preserving his privacy, the scenario provider as well as the content provider together with the advertisers is dependent on valuable consumer information about content and general product information. In this respect, the proposed outline of the scenario considers all ways and directions of data flows, ranging from user information in the shape of TV content recommendations or tailored product information according to given consumption preferences up to all aspects of data protection. The latter appears highly important according to the different participants in the scenario, all having their own interests and thus forming heterogeneous relationships between the different single and corporate actors. The article emphasizes an alternate perspective on iTV compared to simple digital TV on the one and internet technology on the other hand. It gives a dense description of privacy concerns, economic interests, organizational necessities and approaches to programming solutions, presenting alongside the latest inventions and standards in terms of data protection features, e.g. operating with anonymized snapshots helping not only to hide the user’s identity but also to create profile clusters. One of the main suggestions outlined here is to strengthen the consumer’s role, thus accepting his dominant position in bringing iTV to success. The conclusion to be proposed lies in two key aspects: it is as well necessary to refer to the organizational structure as a model of interest relations as to combine the structure with innovative data protection mechanisms. Because the whole scenario deeply depends on trust and reputation, it is a need to put the user/viewer into control of the origins of data processing. This can only be achieved by a special kind of smartcard with far reaching impacts linked to the snapshot method. Furthermore, the authors give hints on how to enhance the attractiveness of the back channel in order to stimulate the data flow." .

We propose two extended signature schemes, BLS+ and BGLS+, to be cryptographical building blocks for constructing anonymous credentials in the random oracle model. Identity-like information of message holder is encoded in a signature in order that the message holder can prove the possession of the input message along with the validity of a signature.

XML has become the lingua franca for data exchange and integration across administrative and enterprise boundaries. Nearly all data providers are adding XML import or export capabilities, and standard XML Schemas and DTDs are being promoted for all types of data sharing. The ubiquity of XML has removed one of the major obstacles to integrating data from widely disparate sources - namely, the heterogeneity of data formats. However, general-purpose integration of data across the wide are a also requires a query processor that can query data sources on demand, receive streamed XML data from them, and combine and restructure the data into new XML output - while providing good performance for both batch-oriented and ad hoc, interactive queries. This is the goal of the Tukwila data integration system, the first system that focuses on network-bound, dynamic XML data sources. In contrast to previous approaches, which must read, parse, and often store entire XML objects before querying them, Tukwila can return query results even as the data is streaming into the system. Tukwila is built with a new system architecture that extends adaptive query processing and relational-engine techniques into the XML realm, as facilitated by a pair of operators that incrementally evaluate a query's input path expressions as data is read. In this paper, we describe the Tukwila architecture and its novel aspects, and we experimentally demonstrate that Tukwila provides better overall query performance and faster initial answers than existing systems, and has excellent scalability." .

In this article, we extend the notion of public-key RFID authentication protocols and propose a privacy-preserving multi-party grouping-proof protocol which relies exclusively on the use of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). It allows to generate a proof which is verifiable by a trusted verifier in an offline setting, even when readers or tags are potentially untrusted, and it is privacy-preserving in the setting of a narrow-strong attacker.

While many current approaches use brute force techniques to search files by meta information (file names, extensions or user-provided tags), the interest is in implementing techniques that allow content-based search in P2P systems. Recently, clustering techniques have been used for searching text documents to increase the efficiency of document discovery and retrieval. Integrating such techniques into P2P systems is important to enhance searching in P2P file sharing systems. While some effort has been taken for content-based searching for text documents in P2P systems, there has been few research work for applying these techniques to multimedia content in P2P systems. In this paper, we introduce two P2P content-based clustering techniques for multimedia documents. These techniques are an adaptation of the existing Class-based Semantic Search algorithm for text documents. The proposed algorithms have been integrated into a JXTA-based Overlay P2P platform, and evaluation results are provided. The JXTA-Overlay together with the considered clustering techniques is thus very useful for developing P2P multimedia applications requiring efficient searching of multimedia contents in peer nodes." .

Instantiating our construction with existing schemes for deterministic functionalities, we obtain schemes for any family of randomized functionalities based on a variety of assumptions (including the LWE assumption, simple assumptions on multilinear maps, and even the existence of any one-way function) offering various trade-offs between security and efficiency. Previously, Goyal et al. (Proceedings of the 12th theory of cryptography conference (TCC), pp 325–351, 2015) constructed a public-key functional encryption scheme for any family of randomized functionalities based on indistinguishability obfuscation. One of the key insights underlying our work is that, in the private-key setting, a sufficiently expressive functional encryption scheme may be appropriately utilized for implementing proof techniques that were so far implemented based on obfuscation assumptions [such as the punctured programming technique of Sahai and Waters (Proceedings of the 46th annual ACM symposium on theory of computing (STOC), pp. 475–484, 2014)]. We view this as a contribution of independent interest that may be found useful in other settings as well." .

In order to ensure this security, many approaches have been proposed recently. One of them is to use key predistribution schemes (KPSs) by means of combinatorial designs. In this paper, we use the Bush’s construction of orthogonal arrays to present a class of key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks. The secure connectivity and resilience of the resulting sensor network are analyzed. This KPS constructed in our paper has some better properties than those of the existing schemes." .

OpenDocument is an ISO standard, promoted by OpenOffice.org and Sun StarOffice. Open XML is the new format for Microsoft Office 2007 documents, an ECMA standard. These two formats share the same basic principles: XML files within a ZIP archive, with an open schema, in contrast to good-old proprietary formats (MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, ...). However, both of them suffer from many security issues, similar to previous Office formats: malicious people can still embed and hide malware (Trojan horses and viruses) thanks to macros, scripts, OLE objects and similar features. This paper shows the security issues with technical details, including XML and ZIP obfuscation techniques that may be used to bypass antiviruses, and describes how to design a filter to get rid of unwanted parts in a safe way." .

In recent years, low-cost RFID tags have been used in many open-loop applications beyond supply chain management, such as the tagging of the medicine, clothes, and belongings after the point of sales. At the same time, with the development of semiconductor industry, handheld terminals and mobile phones are becoming RFID-enabled. Unauthorized mobile RFID readers could be abused by the malicious hackers or curious common people. Even for authorized RFID readers, the ownership of the reader can be transferred and the owners of the authorized mobile reader may not be always reliable. The authorization and authentication of the mobile RFID readers need to take stronger security measures to address the privacy or security issues that may arise in the emerging open-loop applications. In this paper, the security demands of RFID tags in emerging open-loop applications are summarized, and two example protocols for authorization, authentication and key establishment based on symmetric cryptography are presented. The proposed protocols adopt a timed-session-based authorization scheme, and all reader-to-tag operations are authorized by a trusted third party using a newly defined class of timed sessions. The output of the tags is randomized to prevent unauthorized tracking of the RFID tags. An instance of the protocol A is implemented in 0.13-μm CMOS technology, and the functions are verified by field programmable gate array. The baseband consumes 44.0 μW under 1.08 V voltage and 1.92 MHz frequency, and it has 25,067 gate equivalents. The proposed protocols can successfully resist most security threats toward open-loop RFID systems except physical attacks. The timing and scalability of the two protocols are discussed in detail." .

These multimedia services include high-resolution videos and have very large file sizes that require a high level of compression to overcome this limitation. Therefore, there is an acute demand for the research community to provide an efficient multimedia framework to encode medical videos with high quality specifically under the conditions of an error-prone environment. Both an affordable delivery framework and effective coding techniques are extremely desirable for the delivery of high-quality eHealth video applications for transmission over heterogeneous networks and devices. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a multimedia framework to support eHealth applications, which has an improved coding scheme that uses an SVC-scalable extension of MPEC-4 AVC/H.264. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a significant improvement in terms of the PSNR-Y gain and reduces the picture quality degradation caused by artifacts and distortions, compared to the existing scheme." .

Many large institutions require fast solutions to support expedient analysis of historical network data, particularly in case of security breaches. However, “turning back the clock” is not a trivial task. The first major challenge is that such a technology needs to support data archiving under extremely high-speed insertion rates. Moreover, the archives created have to be stored in a compressed format that is still amenable to indexing and search. The above requirements make general-purpose databases unsuitable for this task and dedicated solutions are required. This work describes a solution for high-speed archival storage, indexing, and data querying on network flow information. We make the two following important contributions: (a) we propose a novel compressed bitmap index approach that significantly reduces both CPU load and disk consumption and, (b) we introduce an online stream reordering mechanism that further reduces space requirements and improves the time for data retrieval. The reordering methodology is based on the principles of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and also of interest for other bitmap creation techniques. Because of the synergy of these two components, our solution can sustain data insertion rates that reach 500,000–1 million records per second. To put these numbers into perspective, typical commercial network flow solutions can currently process 20,000–60,000 flows per second. In addition, our system offers interactive query response times that enable administrators to perform complex analysis tasks on the fly. Our technique is directly amenable to parallel execution, allowing its application in domains that are challenged by large volumes of historical measurement data, such as network auditing, traffic behavior analysis, and large-scale data visualization in service provider networks." .

Manufacturers of industrial equipment attempt to embed security functions (of authentication and PLC password protection), but without using additional protection means, the components of these automatic process control systems remain unprotected because of the architecture designed without taking into account information security requirements. In this paper, a comparative analysis of the existing approaches to the APCS protection has been carried out, security criteria for each approach have been formalized, and a new subject-centered approach has been proposed that develops the cyber security paradigm." .

Mixing several existing standard encryption techniques with image encoding tend to change the bit rate greatly. In this paper, FPGA implementation of a novel image encryption algorithm, based on block and symbol scrambling is proposed as a part of JPEG image encoding scheme to meet four major requirements: (1) to provide temporal security, (2) to preserve the overall bit rate with negligible overhead, (3) remain complaint with the JPEG file format, (4) fast and less complex implementation for real time applications. Implementation of the algorithm in an efficient manner with low complexity is a requirement for real time tactical security applications. The algorithm is implemented on STRATIX II and IV FPGAs using only 1 % extra hardware for encryption than that of the basic JPEG. Further, the JPEG implementation without encryption is competitive with other implementations available in literature. The implemented encryption module can be used in the image transmission system for secure image coding and tactical communications." .

To protect data security, a new covert VoIP communications system was proposed in this study to realize secure communications by hiding secret information in VoIP streams. In the proposed algorithm, secret data were divided into blocks after being encrypted with a block cipher, and then each block of secret data was embedded into VoIP streaming packets randomly using a chaotic mapping. The symmetric key was distributed through an efficient and secure channel, and the message digest was implemented to protect the integrity of secret data. The experimental data were collected by comparing audio data between the sender and the receiver. The experimental results indicated that data embedding had little impact on the quality of speech. Besides, statistical analysis could not detect the secret data embedded in VoIP streams using the block cipher and random numbers generated from chaotic mapping. The proposed covert VoIP communications system not only achieved high quality of VoIP and prevented detection of statistical analysis, but also provided integrity for secret data." .
