The processes are filled with osmophilic vesicles. The lens in the eye of the snail, Helix aspersa, is a secreted sphere of fine granular material. Lenses are lacking in the ocelli of sea stars (Patiria miniata, Leptasterias pusilla, and Henricia leviuscula) and of a hydromedusan (Polyorchis penicillatus), the cavity of an eyecup being filled with ciliary-type photoreceptoral processes.2.The cornea of the nereid eye consists of two layers: 1) a thick cuticle surfaced with fine projections and composed of a dense matrix containing granules, fibrils, and vertically arranged rows of lacunae, and 2) a layer of large epithelial cells. The cornea of Helix has three layers: 1) a one-cell thick stratum of epithelial cells, the external surfaces of which are studded with microvilli embedded in a coat of jelly, 2) a narrow stratum of horizontally oriented fibers (collagen ?) into which processes of the outer epithelial cells extend, and 3) an inner layer of columnar cells packed with granules and possessing microvilli on their under surfaces.3.The young photoreceptoral cell in a developing adult eye of a 3-segment nereid larva was found to possess a cilium (flagellum) at its distal end. The cilium does not appear to be involved in the formation of the microvilli which arise from the sides of the sensory cell and below the cilium. Thus, the nereid photoreceptor is basically rhabdomeric rather than ciliary in type.4.The larval eye in the nereid trochophore is a 2-cell organ resembling that of flatworms and composed of a slightly concave pigment cell and a sensory cell. The latter bears at its distal end an array of microvilli which project into the concavity of the pigment cell and lies next to a nerve cell that sends an axon to the ciliated prototroch." .

The central optic nucleus of the thalamus appears to be the only visual thalamic nucleus projecting to the telencephalon in this species. Since the central optic nucleus has a large tectal input but not a direct one from the retina, it is suggested that a retino-geniculo-telencephalic pathway does not exist in this species." .

Our aim was to investigate central corneal endothelial cells and corneal thickness in transplanted corneas at an average of 5.4 years after penetrating keratoplasty Patients and methodsThe study involved 68 perforated keratoplasty patients with at least a 1 year follow-up. Post-operatively, the central corneal endothelial layer was observed using a contact specular microscope. Central endothelial cell density, corneal thickness and the coefficient of variation of endothelial size were statistically analysed. ResultsThe post-operative follow-up time was ranging from 12 months to 23 years. Endothelial cell density (ECD) was 1,501 ± 249 cell/mm2. The average cell size was 673.6 ± 98.3 μm2, and the coefficient of variation of cell size was 0.61 ± 0.11. No difference in ECD was detected between diagnostic groups. Corneal thickness was 0.56 ± 0.06 mm. Correlation between ECD and post-operative time was not significant (r = 0.02; p = 0.85). ConclusionOur study concluded that ECD showed a higher rate of decrease after penetrating keratoplasty with no relation to pre-operative diagnosis." .

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokine, and its levels are elevated in the vitreous of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we aimed at investigating the relative potential of MIF in the ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization. MethodsBoth WT and MIF-knockout mice were subjected to the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) model. Intraretinal vessel regrowth was assessed by whole-mount immunofluorescence, and preretinal neovascularization was analyzed in retinal vertical sections after periodic acid-Schiff staining in the hypoxic stage of the ROP model. Gene expression of selected proangiogenic and proinflammatory factors at postnatal day 13 (p13) was measured by real-time PCR. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and microglial activation were analyzed with immunofluorescence. ResultsMIF deficiency increased areas of vascular obliteration by 49%, reduced sprouting tips by 27% and inhibited preretinal angiogenesis by 35%. VEGF expression was reduced in Müller cells of MIF-knockout mice. MIF absence reduced gene expression of erythropoietin, tumor necrosis factor alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by 30, 70 and 50%, respectively, decreased the number of retinal EPCs by 37.5% and inhibited microglial activation in the hypoxic condition. ConclusionsIn conclusion, we found that MIF has proangiogenic and proinflammatory properties in retinal neovascularization. The proangiogenic role of MIF in ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization is associated with the expression of VEGF and erythropoietin, EPC recruitment and inflammation. Therefore, MIF has a potential role in the pathological angiogenesis of proliferative retinopathy." .

In all species studied three optic tracts were found. Behind the chiasma opticum the basal optic tract runs to the peduncle region, there forming the basal optic neuropil. The marginal optic tract courses from the chiasma over the thalamus to the tectum opticum where it covers the entire surface. In the anterior thalamus the marginal optic tract innervates the neuropil Bellonci-pars lateralis and the corpus geniculatum thalamicum, and more caudally the neuropil posterior thalami. The medial optic tract supplies the neuropil Bellonci-pars lateralis and pars medialis in the anterior thalamus from where it runs medial to the marginal optic tract as a separate tract to the uncinate field in the posterior thalamus. The ipsilateral projections show differences among the species studied, although the global organization remains constant. The differences mainly concern the marginal optic tract which varies from being weakly labeled and restricted to the rostral part of the tectum opticum, to being heavily labeled and innervating the entire tectum to its caudal edge. Species with the heaviest ipsilateral projections all belong to the plethodontid tribe Bolitoglossini, all of which show direct development, a highly projectile tongue, rather frontally oriented eyes and excellent depth perception. In these species the thalamic ipsilateral projection areas are equal in size and shape to the contralateral one. The ipsilateral projections to the tectum show two distinct layers, a superficial and a deep one, which intermingle with the contralateral projections. The two other ipsilateral tracts do not differ significantly among the plethodontid species: the medial optic tract is always heavily and the basal optic tract always weakly labeled." .

A total of 72 cataract lens were collected. The levels of total proteins, glucose and glycated protein in the lens were studied. Plasma protein and fasting glucose levels were also estimated. The amount of glycation of lens was significantly higher in case of hypermature senile cataract (p<0.01) when compared with other types of cataracts. The levels of lens glucose between the various types of cataracts did not differ significantly. These results indicate that the level of lens glucose alone is not the only determining factor of lens protein glycation." .

The head of the fly in each species was soaked in 20% potassium hydroxide solution at room temperature for 7 days, and the clear compound eye was dissected into six small parts, each of which was placed onto a slide and flattened using a coverslip. Images of each part were obtained using a microscope connected to a computer. The printed images of each part were magnified, and the total number of ommatidia per eye was manually counted. For males, the mean number of ommatidia was statistically different among all flies examined: L. dux (6,032) > C. rufifacies (5,356) > C. nigripes (4,798) > C. megacephala (4,376) > L. cuprina (3,665) > M. domestica (3,484).

Scanning electron microscopy analysis of adult flies revealed the sexual dimorphism in the compound eye. Male C. megacephala had large ommatidia in the upper two thirds part and small ommatidia in the lower one third part, whereas only small ommatidia were detected in females.

When crickets were reared under a short-day (LD 12 ∶ 12) photoperiod and then transferred to a long-day (LD 16 ∶ 8) photoperiod upon adult emergence, the adults mainly laid nondiapause eggs. However, adults maintained continuously under short-day conditions laid dispause eggs. When compound eyes were bilaterally removed after adult emergence, the crickets mainly laid nondiapause eggs, irrespective of the photoperiod. Thus, the adults completely lost their sensitivity to photoperiod after bilateral removal of their compound eyes. Unilateral removal of the compound eye also affected the crickets under a short-day photoperiod, and the incidence of diapause eggs was intermediate between that laid by intact adults and that laid by adults after the bilateral removal of compound eyes. The incidence of diapause eggs in sham-operated crickets was not significantly different from that in intact crickets under both sets of photoperiodic conditions. These results show that P. nigrofasciatus perceives the photoperiod through its compound eyes." .

The profiles of the latter two rhythms did not closely match one another and differed from those previously described in the pineal organ of the same species. These results are discussed with respect to a possible paracrine role of retinal melatonin. Melatonin-like immunoreactivity was found in the photoreceptor cell layer and in the Müller cells of the inner nuclear layer. The intensity of the melatonin-like immunoreactivity varied throughout the 24 h light-dark cycle, in good correlation with the variations in the melatonin level as measured by radioimmunoassay." .

Methods: Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with visual loss to 20/40 or less in at least one eye with predominantly vitreoretinal pathology were evaluated in a cross-sectional fashion using a standardized testing methodology to obtain ophthalmic time tradeoff and standard gamble utility values. Spearman correlation coefficients were employed to correlate the utility values with visual acuity in better seeing and poorer seeing eyes. Results: The Spearman correlation coefficient for time tradeoff utility values and vision in the better seeing eye was 0.455 (p < 0.001), while that for time tradeoff utility values and visual acuity in the poorer seeing eye was 0.268 (p < 0.001). The coefficient for standard gamble utility values and the better seeing eye was 0.371 (p < 0.001), while that for standard gamble utility values and vision in the poorer seeing eye was 0.250 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: There is a greater correlation between ophthalmic utility values and vision in the better seeing eye, as versus vision in the poorer seeing eye. Time tradeoff ophthalmic utility values demonstrate a greater correlation with vision in the better seeing eye than do standard gamble utility values." .

Ocular involvement is one of the most disabling complications of BS, causing loss of vision that may progress to blindness if left untreated. The typical form of ocular involvement is a relapsing and remitting panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Initial attacks may spontaneously improve and subsequently disappear in a few weeks but tend to recur if left untreated. Destructive and recurrent attacks, especially with posterior segment and retina involvement, may cause irreversible ocular structural changes and permanent damage in sensory retina, resulting in loss of vision. The risk of irreversible damage to ocular tissue which may result in loss of vision warrants early and intensive treatment especially in patients at high risk such as young men who tend to follow an aggressive disease course. The management strategy involves rapid suppression of inflammation during the attacks and prevention of recurrent attacks. Local and systemic measures including immunosuppressives, corticosteroids, and biologic agents are used for this purpose. Surgery may be required in selected cases. The prognosis of eye involvement has greatly improved over the last decades with the effective use of immunosuppressives." .

These compounds were found to be highly concentrated in the epithelium capsule and were significantly diminished in the cortex and nucleus. Na+, K+-ATPase density in the different regions was determined by [3H]ouabain binding to membranes and by autoradiography of lens slices. The highest concentration of [3H]ouabain-binding sites was observed to occur in membranes prepared from the epithelial cells of the capsule, and was almost 100- and 200-fold higher than the concentrations observed in membranes prepared from fiber cells of the cortex and nucleus, respectively. In the autoradiography studies, strong labeling of [3H]ouabain appeared in the epithelial cell zone, and only weak specific labeling appeared in the lens cortex and nucleus. Almost all (99%) of the Na+,K+-ATPase specific activity was found to be in the capsule epithelium and only 0.5% was measured in the cortex and no activity was detected in the nucleus. These results indicate that the digitalis-like compounds and Na+, K+-ATPase are concentrated in the lens capsule epithelium and are present only at low levels in the cortex and nucleus, thus implying that the lens capsular epithelial layer is the major region of the lens responsible for the homeostasis of ions and water in this tissue." .

The outer segment regions of the long cells were stained intensely with peanut agglutinin. Pretreatment with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid resulted in decreased binding of wheat germ agglutinin throughout the retina and increased binding of peanut agglutinin to the outer segment region of the short cells and the region of myoid process of the long cells. These results suggest that there is a difference in the distribution of glycoconjugate residues between the long and short cells. A rod-like character of the short cell and a cone-like character of the long are tentatively discussed. Lectin-binding patterns in other retinal regions is also examined." .

The small peptide adrenomedullin (ADM) can activate a signaling pathway to increase the enzyme activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). ADM levels are elevated in eyes of diabetic patients and therefore, ADM may play a role in the pathology of diabetic retinopathy. The goal of this research was to test the effects of inhibiting the ADM/NO signaling pathway in early diabetic retinopathy. Inhibition of this pathway decreased NO production in high-glucose retinal cultures. Treating diabetic mice with the PKC β inhibitor ruboxistaurin for 5 weeks lowered ADM mRNA levels and ADM-like immunoreactivity and preserved retinal function as assessed by electroretinography. The results of this study indicate that inhibiting the ADM/NO signaling pathway prevents neuronal pathology and functional losses in early diabetic retinopathy." .

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Rudolf Foundation Clinic, Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Retinology and Biomicroscopic Lasersurgery, Vienna, Austria. METHODS: Prospective study with uneventful cataract surgery. Patients were subdevided into two groups. In group one, we included 10 patients without any general internal disease, in group two 15 patients with diabetes and/or arterial hypertension without ocular pathologies. Patients were examined preoperatively, one day, 1, 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively. At each visit a complete ophthalmic evaluation, best corrected Snellen visual acuity and optical coherence tomography of the macula were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-five eyes of 25 patients were recruited. The mean age was 70 ± 10 years. The average preoperative foveal thickness in both groups was 164 µm ± 12. The foveal thickness four weeks after surgery was 167 ± 14 (p = 0.64) in group 1 and 173 µm ± 14 (p = 0.08) in group 2. One eye in each group had decreased visual results 1 week postoperatively with subclinical thickening of the central macula in OCT measurement.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars. Patients and methods: Anonymous inquiries were made by means of a questionnaire sent to 114 patients after bilateral PRK in which the patients were asked to assess subjectly their driving ability. Additionally, in 66 eyes of 66 patients with a mean myopia of −5.3 D, an investigation on contrast sensitivity was performed according to the recommendations of the DOG (German Ophthalmological Society) using a Rodenstock nyctometer. Results: Postoperatively, 55 % of the patients felt more comfortable driving a car than preoperatively, 31 % did not recognize any change, and 14 % felt more uncomfortable driving car. Contrast sensitivity with or without glare 2 weeks postoperatively was so much reduced in 77 % or 53 %, respectively, of the patients that the criteria for driving a car in Germany were not fulfilled.Within the first 12 months after PRK the number of impaired patients diminished but even 1 year after PRK the number of patients with reduced contrast sensitivity with and without glare was higher than before PRK. Surprisingly, however, the criteria for driving a car with respect to contrast sensitivity with and without glare were not fulfilled even before PRK by as much as 44 % and 24 % of the patients, respectively. Conclusions: All patients must be in formed about the possible impairment for driving a car before PRK is performed" .

While the proteins that constitute the lenses of many vertebrates are relatively well characterized, less is known about the proteins that constitute invertebrate lenses, especially the lens facets in insect compound eyes. To address this question, we used mass spectrophotometry to define the major proteins that comprise the corneal lenses from the adult Drosophila melanogaster compound eye. This led to the identification of four cuticular proteins: two previously identified lens proteins, drosocrystallin and retinin, and two newly identified proteins, Cpr66D and Cpr72Ec. To determine which ommatidial cells contribute each of these proteins to the lens, we conducted in situ hybridization at 50% pupal development, a key age for lens secretion. Our results confirm previous reports that drosocrystallin and retinin are expressed in the two primary corneagenous cells—cone cells and primary pigment cells. Cpr72Ec and Cpr66D, on the other hand, are more highly expressed in higher order interommatidial pigment cells. These data suggest that the complementary expression of cuticular proteins give rise to the center vs periphery of the corneal lens facet, possibly facilitating a refractive gradient that is known to reduce spherical aberration. Moreover, these studies provide a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the cuticular basis of corneal lens function in holometabolous insect eyes." .

In the earliest embryos (up to 51/2 days of incubation), all cells that detach from the ventricular lining to differentiate as neurons do so while the ventricular cell precursor has an interphasic configuration. This means that, although they free themselves from the scleral attachment site, they keep for a while a vitreal attachment. The vitreally-attached endfeet subsequently transform into axonal growth cones, sprouting filopodia and lamellipodia. While the axons grow towards the optic nerve head, cell bodies and remaining scleral processes are progressively retracted inwards, leading to the appearance of typical ganglion cells. After 51/2 days of incubation, a great number of postmitotic neuroblasts detach while still in the G1 phase of the ventricular cell cycle. Those of them that show the longest leading processes become also ganglion cells, after their leading tip has acquired a growth cone configuaration and has bent into the optic fiber layer. These results on early mechanisms of ganglion cell genesis are discussed in relation to data in the literature, and a simple hypothesis is offered which explains the biphasic pattern in which presumptive ganglion cells detach from the ventricular lining of the chick retina." .

The aim of the study therefore was to assess the therapeutic potential of miltefosine on Acanthamoeba keratitis-infected hamster eyes. The cornea of hamsters were infected with Acanthamoeba hatchetti, a human corneal isolate. On the fifth day, all the cornea were microscopically examined in order to determine the degree of infections (G, from 0 to 3). Four groups were then prepared: miltefosine (160 μM); 0.1% propamidine isetionate plus 0.02% polyhexnide; infected control (0.05% ethanol in PBS) and a non-infected control (0.05% ethanol in PBS) groups. The treatment was continued for 28 days. After the treatment, the cornea were excised and used for Acanthamoeba culture to investigate the presence of Acanthamoeba growth. Miltefosine treatment yielded much higher cure scores than propamidine isetionate plus polyhexanide. On the last day of treatment, 85% of the miltefosine-treated eyes were graded as G0; no changes were observed in the uninfected control group eyes; G3 eyes showed only a partial improvement. Furthermore, no Acanthamoeba cells could be recovered from the miltefosine-treated eye samples. Miltefosine appeared to hold necessary therapeutic properties for the treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis." .

Retinal blood flow is measured with the non-invasive Heidelberg Retinal Flowmeter (HRF). The clinical suitability of the HRF in patients with diabetes mellitus is investigated, and measured blood flow is compared with blood flow in a group of non- diabetic persons. Methods: Cross- sectional study of retinal capillary perfusion in eighty diabetic patients and forty-nine control persons, non-invasively measured with the Heidelberg scanning laser Doppler flowmeter. Results: In the control group, HRF measurements could be performed in all subjects. In the diabetes group some patients had media opacities or were not able to maintain stable fixation. Therefore HRF measurement was only possible in 79%, 75% and 60% of the subjects for the nasal, papillo-macular and foveal areas respectively. Retinal blood flow as measured in the perifoveal and nasal areas was associated with the level of diabetic retinopathy. In patients with proliferative DR (levels 4 and 5) the blood flow was reduced, in comparison with that of the patients with exudative or non-proliferative DR (levels 1 and 2) and preproliferative DR (level 3). Blood flow was not correlated with age, systemic blood pressure, intra-ocular pressure and perfusion pressure in either group. A significant negative correlation with the actual blood glucose level was found in the perifoveal area (R=–0.585, P=0.0001). Conclusions: The HRF offers an interesting non-invasive method for measurement of retinal blood flow. In this cross-sectional study variations in retinal blood flow could be detected in various stages of DR in relation to clinically visible funduscopic changes." .

Material and methodsIn a retrospective interventional case series, 62 eyes of 61 patients were treated with 1.5 mg bevacizumab intravitreally. Baseline and follow-up visits included best-corrected visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations. Follow-up visits were performed 1, 3, and 6 months after initial treatment. Morphological effects on PED were quantified by repetitively measuring the highest elevation on two perpendicular OCT cross-sections. If height of PED was increased by 50 microns, or intraretinal fluid appeared or increased, or visual acuity decreased more than 5 letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, patients were reinjected. ResultsOn OCT, PED decreased from 346 ± 148 µm at baseline to 241 ± 159 µm (p < 0.001) at 1 month, 227 ± 193 µm (p < 0.001) at 3 months, and 166 ± 170 µm (p < 0.001) at 6 months. Mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) increased from 49 ± 18 letters at baseline to 52 ± 21 letters (p = 0.062) at 1 month. However, 3 and 6 months after initial injection mean BCVA returned to baseline levels (3 months: 49 ± 19 letters, p = 0.518; 6 months: 49 ± 20 letters, p = 0.053). On average, patients received 2.5 injections during the observation period of 6 months. Except for one retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear no other ocular or systemic adverse events were noticed. Ocular inflammation was not found in any of the investigated patients. ConclusionsThe presented data demonstrate a therapeutic effect of intravitreal bevacizumab in patients with specific classes of pigment epithelial detachments secondary to AMD." .

The cones are formed by two main cone cells, and in addition two accessory cone cells are present. Seven retinula cells contribute to the rhabdom, which is fused distally and open proximally (separated rhabdomeres). A special cell type, previously designated ‘hyaline cells’ are shown to be reflecting pigment cells. These cells form a well-developed tapetal layer. Distal pigment cells screen neighbouring ommatidia. Further, the eye is delimited by two membranes homologous to the fenestrated and eye capsule membranes present in several other isopod groups. The hypertrophied rhabdoms and the elaborate tapetal layer separate the morphology of the Cirolana eye from that of other isopod eyes. These structural features makes the Cirolana eye a case of convergent development with several other deep water living crustaceans." .

Eye tissue was sampled in the newly emerged and at 3, 7, and 21 days following eclosion. This mutant is known to show a light-induced degeneration of the peripheral retinular cells (R 1–6); the spectral sensitivity is altered and the threshold is increased reflecting the function of the central cells (R7, 8) which do not degenerate. A totally normal appearing visual system (peripheral retina and optic neuropiles) was found in newly emerged adults. After 3 days the somata of some of the peripheral retinal cells are affected and all of their axons show degeneration. At one week the R 1–6 pathology is well advanced in both somal and axonal regions. In affected cells the cytoplasm is more or less uniformly electron dense and contains liposomes, lysosome-like bodies, myeloid figures and vacuoles suggesting autophagy. Such cytoplasm (noted at 3 and 7 days post-eclosion) exhibits an electron dense reticulum and degenerate mitochondria. Microvilli become more electron dense. Retinular axon terminals are electron opaque and lack synaptic vesicles with few if any presynaptic structures. Mitochondrial remains are barely recognizable. Transsynaptic degeneration was not found. After 3 weeks, the structure of R 1–6 in the peripheral retina (somata and rhabdomeres) is greatly reduced or lost while R7 and R8 and higher order neurons are not affected. The debris from cell bodies and axon terminals of R 1–6 seems diminished, so that some phagocytosis probably takes place along with gliosis in the lamina." .

The extent of the damage depends on the dose of ouabain used in the experiment. After intraocular injection of 7μl 10−5 M ouabain, the ganglion cells and the cells of the inner nuclear layer (INL) become necrotic except for most of the outer horizontal cells, some bipolar cells, and Müller cells. The outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the marginal growth zone at the ora serrata remain intact; the plexiform layers become spongy. The degenerated material is removed by the proliferated reactive macroglial cells and invading macrophages. The degenerated cellular elements of the retina are replaced by mitosis of neuroblasts in the marginal growth zone and of cells in the ONL. After intraocular injection of a 5-fold higher dose of ouabain (7 μl 5·10−5M), the degeneration of the retina proceeds more rapidly and completely. In this experiment, the ONL is destroyed and the receptor outer segments are phagocytosed by cells of the pigment epithelium. In contrast to the regeneration of the amphibian retina, in the goldfish cells of the pigment epithelium do not participate by metaplastic transformation in the regeneration of the retina. The only source of cellular regeneration of the retina after complete destruction of its differentiated neural elements is the marginal growth zone, which is highly resistant to ouabain. The rate of mitoses in this region is strongly increased. The derivatives of these cells spread out tangentially over the entire fundus of the eye in a concentric manner. In this regenerate, mitotic processes continue in a radial direction, resulting in thickening and layering of the new retinal formation." .

The aim of this work was to demonstrate the effect of ocular compression with a Honan’s balloon on the quality of peribulbar anesthesia when a short needle was used. The blockades were performed in 120 patients using a 27 G, half-inch-long needle. The needle was inserted into the inferotemporal quadrant adherent to the inferior orbital notch. The 7 to 10 ml of local anesthetic solution, consisting of bupivacaine 0.5%, lidocaine 2% in a ratio of 3:2 with hyaluronidase 5 U/ml, was injected followed by application of Honan’s balloon or no compression.

In vivo entrainment of the circadian rhythm of afferent optic nerve impulses by LD 12∶12 cycles phase advanced 13 hours was essentially complete after only one exposure of the animal to this light cycle.3.The impulse rhythms of eyes exposed to the phase advanced light cycle in vitro entrained, but in this case 4 to 5 exposures to the advanced light cycle were required before entrainment was complete. The difference in the rates of in vivo and in vitro entrainment obtained whether eyes remained attached to the cerebral ganglion or were cultured in filtered Aplysia blood instead of a modified Eagle's minimal essential medium.4.Eyes maintained in vitro for 9 days expressed circadian impulse rhythms.5.The behavior of the eye is influenced by efferent activity from neuronal elements in the cerebral ganglion. The pattern of afferent optic nerve impulses and the waveform of the afferent impulse rhythm varies depending on whether or not the eye remains attached to the cerebral ganglion.6.Electrical stimulation of either the optic, tentacle, or rhinophore nerves, which emanate from the cerebral ganglion, produces an inhibition of the efferent optic nerve activity. This result indicates that a mechanism exists in Aplysia for the activity of one eye to affect the behavior of the contralateral eye and for other sensory inputs to affect the behavior of the eye as well." .

A subtype of glaucoma called primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) has been observed to be the result of one or more mechanisms such as Pupil block, Plateau iris, Peripheral iris roll, and Lens in the anterior segment of the eye. Reliable features in anterior segment images are important for determining the specific mechanisms involved in PACG. In this paper, first the discriminant features are selected by several feature selection algorithms in the context of PACG detection based on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, and then a novel criteria is proposed to further select more reliable features. Our approach is based on selecting the top-ranked features in each algorithm and its rank combination for selection of the best features. Compared with the features selected by the individual feature selection methods, the features selected by our method achieves the best performance in terms of the accuracy of classification of the four PACG mechanisms by using AdaBoost classifier." .

In the eye, limbal epithelial stem cells (corneal epithelial stem cells) provide the self-renewal capacity of the corneal epithelium and are essential for maintaining corneal transparency and vision. Limbal epithelial stem cell deficiency results in significant visual deterioration. Successful treatment of this type of blinding disease requires studies of the limbal epithelial stem cells and their microenvironment. We investigate the function of the limbal microvascular net and the limbal stroma in the maintenace of the limbal epithelial stem cell niche in vivo and examine the regulation of limbal epithelial stem cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in vivo. We assess the temporal and spatial changes in the expression patterns of the following markers during a six-month follow-up of various rabbit limbal autograft transplantation models: vascular endothelial cell marker CD31, corneal epithelium differentiation marker K3, limbal epithelial stem-cell-associated markers P63 and ABCG2 and proliferating cell nuclear marker Ki67. Our results suggest that limbal epithelial stem cells cannot maintain their stemness or proliferation without the support of the limbal microvascular net microenvironment. Thus, both the limbal microvascular net and the limbal stroma play important roles as components of the limbal epithelial stem cell niche maintaining limbal epithelial stem cell survival and proliferation and the avoidance of differentiation. The limbal stroma constitutes the structural basis of the limbal epithelial stem cell niche and the limbal microvascular net is a requirement for this niche. These new insights should aid the eventual construction of tissue-engineered cornea for corneal blind patients in the future." .

A 12-year-old female child born out of a consanguineous marriage reported to us with bilateral blindness. She was evaluated clinically. Ultrasound B mode and computerized tomogram (CT) examination were done. Based on all the inputs, right eye enucleation was performed, and the same was subjected to a histopathology examination. The patient had proptosis of the right eye with (LE) calcification of the lens. CT scan revealed irregular thickening of the right globe with heterogeneous uveoscleral enhancement. The vitreous showed irregular hyperdense thickening with multiple calcifications. There was mild thickening of the retrobulbar optic nerve and tendinous insertions of extraocular muscles. The right eye was enucleated, and its histopathology examination revealed panophthalmitis with intraocular ossification. The right globe revealed no evidence of malignancy. Painful blind eye is a major therapeutic dilemma for an ophthalmologist.

Adult females showed a long-day photoperiodic response to control reproductive diapause. When the compound eyes were bilaterally covered with silver paint, diapause incidence increased under diapause-preventing conditions, i.e., a long-day photoperiod and constant light, as though flies were kept under constant darkness. Neither silver painting on a medial region of the head capsule nor control painting in which both compound eyes were painted in a clear solvent caused significant effects on diapause incidence. Unilateral painting of the compound eye caused an increment of diapause incidence under constant light but no effects under a long-day photoperiod. When the compound eyes were bilaterally removed, all the flies developed their ovaries both under a long-day and a short-day photoperiod. Unilateral removal of the compound eye also caused ovarian development under a short-day photoperiod, whereas removal of one antennal lobe or all ocelli caused no effects on diapause incidence.

Vasculitis, retinitis and neurosensory detachment are not well-recognized sequelae of typhoid fever. FindingsWe report a case of vasculitis, retinitis and macular neurosensory detachment presenting post typhoid fever. A 27-year-old female presented with decreased vision in right eye with history of typhoid fever (treated adequately 6 weeks prior). Her best corrected visual acuity in right eye was 20/125, N36. Fundus showed a patch of vasculitis and retinitis superior to the disc associated with macular neurosensory detachment and disc pallor. With oral steroids, the inflammation resolved and visual acuity improved to 20/20 at 6 weeks. ConclusionsImmune-mediated vasculitis and retinitis following typhoid fever may respond well to systemic steroids." .

Common phenes were eye facet disarray, fusion of tarsal segments and to a lesser extent also eye reduction. AMD-reduced eyes ofwhite-mottled mutants also showed darker pigmentation than untreated controls.Notch mutants were more sensitive to AMD than non-Notch animals, as regards leg and bristle phenocopies. The most obvious difference between the two substances was their differential effect on bristle formation. AMD caused supernumerary bristles of thesplit mutant type, whereas FU tended to suppress bristle formation. The spectrum of malformations, especially after AMD treatment, resembled the temperature-sensitive phenes of certainNotch alleles ofD. melanogaster and suggests that AMD interferes with the transcription of the complexNotch gene." .

Diazepam produced a dose-dependent reduction in gain of pursuit eye movements at target frequencies of 0.4–1.6 Hz. Cross-correlation of eye and track was significantly reduced at most frequencies showing gain reduction after 10 mg diazepam. Eye-target phase relationship was not systematically altered by drug. Visual inspection of smooth pursuit tracking records showed reduced peak-to-peak amplitude of eye tracking along with replacement of smooth pursuit with saccadic pursuit, especially after 10 mg. Changes in smooth pursuit eye tracking after diazepam were similar to those changes reported in the literature associated with olivopontocerebellar atrophy and were quite unlike the changes in smooth pursuit after opiates, as previously reported. The role of cerebellar benzodiazepine binding sites in diazepam disruption of eye tracking was discussed." .

Topical administration of somatostatin (SST), a neuroprotective molecule with antiangiogenic properties, prevents diabetes-induced retinal neurodegeneration in animals. The α2-adrenergic receptor agonist brimonidine (BRM) decreases vitreoretinal vascular endothelial growth factor and inhibits blood–retinal barrier breakdown in diabetic rats. However, SST and BRM effects on microvascular cells have not yet been studied. We investigated the behaviour of these drugs on the crosstalk between microvasculature and neuroretina. MethodsExpression of SST receptors 1–5 in human retinal pericytes (HRP) was checked. We subsequently evaluated the effects of diabetic-like conditions (high glucose and/or hypoxia) with/without SST/BRM on HRP survival. Endothelial cells (EC) and photoreceptors were maintained in the above conditions and their conditioned media (CM) used to culture HRP. Vice versa, HRP-CM was used on EC and photoreceptors. Survival parameters were assessed. ResultsHRP express the SST receptor 1 (SSTR1). Glucose fluctuations mimicking those occurring in diabetic subjects are more damaging for pericytes and photoreceptors than stable high glucose and hypoxic conditions. SST/BRM added to HRP in diabetic-like conditions decrease EC apoptosis. However, neither SST nor BRM changed the response of pericytes and neuroretina–vascular crosstalk under diabetic-like conditions. ConclusionsRetinal pericytes express SSTR1, indicating that they can be a target for SST. Exposure to SST/BRM had no adverse effects, direct or mediated by the neuroretina, suggesting that these molecules could be safely evaluated for the treatment of ocular diseases." .

Each flow is studied using a traditional fluid mechanics/asymptotic analysis approach. We also assess the veracity of a hypothesis that was recently advanced [see Maurice, D.M., 1998. The Von Sallman Lecture 1996: An ophthalmological explanation of REM sleep. Exp. Eye.

Photoreceptors sufficient for entrainment of this oscillator reside within the eye itself (Eskin, 1971). We now report that extraocular photoreceptors can also entrain the ocular oscillator. Our evidence is:(1)Although the eye gives only a weak sensory response to red light (Fig. 2), red light cycles will entrain the ocular oscillator in an intactAplysia (Fig. 3).(2)Ocular entrainment by red light cycles, but not by white, requires that the optic nerve be intact (Fig. 4a, b); denervation of the eye allows the ocular oscillator to freerun in red light cycles (Fig. 4c).(3)The procedure of denervation does not prevent ocular entrainment by white light cycles in denervated eyes (Fig. 8). TheAplysia nervous system contains several circadian oscillators and several photoreceptors. Functional integrity of the organism requires that these elements be synchronized with one another. A neural, as opposed to hormonal, link is required for coupling the circadian oscillator in the eye to other neural sources of temporal information." .

Patients underwent selective coronary arteriography and fundus fluorescein angiography that allowed us to investigate the dye dynamics and to detect abnormalities of time evolution, vessel walls, and flux. During the fluorescein angiography we measured time events as the choroidal flush (ta) the start of the laminar phase (tb), and the end of the laminar phase (tc) and we took pictures that were digitally processed in order to compute the ROI1/ROI2 value, assumed as a numerical index of ischemia of the optic disc. In the examined sample we found ta=61±109, tb=65±107, tc=159±155, and ROI1/ROI2=0.968±0.300. Normal ranges for these parameters were determined by the fundus fluorescein angiography of a control group of 10 patients, unaffected by coronary artery disease and ischemic pathology of the retinal network; we found ta=12±4, tb=16±8.5, tc=44±9.3, and ROI1/ROI2=0.735±0.086. Eighty-five percent of coronaropatic patients showed ischemia of the optic disc, 89% anomalies of the epi-peripapillar network, 70% anomalies of the papillo-macular network, and 89% evidence of at least two findings of ischemia; 85% of patients showed a value of ROI1/ROI2 out of the normal range. The unpaired Student'st-test between the coronaropatic and the control group does not show significant differences between ta and tb; on the contrary, those with coronary disease and the control group were statistically different for tc (p≤0.02). Moreover, we have found a correlation between the numerical index of optic disc ischemia and the severity of coronary artery disease (r=0.68,p≤0.01). Hence, the vascular abnormalities shown by the fluorescein angiography can constitute valid noninvasive markers and can advise further cardiological tests for a coronary artery disease not yet diagnosed." .

Thirty adult male rabbits were divided into three groups: control group, experimental group 1 (exposed to 3 h/3 h 60 W red light) and experimental group 2 (exposed to 3 h/3 h 100 W red light). The retina of the eye was removed and studied by transmission electron microscope. Results showed that the experimental group 1 exhibited slight loss of mitochondrial cristae and vacuolization in inner segment, but the other layer of photoreceptor appeared normal. Disorganization and loss of outer segment showed in experimental group 2. Vacuolization, loss of mitochondrial cristae, cell swelling, and pyknotic nuclei were observed in this group. These findings indicate that intermittent red light cause damage in the photoreceptor layer of the rabbit retina; also, higher light intensity increased these damages." .

This eucone superposition eye is composed of about 8000 ommatidia. Each ommatidium is surrounded by six secondary pigment cells showing pigment movement according to the state of adaptation. It contains four crystalline cone cells forming together a crystalline cone and tract, two primary pigment cells, which encompass the crystalline cone, and usually eight retinula cells. On the basis of their rhabdomeric structure, three types of retinula cells can be distinguished. According to the structure of the rhabdom, two types of ommatidia are found in different regions of the eye. The rhabdom of the lobed type, providing more than 80% of ommatidia, is composed of V-shaped rhabdomeres with fanwise arranged microvilli. The rhabdom of the square type, found in a small area in the dorsal region of the eye, consists of triangular rhabdomeres with parallel microvilli. The functional significance of this difference is discussed." .

The clear zone contains the unpigmented extensions of the secondary pigment cells, which surround the cell bodies of seven retinula (receptor) cells per ommatidium and a retinular tract formed by them. The seven-lobed fused rhabdoms are composed by the rhabdomeres of the receptor cells 1–7. The rhabdoms are optically separated from each other by a tracheal sheath around the retinulae. The orientation of the microvilli diverges in a fan-like fashion within each rhabdomere. The proximally situated retinula cell 8 does not form a rhabdomere. This standard form of ommatidium stands in contrast to another type of ommatidium found in the dorsal rim area of the eye. The dorsal rim ommatidia are characterized by the following anatomical specializations: (1) The corneal lenses are not clear but contain light-scattering, bubble-like inclusions. (2) The rhabdom length is increased approximately by a factor of two. (3) The rhabdoms have unlobed shapes. (4) Within each rhabdomere the microvilli are parallel to each other. The microvilli of receptor 1 are oriented 90° to those of receptors 2–7. (5) The tracheal sheaths around the retinulae are missing. These findings indicate that the photoreceptors of the dorsal rim area are strongly polarization sensitive and have large visual fields. In the dorsal rim ommatidia of other insects, functionally similar anatomical specializations have been found. In these species, the dorsal rim area of the eye was demonstrated to be the eye region that is responsible for the detection of polarized light. We suggest that the dorsal rim area of the cockchafer eye subserves the same function and that the beetles use the polarization pattern of the sky for orientation during their migrations." .

They have also been compared with oil droplets occurring predominantly in many reptilian and avian retinas. Ontogenetically, ellipsosome differentiation from ellipsoidal mitochondria occurs with advance eye growth (diameter>1 mm). In juvenile loaches, they arise almost simultaneously in the dorsal and ventral retina, whereas in cyprinids, they appear first dorsally in bottom-dwelling early juveniles (approximate age 3–4 months), and then in the ventral retina in migratory late juveniles (eye diameter>4 mm, approximate age 2 years). The significance of the pattern of ontogeny of ellipsosomes in these stream fishes is discussed in relation to their utilization of a complex habitat during life. All adult cones possess conspicuous ellipsosomes. Histochemically, they react strongly with phosphotungstic-acid hematoxylin, a dye specific for proteins, whereas oil droplets refuse to do so (studied in turtle and pigeon). This reflects a major chemical difference between the two types of globules. Since ellipsosomes are present in the double cone accessory unit (which in higher vertebrates lacks an oil droplet) and since they appear late ontogenetically during advanced eye growth, they cannot be related to oil droplets, which have an embryonic developmental program." .

Due to multiple limitations such optimal, best evidence-based treatment is hardly manageable in any European country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subsequent overview outlines the key factors and their variability throughout Europe that limit the chance for adequate patient treatment. To outline the differences a survey was conducted among European retina specialists. Among the key limitations for optimal treatment are the drug label valid throughout the European Union (EU) for the most commonly used approved anti-VEGF drug ranibizumab. Below the EU-wide regulations are the national and partly regional restrictions for performing and reimbursing intravitreal injections. Further restrictions can be of relevance at the level of each institution performing intravitreal injections, including budget restrictions and limitations on the number of injections performed. The results of the survey indicate significant differences throughout Europe. RESULTS: Among the key differences is the time to the final national decision on reimbursement, which can take several years in some European countries. Further differences exist among many countries on who and which institutions can conduct intravitreal injections. In most countries this is dependent on the reimbursement through the health care system. Especially in eastern European countries, institutions - being officially reimbursed for intravitreal injections - are submitted to further restrictions such as limited budgets or a limited number of injections per year. Additional relevant differences exist regarding the requirements for the injection room, ranging from just a designated room to a fully equipped operating room. This has in addition to safety significant implications on cost and time-efficient patient treatment. The reimbursement for the intravitreal injection procedure at institutions with official reimbursement by the health care system varies throughout Europe from about 80 to 600 €. Unfortunately, in many countries the organizational structures and incentives have – to the disadvantage of patients and treating ophthalmologists – not yet been adopted to the needs of the era of intravitreal injections. CONCLUSIONS: With a growing number of affected and by intravitreal anti-VEGF injections treatable patients there will be an increasing pressure on improving access to adequate treatment. More uniformity regarding requirements and reimbursement throughout Europe is desirable. Unfortunately a further trend to regionalization is observed." .

Under incident illumination the cornea appears grey and cloudy, leaving only the centers of the corneal lenses clear. This is due to numerous pore canals that penetrate the cornea from the inside, ending a few μm below the outer surface. They consist of (1) a small cylindrical cellular evagination of a pigment cell (proximal), and (2) a rugged-walled, pinetree-shaped extracellular part (distal). The functional significance of these pore canals is discussed. It is concluded that their light scattering properties cause the wide visual fields of the photoreceptor cells measured electrophysiologically in the dorsal rim area, and that this is related to the way this eye region detects polarization in skylight." .

In order to achieve the delivery of evidence-based, population-based screening programmes, it was recognised that certain key components were required. It is necessary to identify the eligible population in order to deliver the programme to the maximum number of people with diabetes. The programme is delivered and supported by suitably trained, competent, and qualified, clinical and non-clinical staff who participate in recognised ongoing Continuous Professional Development and Quality Assurance schemes. There is an appropriate referral route for those with screen-positive disease for ophthalmology treatment and for assessment of the retinal status in those with poor-quality images. Appropriate assessment of control of their diabetes is also important in those who are screen positive. Audit and internal and external quality assurance schemes are embedded in the service. In England, two-field mydriatic digital photographic screening is offered annually to all people with diabetes aged 12 years and over. The programme commenced in 2003 and reached population coverage across the whole of England by 2008. Increasing uptake has been achieved and the current annual uptake of the programme in 2015–16 is 82.8% when 2.59 million people with diabetes were offered screening and 2.14 million were screened. The benefit of the programme is that, in England, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness in the working age group." .

The most common pathologies responsible for visual impairment and legally defined blindness in developed countries include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. These conditions share common pathophysiological features: dysfunction and loss of retinal neurons. To date, two main approaches are being taken to develop putative therapeutic strategies: neuroprotection and cell replacement. Cell replacement is a novel therapeutic approach to restore visual capabilities to the degenerated adult neural retina and represents an emerging field of regenerative neurotherapy. The discovery of a population of proliferative cells in the mammalian retina has raised the possibility of harnessing endogenous retinal stem cells to elicit retinal repair. Furthermore, the development of suitable protocols for the reprogramming of differentiated somatic cells to a pluripotent state further increases the therapeutic potential of stem-cell-based technologies for the treatment of major retinal diseases. Stem-cell transplantation in animal models has been most effectively used for the replacement of photoreceptors, although this therapeutic approach is also being used for inner retinal pathologies. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the development of cell-replacement approaches for the treatment of currently incurable degenerative retinal diseases." .

Thereby the pressure inside the lens proved to be elevated by 6 mm Hg. The energy required for this process was estimated at (1.5–6)·10−2 J. The movement of fluid in vivo (monitored with fluorescein) proceeds from the anterior to the posterior surface and out into the vitreous body." .

Retinal projections were entirely contralateral to the hypothalamic optic nucleus, the lateral geniculate nucleus, the dorsomedial optic nucleus, the pretectal nuclei including the cortical nucleus, and the optic tectum. The small size and lack of differentiation of the visual system in the electric catfish suggest a relatively small role for this sensory system in this species." .

A series of normal animals was compared with one in which the optic nerve was crushed and allowed to regenerate. Ganglion cells were labelled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) applied to the optic nerve, and retinae were examined as sections or whole mounts. We analysed separately ganglion cells with somata displaced to the inner nuclear (Dogiel cells, DGCs) and to the inner plexiform layer (IPLGCs). These findings were related to data for the orthotopic ganglion cells (OGCs). The mean number of DGCs in the normal series was 2,550 (±281) and fell to 1,630 (±321) after regeneration, representing a mean loss of 36%. This reduction was not significantly different from the mean loss of 43% from the OGC population in which mean values fell from 474,700 (±47,136) to 268,700 (±54,395). In both the normal and the regenerate series, DGCs were estimated to represent means of only 0.6% of the OGC population. Densities of DGCs were highest in the nasoventral and temporo-dorsal peripheries; densities of both DGCs and OGCs were lower after optic nerve regeneration. We conclude that the factors which affect ganglion cell death during optic nerve regeneration, do so to similar extents amongst the DGC and the OGC populations. The IPLGCs were very rare in normal animals with a mean of 420 (±95). However, their numbers increased after regeneration to a mean of 3,350 (±690), estimated to be 1.2% of the OGC population. These cells normally favoured peripheral retina but became pan-retinal after regeneration. The primary dendrites of the majority of IPLGCs were oriented in the same direction as those of OGCs. We conclude that most IPLGCs were OGCs which had relocated their somata to the inner plexiform layer." .

Posterior RON is a rare but devastating toxicity of radiation applied to the visual pathways to treat paranasal sinus and skull base tumors. Anterior RON is an unavoidable consequence of proton beam irradiation or ophthalmic plaque treatment of orbital, choroidal, or retinal tumors. Various treatments aimed at stabilizing and ideally reversing vision loss have been investigated but only in small cases series. Systemic corticosteroids and anticoagulants, which are moderately effective when used for cerebral radiation necrosis, have shown no signs of benefit for RON. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may promote short-term, partial recovery of vision in select patients, especially at partial pressures of at least 2.4 atm and when administered early after symptom onset. Reversal of visual deficits through treatment with systemic bevacizumab has been reported, but until controlled studies are performed, the side effect profile of stroke and myocardial infarction should limit its use in a population with predisposing cardiovascular risk factors. Intravitreal bevacizumab has shown promising results in patients with anterior RON, but repeated, long-term injections are required for sustained effect. As no intervention has been clearly shown to halt or reverse vision loss, larger prospective studies are needed to validate observed benefits for any of the treatments that have been described." .

Retrospective interventional study on 112 eyes of 112 patients who presented to the ophthalmic plastic clinic of a tertiary eye care center over a period of 23 years from January 1990 to February 2013 with lacrimal abscess were reviewed for demographic and microbiological profile. The culture results, organisms isolated, and their antibiotic sensitivity were studied. ResultsThe mean age at presentation was 37 years. The female to male ratio was 2:1. There was no significant difference in the laterality between the right and left eyes. Gram-positive organisms were the most commonly isolated accounting for 56.3% (63/112), and the commonest species isolated was Staphylococcus aureus in 25% (28/112) of the patients. Hemophilus influenzae was the commonest gram-negative isolate accounting for 30.2% of all the gram-negative isolates. Of the patients, 10.7% (12/112) showed no organisms on smear as well as sterile cultures. Gram-positive organisms were commonly sensitive to penicillins and vancomycin whereas gram-negative organisms were sensitive to quinolones and aminoglycosides. ConclusionsGram-positive organisms are quite common as compared to gram-negative ones in cases of lacrimal abscess. The results of this study have significant bearing on the treatment of patients with lacrimal abscess." .

A large family with multiple individuals affected by retinal degeneration was ascertained in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The visual acuity of all affected patients in the family was severely compromised beginning in early childhood. The retinal disease in this family is a severe form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) accompanied by macular degeneration. Fundus changes advanced with age. Choriocapillaris atrophy and posterior RPE atrophy were obvious allowing visualization of the large choroidal vessels in patients over 40 years of age. Rod and cone responses on ERG recordings were extinguished in patient’s teens. A genome-wide scan mapped the disease to a 34.7 cM region of chromosome 4p14–p16 between D4S1599 and D4S405. A maximum lod score of 3.96 with D4S403 and D4S391 is seen at θ = 0. Sequence analysis of PROM1 located in the linkage interval identified a c.1726C>T homozygous transition in exon 15: resulting in p.Gln576X in the translated protein. This mutation is found in a homozygous state in all six affected individuals and was heterozygous in five of the six unaffected family members examined. The mutation was not detected in 192 chromosomes of unrelated control individuals of the same ethnicity and from the same region. This delineates the phenotypic characteristics of retinopathy caused by mutations in PROM1." .

Hollow vesicles of this epithelium, the hypodermis, formed during culture in a medium containing ecdysone, from squares of eye crescent integument excised from the moth Manduca sexta. Spherical vesicles were deformed by suction using an elastimeter; a plot of pressure vs. deformation has a slope which indicates the stiffness. This method allows a direct determination of the stiffness in a small patch of hypodermis at various places along the organism's surface. Vesicles produced from a sequence of sites along an adhesion gradient might show a corresponding sequence of stiffnesses. However, any difference in stiffness between vesicles from dorsal vs. ventral eye crescent was obscured by a large scatter in values for stiffness. Variation in the wall thickness of vesicles, and use of a scaling method involving elastic spheres, may underlie this scatter. The mean (±SD) corrected stiffness for all trials was 5.59±2.79 dynes/cm2/μm deformation." .

A precise ophthalmic examination revealed ptosis, entropion, nictitating membrane prolapse, enophthalmos, and miosis in the left eye, whereas the eyelids and pupil were normal on the right side. The left eye lacked palpebral reflex, and the menace response seemed to be decreased. Pupillary light reflex was present in both eyes. The eyes did not show any evidence of trauma and irritation. The cornea appears to be healthy and transparent. On direct ophthalmoscopy, no gross abnormality was found in the eyeball. Unilateral facial palsy of the left side was prominently noticed, as the muzzle was deviated toward the contralateral side. A careful otoscopic examination revealed no evidence of otitis externa. Moreover, results of complete hematological and serum biochemical profiles were normal. In this goat, no other significant abnormalities were detected in physical examination. Detailed history delineated normal vision in both eyes, normal posture, and normal behavior.

MethodsRGPCL were prescribed for 89 patients (178 eyes) with myopia or myopic astigmatism and no history of wearing contact lenses. The patients who stopped wearing RGPCL after 1 week because of ocular discomfort were defined as dropouts, and those who adapted to regular full-time RGPCL wear were defined as successful wearers. VAS scores were measured at several intervals for 1 month after the initial wearing of the lenses. The number of days required to adapt to wearing RGPCL was defined as the adaptation time. ResultsFour patients were dropouts due to ocular discomfort (eight eyes; 4.5%). VAS scores were significantly lower in successful wearers than in dropouts at 1 week, although their VAS scores were not different at 1 day. VAS scores of the successful wearers at 1 week were significantly lower than those at 1 day. The average time required to adapt to RGPCL was 23.0 ± 22.1 days for the 85 successful wearers. Lower VAS scores at 1 day or 1 week were significantly correlated with a shorter adaptation time in the successful RGPCL wearers. ConclusionsOur results indicate that the VAS score might be useful for predicting successful RGPCL use and the adaptation time required by successful wearers." .

Superficial drusen were seen only in 15 of the 92 eyes with the anomaly. In those 42 subjects in whom the anomaly was bilateral, it was seldom symmetrical. The reduced visual acuity found in a few cases could be attributed to causes other than the drusen. In 10 eyes the anomaly was observed to be associated with visual field defects. The age distributions of the subjects with visual field defects and with superficial drusen show that they were more common among older children. The superficial position of the drusen and the presence of visual field defects do not, however, have a close cause- and-effect relationship. A cilioretinal artery was observed to co-exist with optic disc drusen with a high frequency, i.e. in more than 40%. Other vascular aberrations were also noted in association with the optic disc anomaly. Neurological symptoms were the most common cause for consultation in the 50 children examined. In more than half of the present cases appearance of the optic disc had contributed to the suspicion of an intracranial expansive process. A fallacious similarity between the elevation of the optic disc caused by buried drusen and optic disc edema caused by increased intracranial pressure presents a problem of differential diagnosis, expressly in younger children." .

The sections were studied under a light microscope after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains. The outer layer was composed of the cornea cranially and the sclera caudally. The sclera contained an episclera zone and two cartilaginous segments with connective tissue correlation. The cornea included dermal components (stratified cuboidal epithelium, Bowman's membrane, and dermal stroma with occasional flattened cells); the scleral part consisted of two main layers (irregular fibers of connective tissue overlaying the second scleral stroma layer). The fibers of the scleral stroma were the only component present at the posterior part of the cornea. These results reveal that the eye of S. javus does not possess Descemet's membrane or endothelium in the cornea." .

The current study evaluated the influence of serotonin on light-induced phase shifts of this ocular rhythm. The application of serotonin in combination with light was found to have profound and interactive effects on the magnitude of the resulting phase shifts. Further, the phase shifts that resulted from the interaction between light and serotonin appeared to be phase dependent, i.e., the application of serotonin inhibited the phase shifting effects of light during one part of the circadian cycle but enhanced them during another. Finally, the results show that the interaction between light and serotonin is dependent upon the sequence in which these two treatments are paired. These data, coupled with previous findings, suggest that serotonin may act to modulate light's phase shifting effects on the ocular pacemaker in Aplysia." .

Studies of alternative routes for infection are scarce; therefore, eye infection should be important, because of the eye’s high blood irrigation and brain proximity, as port of entry of the parasite. Trypanosoma cruzi parasites and/or their genetic material in ocular and adjacent muscle tissues were studied in batches of six NMRI mice (15 g) and Trichomys apereoides, an ancient caviomorph (250 g) inoculated with T. cruzi metacyclics from Brazilian (2) and Venezuelan (3) isolates genetically typified as T. cruzi I and II. Two animals/batch in the acute or chronic phase were killed and necropsies of cardiac and skeletal muscles, eyeball, and surrounding ocular muscle were processed for hematoxylin–eosine staining. Tissue parasitism was determined. DNA of the digested sections of the eyeball (5–10 μm) was extracted for T. cruzi k-DNA amplification by PCR, with S35 and S36 primers. The PCR products were analyzed. The average of maximum values of parasitemia of all infected animals was of 105 trypomastigotes/ml blood. Skeletal muscle and heart were colonized in patent infection for all isolates. Amastigote nests were found in corneal tissue of 2/3 of the used isolates and adjacent ocular muscle and connective tissue were parasitized. Trypanosoma cruzi k-DNA (330-bp band) was observed in ocular tissue of 4/6 of the isolates studied in both animal models. Investigations concerning infection of the eye globe tissues by T. cruzi are extremely scarce. The presence of stages of T. cruzi and/or its genetic products in ocular tissues indicate a broad colonization from a systemic infection. The results show the ocular environment as a possible appropriate microniche for T. cruzi and emphasize the risk of transmitting T. cruzi by ocular fluids and by parasitized cornea through transplants." .

We experienced 6 cases of unilateral blindness immediately after surgery for 3 recent years. These patients were classified into Hunt-Hess grade I to II except for one patient with III. All patients complained of visual loss with varying degree of lid oedema and ophthalmoplegia ipsilateral to the site of surgery. Angiographic examination of these patients revealed that the aneurysm was located at the internal carotid artery bifurcation in one case and the middle cerebral artery bifurcation in five cases. All of them were relatively far from the optic nerve. The aneurysm was clipped easily with minimal brain retraction via standard pterional craniotomy since the brain was slack in all cases. In all cases, injuring the optic nerve during surgery was remote. All patients showed evidence of retinal ischaemia on fundoscopy with or without fluorescein angiography. The pathophysiology of this ischaemic event is unknown. In our patients, we could exclude possible aetiological factors such as abnormal systemic and ocular conditions, causing ischaemia in intra-orbital structures, increased intracranial pressure, intra-operative hypotension, carotid atherosclerosis, and ocular vasospasm etc. Accordingly we speculate that the complications seen in our cases were most likely related to intra-orbital ischaemia initiated by a collapse of the arterial and venous channels in the orbit and/or to direct or indirect contusion on the intra-orbital structures. These situations could be produced by inadvertent pressure placed on the eyeball with a bulky retracted frontal skin flap. Visual acuity in these patients ranged from no light perception to the ability to see objects and detect colour. Their conditions were irreversible. The degree of visual recovery seems to be dependent on the duration and severity of retinal ischaemia by orbital compression. Unfortunately there is no satisfactory treatment. We recommend the use of an eye shield to protect ipsilateral eyeball just before aneurysm surgery." .

Material and methodsFifty-three eyes of 45 patients with vision loss due to Fuchs’ corneal dystrophy, pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, bullous keratopathy secondary to glaucoma, and deep stromal scarring.All patients underwent a personally modified microkeratome-assisted technique of endokeratoplasty between June 2002 and September 2008. All surgeries were performed at the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna by one surgeon (CS). Examinations during follow-up included complete eye examination, best-corrected visual acuity testing, ultrasound pachymetry (Pachymeter SP-2000, Tomey Corporation, Nagoya, Japan) as well as endothelial cell count (Noncon ROBO-CA, Konan-Keeler, Kobe, Japan). ResultsMean age was 70 years (ranging from 43 to 95 years). Mean follow-up period for all patients was 32 months (ranging from 1 to 60 months). Mean visual acuity increased from 0.972 logMAR at baseline to 0.278 after 60 months of follow-up (n = 16, p = 0.007). Mean endothelial cell density decreased from 2,797 cells/mm2 at baseline (donor tissue) to 989 cells/mm2 (n = 15, − 65 %, p < 0.001) after 60 months. Postoperative mean corneal thickness increased from 530 μm (n = 32) at month 3 to 586 μm (n = 15, + 11 %, p = 0.003) after 60 months of follow-up. Five eyes (9 %) experienced graft failure and required reoperation with donor exchange. ConclusionsAlthough new techniques like DMEK/DSAEK nowadays have replaced the endokeratoplasty procedure, long-term results are comparable to the long-term outcome of modern lamellar endothelial procedures. Endokeratoplasty might remain a possible alternative to penetrating keratoplasty in patients with endothelial disorders and scarring of the posterior stroma by providing faster wound healing and better preservation of corneal surface and thus a better rehabilitation of visual acuity." .

Fourteen patients with epilepsy and exposure to vigabatrin and 12 clinically normal individuals, constituting the control group, were included. Retinal images were obtained using spectral-domain OCT (Optovue RTVue Fourier domain). Nasal and superior quadrants of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) were found to be significantly lower in the patient group compared to the controls (p < 0.01). No significant difference was shown in the thickness of GCC layer (p > 0.05). Foveal thickness was significantly higher in the patient group (p: 0.006), but no significant difference was found in perifoveal and parafoveal regions between groups (p > 0.05). The thickness of RNFL was found to be lower in vigabatrin-exposed patients without any reduction in GCC layer in the macular region. However, foveal thickness was found to be significantly higher compared to perifoveal and parafoveal macular regions in vigabatrin-exposed patients. In conclusion, OCT revealed reduced thickness of RNFL without any reduction in ganglion cell layer in our study. The objective quantitative assessment of OCT is a practical noninvasive method and it can have role in future monitoring of these patients." .

The mice were exposed to 75 % oxygen from P7 to P12 to initiate oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). The macrophages were depleted by injection of clodronate-liposomes (lip) intraperitoneally. The eyes were collected at P12 and P17. Retinal flatmounts and histopathological cross-sections were performed to analyze the severity of retinal NV and BMC recruitment. BMCs immunopositive for CD31 (PECAM-1; endothelial cell marker) and α-SMA (smooth muscle cell marker) antigens were detected using a confocal microscope. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The VEGF, SDF-1, CXCR4 and CD45 protein expression was detected by western blot examination. The retinal avascular area in OIR mice at P12 was unaffected after macrophage depletion carried out twice (38.27 ± 1.92 % reduction) using clodronate-lip. The retinal avascular area and the NV area at P17 were reduced after macrophage depletion four times (79.53 ± 1.02 % reduction); these findings were supported by retinal flatmounts and histopathological cross-sections. Macrophage depletion led to significant inhibition of BMC recruitment into the NV tufts at P17, with decreased expression of retinal VEGF, SDF-1, CXCR4 and CD45. The recruited BMCs differentiated primarily into CD31-positive endothelial cells (ECs) and α-SMA-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This study suggested that macrophages promoted the vasculogenesis of retinal NV, particularly the contribution of BMCs in the mouse OIR model, which might be triggered by VEGF and SDF-1 production." .

In-home visual acuity screening was accepted by three-fourths of the enumerated population aged 50 years or more. Those with reduced bilateral visual acuity were referred to a community health post for ophthalmic examination. Among those diagnosed as bilaterally blind (≤20/200), comprising 5% of the screened population, two-thirds were thought to be blind from cataract. Because of other ocular pathology and general health conditions, surgery was not indicated for 30–50%. Two-thirds of those recommended for out-patient surgery accepted. Motivational efforts to convince the refusers were uniformly unsuccessful. The average age of those accepting and those refusing surgery was in the mid-seventies. Those already aphakic were 7–8 years younger. Post-operative acuity was ≥20/50 for only one-half of those operated. A significant number of cases had previously undetected macular degeneration and other causes of decreased vision. These projects have given increased attention to cataract blindness and the need for further operational research to develop effective methods for its control using outpatient surgery." .

Prospective evaluation was performed for 26 patients requiring surgery for parasellar tumors. Ophthalmologic examination was performed pre- and postoperatively. ONBF was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry before tumor dissection (initial ONBF) and after tumor removal (final ONBF). The waveform was analyzed using a data acquisition system. Initial ONBF could be measured in 16 patients (22 nerves; 8.9 ± 0.9 ml/100 g/min). Final ONBF could be determined in all 26 patients (42 nerves; 10.8 ± 0.7 ml/100 g/min). In the 22 nerves with initial measurements, final ONBF (11.3 ± 0.6 ml/100 g/min) was significantly increased (p < 0.01). In six patients whose optic canal was unroofed, ONBF did not change immediately; nonetheless, an increase was prominent in the final phase (p < 0.05). In another six patients, a small vessel adjacent to the optic nerve was temporarily occluded. ONBF was demonstrably reduced in three patients and recovered quickly after reperfusion. Intraoperative ONBF measurement may be useful as real-time monitoring for prediction and prevention of intraoperative optic nerve ischemia." .

The eyes, however, do play a role in modulating the activity rhythm; eye removal may change the temporal distribution of diurnal activity; reduce the punctuality of activity onsets, increase the amount of nocturnal activity, and decrease the total amount of activity (Fig. 1). These results, together with previously published ones, make it unlikely that a circadian oscillator known to reside in the eye and another one located in the abdominal ganglion are the sole sources of behavioral rhythmicity inAplysia." .

Three types of structurally distinct retinulae were found and mapped throughout the compound eye: Type I is composed of four unpigmented thin cells, four larger pigmented cells as well as a basal ninth cell. Its rhabdom possesses a round cross section and four microvilli directions. This type occupies most of the dorsal two-thirds of the retina. Type II consists of two thin cells, two intermediate cells and four large cells. A basal ninth cell is also present; the rhabdom is as in type I. Type II retinulae are located in the ventral third of the retina. Type III ommatidia are unique within the Hymenoptera: there are four large pigmented cells, four thinner unpigmented cells and a basal ninth cell. The rhabdom, however, has a dumb-bell shaped cross section; two small cells lie at its opposed extremities and the remaining six cells have mutually perpendicular microvilli orientations. This type of retinula is found at the dorso-medial eye margin. Serial sectioning in this region revealed a conical shaped rhabdom without any torsion along the longitudinal axis. The rhabdomere cross section was calculated from distal and proximal thin sections. Angular statistics were applied to the microvilli directions of all three ommatidial types to determine the degree of order. A possible functional significance of the structural specializations of the different eye regions is discussed." .

The tumor had developed in the left middle cranial fossa after an intracranial trigeminal nerve operation 23 years before. It had displaced and infiltrated the temporal lobe and expanded probably via the fissura orbitalis into the orbit. The thickened optic nerve revealed a marked widening of the subdural fissure by typical granular cells. The cufflike tumor cell aggregation in the subdural fissure had compressed the optic fascicle, thereby inducing a demyelinisation and axonal degeneration. A reactive gliosis in the optic fascicle masks the typical pattern of the optic nerve atrophy. The gangliocytes of the third retinal neuron are atrophic and replaced by reactively proliferated fibrillary astrocytes. A short review of the literature and theories concerning histogenesis of the granular cell tumor (neurogenic or mesodermal) is given. An intermediary type of neurofibromatous and granular cells which we found motivates us to agree with a mesodermal origin." .

They originate as larval eyes that migrate inward during metamorphosis. We used a combination of light microscopy and in situ hybridization to examine their anatomical organization in the butterfly Vanessa cardui and to test for the presence of visual pigments, the light sensitive components of the visual transduction pathway. The bilateral cluster of six internal stemmata is located near the ventral edge of the lamina. They retain the dark screening pigment and overlying crystalline cones of the larval stemmata. We found two opsin mRNAs expressed in the stemmata that are also expressed, respectively, in UV-sensitive and green-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the compound eye. A third mRNA that is expressed in blue-sensitive photoreceptor cells of the compound eye was not expressed in the stemmata. Our results reinforce the idea that the adult stemmata are not merely developmental remnants of larval eyes, but remain functional, possibly as components of the circadian input channel." .

Two classical laws governing monocular vision, which are known as Listing’s law and Donders’ law, can be enforced in this model using a single holonomic constraint. While there has been considerable attention paid to the kinematics of the eye, the dynamics of the eye predicted by rigid body models has not received the same level of attention. In the present paper, the unforced dynamics of the resulting rigid body model are examined with particular emphasis placed on the geodesics of the configuration manifold. A comprehensive portrait of these motions is presented, and the insight gained is related to the dynamics of the gaze direction and saccadic motions of the eye. Among our results, we find that modeling the eye as an asymmetric rigid body produces a non-integrable system of governing equations and that the geodesics on the configuration manifold provide a wealth of potential motions for the gaze direction." .

We calculated the age-related change of lights reflected from Munsell color chips onto the retina, and derived results that show that the chromaticity values of all the color chips shifted to the yellow region of the xy-chromaticity diagram. However, a replot on the CIELAB diagram and the estimation by means of the von Kries adaptation model suggests that old people may compensate their color vision using a general chromatic adaptation process. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments: a chromatic adaptation experiment and a color matching experiment to simulate D65-lights as seen by older people but using young subjects. The results indicate that chromatic adaptation does not provide a complete explanation for color compensation by older people, suggesting that an age-related change of the yellow-blue opponent color mechanism may contribute to this compensation." .

Systemic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, are linked to retinal microvascular structure changes (as width, tortuosity, and branching angle). The latter results in a potentially disadvantageous blood flow. This study has been designed to examine the relationship of a retinal vascular tortuosity to both blood pressure and velocity. The geometrical outlines of realistic retinal vascular trees have been extracted from fundus images. The retinal venular tortuosity has been quantitatively measured. A normal tortuosity value has been found, which has not exceeded 1.2. A computational fluid dynamics study has been conducted to examine the effect of topological changes on the hemodynamics distribution in the retinal circulation. The microvascular diameter effect (i.e., Fahraeus–Lindqvist effect) and the hematocrit have been considered in determining the viscosity of the blood in the retinal vessel segments. The pressure drop and the maximum velocity have been in the order of 15 mmHg and 0.032 m/s for tortuous vessels, and 13 mmHg and 0.054 m/s for normal vessels, respectively. For a clinical case, the maximal velocity falls down to 14 % due to the tortuosity. The current results have shown a decrease in the blood velocity and an increase in the pressure drop with tortuosity, which are in good agreement with in vivo measurements reported in the literature." .

The patient, a 50 year old, female presented with a large corneal ulcer with hypopyon. The direct microscopic examination of the scrapings revealed hyaline, thin, septate and branched hyphae. In vitro some antimycotics (amphotericin B,5-fluorocytosine, oxiconazole, amorolfine and ketoconazole) were tested against A. terreus by agar dilution method. Ketoconazole with MIC of 3 gmg/ml after 7 days of incubation was most effective followed by oxiconazole (10μg/ml). Experimental corneal ulcer was produced by injecting intralamellary 0.1 ml of the spore suspension containing 10×106 cfu/ml into the eyes of previously immunocompressed albino rabbits. Histopathologic examination showed infiltration and large destruction of the corneal stroma. Subconjunctival oxiconazole therapy exhibited complete cure. Based on our findings, a clinical evaluation of oxiconazole in human keratomycosis seems to be justified." .

Additionally, the eyes of 46 non-experimental animals were variously fixed and stained, many of them with 1% osmium tetroxide for electron microscopy.2.Glycogen, demonstrated by the periodic acid Schiff (PAS) reaction, was more abundant in dark-adapted eyes and occurred particularly in the basal (luminal) half of the lens, the humor of the eye, “paraboloid” and perinuclear regions of photoreceptors, and “vesicles” in the nervous layer. Illuminated eyes showed a decrease in PAS-positive material, especially in lens and lumen. It is concluded that the lens secretes glycogen and perhaps other polysaccharides into the cavity of the eye and that possibly these substances may be used by the photoreceptoral processes.3.Oil red O and oil blue N revealed pyridine-soluble lipids in the chromatophores of the capsule of the eye. These chromatophores appear to have characteristics of both lipophores and guanophores.4.Staining with methyl green-pyronin showed desoxyribonucleic acid in nuclei and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the following: basal (luminal) part of lens cytoplasm, the luminal humor, “paraboloid” and perinuclear regions of photoreceptors, and perikarya of ganglion cells. The RNA in ganglion cells is identified with Nissl substance. There was no apparent difference in RNA content of light and dark-adapted eyes.5.Metachromasia to azure B and toluidine blue was observed in the RNA-positive regions of lens, lumen, and retina.6.Osmium tetroxide was bound especially by the basal (luminal) ends of lens cells and by some of the cytoplasmic granules in capsular chromatophores.7.Melanin pigment in the retinal melanocytes was observed to shift lumenward in a 48-hour illumination of the eye and to retreat basally during darkadaptation.8.It is suggested that the luminal melanin-bearing cells may be macrophages." .

Staining in the imaginal discs was limited to specific areas where intense reactions occurred primarily in differentiating structures. The eye-antennal disc possessed the most distinctive staining pattern. The ommatidial preclusters and clusters of the eye portion both stained, with heavier deposition in mature clusters. Staining in the preclusters closest to the morphogenetic furrow (MF) was obscured by a band of stained cells on either side of the MF that extends dorsoventrally across the disc. The ME low activity mutantMen NCl showed a dramatic reduction in staining of this band of cells but had no visible effect on eye morphogenesis. The larval optic nerve which traverses the entire length of the eye-antennal disc was a consistently stained feature. Two structures specifically stained in the leg discs. The most prominent was the chordotonal organ, while the second was a larval nerve extending the length of the disc. Limited staining was observed in the wing disc. No ME staining could be detected in the labial disc or haltere disc. Even though the genital discs did not stain for ME, the enzyme was induced sometime during the pupal stage since intense staining was noted in several adult internal genital disc derived structures. In general, ME staining in imaginal discs was associated with structures from the nervous system." .

One of the cells differentiates as R7 and the remaining as any one of the R1 to R6. The last cells behave initially as equivalent, and can differentiate within the same or within different, but neighbouring, ommatidia. The class of R1 to R6 cell in which each one of these elements differentiates, seems to depend on the time of its origin.

Current evidence supports an underlying autoimmune mediated process, which is the rationale for the provision of immuno-suppressive therapy in addition to antitumor treatment. There are no controlled clinical trials that address the treatment of paraneoplastic retinopathy and/or optic neuropathy. Management decisions must be based on a relatively small number of case reports. There have been no reports of spontaneous visual improvement in these disorders. Therefore, any improvement after treatment is attributable to the therapeutic intervention. With the exception of the paraneoplastic optic neuropathy patient group, most patients show little or no response to immunosuppressive therapy, and only a small percentage of patients have dramatic improvement. However, modest improvements in visual function can improve patient quality of life and functional independence. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy before significant visual loss is seen seems to be a critical factor in treatment success. An increase in serial autoantibody titers may serve as a marker of disease activity and allow initiation of therapeutic interventions before symptomatic visual decline." .

Depending on the location of the angioma, these treatments can cause additional, significant functional damage. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) however, allows a selective occlusion of vascular lesions without damaging adjacent retinal structures.  Methods: Two patients with isolated choroidal hemangiomas involving the posterior pole were treated with PDT. Treatments were performed using a diode laser at 692 nm, a light dose of 100 J/cm2 and 6 mg/m2 body surface area verteporfin (BPD-MA). PDT was applied in two courses in one eye and in four in the other eye at 1–4 months intervals. Patients were followed up for 9–12 months with visual acuity measurements and dilated ophthalmoscopy. Ultrasound, indocyanine green angiographic and fluorescein angiographic images were evaluated at each visit.  Results: Tumor heights were 3.3 and 4.6 mm on pretreatment ultrasound. After therapy, patients with isolated choroidal hemangioma showed total regression of the lesion and improved visual acuity due to resorption of retinal edema. Serous retinal detachment and cystoid macular edema resolved. Ultrasound demonstrated a progressive decrease in tumor height after each PDT application, with complete disappearance of the lesion. Retinal vessels were not affected by the treatment, and retinal function recovered in areas with previous tumor involvement.  Conclusion: PDT allows selective treatment of large intraocular angiomatous lesions.Without optimized parameters, complete regression of choroidal hemangiomas, resolution of secondary complications and improvement of visual acuity were documented." .

They consist of relatively few (about 160–190) ommatidia with a wide angle of divergence. Each ommatidium has two primary pigment cells, four Semper cells and eight retinula cells whose four distal rhabdomeres are arranged around the tip of the crystalline cone. The screening pigments are contained mainly in the primary pigment and retinula cells, while the secondary pigment cells are sparsely pigmented. The dorsal eye region can be distinguished by the following characteristics: lack of dioptric apparatus (flat, unfacetted cornea, absence of cones), densely packed rhabdomes in approximately parallel orientation extending distally to the cornea and possessing a markedly increased cross-sectional area in comparison with those of normal ommatidia. Screening pigments are absent. The importance of this dorsal region will be discussed." .

Progression of visual field damage is slow and typically painless. Thus, glaucoma is often diagnosed after a substantial percentage of RGCs has been damaged. To date, clinical interventions are mainly restricted to the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), one of the major risk factors for this disease. However, the lowering of IOP is often insufficient to halt or reverse the progress of visual loss, underlining the need for the development of alternative treatment strategies. Several lines of evidence suggest that axonal damage of RGCs occurs primary at the optic nerve head, where axons appear to be most vulnerable. Axonal injury leads to the functional loss of RGCs and subsequently induces the death of the neurons. However, the detailed molecular mechanism(s) underlying IOP-induced optic nerve injury remain poorly understood. Moreover, whether glaucoma pathophysiology is primarily axonal, glial, or vascular remains unclear. Therefore, protective strategies to prevent further axonal and subsequent soma degeneration are of great importance to limit the progression of sight loss. In addition, strategies that stimulate injured RGCs to regenerate and reconnect axons with their central targets are necessary for functional restoration. The present review provides an overview of the context of glaucoma pathogenesis and surveys recent findings regarding potential strategies for axonal regeneration of RGCs and optic nerve repair, focusing on the role of cytokines and their downstream signaling pathways." .

In some animals the intensity of the fluorescence was increased by treating the animals with Nialamide and 1-DOPA. The cornea contained no adrenergic fibres except at the limbus, where a plexus of adrenergic varicose fibres was seen, partly associated with vessels. In the chamber angle, adrenergic varicose fibres were common in the loose connective tissue covering the canal of Schlemm. The canal of Schlemm was supplied by only few adrenergic fibres, but such fibres appeared along the intrascleral aqueous drainage vessels. In the iris, adrenergic varicose fibres appeared immediately in front of the posterior layer of pigment cells, strongly indicating the presence of a dilator homologous with that seen in mammals. The frontal third of the stroma contained several adrenergic varicose fibres, many of which seemed to lack association with any vessel. Varicose adrenergic fibres were also sparsely seen in the striated muscle of the iris. The ciliary processes contained many adrenergic varicose fibres, at least part of which seemed to be associated with the ciliary epithelium. The striated muscles of the ciliary body contained adrenergic varicose fibres along the vessels only. The retina contained adrenergic varicose fibres in three layers in the inner plexiform layer. Adrenergic ganglion cells of two sizes were detected in the inner nuclear layer. The retinal vessels had no adrenergic nerve fibres. The pecten was also devoid of adrenergic nerve fibres, except along the vessels close to the papilla. The optic nerve contained adrenergic varicose nerve fibres along vessels only. In the ciliary ganglion, varicose adrenergic fibres appeared at the small ganglion cells, often forming baskets of synaptic character." .

MethodsOne eye each of 232 healthy subjects (mean age: 57.8 years; range:40–70) was considered. Temporal-superior-nasal-inferior-temporal average (TSNIT Avg) and OD area (area within the ellipse placed on inner border of peripapillary scleral ring) values were collected. Ellipse horizontal and vertical diameters provided on printout were used to estimate OD area using the equation: OD area = π × horizontal radius×vertical radius. TSNIT Avg values were plotted against OD area and a multiple linear regression including age calculated. ResultsMean OD area was 2.19 mm2±0.45 (range: 1.23–3.59) and mean TSNIT Avg was 54.3 μ ± 3.2 (range: 45.8–61.8). Multiple linear regression equation was TSNIT Avg=57.7−0.096×OD Area−0.055×Age (Pearson r=−0.146: p=0.086) ConclusionIn our sample of healthy eyes, no significant correlation was found between TSNIT Avg and OD area. In spite of a shorter distance between OD and measurement ellipse margins, larger discs did not necessarily show a thicker RNFL. Probably the large inter-subject variability for RNFL thickness, and then for axonal count, was a predominant factor over OD area." .

The rhythm will free-run for at least 3 cycles in vitro (Fig. 2) and can be entrained by light cycles provided in vivo (Fig. 4 A). While bothBursatella andAplysia eyes contain circadian pacemakers the two rhythms differ in several respects: (1) the peak impulse frequency forBursatella eyes is only 96/h (±36 SD) compared with 247/h (±61 SD) forAplysia. (2) The ocular waveform of theBursatella rhythm exhibits a steep rise and fall from peak frequencies and lacks the delayed falling phase which creates a ‘shoulder’ on the ocular waveform inAplysia (Fig. 2).

We also investigated the locomotor rhythm.Bursatella were found to be predominantly diurnal when exposed to L∶D, 12∶12 (Fig. 5A) and to exhibit anticipatory locomotor activity when maintained on L∶D), 9∶15 (Fig. 6). The eyes appear to play a minor role, if any, in timing the locomotor rhythm. EyelessBursatella remained diurnal on L∶D, 9∶15 and most animals continued to exhibit anticipatory behavior (Fig. 6). These results suggest that theBursatella eye plays a less prominent role than theAplysia eye in controlling locomotor behavior." .

While its function has remained elusive, we have previously shown that, under otherwise normal conditions, unilateral disconnection of centrifugal neurons in the chick affected eye development, inducing a reduced rate of axial elongation that resulted in a unilateral hyperopia in the eye contralateral to the lesion. Here, we further investigate the role of centrifugal neurons in ocular development in chicks reared in an abnormal visual environment, namely constant light. The baseline ocular phenotype of constant light-reared chicks (n = 8) with intact centrifugal neurons was assessed over a 3-week post-hatch time period and, subsequently, compared to chicks raised in normal diurnal lighting (n = 8). Lesions of the isthmo-optic tract or sham surgeries were performed in another seventeen chicks, all raised under constant light. Ocular phenotyping was performed over a 21-day postoperative period to assess changes in refractive state (streak retinoscopy) and ocular component dimensions (A-scan ultrasonography). A pathway-tracing paradigm was employed to quantify lesion success. Chicks raised in constant light conditions with an intact CVS developed shallower anterior chambers combined with elongated vitreous chambers relative to chicks raised in normal diurnal lighting. Seven days following surgery to disrupt centrifugal neurons, a significant positive correlation between refractive error asymmetry between the eyes and lesion success was evident, characterized by hyperopia in the eye contralateral to the lesion. By 21 days post-surgery, these contralateral eyes had become emmetropic, while ipsilateral eyes had developed relative axial hyperopia. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that the centrifugal visual system can modulate eye development." .

It is unlikely that the Acanthamoeba colonization is a feature which is effective only in patient’s homes with infectious keratitis since the organism has been isolated from domestic tap water. Two hundred and thirty-one (231) corneal scrapings were taken from infectious keratitis cases, and four contact lens solutions and domestic tap waters were taken from 22 out of 44 AK-diagnosed patient’s homes. Microscopic examination, culture, PCR, real-time PCR and DNA sequencing analyses were used for AK-diagnosed samples. The real-time PCR was the most sensitive (100 %) one among the methods used in diagnosis of AK. The 44 (19.0 %) out of 231 corneal scrapings, 4/4 (100 %) contact lens solution and 11/22 (50 %) of domestic tap water samples were found to be positive by real-time PCR for Acanthamoeba. A. griffini (T3), A. castellanii (T4) and A. jacobsi (T15) genotypes were obtained from corneal scrapings, contact lens solutions and domestic tap water samples taken from the patient’s homes diagnosed with AK. The isolation of Acanthamoeba containing 6/22 (27.3 %) A. griffini (T3), 14/22 (63.6 %) A. castellanii (T4) and 2/22 (9.1 %) A. jacobsi (T15) from the domestic tap water outlets of 22 of 44 (50 %) of patient’s homes revealed that is a significant source of these organisms. A. griffini (T3) and A. jacobsi (T15) genotypes have not been determined from AK cases in Turkey previously. Thus, we conclude that Acanthamoeba keratitis is associated with exposition of patients who has ocular trauma or ocular surface disease to domestic tap water in endemic or potentially endemic countries." .

Haemolysis was seen with corrosive/ severe and severe/moderate eye irritants but was negligible with non-irritant substances. Although not quite as sensitive as dog blood to irritants, human blood gave comparable results and was also more easily available in quantity. As with other in vitro tests, some false-positive results were given by the haemolysis test and also a few false-negative results. However, in all cases these were explicable given the physical and chemical properties of the materials. pH of test solutions did not seem to be a complicating factor. There was good correlation between the results of this test and published in vivo data. Although it may not yet entirely replace the in vivo model, the haemolysis test is a valuable preliminary stage in a tiered approach to eye irritancy screening." .

A highly precise and smoothly working robust gearing in connection with an asymmetrically notched key allows quick application of the approximator and an exactly adjustable interclip distance. By means of a combined handling and gearing screw and exchangeable 30°-angled clips the instrument can easily be applied in narrow operating fields, and it can be handled under vision through the operating microscope without change in magnification adjustment. A quickly increasing platelet aggregation at the suture line and an early “slow flow” can be achieved by gradual opening of the clips. The ease of approximator application may contribute to shortening operation times." .

It is known that the induction of cataractous process in this case is initiated by aldose reductase (AR) catalyzed synthesis and accumulation of excessive sorbitol in the lens fibres and epithelium and their consequent osmotic hydration. Synthesis of this and other polyols is competitively inhibited by pyruvate. The objective of the present investigations was hence to determine whether pyruvate would have a similar protective effect in species where cataract formation is relatively independent of sorbitol synthesis such as in humans where the lens AR activity is extremely low, especially with glucose as a substrate. The Km of AR for glucose is known to be very high. The possible protective effect of pyruvate in the low AR models was conceived on the basis of our previous findings suggesting that it can also exert substantial antiglycating as well as antioxidant effects. The present studies have hence been conducted with mice, a species known to be low in lens AR, similar to that in humans. As stipulated, pyruvate administration has indeed been found to offer a significant protection against development of diabetic cataract in this model also. The effect correlated with the inhibition of protein glycation as well as of oxidative stress. The latter was apparent by the prevention of the loss of glutathione known to be associated with diabetes. Although there was a small but noticeable increment in the sorbitol content of the diabetic lenses, this was osmotically insignificant. Even this increase was prevented by pyruvate. The magnitude of the elevation in the contents of glycated proteins and the depression in the level of glutathione were, on the contrary, highly pronounced, suggesting a more prominent role of the latter factors. In addition, the possibility of a direct metabolic support it could offer to the tissue is also imminent by its effect on the maintenance of ATP, as shown earlier. The present studies are therefore considered more relevant to the pathogenesis of cataract in human diabetics and its possible prevention by endogenous compounds with antiglycating and antioxidant properties. Inhibition of cataract formation by pyruvate in an animal model with low lens AR, similar to that in humans, has been shown for the first time. (Mol Cell Biochem 269: 115–120, 2005)" .

Age younger than 30 years was indentified as a risk for penetrating keratoplasty. The high resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy is an ‘in vivo’ examination method and is suitable for diagnostic and morphometrical examinations. We used this device to diagnose keratoconus and follow its course. Material and methodsOne hundred and fourtyseven patients with keratoconus, among them 65 patients received contact lenses for their 95 eyes, and 16 patients had penetrating keratoplasty on their 19 eyes. Both the structural changes of the cornea after the use of contact lenses as well as before and after penetrating keratoplasty the patients were followed by ultrasound biomicroscopy (Zeiss-Humphrey 840, 50 MHz). ResultsThere were 65 patients (95 eyes) with contact lenses. Thirty one patients had lenses on both eyes. After penetrating keratoplasty, early complications occured in 9 whereas late complications in 7 patients. One patient needed repeated penetrating keratoplasty because of allograft rejection. We demonstrated the special ultrasound biomicroscopy signs of the keratoconic patients in cases of wearing contact lenses, and in cases of penetrating keratoplasty. ConclusionsBoth wearing contact lenses and undergoing penetrating keratoplasty could result in a very good visual acuity for a longer time, and good anatomical status is obtained by penetrating keratoplasty." .

Large numbers of mitochondria are found in the outer segment of the photoreceptors around the bases of the microvilli. As it passes through the pigment layer the photoreceptor is invaded by finger-like intrusions of the pigment cells which serve to prevent light entering the eye from behind. The lens consists of fine filaments or rod-shaped bodies secreted by the pigment cells, which pass to the lens up narrow pillars between the outer segments of the photoreceptors. Attention is drawn to the evolutionary parallel between the shadow reflex of Branchiomma and the “off” responses of the photoreceptors in the distal retina of Pecten, both animals being exceptional within their phyla in having photoreceptors of the ciliary type." .

MethodsEyes (1000) were randomized to placebo (497) or nepafenac 0.3% (503) used once daily, post-operatively for 5 weeks at two ophthalmology clinics. Diagnosis of PCME was made by clinical, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), and with fluorescein angiography confirmation. Correlation of PCME to NSAID use and the presence of pre-operative risk factors for PCME were assessed including, contralateral PCME, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, macular hole, epiretinal membrane, macular degeneration, retinal detachment repair, and prostaglandin use. ResultsPCME was the most common complication associated with routine cataract surgery (4.2% with PCME risk factors, 2.0% with risk factors excluded). Topical nepafenac 0.3% significantly reduces the incidence of PCME compared to placebo when used after routine cataract surgery (p = .0001). When patients with pre-operative risk factors are excluded, the incidence of PCME between treatment and placebo groups is equivalent (p = 0.31). PCME relative risk (RR) was most significant in contralateral PCME (RR 19.5), diabetic retinopathy (RR 13.1), retinal vein occlusion (RR 12.9), macular hole (RR 7.7), and epiretinal membrane (RR 5.7). Prostaglandin use and previous retinal detachment were not shown to increase risk. ConclusionPseudophakic cystoid macular edema is common after phacoemulsification cataract surgery.

Degenerate capillaries are a central feature of diabetic retinopathy. An inflammatory process has been linked to the development of diabetic retinopathy but its regulation is incompletely understood. Cluster of differentiation (CD) 40 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that promotes the development of certain inflammatory disorders. The role of CD40 in diabetic microangiopathy is unknown. MethodsB6 and Cd40 −/− mice were administered streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Leucostasis was assessed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concanavalin A. Retinal Icam1 and Cd40 mRNA levels were examined using real-time PCR. Protein nitration was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Histopathology was examined in the retinal vasculature. CD40 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) were examined by immunoblot and/or flow cytometry. Nitric oxide production was examined by immunoblot and Griess reaction. ResultsIn mouse models of diabetes, Cd40 −/− mice exhibited reduced retinal leucostasis and did not develop capillary degeneration in comparison with B6 mice. Diabetic Cd40 −/− mice had diminished ICAM-1 upregulation and decreased protein nitration. Cd40 mRNA levels were increased in the retinas of diabetic B6 mice compared with non-diabetic controls. CD40 expression increased in retinal Müller cells, endothelial cells and microglia of diabetic animals. CD40 stimulation upregulated ICAM-1 in retinal endothelial cells and Müller cells. CD40 ligation upregulated NOS2 and nitric oxide production by Müller cells. Conclusions/interpretationCD40-deficient mice were protected from the development of diabetic retinopathy. These mice exhibited diminished inflammatory responses linked to diabetic retinopathy. CD40 stimulation of retinal cells triggered these pro-inflammatory responses." .

Whereas functionally hemidecorticate albino rats were unable to learn in 200 trials a horizontal-vertical discrimination when using the eye contralateral to the depressed hemisphere, hooded rats needed under similar conditions three times as many trials to criterion (167) than when using opposite eye and hemisphere (59). An engram established in intact animals with both eyes could be retrieved in functionally hemidecorticate rats of both strains even with the eye ipsilateral to the intact hemicortex, but retraining required about twice as many trials as when using the contralateral eye. Retrieval of monocularly acquired engrams was less efficient under similar conditions. Pattern discrimination formed through crossed or uncrossed visual projections during monocular occlusion and contralateral or ipsilateral CSD was completely lateralized, since relearning with naive eye and hemisphere proceeded at the same rate as the original learning. On the contrary, a black-white discrimination trained with the eye contralateral to the depressed hemisphere could be partly retrieved by the untrained eye and hemisphere. It is concluded that the ipsilateral visual projection is more effective in hooded than in albino rats and that it can be more efficiently used for retrieval than for acquisition." .

The latter has been associated with mutations in the OPA1 and OPA3 genes. To date, only six families with OPA3-associated dominant optic atrophy have been reported. In order to identify additional families, we performed Sanger sequencing of the OPA3 gene in 75 unrelated optic neuropathy patients. Affected individuals from two families were found to harbour the c.313C > G, p.(Gln105Glu) change in heterozygous state; this genetic defect has been previously reported in four dominant optic atrophy families. Intra- and interfamilial variability in age of onset and presenting symptoms was observed. Although dominant OPA3 mutations are typically associated with optic atrophy and cataracts, the former can be observed in isolation; we report a case with no lens opacities at age 38. Conversely, it is important to consider OPA3-related disease in individuals with bilateral infantile-onset cataracts and to assess optic nerve health in those whose vision fail to improve following lens surgery. The papillomacular bundle is primarily affected and vision is typically worse than 20/40. Notably, we describe one subject who retained normal acuities into the fifth decade of life. The condition can be associated with extraocular clinical features: two affected individuals in the present study had sensorineural hearing loss. The clinical heterogeneity observed in the individuals reported here (all having the same genetic defect in OPA3) suggests that the molecular pathology of the disorder is likely to be complex." .

The disease displays regional differences, with signs of hyperperfusion in the macular area and capillary occlusion with retinal ischemia in the peripheral retinal areas. It can be hypothesized that these regional differences in the occurrence of retinopathy lesions may reflect differences in the capacity of retinal arterioles to autoregulate the diameter of retinal arterioles. MethodsSeventeen normal persons and two matched groups of patients with respectively diabetic maculopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy were examined. The diameter change of a macular and a peripheral retinal arteriole during an increase in the arterial blood pressure induced by isometric exercise, during an increase in retinal metabolism induced by flicker stimulation, and during both stimulus paradigms simultaneously were studied using the dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA). ResultsDuring isometric exercise, the diameter response was reduced in both macular and peripheral retinal arterioles in the two groups of patients with diabetes mellitus. During flicker stimulation, the diameter response was significantly reduced in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, but there was no significant difference between the responses of macular and peripheral arterioles. During simultaneous isometric exercise and flicker stimulation, there was no difference between the diameter response of macular arterioles in the three groups, whereas the diameter response of macular arterioles was significantly lower in normal persons and significantly higher in persons with proliferative diabetic retinopathy as compared to peripheral arterioles. ConclusionsRegional differences in the disturbances of the diameter response to increased blood pressure may contribute to the regional differences in the distribution of diabetic retinopathy lesions. In the central retinal areas, the diameter response to increased blood pressure and retinal metabolism interacted in a way that may potentially protect this area from ischaemia, whereas this protective mechanism was absent in the peripheral retinal arterioles. An elucidation of the mechanisms underlying diameter regulation to increased blood pressure and retinal metabolism, and the interaction between these two mechanisms, may help in understanding the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy." .

They are usually removed at the end of the procedure, but small amounts may remain in the eye. Recently, contradictory results have been reported on the damage in association with residual perfluorocarbon liquids in the eye. This study examined the effects of perfluorodecalin on human retinal pigment epithelium and corneal endothelium in vitro. · Methods:Vitality and proliferative capacity of cell cultures were measured after incubation with perfluorodecalin. Vitality of cell cultures were measured using the Life-Dead assay. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring incorporation of 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine into cellular DNA. Furthermore, endothelium of organ-cultured human corneas was examined after incubation with perfluorodecalin by photodocumentation. · Results:Both cell types showed less extinctions in the Life-Dead assay after incubation with perfluorodecalin. After removing perfluorodecalin from the cultures, cells showed the same capacity of proliferation as the control cells. Compared to control corneas, perfluorodecalin induced a decrease in endothelial cell density. In four corneas, endothelial cell necrosis was observed. · Conclusion:Decreasing extinctions in the Life-Dead assay after incubation with perfluorodecalin can be interpreted as showing a decreasing amount of vital cells. Because cell proliferation showed no significant changes the results suggest that perfluorodecalin may not be directly toxic to cells in vitro. It may exert an indirect or mechanical effect on cell function by impeding the normal metabolic exchange between endothelium and medium. Based on these results perfluorodecalin should be completely removed after operation." .

Apparent recovery of generally lower amplitude oscillations after surgery did, however, occur in 7 out of 17 preparations tested (Fig. 6).2.Only lesions which included the central part of the optic tract resulted in a loss of rhythmicity (Fig. 1). Ultrastructure of this region of the optic tract showed axons with dense core vesicles and blood vessels; however, presumptive neurosecretory axons were not confined to this region (Fig. 3, 4).3.Tests for circulatory patency of the lesioned optic system were made by injecting eyestalk hormone extracts. Such injections caused depression of the ERG amplitude of both the operated and unoperated eye indicating that exogenous (and presumable endogenous) hormone reached the retina. Hormone injections, however, failled to alter the phase of the rhythm (Fig. 5).4.Low level unilateral retinal illumination in an animal with intact optic tracts successfully entrained the ERG rhythm in both eyes (Fig. 7).5.In operated animals unilateral illumination of the neurally isolated retina failed to entrain the intact contralateral side as evidenced by the fact that the intact side free-ran throughout the 13 days of attempted entrainment (Fig. 8A).6.Transfer of the entraining light to the intact retina phase-shifted its rhythm, while the operated eye became phase-locked to and appeared to be driven by the intact side (Fig. 8B).7.A summary diagram is provided which details the known coupling components of this circadian system (Fig. 9). Both hormonal and neural coupling appear to synchronize retinal sensitivity in the two eyes. Although the hormonal contribution is substantial, preliminary evidence indicates that their titers are driven by the underlying clock rather than comprising an integral part of the oscillator itself (Fig. 5)." .

Imaging by optical coherence tomography and measurements of the dimensions of the optic nerve head and the nerve fibre layer in central retinal areas is currently used to estimate the grade of pathological changes. The visualization and quantification of ganglion cells and nerve fibres directly in patients would dramatically improve glaucoma diagnostics. We have investigated the optical properties of cellular structures of retinal tissue in order to establish a means of visualizing and quantifying ganglion cells in the living retina without staining. We have characterized the optical properties of retinal tissue in several species including humans. Nerve fibres, blood vessels, ganglion cells and their cell processes have been visualized at high image resolution by means of the reflection mode of a confocal laser scanning microscope. The potential of adaptive optics in current imaging systems and the possibilities of imaging single ganglion cells non-invasively in patients are discussed." .

OLFM2 encodes a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the noelin family of olfactomedin domain-containing proteins that modulate the timing of neuronal differentiation during development. OLFM2 SNPs have been associated with open angle glaucoma in a case–control study, and knockdown of Olfm2 in zebrafish results in reduced eye size. From a cohort of 258 individuals with developmental eye anomalies, we identified two with heterozygous variants in OLFM2: an individual with bilateral microphthalmia carrying a de novo 19p13.2 microdeletion involving OLFM2 and a second individual with unilateral microphthalmia and contralateral coloboma who had a novel single base change in the 5′ untranslated region. Dual luciferase assays demonstrated that the latter variant causes a significant decrease in expression of OLFM2. Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridisation experiments using human developmental tissue revealed expression in relevant structures, including the lens vesicle and optic cup. Our study indicates that OLFM2 is likely to be important in mammalian eye development and disease and should be considered as a gene for human ocular anomalies." .

In all larval stages the eyes consist of a cornea, a lens and an everse retina. The photoreceptors in young larvae are exclusively of the ciliary type. In old larvae, however, two types of photoreceptors are present and the retina is composed of two segments: a posterior segment with altered ciliary photoreceptors (=type I sensory cells) and an anterior segment with what are presumably rhabdomeric photoreceptors (=type II sensory cells). The anterior retina is interpreted here as an accelerted character. Furthermore, the arrangement of the pigment granules changes during the long larval development being cup shaped in young larvae versus ribbon shaped in old larvae. The findings allow for the conclusions that: (a) the ciliary photoreceptors are correlated with the long larval period of Heteropoda and that (b) the eyes are altered continuously during the larval cycle." .

Inhibited cultures showed less, if any, colour changes. Plates could be read by eye or using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader. Within the pH range of 7.0–7.5, the extinction values of phenol red at 560 nm showed a linear correlation with both the pH of the medium and the pyruvate concentration in the medium. By comparison of the decreases in extinction in test cultures with those in control cultures, IC50 values (drug concentrations causing 50% inhibition) could be determined.

Free phagocytic cells closely associated with this area of cell death have been interpreted as cells migrating from the lens epithelium. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, light-microscopic histochemical staining for acid phosphatase and immunostaining using MB1 (a monoclonal antibody specific for quail endothelial and hemopoietic cells) of chimeras of chick embryo and quail yolk sac were used to analyze these lens vesicle-associated free phagocytic cells. The cells have morphological features identical to those of macrophages in other embryonic tissues. In contrast to epithelial cells phagocytosing cell debris, they exhibit strong acid phosphatase activity, a feature typical of macrophages. In addition, free phagocytic cells are MB1 positive in chick embryo-quail yolk sac chimeras, hence they proceed from cells of hemangioblastic lineage originating in the yolk sac. These results indicate that the lens vesicle-associated free phagocytic cells are macrophages. Observations of MB1 positive amoeboid cells in the juxta-retinal mesenchyme and on the borders of the optic cup suggest that these macrophages migrate through the mesenchyme surrounding the eye primordium. Macrophages are seen in both the interspace between lens vesicle and ectoderm and in the lumen of the lens as well as within both the ectoderm and the lens epithelium. In these locations they remove cell debris, and thereby contribute to the complete disappearance of the area of cell death. Macrophages remain in the lens vesicle-ectoderm interspace until developmental stages at which it is invaded by corneal endothelial cells." .

Herein, we aimed to evaluate CCT, IOP and retinal thickness (RT), and their relationships with serum GH and IGF-1 levels and disease duration, in acromegaly patients. We compared the ocular parameters with those of a control group. This study included the largest number of patients of any comparable investigation to date. Material and MethodWe enrolled 30 acromegaly patients (15 male, 15 female and age: 48.4 ± 12.8 years) and 21 age and gender matched controls. All participants underwent complete hormonal and ophtalmological evaluation including central corneal thickness (CCT), retinal thickness (RT) and intraocular pressure (IOP) values. ResultsThere were no significant differences in median right and left CCTs and mean CCT (p = 0.646, p = 0.667 and p = 0.384, respectively). Nor were there statistically significant differences in median right and left RT, or mean central RT, between the acromegaly and control groups (p = 0.977, p = 0.738 and p = 0.811, respectively). However median right, left and mean IOPs were found to be significantly higher in the acromegaly group, despite there being no difference in the CCT values (p = 0.011, p = 0.028 and p = 0.047, respectively). When we analyzed two subgroups of acromegaly patients (active/inactive), we found that the median right, left and mean CCTs and RTs, were not significantly different between the groups. Although there was a significant difference in IOP between the acromegaly and control groups, the two subgroups of acromegaly patients had similar IOPs (p = 0.400, p = 0.621 and p = 0.451 for right, left and mean IOPs, respectively). IOP was not found to be correlated with serum IGF-I, GH or disease duration in acromegaly patients. ConclusionOur study results suggest that acromegaly is associated with increased ocular pressures irrespective of disease activity. Therefore detailed ocular evaluation should be a routine component of the follow up visits of acromegaly patients." .

An attempt to confirm this structure independently is described here, visually with dye tracers, and more quantitatively with radioisotopes.2.Dyes injected into the blood (haemolymph) rapidly appear in a parallel array of capillaries which transfix the neural layers anterio-posteriorly just below the basement membrane of the retina, but dyes cannot be detected within the retina or the optic lobe neuropile even after many hours.3.Procion dyes infiltrated through a hole in the cornea spread throughout the retina, but appear to travel no further centrally than the basement membrane, although pigmented glial cells extending down to the capillaries take up the stain. In this region below the basement membrane, dye movement both into and out of the eye seems to be retarded, in agreement with the electrical measurements.4. 3H-inulin and3H-polyethylene glycol (PEG) both diffuse only very slowly from the blood into the eye, and finally indicate an exchangeable space of about 3% of the eye volume, believed to be extracellular. The electrical measurements require a similar space.5.Theoretical uptake curves for the unrestricted diffusion of inulin and PEG have half times of about 9 and 4 min, respectively. The half times of the curves best fitting the actual measurements are 4.5 and 1.6 h, indicating that diffusion is much retarded. If as believed, this retardation occurs only in the basal retina, the diffusion coefficients of the two tracers in this region have to be reduced by about a hundred to fit the uptake curves.6.The smaller tracers sorbitol, mannitol, sucrose and sulphate all indicate an unrealistically large space in the eye and (except sulphate) leg muscle, a space which does not equilibrate with the blood (except with sulphate). This suggests extensive penetration of the cells in these tissues by the tracers or their metabolites. Autoradiography of3H-sucrose in the retina shows this too.7.The uptake of sucrose into the eye is similar to that predicted for diffusion followed by removal of tracer by cellular absorption. The uptake rate measured for sorbitol, and that estimated for saccharides to explain the observed metabolic rate, are much too large to be explained by diffusion then uptake. This suggests that a rapid bypass route exists for some compounds across the barrier, to handle metabolic needs. The basal pigmented glial cells are properly positioned, and take up both sucrose and Procion Yellow.8.Taken overall, the results confirm the electrical measurements in suggesting that the retina is sealed off from the blood by a basal barrier, which greatly retards diffusional access to the eye. The isolation of the retina from the lamina synaptic region should be several times more severe." .

MethodsForty-seven BD patients with ocular inflammation, who presented with the first ocular episode, and who had been followed continuously for 5–10 years in our hospital, were studied. Charts were reviewed for gender, onset age of uveitis, complete or incomplete type BD, HLA-B51 status, final visual acuity at the last remission period, mean number of ocular attacks per year, and clinical findings of iridocyclitis with profuse hypopyon, strong vitreous opacity blocking the observation of retinal vessels, diffuse retinal vasculitis, and exudates with hemorrhage within the retinal vascular arcade. ResultsPatients with a visual acuity of ≤20/200 and those with >20/200 differed significantly in the mean number of ocular attacks per year and clinical findings of strong vitreous opacity and exudates within the retinal vascular arcade, but not with regard to the other factors. In addition, the frequency of ocular attacks showed a significant negative correlation with the outcome of visual acuity. Logistic regression analysis indicated a significant association of an average of more than three ocular attacks per year, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates within the retinal vascular arcade with poor visual outcome. ConclusionsThis study indicates that more than three ocular attacks per year, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates within the retinal vascular arcade are the risk and prognostic factors for a poor outcome of visual acuity in BD patients." .

For the in vitro studies, human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) were cultured in the presence of varying glucose concentrations, and the expression of mRNA and protein for GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, and VEGF was assessed. The chosen glucose concentrations were reflective of those apparent in diabetic patients. Expression of VEGF and CHOP mRNA levels were significantly increased in diabetic rats compared to control rats at 1, 3, and 6 months (P < 0.05). In HRCECs cultured in the presence of high as well as variable glucose concentrations, CHOP expression and apoptosis were significantly increased (P < 0.05). However, GRP78 and ATF4 expression levels were unchanged. Our findings suggest that early progression of DR may be mediated by ER stress, but probably does not involve changes in ATF4 or GRP78." .

Despite numerous studies addressing methylmercury toxicity, the detailed mechanisms underlying its transport and accumulation, especially during early developmental stages, remain unclear. Zebrafish larvae are increasingly used as a model system for studies of vertebrate development and toxicology. Previously, we have identified the lens epithelium as the primary site for cellular mercury accumulation in developing zebrafish larvae (Korbas et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:12108–12112, 2008). Here we present a study on the dynamics of methylmercury accumulation and redistribution in the lens following embryonic and larval exposure to methylmercury l-cysteineate using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging. We observed highly specific accumulation of mercury in the lens that continues well after removal of fish from treatment solutions, thus significantly increasing the post-exposure loading of mercury in the lens. The results indicate that mercury is redistributed from the original target tissue to the eye lens, identifying the developing lens as a major sink for methylmercury in early embryonic and larval stages." .

The feed-forward shunting network possesses properties that make it well suited for processing of static, spatial information. However, it is shown here that those same properties of the shunting network that lead to good spatial processing imply poor temporal processing characteristics. This article presents an extension of the feed-forward shunting network model that solves this problem by means of preprocessing layers. The anatomical interpretation of the resulting model is structurally analogous to recently discovered data on a retinal circuit connecting cones to retinal ganglion cells through pairs of pushpull bipolar cells. Mathematical analysis of the lumped model leads to the hypothesis that X and Y retinal ganglion cells may consist of a single mechanism acting in different parameter ranges. This hypothesis is confirmed in the companion article, wherein the model in conjunction with a nonlinear temporal adaptation mechanism — is used to reproduce experimental data of both X and Y cells by simple changes in morphological and physiological parameters." .

METHODS: Six patients with nAMD were examined in a consecutive case series with UHR-OCT and Stratus OCT one day before and 10 ± 3 days after intravitreal application of 1.25 mg (0.125 ml) bevacizumab (Avastin®). Maximum central retinal thickness (CRT) was measured with the retinal thickness program and calliper measuring function of S-OCT and by the measuring tool of Adobe Photoshop 5.0 in UHR-OCT pictures. RESULTS: In three of six cases residual fluid after treatment was only visible with UHR-OCT but not with the S-OCT. A decrease of maximum CRT could be shown in all cases in UHR-OCT pictures but only in half of the cases (6/3) in S-OCT pictures. In 2/6 cases vitreoretinal adhesions were demonstrable with UHR-OCT but not seen with the S-OCT, irregularities in the photoreceptor layer could be revealed clearly by UHR-OCT in 2/6 cases. CONCLUSION: After anti-VEGF treatment, UHR–OCT gives more accurate information about residual fluid and intraretinal damage than S-OCT and offers more precise measurements of maximum CRT. These factors may influence further decision of therapy and give us a better explanation and correlation with unsatisfactory visual acuities than with the S-OCT." .

Compared to the compound eye of the worker honeybee Apis mellifera and the diurnal halictid bee Lasioglossum leucozonium, the eye of M. genalis shows specific retinal and optical adaptations for vision in dim light. The major anatomical adaptations within the eye of the nocturnal bee are (1) nearly twofold larger ommatidial facets and (2) a 4–5 times wider rhabdom diameter than found in the diurnal bees studied. Optically, the apposition eye of M. genalis is 27 times more sensitive to light than the eyes of the diurnal bees. This increased optical sensitivity represents a clear optical adaptation to low light intensities. Although this unique nocturnal apposition eye has a greatly improved ability to catch light, a 27-fold increase in sensitivity alone cannot account for nocturnal vision at light intensities that are 8 log units dimmer than during daytime. New evidence suggests that additional neuronal spatial summation within the first optic ganglion, the lamina, is involved." .

One week after surgery mean visual acuity improved to 20/325 (LP to 20/25) and only 4/28 patients (14%) showed quantitative function. At the final examination mean visual acuity decreased to 20/428 and the number of eyes with quantitative vision increased to 9/28 (32%). 12 eyes (43%) showed a final functional benefit after the treatment.5 eyes (17.8%) developed a severe recurrent hemorrhage. In 3 of those a correlation to partial or total vitreous separation cannot be excluded. One eye showed an inferior retinal detachment 6 weeks postoperatively potentially induced by a complete vitreous separation. ConclusionThe removal of submacular hemorrhage by intravitreal rTPA is a minimal invasive surgery. The postoperative success rate of 50% visual improvement is statistically significant to preoperative values but the final results are worse than the results immediately after surgery. The effect seems to be temporary especially in cases where the underlying AMD in not treatable." .

Each eye has a lens and a single cup-shaped pigment cell. There are differences in the arrangement of the microvilli in the rhabdomeres of the anterior and posterior eyes. Microvilli from each side of the anterior retinular cell are convergent. In each rhabdomere of the posterior eyes most of the microvilli lie parallel to each other but their direction is perpendicular to that of the microvilli of the adjacent posterior rhabdomere. The retinular cell leaves the eye between the pigment cell and the lens, and the retinular cell nucleus lies outside the eye. The darkbrown pigment in the pigment cell was identified as melanin. The lens contains carbohydrate and possibly protein but tests for fat were negative." .

CNV has been reported to occur at the borders of an inferior posterior staphyloma in the tilted disc syndrome. We present a case of multiple simultaneous CNVs located at the borders of a myopic macular staphyloma. · Methods: The clinical and angiographic records of a myopic patient who presented several areas of choroidal neovascularization were reviewed. · Results: On fundus examination, four gray lesions surrounded by subretinal hemorrhages and covered by a large serous retinal detachment were observed at the borders of a posterior staphyloma. Fluorescein angiography revealed that these four lesions were CNVs extending from the borders of the staphyloma to the macular region. As measured by B-scan ultrasonography, the staphyloma was 4 mm deep. · Conclusion: This case supports the hypothesis that the borders of staphylomas are sites at risk for the development of CNV in pathologic myopia." .

It has previously been shown that the early development of retinal lesions temporal to the fovea may predict the development of treatment-requiring diabetic maculopathy. The aim of this study was to map accurately the area where lesions could predict progression to vision-threatening retinopathy. MethodsThe predictive value of the location of the earliest red lesions representing haemorrhages and/or microaneurysms was studied by comparing their occurrence in a group of individuals later developing vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy with that in a group matched with respect to diabetes type, age, sex and age of onset of diabetes mellitus who did not develop vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy during a similar observation period. ResultsThe probability of progression to vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy was higher in a circular area temporal to the fovea, and the occurrence of the first lesions in this area was predictive of the development of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. The calculated peak value showed that the risk of progression was 39.5% higher than the average. There was no significant difference in the early distribution of lesions in participants later developing diabetic maculopathy or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Conclusions/interpretationThe location of early red lesions in diabetic retinopathy is predictive of whether or not individuals will later develop vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy. This evidence should be incorporated into risk models used to recommend control intervals in screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy." .

In nonoperated individuals of both species the optic tectum contained numerous immunoreactive neurons with strongly positive somata located in the stratum periventriculare and a thick immunolabeled dendritic shaft ascending radially toward the stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale. The retinorecipient layers contained many fibrous immunoreactive structures. Some varicose fibers, isolated or in small bundles, were localized to the stratum album centrale, especially in the dorsal tectal half. Unilateral eye removal produced the disappearance of the immunoreactive fibrous structures located in the retinorecipient layers of the tectum contralateral to the enucleation. The present work shows that calbindinlike immunoreactive substances are localized in specific neural circuits of the fish optic tectum and suggests that the calbindin-like immunoreactive fibers in the retinorecipient strata are of retinal origin." .

We aimed to establish a link between features of retinal progressive impairment and putative cortical changes in a cohort of 15 asymptomatic patients harboring the 11778G>A mutation with preserved visual acuity and normal ocular examination. To study plasticity evoked by clinically silent degeneration of RGC we only studied mutation carriers. We phenotyped pre-clinical silent degeneration from the psychophysical, neurophysiological and structural points of view to understand whether retinal measures could be related to cortical reorganization, using pattern electrophysiology, chromatic contrast sensitivity and high-resolution optical coherence tomography to measure macular, RGC nerve fiber layer as well as inner/outer retinal layer thickness. We then performed correlation analysis of these measures with cortical thickness estimates in functionally mapped retinotopic visual cortex. We found that compensatory cortical plasticity occurring in V2/V3 is predicted by the swelling (indicating deficits of axonal transport and intracellular edema) of the macular RGC axonal layer. Increased cortical thickness (CT) in V2 and V3 was observed in peripheral regions, like visual field loss, in these mutation carriers. CT was a very discriminative measure between carriers and controls, as revealed by ROC analysis. Importantly, the substantial cortical reorganization that occurs in the carrier state can be used to provide statistical discrimination between carriers and controls to a level that is similar to measures of retinal dysfunction. We conclude that peripheral cortical compensatory plasticity in early visual areas V2/V3 may be triggered by pathology in peripheral RGC axons in combination with potential developmental changes." .

MethodsThe study included 65 patients (120 eyes) with Behçet’s uveitis. All patients underwent detailed ophthalmic examination, including dilated biomicroscopic fundus examination, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 46 months (mean 20 months). ResultsAt initial examination, 29 eyes (24.1 %) had macular involvement including macular edema (16 eyes, 13.3 %), serous retinal detachment (SRD; five eyes, 4.1 %), active retinitis (three eyes, 2.5 %), macular hole (three eyes, 2.5 %), macular atrophy (two eyes, 1.6 %), macular ischemia (one eye, 0.8 %), epiretinal membrane (one eye, 0.8 %), branch retinal vein occlusion involving the macula (three eyes, 2.5 %), and branch retinal artery occlusion involving the macula (two eyes, 1.6 %). During follow-up, 22 eyes (18.3 %) developed macular complications including macular edema (ten eyes, 8.3 %), SRD (four eyes, 3.3 %), active retinitis (two eyes, 1.6 %), severe macular atrophy (two eyes, 1.6 %), macular ischemia (three eyes, 2.5 %), macular hole (one eye, 0.8 %), epiretinal membrane (two eyes, 1.6 %), and subretinal fibrosis (one eye, 0.8 %). Branch retinal vein occlusion involving the macula developed in two eyes (1.6 %). Final best corrected visual acuity in patients with macular involvement ranged from 20/400 to 20/25 (mean 20/80). ConclusionsMacular edema and other vision-threatening macular complications are common in Behçet’s uveitis. Macular damage is often irreversible, causing permanent visual impairment. Early and appropriate treatment of Behçet’s uveitis is mandatory to reduce the risk of visual impairment due to macular involvement." .

There have been few reports on drusen regression or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) development after macular hole surgery. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of both drusen regression and subsequent CNV development within 7 months of successful macular hole surgery. Case presentationA 73-year-old woman presented with a stage 3 full-thickness macular hole and large, confluent soft macular drusen in the right eye and a neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the fellow eye. Four months after the successful macular hole surgery, significant regression of drusen was seen, especially in the temporal area to the fovea. Three months later, the patient developed CNV and her best-corrected visual acuity decreased to 20/100, despite further regression of macular drusen. ConclusionsMacular hole patients with macular soft drusen need to be carefully followed up after surgery for possible drusen regression and CNV development." .

However, these implants can still lead to reversible and irreversible complications, even years after implantation. Material and methodsThis review gives a short overview about the different kinds of phakic IOLs, the advantages and disadvantages of these lenses and the pre- and post-operative examinations. ResultsMost of the angle-supported phakic IOLs have been abandoned from the market few years after launching. Two anterior chamber IOLs and one posterior chamber IOL—the iris-clip IOL ‘Artisan/Verisyse’ (Ophtec, Netherlands/Abbott, USA), the angle supported IOL ‘Cachet’ (Alcon, USA) and the ‘implantable collamer lens’ (Staar, USA), are commercially available at the moment. ConclusionPhakic IOLs are a good option for the treatment of high myopia, but exact preoperative examination of the patient and consistent post-operative controls including endothelial cell count are mandatory to reduce the risk of long-term complications." .

Recently, a genomewide association study detected the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in RAD51B (rs8017304 A>G) with AMD. RAD51B is involved in recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. We analyzed RAD51B influence on AMD using two cohorts from Caucasian and Han Chinese populations. The Caucasian set replicated the rs8017304 A>G association and revealed two novel AMD-associated SNPs in RAD51B, rs17105278 T>C and rs4902566 C>T. Under the dominant model, these two SNPs exhibit highly significant disease risk. SNP–SNP interaction analysis on rs17105278 T>C and rs4902566 C>T homozygous demonstrated a synergistic effect on AMD risk, reaching an odds ratio multifold higher than well-established AMD susceptibility loci in genes such as CFH, HTRA1, and ARMS2. Functional study revealed lower RAD51B mRNA expression in cultured primary human fetal retinal pigment epithelium (hfRPE) carrying rs17105278 T>C variants than in hfRPE carrying rs17105278 wild type. We concluded that the risk of developing AMD exhibits dose dependency as well as an epistatic combined effect in rs17105278 T>C and rs4902566 C>T carriers and that the elevated risk for rs17105278 T>C carriers may be due to decreased transcription of RAD51B. This study further confirms the role of DNA damage/DNA repair in AMD pathogenesis." .

For comparison, we also examined available lenses of other members of the family Sternoptychidae, including three other species of the genusArgyropelecus, and two species of the genusSternoptyx. Lens pigmentation was observed in all specimens ofArgyropelecus spp. larger than about 36 mm in standard length, but was absent in allArgyropelecus spp. individuals less than 36 mm. However, lens pigmentation was not observed inSternoptyx specimens of any size. Detailed studies ofA. affinis indicated that (1) at 36 mm the nascent lens fiber cells, which are continually laid down over preexisting, unpigmented cells, begin incorporating pigment, and (2) the pigment concentration increases steadily as pigmented cells are added during lens growth. Spectrophotometric and biochemical data suggested that the pigment is a carotenoprotein complex, the carotenoid-like chromophore being strongly associated with a specific soluble lens protein, alpha crystallin. While the lens coloration in these fishes is age-related, analyses of the retinal visual pigment revealed no concomitant age-related change in the peak wavelength of retinal sensitivity in these fishes. Our data on the spectral absorbance of the lens and visual pigment of these fishes suggest that the lens pigmentation acts as a short-wave filter to improve acuity of the visual system." .

This study evaluates patients’ knowledge and the need for more patient information. Methods271 patients with AMD were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their knowledge about AMD. 150 patients were interviewed by a physician and 121 patients completed the questionnaire on their own. Results79.4 % of patients had previous knowledge about AMD. Most patients, 97.3 %, got their information from physicians. 58 % of patients find their knowledge concerning AMD adequate. Only 23.9 % knew about aid organizations for patients with visual impairments. DiscussionThough the majority of patients had good knowledge concerning AMD, there was a large percentage of patients who seemed to lack information. Physicians should actively ask their patients if they have any questions related to their disease. Medial focus on AMD and information about aid organizations could help patients to cope with their disease. ConclusionA large number of patients seemed to need additional information. We suggest that ophthalmologists provide general information concerning AMD to their patients every 3 to 5 years. Information about aid organizations specializing in visual impairment could also be provided. Well-informed patients would be better able to follow their physician’s instructions and would have a better understanding of their disease, particularly for the sake of therapy." .

This performance measure was applied to a normal population to determine the physiologic decay of retinal sensitivity with aging. Further, the development of this performance measure was followed in 54 glaucoma eyes which were divided into three groups: Untreated, treated with satisfactory intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation, and treated with unsatisfactory IOP regulation. All eyes were examined perimetrically on at least three separate occasions. Decaying performance measures were found in the preponderance of glaucoma eyes. Therapy aimed at lowering the IOP did not offer a protective effect. Papillary hemorrhage and a significant decay in performance are usually found in the same eye." .

SettingDepartment of Ophthalmology, Kitasato University Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan. DesignRetrospective case series. MethodsThis study comprised 12 eyes in 12 patients (age 66.2 ± 5.6 years) who underwent photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) enhancement to improve their dissatisfaction after pseudophakic monovision. We quantitatively assessed the visual and refractive outcomes and the subjective satisfaction measured using a visual analog scale, that ranged from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), before and 3 months after PRK enhancement. ResultsSix (50%) of the 12 patients were dissatisfied with their various distance visions because of a large amount of anisometropia (≥2.50 D). Two (16.7%) were dissatisfied with their distance vision after conventional monovision because of residual cylindrical errors (≥0.75 D) in the dominant eye. Three (25%) was an unknown origin. The remaining one of the 12 patients was dissatisfied due to the unadaptability to crossed monovision. Eleven (91.7%) eyes were within ±0.5 D of the targeted correction after PRK enhancement. The overall satisfaction score was significantly improved, from 3.7 ± 2.4 (range 0–7) preoperatively to 6.0 ± 2.4 (range 2–9) postoperatively (p = 0.02). No vision-threatening complications were seen throughout the observation period. ConclusionsPRK enhancement was effective with predictable refractive results and thus improved patient satisfaction for dissatisfied patients after pseudophakic monovision. These findings also suggest that the accurate correction of refractive errors plays a key role in successful pseudophakic monovision." .

The 4 dissociated cell populations were cultured separately and in all double combinations. Two different types of IVR's were generated; one developed from central or peripheral retinal cells, the other required the addition of pigmented cells from the ciliary margin of the eye. The shape of these IVR's was examined using scanning electron microscopy, and they were also characterized histologically. The acetylcholinesterase pattern marked the inner half of the retina; F11-antibody and a peanut agglutinin marker revealed both plexiform layers and a radial fiber system. In both types, organized histotypical areas consisted of complete sets of retinal layers. In the type containing pigmented cells from the eye periphery, the sequence of layers was identical with that of an in-situ-retina (“laminar IVR”). In IVR's derived from retinal cells only, the sequence of layers was reversed (“rosetted IVR”)." .

The eyes of C57BL/6J mice were fixed with glutaraldehyde followed by either freeze substitution, or embedding in glycol methacrylate, a water-miscible embedding medium, after limited or no dehydration. In these preparations, microfibrils were present within sheet-like layers observed in the posterior chamber of the eye. The material enclosing the microfibrils that formed the layer was also preserved, at least partially, by fixation of the tissue with uranyl acetate or potassium permanganate (KMnO4) as observed in the chick eye. This microfibril-associated material was found to be composed of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as shown by positive immunostaining for HSPG, as well as by identification of 4.5 nm-wide HSPG double tracks as its major constituent. When a considerable amount of this material was lost in KMnO4-fixed tissues, the remaining portion was preserved in the form of clusters of about 50 nm in width which were periodically adhered along the length of microfibrils. At the center of each cluster, a minute dark particulate structure was present. It was composed of an approximately 10 nm-wide polygonal assembly of 3.5 nm-wide ring-like structures, and was, in unfixed chick eyes, positively immunostained for fibrillin. The periodicity of HSPG clusters, and of fibrillin, along the length of immunostained microfibrils was similar, ranging from 45 nm to 65 nm. These observations indicate that fibrillin is periodically associated at the surface of “classical” microfibrils, and it may mediate the association of large amounts of HSPG to microfibrils." .

In the posterior chamber of the eye of the C57BL/6J mouse, 3 nm-wide ribbon-like double-tracked structures were present and were periodically associated on either side with 3.5 nm-wide particulate structures identified as pentosomes, the subunits of amyloid P component (AP). At certain sites, such composite structures were observed in various stages of helical winding, and in these helices, pentosomes were preferentially localized internally. In helices in the final stages of winding, the resulting rods appeared increasingly similar to those of microfibrils. In experiments in vitro, incubation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in TRIS buffer, pH 7.4, at 35°C for 1 h produced random aggregates of 3 nm-wide double-tracked structures similar to those observed in the eye. Co-incubation of CSPG and AP resulted in the formation of rod-like structures arranged parallel to one another in approximately 50 nm-thick sheet-like layers. These rods were ultrastructurally similar to microfibrils and were made up of helically wound, 3 nm-wide double-tracked structures containing pentosomes within their core. The results of in vivo as well as in vitro experiments suggest the possibility that the connective tissue microfibril is composed of helically wound, CSPG-containing, 3 nm-wide double-tracked structures periodically associated with pentosomes which, as the helix becomes progressively tighter, fit with one another at the core of the helix to form successive 8.5 nm-wide disks of AP segments." .

We have characterised the astroglial lineage of the lizard optic pathway throughout its ontogeny (embryonic stage 30 [E30] to adults) by using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to detect the proliferation marker PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the transcription factor Pax2 and the gliofilament proteins vimentin (Vim) and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein). PCNA+ cells were abundant until E39, with GFAP+/PCNA+ astrocytes being observed between E37 and hatching. Proliferation diminished markedly afterwards, being undetectable in the adult optic pathway. Müller glia of the central retina expressed Pax2 from E37 and their endfeet accumulated Vim from E33 and GFAP from E37 onwards. Astrocytes were absent in the avascular lizard retina, whereas abundant Pax2+ astrocytes were observed in the ON from E30. A major subpopulation of these astrocytes coexpressed Vim from E35 and also GFAP from E37 onwards; thus the majority of mature astrocytes coexpressed Pax2/Vim/GFAP. The astrocytes were ultrastructurally identified by their gliofilaments, microtubules, dense bodies, desmosomes and glycogen granules, which preferentially accumulated in cell processes. Astrocytes in the adult ON coexpressed both gliofilaments and presented desmosomes indicating a reinforcement of the ON structure; this is physiologically necessary for local adaptation to mechanical forces linked to eye movement. We suggest that astrocytes forming this structural scaffold facilitate the regrowth of RGCs after ON transection." .

The insides of the cups are lined with tapetal cells, which produce several layers of reflecting crystals. The reflecting crystals form a concave mirror in each cup upon which the retinular cells rest. The two-celled rhabdoms are few and perpendicular to the tapetal layer. The axons from the tripartite eye leave the retinular cells distally in three separate groups. The eye is thus of the inverse type. Large lens cells, with a low refractive index, are present in the open part of each cup. Distal to the lens cells, highly refractive lenses are formed in the cuticle. These lenses serve to decrease the effective curvature of the mirrors, thus enabling the reflectors to produce a focused image on the retina. The ventral cup differs by the lack of a cuticular lens and has degenerated-appearing cellular elements. The investigated nauplius eye is the only one known with both a mirror and a highly refractive lens in the dioptric apparatus." .

Twelve eyes (9 patients) with high myopia (more than −14 diopters) were implanted with ZB5M lenses (Domilens, France). The corneal endothelium was studied by fluorophotometry (endothelial transfer coefficient: kc.ca), specular microscopy and ultrasonic pachimetry. Tests were performed prior to and 3 and 6 months after the surgery. The Wilcoxon rank test was used for the statistical analysis of the data. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the preoperative kc.ca (4.15 ± 0.72 × 10−3 min−1) and the kc.ca three months after the implantation (4.43 ± 0.87 × 10−3 min−1). A statistically significant difference (p<0.01) was also found between the three and six months postoperative kc.ca (5.31 ± 0.81 × 10−3 min−1). There was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the preoperative central endothelial cell density (2533 ± 219 cells/mm2) and the six months postoperative central endothelial cell density (2385 ± 191 cells/mm2). No significant differences were found in relation to the central corneal thickness. In conclusion, three months after the implantation of ZB5M lenses to correct high myopia in phakic eyes, the corneal endothelial function was altered and continued to be so six months after the operation." .

The rhabdom's fine structure is typical of decapods but its dual overall form and position mingle certain features of both apposition and superposition compound eye types. Distal and proximal retinal pigments both showed adaptive migration, but the distal pigment cells moved over a restricted range, and DA separated the retinular cell pigment granules into two groups, perinuclear and basilar. In the rhabdom no changes in its position, dimensions or microvillus fine structure were observed with LA or DA. But at the base of the rhabdom microvilli the rate of pinocytosis was strongly affected by the eye's adaptive state, being lowest after 17 hours DA and greatest after 17 hours LA; the wall of the 0.1 μ microvesicles so formed, looked like the membrane of the rhabdom microvillus and they were the same size as the vesicles in multivesicular bodies and in vesicular lamellar bodies. Three categories of complex cytoplasmic particles about 1 μ in diameter (multivesicular bodies, vesicular lamellar bodies and purely lamellar bodies) were all increased in number by decreased DA and by increased LA; similar quantitative effects occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the ribosomes. The pinocytotic vesicles and the complex cytoplasmic bodies may represent part of an intracellular system to dispose of rhabdom metabolites whose production was initiated or increased by light absorption. Cytoplasmic and perirhabdomal vacuoles mainly distal in location, were also affected by light, but inversely; their maximal extent occurred after 17 hours DA; less DA or any LA significantly decreased their presence and aggregation. The data reported are of interest not only because they correlate retinal fine structure with the metabolism of vision but also because they provide a new and specific tool for distinguishing active from inactive neurosensory cells in the optic pathway." .

MethodsCorneal and ocular HOAs of the right eyes of 87 normal subjects were measured using videokeratography and the Hartmann–Shack wavefront aberrometer (KR-9000PW; Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The HOAs were calculated using Zernike polynomials up to the sixth order. From the Zernike coefficients, the root mean squares (RMS) of coma and spherical aberration were calculated. ResultsCorneal spherical-like aberrations significantly correlated with age (r = 0.420, p < 0.001); however, coma-like aberrations and total HOAs did not significantly correlate with age. None of the ocular HOAs significantly correlated with age. In addition, a gender-wise comparison of the collected data showed that corneal and ocular HOAs did not significantly correlate with age. ConclusionIn children, the corneal and ocular total HOAs did not vary with age. Compared to the previous reports in adults, we found fewer corneal and ocular HOAs in children." .

Although several diagnostic tools have been developed to detect and monitor this disease, none has the requisite sensitivity to identify it at a preclinical stage or to perceive small changes in retinal health over short periods. Specifically, irreversible visual changes occur before neuronal damage is discovered. The most widely accepted in vitro assay for apoptotic cells involves the use of fluorescent annexin A5. The radiolabelling of this marker makes it possible to assess, in vivo and non-invasively, various diseases in which the apoptotic process is pivotal, such as myocardial infarction or tumour response to chemotherapy. Recently, a new technique has been developed to visualise directly individual RGCs undergoing apoptosis in the living eye. This DARC (detection of apoptosing retinal cells) technology uses fluorescently labelled annexin A5 to bind apoptosing retinal neurons and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy to detect the marked dying cells. Based on experimental models, DARC has been suggested to offer a direct and quantitative assessment of the retinal condition of patients. A Phase I clinical trial in glaucoma patients is scheduled to start shortly. This technology has the potential to pre-empt the diagnosis of glaucoma prior to visual deterioration, to provide an accurate numeric evaluation highlighting even small retinal changes and to allow the rapid judgement of the efficacy of both current and new therapeutic strategies." .

The temperature difference between the cornea and the iris (at core body temperature) causes circulation of the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber of the eye. Others have suggested that the circulation pattern governs the shape of the Krukenberg spindle, a distinctive vertical band of pigment on the posterior cornea surface in some pathologies. We modeled aqueous humor flow the human eye, treating the humor as a Boussinesq fluid and setting the corneal temperature based on infrared surface temperature measurements. The model predicts convection currents in the anterior chamber with velocities comparable to those resulting from forced flow through the gap between the iris and lens. When paths of pigment particles are calculated based on the predicted flow field, the particles circulate throughout the anterior chamber but tend to be near the vertical centerline of the eye for a greatest period of time. Further, the particles are usually in close proximity to the cornea only when they are near the vertical centerline. We conclude that the convective flow pattern of aqueous humor is consistent with a vertical pigment spindle. © 2002 Biomedical Engineering Society. PAC2002: 4266Ew, 8710+e, 8719Pp" .

AGEs progressively accumulate in the aging lens and retina and accumulate at a higher rate in diseases that adversely affect vision such as, cataract, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. In the lens AGEs induce irreversible changes in structural proteins, which lead to lens protein aggregation and formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates that scatter light and impede vision. In the retina AGEs modify intra- and extracellular proteins that lead to an increase in oxidative stress and formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promote vascular dysfunction. This review outlines recent advances in AGE research focusing on the mechanisms of their formation and their role in cataract and pathologies of the retina. The therapeutic action and pharmacological strategies of anti-AGE agents that can inhibit or prevent AGE formation in the eye are also discussed." .

We present the multimodal imaging results of a patient who underwent an ileocecal resection for Crohn’s disease and presented with nyctalopia and bilateral central scotomas. MethodReport of a single case. ResultsThe patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/32 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination identified small elevated focal translucent foamy Bitot’s spots on the superficial bulbar conjunctiva near the temporal limbus, and these lesions were also detected using swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, fundus photography revealed small yellow lesions in the peripheral retina, and swept-source OCT showed focal irregularities of the ellipsoid zone in the retina. Initial work-up revealed a vitamin A level of 0.05 mg/L (normal range 0.3–1.2 mg/L), and the patient was treated with a daily 10,000 IU dose of vitamin A. After 6 months of treatment, the patient’s retinal sensitivity improved in both eyes, as detected by microperimetry. ConclusionThe use of OCT can have utility in imaging anterior segment abnormalities as well as retinal changes in patients presenting with xerophthalmia associated with vitamin A deficiency. Patients who have undergone intestinal resection should have regular check-ups for vitamin A levels, and be promptly treated to prevent eye pathologies and visual symptoms." .

MethodsConfluent cultures of human cornea and conjunctival cell lines were exposed for 25 minutes to different glaucoma medications as well as a range of concentrations of BAK (0.001%–0.050%). Balanced salt solution was used as the “live” control and a solution containing 70% methanol and 0.2% saponin was used as a “dead” control. The number of dead and live cells were determined via ethidium homodimer (Eth-1) and calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM) fluorescence, respectively. ResultsThe toxicity of the prostaglandin analog with beta-blocker timolol fixed-combination formulations preserved with BAK was different from that observed in the respective BAK concentrations. Travoprost plus timolol fixed combination with BAK performed better than its respective BAK concentration alone, while the latanoprost plus timolol fixed combination performed worse than its respective BAK concentration. Travoprost plus timolol fixed combination preserved with PQ had greater corneal and conjunctival cell survival than either the travoprost plus timolol fixed combination preserved with BAK or the latanoprost plus timolol fixed combination. ConclusionOcular surface side effects have previously been demonstrated with chronic, long-term exposure to intraocular-pressure-lowering medications containing the common preservative BAK. BAK alone has significant in-vitro cytotoxicity to cultured ocular epithelial cells. Substitution of BAK with PQ resulted in significantly higher percentages of live conjunctival and corneal cells. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical implications of these findings." .

Ten cynomolgus monkeys were treated with a hematoporphyrin derivative, given intravenously at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. Forty minutes or 1 or 3 days after the injection, argon laser photoradiation was given over a 2.0-mm-diameter with a 10-min exposure and at an intensity of 40, 100, or 200 mW. The eyes were enucleated 1, 3, 4, 15, 18, 21, 35, or 38 days after the photoradiation and tissue samples were observed under a transmission electron microscope. The most fragile regions in the retina were the retinal nerve fibers, the outer segments of the visual cells, and the retinal pigment epithelium. Vascular endothelial cells were also fragile. The retinal capillary was easily obstructed, and the choriocapillaris was also occluded in an animal with severe retinal damage. The Mueller cells had the highest tolerance to the photodynamic treatment. Thus, exposing the normal part of the retina to light during photodynamic therapy should be avoided." .

They can induce pain on instillation, allergic reactions, delayed healing, punctate keratitis, disturbances of lacrimal secretion, disturbances of accommodation (especially the parasympathomimetics) and local pigmentation after prolonged use. Corticosteroids are associated with 2 major risks: chronic glaucoma and cataract, initially reversible if treatment is stopped. There is still a major risk of corneal herpes with corticosteroids. It is important to be aware of these local problems as they are responsible for poor patient compliance. The systemic effects essentially concern the agonists and antagonists of the autonomic nervous system. β-Blocker eye drops can cause bronchospasm, heart failure, syncope and psychiatric disorders, especially at high doses and with nonselective β-blockers. These consequences are usually related to failure to comply with the prescribing precautions. α-Adrenergic agonists, which exert dose-dependent effects, can induce hypertensive crises or angina attacks. Apart from patients at risk (children under the age of 30 months and the elderly), parasympathomimetics cause few systemic adverse effects; anticholinesterases, which have curare-like properties, are contraindicated for 6 weeks before general anaesthesia. In the very young and the very old, atropinic eye drops carry a risk of cardiovascular collapse and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Problems may also occur with other classes of drugs such as anti-infectives, antiseptics, anti-inflammatories and contact lens products. Nevertheless, it is clear that this form of treatment is generally very well tolerated in relation to the volume of eye drops prescribed by ophthalmologists each day." .

The follow-up of 25 cases of infantile cystinosis over a period of 26 years demonstrated that the corneal and retinal epithelium were affected in the same way as the kidney epithelium. Corneal involvement induced photophobia and discomfort, but actual blindness was mainly due to retinal involvement, and therefore no corneal graft was performed. The use of topical cysteamine appears to be promising, but its production raises many questions so no definitive conclusions may be made. Since 1965, 51 patients with nephronophthisis have had ocular examinations; all patients had characteristic clinical symptoms and histological findings. The first group, which consisted of 18 children, all under 10 years of age, was found to have obvious chorioretinal degeneration. The second group, which consisted of 11 children, had a normal ocular examination and normal electroretinogram (ERG). The third group, consisting of 22 children, had a normal clinical examination but ERG tracings with variable alterations. In 28 instances of Alport's syndrome, two types of ocular abnormalities have been observed. In six cases, an anterior lenticonus was noted, which caused a major decline in visual acuity. Retinopathy, which did not affect vision, was observed in 13 cases." .

Dry eye disease and dysfunction of ocular somatosensory pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis. The current study investigates the association between a dysfunctional tear film and ocular aberrations with migraine. MethodsSixty eyes of 30 patients with migraine and 60 eyes of 30 controls were studied. Dry eye evaluation included Schirmer’s test, tear film break-up time, corneal esthesiometry and lipid layer analysis using Lipiview® interferometer. Wavefront aberrations were measured using Optical Path Difference before performing the dry eye evaluation. The intraocular light scatter was quantified using the objective scatter index (OSI) of the optical quality analysis system. Measured parameters were compared between the migraine and the control group using independent sample t-test. Statistical analysis was performed using commercial software. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsThere were 19 females and 11 males in each group. Statistically significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to total aberrations (p = 0.049), higher order aberrations (p = 0.009), coma (p = 0.03), spherical aberrations (p = 0.018), Lipiview interferometric coloric units (p < 0.001) and OSI (p < 0.001). Trefoil (p = 0.26) and TBUT (p = 0.398) were not significantly different between both groups. ConclusionsOcular aberrations are higher in patients with migraine as compared with controls. Tear film abnormalities add to the aberrations in otherwise asymptomatic patients and may also be associated with migraineous attacks. Treating the ocular surface to obtain a healthy tear film might introduce a potential modifiable factor in the prevention of migraneous attacks." .

The consequence of small size and of low habitat illuminances for spatial acuity are assessed.2.In all phylogenetically advanced salticids examined in the present study, a foveal Layer I receptor contains a single rhabdomere organised as a light-guide. The following sections discuss Layer I:3.For open-space species, small size minimally prejudices spatial acuities: for the very largePhiale magnifica, optimal spatial acuity is estimated to be 2.3 arc min for adults, and 4.6 arc min for second-instar spiderlings. For adults of the small speciesJollas geniculatus (only slightly larger than second-instarPhiale) we obtain 5.2 arc min.4.For species occupying habitats in the forest understory, low illuminances appear to prejudice spatial acuity. For adults of the large speciesItata completa which lives beneath broad foliage, we obtain 5.8 arc min; for the small ant-mimicFluda princeps which inhabits the litter layer, we estimate 16.8 arc min.5.The results indicate that habitat illuminance only constrains retinal design when it is extremely low. Impaired spatial acuities in such dark habitats are predicted to limit behavioural repertoires, and, as a secondary consequence, the number of species that can co-exist in a given forest microhabitat.6.Receptor illuminances could, in principle, be modulated by adjustments to four factors: (i) focal lengths of the corneal lenses; (ii) the extent, or absence of the pigment stops that lie directly behind them; (iii) the magnification factors afforded by the diverging components of the telephoto lens systems; (iv) the tip diameters of foveal Layer I rhabdomeres. The first parameter is not manipulated: all corneal lenses have roughly the sameF-number (≃ 1.80). Forest species usually lack a pigment stop behind the corneal lens, the power of the diverging component is reduced or virtually absent, and rhabdomere diameters are large.7.The interface between the retinal matrix and the anterior chamber of the eye is irregularly convexiclivate in advanced salticids, two convexiclivate surfaces forming “saddles” that overlie the narrow dorsal and ventral arms of the retinal mosaics. It is confirmed that inPortia andLyssomanes, both from “primitive” subfamilies, the interfaces are not convexiclivate, as Williams and McIntyre (1980) noted." .

The results provide evidence that diplopodan ocelli are derived from typical mandibulate ommatidia, which consequently had been present in diplopod ancestors. The recent representatives of the two sister groups, Pselaphognatha and Chilognatha are characterized by two essentially different types of eye morphology: The eyes of the Pselaphognatha comprise a bilayered rhabdom (built up by 3+4 retinular cells), a few corneagenous cells, a corneal lens, and two vitreous bodies. The latter probably represent relics of a former crystalline cone. On the contrary, the ocelli of the Chilognatha consist of a multilayered rhabdom (built up by a large number of retinular cells), numerous corneagenous cells, and a corneal lens. The dioptric apparatus lacks a crystalline cone. Further structural elements, the distribution of which varies, are the covering cells and processes of hypodermal cells which contain screening pigments. Whereas the eye of the Pselaphognatha can be traced back to a single ommatidium, the ocellus of the Chilognatha can only be interpreted as a merging product of several associated ommatidia or as the result of multiplication and rearrangement of former ommatidial elements. This concept is substantiated by analogous phenomena which occur within other arthropod groups and thus serve as models for the phylogeny of the diplopodan eyes. The comparison of the morphology and the ecology of palaeozoic and recent diplopods demonstrates that the disintegration of former facetted eyes and the modification of ommatidia were induced by the adaptation to cryptic modes of life." .

Afterward, a combination of a maker-controlled watershed segmentation and mathematical morphology exiting that was applied to detect of OD. These two methods have complementary drawbacks and advantages, and this is the motivation for the hybrid method presented.

The methods were evaluated by applying to two-color retinal dataset [local dataset in Thailand and a public available diabetic retinopathy database (STARE)].

The aim of the study was to investigate whether there were any associated ocular anomalies in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), all of whom had revealed primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in biopsy. Thirty-three SRNS patients (16 male, 17 female) with a median age of 10.5 years (range 3–25 years) were enrolled in the study. Twenty steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) patients (ten male, ten female) with a median age of 8 years (range 3–15 years) served as controls. All SRNS patients were examined by mutational analysis for mutations in the NPHS2, WT1, and LAMB2 genes. Nine out of 33 SRNS patients (27.2%) showed various eye abnormalities. However, no abnormal ocular findings were detected in any of the SSNS patients. Abnormal eye findings detected in SRNS patients were anisometropic amblyopia (n = 4), Mittendorf’s dots (n = 4), myopic astigmatism (n = 3) and exotropia (n = 1). Macular pigment changes (n = 1), posterior subcapsular opacities (n = 1) and cataract (n = 1) were considered as steroid-induced side effects. In four patients, more than one eye abnormality was found. Mutational analysis for the NPHS2, WT1 and LAMB2 genes revealed disease-causing mutations in 24.2% of patients. Homozygous NPHS2 mutations were detected in five patients (15.1%), all of whom had parental consanguinity. In three patients (9%) from non-consanguineous parents, heterozygous de novo WT1 mutations were detected as disease-causing mutations. No LAMB2 mutation was detected in any patient. While four out of five (80%) patients with homozygous NPHS2 mutations showed at least one abnormal ocular finding (i.e. Mittendorf’s dot or anisometric amblyopia), none of the patients with a WT1 mutation had ocular involvement. In conclusion, ocular involvement may accompany SRNS caused by primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Ophthalmologic evaluation at the time of diagnosis might be beneficial to characterize further the spectrum of this possible association." .

MethodsThis retrospective study included 20 POAG patients who were treated with Nifedipine (5 mg daily) and 20 untreated control POAG patients. In both the treated and untreated control group, a distinction was made between those patients who had the Flammer-Syndrome (FS) and those who did not. The RVP was measured in all patients bilaterally at baseline and 3 weeks later by means of contact lens ophthalmodynamometry and the RVP measurements of the treated POAG patients were compared to the RVPs of the untreated POAG controls. Ophthalmodynamometry is done by applying an increasing force on the eye via a contact lens. The minimum force required to induce a venous pulsation is called the ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF). The RVP is defined and calculated as the sum of ODF and intraocular pressure (IOP) [RVP = ODF + IOP]. ResultsThe RVP decreased significantly after 3 weeks in both eyes of patients treated with low-dosed Nifedipine compared to the untreated group (mean decrease of 12.5 mmHg (SD 12.5), P < 0.001). A larger response to therapy was found in patients with the FS compared to patients lacking the FS (mean decrease of 16.07 vs. 7.28 mmHg, confidence Interval (CI): 5.2 to 9.3 vs. 12.3 to 19.7; P < 0.001). No significant differences were accounted for in the IOP’s of the patients after treatment. In the untreated control group, no significant differences were accounted for either in the RVP or the IOP after 3 weeks. ConclusionsTreatment with low-dosed Nifedipine decreases RVP in both eyes of glaucoma patients, particularly in those with the Flammer-Syndrome. This effect may be due to the partial inhibition of Endothelin-1 (ET-1) by Nifedipine." .

Cell soma sizes were measured in carefully matched regions of Nissl-stained wholemounted retinae after either nerve crush, nerve cut with stump separation, nerve crush with intraocular nerve growth factor (NGF) or nerve cut with NGF applied to the proximal stump. The state of axonal regeneration was also assessed in each case by anterograde transport of HRP. Following nerve crush axons crossed the lesion by 7 days, reached the chiasma by 14 days and entered the tectum around 20–30 days. The normally evenly stained ganglion cells exhibited granular Nissl staining at 7 and 10 days but very little change in soma size. From 10 to 28 days the mean retinal ganglion cell area increased by 102% and maintained this size until at least 75 days. By 102 days soma size had nearly returned to normal. A population of displaced amacrine cells retained a normal appearance and soma size throughout regeneration. Following nerve cut and stump separation the retinal ganglion cells were slightly more reactive in appearance at 7 days after crush but otherwise the soma reaction developed in a similar manner. Axon tracing revealed no extension beyond the lesion site in these animals and therefore the state of axonal growth did not affect the early soma response. NGF applied at the time of the lesion had no detectable effect on the soma reaction. Although many retinal ganglion cells re-establish contact with visual centres after axotomy in the frog, a considerable proportion die. This contrasts with both the goldfish, where all cells regenerate successfully, and various mammals, where none do so and all retinal ganglion cells die. All retinal ganglion cells in the frog undergo reactive changes similar to those of goldfish and there is no sign of the cell shrinkage seen in mammals. Therefore the cell death in frog would appear to be different from that in mammalian retina but similar to that of mammalian peripheral nerve in which chromatolysis generally preceeds death." .

MethodsThis study was performed on 91 eyes of 91 patients who underwent uneventful cataract surgery. Ocular biometry values were measured using the IOL Master 500, and intraocular lens (IOL) power was calculated using the Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and SRK/T formulas. We calculated the expected difference (ED) of each 3rd generation formula from the Haigis formula by subtracting the predicted refraction of the Haigis formula from the predicted refraction of each 3rd generation formula. Post-operative anterior chamber depth (ACD) was measured at 1 month after surgery using the IOL master. We calculated errors of each formula by subtracting predicted from manifest refraction at post-operative 1 month. Correlation analysis was performed between ocular biometry values, formula expectation values, formula errors and absolute formula errors. ResultsMultiple regression analysis revealed that preoperative ACD was the only significant factor for ED prediction in all of the 3rd generation formulas. For mean errors, axial length and post-operative 1-month change of ACD (delta ACD) correlated significantly with the errors in all 3rd generation formulas, but not with errors of the Haigis formula. Median absolute error (MedAE) of the formulas were 0.40 D for the Hoffer Q formula, 0.37 D for the Holladay formula, 0.34 D for the SRK/T formula, and 0.41 D for the Haigis formula. The MAE of the formulas were 0.50 ± 0.47 D for the Hoffer Q formula, 0.50 ± 0.50 D for the Holladay formula, 0.47 ± 0.51 D for the SRK/T formula, and 0.50 ± 0.47 D for the Haigis formula. ConclusionRegarding ED between the third generation and Haigis formulas, preoperative ACD demonstrated the greatest influence. Calculating mean absolute errors of the formulas, all IOL formulas showed excellent and comparable accuracy. Post-operative change (delta) of ACD correlated significantly with errors of third generation formulas according to simulated ACD." .

There is no perfect way to prevent avascular bleb formation. We hypothesized that keeping the conjunctiva away from direct exposure to aqueous filtration may suppress avascular bleb formation after filtration surgery with MMC. In order to prove our hypothesis, we investigated whether a thin biodegradable, honeycomb-patterned film (HPF) can reduce bleb avascularity in a rabbit model of filtration surgery with mitomycin C (MMC). MethodsA fornix-based full-thickness filtration surgery was performed in one eye of each of five rabbits (control group). The same surgery with intraoperative MMC treatment was done in both eyes of six rabbits, with one eye receiving a 14-μm-thick HPF made from poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone), which was placed subconjunctivally over the filtration site with the honeycomb surface facing up. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, bleb evaluations using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were performed periodically for 4 weeks postoperatively followed by histological examination. ResultsThe postoperative IOP decrease and bleb survival were significantly greater in MMC-treated eyes than in control eyes, and were similar between MMC-only and MMC + HPF eyes. The avascular area in the bleb persisted for 4 weeks in MMC-only eyes. Postoperative IVCM showed morphological changes of the conjunctival epithelial cells (i.e., enlarged and variable in size and shape) and epithelial defects in MMC-only eyes, and significantly lower density of connective tissue and vascularity in the subepithelial space in MMC-only eyes compared to the control eyes. These IVCM findings agreed with those by UBM and histology. Bleb avascularity shown by clinical bleb appearance, IVCM and histology, conjunctival epithelial damage shown by IVCM and histology, and loose subepithelial connective tissue shown by UBM, IVCM, and histology were all reduced in MMC + HPF eyes compared to MMC-only eyes. ConclusionsIVCM successfully showed the characteristic conjunctival damage in MMC-treated blebs. The concomitant use of a thin biodegradable HPF reduced avascularity and conjunctival damage in blebs, without compromising filtration in rabbits following filtration surgery with MMC." .

The most extreme form, high myopia, is usually associated with other ocular disorders such as retinal detachment, macular degeneration, cataract, and glaucoma, and is one of leading causes of blindness. The etiology is complex and has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel missense variant of the CCDC111 gene (NM_152683.2: c.265T > G; p.Y89D) in a high myopia family by exome sequencing. The variant was identified in 4 patients from an additional 270 sporadic high myopia patients, but not found in 270 controls. The amino acid is highly conserved across species, and variants giving rise to amino acid substitutions are predicted to be functionally damaging. The CCDC111 gene was ubiquitously expressed in primary cell cultures from human eye tissue, including corneal epithelial cells, choroidal melanoma cells, scleral fibroblasts, retinal epithelial cells, retinal Müller cells, and lens capsule epithelial cells. In summary, our results suggested that the CCDC111 may be a susceptibility gene for high myopia." .

The fascicles in the optic nerve are clearly demarcated by astrocytic processes, in contrast to the fascicles in the tectum. No astrocytes could be identified in the tectum; in this region processes of astrocytes or of radial glial cells do not form channeling structures reminiscent of those in the optic nerve. Furthermore, tectal blood vessels lack complete investments of glial processes. It can be assumed that at least in lower vertebrates a framework of astrocytic processes might be important for growth of optic fibers over large distances, i.e., from the eye to the tectum, but may be dispensable in the target region itself." .

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reported associations with IOP at TMCO1 and GAS7, and with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at CDKN2B-AS1, CAV1/CAV2, and SIX1/SIX6. To identify novel genetic variants and replicate the published findings, we performed GWAS and meta-analysis of IOP in >6,000 subjects of European ancestry collected in three datasets: the NEI Glaucoma Human genetics collaBORation, GLAUcoma Genes and ENvironment study, and a subset of the Age-related Macular Degeneration-Michigan, Mayo, AREDS and Pennsylvania study. While no signal achieved genome-wide significance in individual datasets, a meta-analysis identified significant associations with IOP at TMCO1 (rs7518099-G, p = 8.0 × 10−8). Focused analyses of five loci previously reported for IOP and/or POAG, i.e., TMCO1, CDKN2B-AS1, GAS7, CAV1/CAV2, and SIX1/SIX6, revealed associations with IOP that were largely consistent across our three datasets, and replicated the previously reported associations in both effect size and direction. These results confirm the involvement of common variants in multiple genomic regions in regulating IOP and/or glaucoma risk." .

Although the rat has been considered refractory to both the systemic and local effects of endotoxin, the present study has shown that intravitreal injection of endotoxin evoked a characteristic acute inflammatory response which was reproducible and dose-dependent. In addition, a consensual ocular response in the control eye occurred which was less severe but also dose-dependent. Preliminary investigations support the view that consensual responses of this nature may be mediated by a nervous reflex arc mechanism. Sequential histological analysis revealed a marked polymorphonuclear cell infiltration of most ocular tissues in the early stages, while mononuclear cells predominated after 3 days. Widespread intravascular microthrombi were also observed, particularly in the ciliary vessels. Recovery, however, was usually complete by 7 days." .

As a first approach to the hypothesis that harbor seals can obtain acute aerial visual acuity mediated by the interaction of the vertical slit-shaped pupil and the corneal flattening although refractive measurements had revealed aerial myopia, visual acuity was tested as a function of luminance and pupil dilation. We analyzed aerial visual acuity (minimal resolvable stripe width) in three harbor seals in a two-alternative-forced-choice discrimination experiment. Our results further support the hypothesis that harbor seals possess an aerial visual acuity comparable to the acuity in clear waters if the vertical slit pupil does not exceed the zone of corneal flattening in bright light. When the pupil dilates with decreasing luminance, visual acuity decreases which might be due to deflected light from the stronger curved peripheral cornea." .

Regular exposure to sunlight increases the risk of cataract development. Ultraviolet light causes oxidative stress which induces DNA damage in the lens epithelium and the development of opacities. The existence of DNA repair in lens epithelial cells has been reported, and polymorphisms of DNA repair genes may affect repair efficiency. This work aims to study the frequency of polymorphisms of two DNA repair genes, xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group D (XPD) codon751 and X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) codon399, in cataract in the sunny weather of Egypt. Forty-two Egyptian patients with maturity onset cataract were compared to 41 control subjects using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. There was a significant increase in frequency of XRCC1-399 Arg/Arg genotype in cataract patients (42.8%) compared to healthy controls (22%) (p = 0.042).This increase remained significant after redistribution according to occupational exposure. No significant difference was found for the genotypic and allelic distributions of the polymorphisms in XPD-751 gene (p > 0.05) between groups. There was a significant increase in cataract development in subjects with high exposure risk to sunlight more than those with low risk, either due to their occupation (p = 0.034) or to residence in sunny areas of upper Egypt (p = 0.037). Findings suggest that polymorphism in XRCC1 codon399 may predispose to the development of maturity-onset cataract and support the hypothesis that sun exposure is a leading factor for cataract development." .

Larvae have well-developed apposition eyes, including 3 main types of accessory screening and reflecting pigments and a fourth class of putatively reflective granules recently described in adult shrimps. Rhabdoms contain orthogonally layered microvilli, and by the last larval stage, 8 retinular cells. Ocular accessory pigments in both light- and dark-adapted larvae are distributed much like those of light-adapted adults, but the distal mass of reflecting pigment is concentrated dorsally in larvae and ventrally in adults. Since larvae swim upside-down, reflecting pigment is oriented downward in all developmental stages and may function for countershading. Light and dark adaptational migrations of all 3 major accessory pigments commence abruptly at metamorphosis to the first postlarva. Upon dark adaptation in postlarvae, superposition optics remain impossible because (1) distal screening pigment migrates only slightly, (2) no clear zone has developed, and (3) the crystalline cones remain circular in cross section. Nevertheless, a slight improvement in photon catch is expected due to extensive redistributions of reflecting pigment and retinular cell screening pigment granules." .

The consequences of age-related visual change are particularly evident in the presence of serious disorders of the eye such as cataract. Cataracts, a near-universal visual outcome of aging, increase the opacity and light scattering properties of the lens. These changes, in turn, impair acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color discrimination, especially under conditions of dim illumination or strong glare. Research shows that the performance, safety, mobility, comfort, and driving habits of older drivers are affected adversely by cataract-induced visual loss. Conversely, the striking improvements in sight with surgical replacement of the cataractous lens appear to enhance aging drivers’ performance and safety. The relative benefits of treating cataracts unilaterally versus bilaterally, however, have yet to be determined, as do the direct and mobility-mediated effects of cataract and cataract treatment on psychosocial variables that contribute to well-being and quality of life." .

To stimulate ganglion cells, epiretinally flat platinum microelectrodes embedded in thin polyimide film were developed and tested in the cat. Methods: After remo-val of the lens and the vitreous body a thin microfilm electrode array was implanted through a corneoscleral incision in the cat eye (n=4). In two eyes no further attempt was made to fixate the tip of the electrode, which was pressed onto the retinal surface due to the tension of the curved polyimide film. In two eyes the tip of the electrode was fixed with cyanoacrylate adhesive. The exterior part of the microelectrode film was directed under the skin towards the forehead which allowed fixation of the microplug to a head fixation bolt. Retinal stimulation experiments were performed within 1 week after implantation. Success of stimulation was assessed by recording neuronal activities from areas 17 and 18. Retinal microelectrodes were removed 2 weeks or longer after implantation. Results: Intraocular inflammation or retinal detachment were not observed after implantation of the microelectrode film. In two eyes the tip of the microelectrodes dislocated spontaneously within the first few days. The lowest threshold of electrical stimulation was 35 µA, corresponding to a charge transfer of 14 nC per phase. These values were ten times higher than those obtained by needle electrodes used in prior experiments. Conclusions: Intraocular implanted flat microelectrodes made of platinum and polyimide were well tolerated. Because of the flat configuration of the microelectrodes higher stimulation thresholds than for needle electrodes were found, indicating insufficient con-tact to the retinal surface. An alter-native shape and fixation technique is required to minimise electrodes’ threshold of stimulation." .

MethodsFour myopic patients (2 males, mean age 45 years, axial length 27–30 mm) were analyzed using swept source OCT Triton Topcon (DRI Triton; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) and 3 × 3, 4.5 × 4.5, and 9 × 9 mm scans were obtained. Topcon Image6 software was used to segment retinal layers and to extract both OCTA reconstructions of superficial, deep and choriocapillary plexa, and en face images. ResultsOCT analysis clearly revealed retinochoroidal structures, including both inner and outer choroidal segments, the external limiting membrane, and the retinal pigment epithelium in all patients. OCTA analysis was able to reconstruct superficial, deep and choriocapillary plexa in all patients. On 9 × 9 OCTA and en face reconstructions of every patient, a circular, linear, hyporeflective area was found circumscribing the retinal vascular arcades, as a frame; no vessels were detected in this area. DiscussionIn accordance with previous studies, vessel rarefaction was reported. The dark circular area found in 9 × 9 scans had characteristic aspects, as the presence in both eyes, specularity, absence of vascularization, and lack of ophthalmoscopic evidence. In the B‑scan images, a mirror reflection of retinal profile, appearing upside down, was observed. This aspect can be due to the reflection of retinal reconstruction caused by the high curvature of the eye and to the staphyloma. Differential diagnosis might be choroidal rupture, even though the specularity and the presence of the dark area in all the layers clear the picture. ConclusionThis study confirmed that OCTA in high myopia can be affected by a number of pitfalls and this should be taken into account for the right interpretation of OCTA reconstructions." .

Although there are a great number of studies concerning the uptake of taurine in several tissues, the regulation of taurine transport has not been studied in the retina after lesioning the optic nerve. In the present study, isolated retinal cells of the goldfish retina were used either immediatly after cell suspension or in culture. The high-affinity transport system of [3H]taurine in these cells was sodium-, temperature- and energy-dependent, and was inhibited by hypotaurine and β-alanine, but not by γ-aminobutyric acid. There was a decrease in the maximal velocity (Vmax) without modifications in the substrate affinity (Km) after optic axotomy. These changes were mantained for up to 15 days after the lesion. The results might be the summation of mechanisms for providing extracellular taurine to be taken up by other retinal cells or eye structures, or regulation by the substrate taurine, which increases after lesioning the optic nerve. The in vivo accumulation of [3H]taurine in the retina after intraocular injection of [3H]taurine was affected by crushing the optic nerve or by axotomy. A progressive retinal decrease in taurine transport was observed after crushing the optic nerve, starting at 7 hours after surgery on the nerve. The uptake of [3H]taurine by the tectum was compensated in the animals that were subjected to crushing of the optic nerve, since the concentration of [3H]taurine was only different from the control value 24 hours after the lesion, indicating an efficient transport by the remaining axons. On the contrary, the low levels of [3H]taurine in the tectum after axotomy might be an index of the non-axonal origin of taurine in the tectum. Axonal transport was illustrated by the differential presence of [3H]taurine in the intact or crushed optic nerve. The uptake of [3H]taurine into retinal cells in culture in the absence or in the presence of taurine might indicate the existence of an adaptive regulation of taurine transport in this tissue, however taurine transport probably differentially occurs in specific populations of retinal cells. The use of a purified preparation of cells might be useful for future studies on the modulation of taurine transport by taurine in the retina and its role during regeneration." .

The terminal vessels form a single-layered sheath intimately adjacent to the vitreal side of the avascular retina. The hyaloid system is subdivided by the ventral venous trunk into three central areas: the dorsal, the temporo-ventral, and the naso-ventral area. Toward the ora serrata, the hyaloid system is bordered by an arterial ring, and by nasal and temporal venous branches forming more or less complete hemicircles. A vascular zone composed of several tongue-like sectors establishes an inter-connection between the peripheral vascular rings and the central areas of the fundus. The arterial blood is supplied from the arterial ring. The drainage of the hyaloid system is provided via two routes: (1) the Y-shaped ventral trunk collects blood from the central areas, (2) the two peripheral venous branches drain the tongue-like sectors. The vessels within the dorsal area follow preferentially a dorso-ventral meridional direction. This densely capillarized territory corresponds in localization to the area centralis retinae. The ultrastructure of microvessels of the hyaloid system is characterized by features typical for capillaries of the central nervous system." .

MethodsIOP and BP measurements were recorded from 37 brass and 15 woodwind instrument players, before and after playing tones of low, middle and high frequency. We also measured IOP and BP before and during playing common exercises of 10 minutes duration, as well as after playing a sustained high-pitched tone, to test for changes in IOP under conditions of maximum effort. ResultsPlaying tones on brass and woodwind instruments causes a temporary elevation in IOP and BP, depending on the tone frequency: brass instrument players showed a significant elevation after playing high and middle frequency tones (p < 0.0001) whereas woodwind instrument players showed a significant increase only for high frequencies (e.g., oboe, 17 ± 2.9 mm Hg to 21 ± 4.4 mm Hg; p = 0.017). Playing a typical exercise of 10 minutes temporarily increased IOP in both groups of musicians. Finally, playing a sustained tone of high pitch caused a significant elevation in IOP in brass instrument players only (16.6 ± 3.5 mm Hg to 23.3 ± 8.9 mm Hg; p < 0.0001). ConclusionsThe temporary and sometimes dramatic elevations and fluctuations in IOP observed in this study, coupled with daily exposure to instrument play, puts professional wind instrument players at increased risk of developing glaucoma. Consequently, these musicians should be monitored for signs of glaucoma, especially those with co-existing risk factors." .

In the lateral ocellus the receptor cells synapse up to 8 ocellar nerve fibers, and in the median ocellus they synapse up to 16 (20–30 μm thick) ocellar nerve fibers. The ocellar synaptic plexus may display three types of synapses between the two types of neurons: (i) Receptor-cell axons are presynaptic to dendrites of the first-order interneurons. (ii) Dendrites of the first-order interneurons are presynaptic to receptor-cell axons. (iii) The subunits of a dendrite of first-order interneurons form synapses with each other." .

To determine if drusen are associated with changes in central visual field sensitivity, one eye of each of 35 subjects (mean age 64.9 years) with bilateral drusen and visual acuity of 1.0 (20/20) underwent automated static threshold perimetry of the central 10°. 16 normal subjects (mean age 65.8 years) were used as controls. 30° fundus photographs were graded in a masked fashion for the clinical characteristics of drusen: type, size and number. The mean sensitivity (MS) of the central 10° was significantly lower in eyes with drusen compared to normal eyes (p=.0001). After grading drusen eyes for size (≥ 63µ) and type (presence of soft drusen), MS significantly deteriorated when large and soft drusen were present. These results suggest that central visual field sensitivity is precociously affected in eyes with drusen and that testing central visual field sensitivity may be useful as functional parameter in long term studies on the evolution of age-related macular degeneration." .

The observations on the course of the optic tracts and on the optic terminals in the thalamus and optic tectum are to a great extent in agreement with those of other authors. The probability of a retino-preoptic pathway is supported by the detection of fibres running in dorsal direction in front of the place where the optic nerve penetrates the brain. In horizontal sections these fibres can be seen deviating from the optic tract, covering a short distance in frontal direction and then turning upward under an angle of about 90 degrees. They disappear between the ventral aldehyde-fuchsin positive cells of the preoptic nucleus. The ventral and median parts of the ipsilateral preoptic nucleus contain fragments of degenerated fibres. Autoradiographic data are also in favour of the presence of an ipsilateral retino-preoptic tract. After carefully counting the number of grains over left and right preoptic nucleus, it appeared that over the ventral and median parts of the left preoptic nucleus more grains occur than over the identical areas of the right one." .

Colour slides are projected onto a screen and features noted on an acetate sheet which provides a permanent record. Sector analysis showed microaneurysms and haemorrhages to occur most often at the temporal-to-macula area, exudates at the macula and cotton wool spots on the nasal side of the retina. Seventy percent of microaneurysms appeared in the previous year, irrespective of the severity of the retinopathy. In proportion to their usual relative prevalences, after normalisation of distribution, the various features can be combined to provide a single value, the Retinopathy Index. This provides an overall assessment of retinopathy which is suitable for comparing the progress of mild retinopathy in prospective studies." .

They can be divided into retinal vascular diseases, in which there is leakage and/or neovascularization (NV) from retinal vessels, and subretinal NV, in which new vessels grow into the normally avascular outer retina and subretinal space. The first category of diseases includes diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, and retinopathy of prematurity, and the second category includes neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), ocular histoplasmosis, pathologic myopia, and other related diseases. Retinal hypoxia is a key feature of the first category of diseases resulting in elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which stimulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), placental growth factor, stromal-derived growth factor-1 and their receptors, as well as other hypoxia-regulated gene products such as angiopoietin-2. Although hypoxia has not been demonstrated as part of the second category of diseases, HIF-1 is elevated and thus the same group of hypoxia-regulated gene products plays a role. Clinical trials have shown that VEGF antagonists provide major benefits for patients with subretinal NV due to AMD and even greater benefits are seen by combining antagonists of VEGF and PDGF-B. It is likely that addition of antagonists of other agents listed above will be tested in the future. Other appealing strategies are to directly target HIF-1 or to use gene transfer to express endogenous or engineered anti-angiogenic proteins. While substantial progress has been made, the future looks even brighter for patients with retinal and choroidal vascular diseases." .

Intense staining was found in the amorphous part of mature elastic fibers in different regions of the organ. In elaunin fibers, both the amorphous core and the surrounding microfibrils were clearly labeled. In addition, reactive sites were detected in the oxitalan fibers of the stroma of the cornea and in Descemet's membrane, which showed a gradient of reactive sites increasing from the center toward the periphery. Oxitalan fibers of the stroma often fused with Descemet's membrane; the pattern of immunological staining suggested a continuity between the two structures. In the ciliary zonule, labeling for tropoelastin was observed in discrete areas on the bundles of microfibrils. The results show a complex structural organization of elastic tissue; this may be important in endowing the various parts of the eye with different mechanical properties." .

Additionally, to report intravitreal anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injection treatment results. MethodsA case series of patients diagnosed with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy. Fluorescein angiography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and SS-OCTA were performed. Analysis of retina and choroidal vasculature was performed. All patients received anti-VEGF therapy. ResultsThe study demonstrated pathological vessels in the retina avascular zone and at the level of choriocapillaris during the course of choroidal neovascularization in central serous chorioretinopathy. These vessels are invisible in fluorescein angiography, as they are hidden by pooling of the dye. These vessels correspond to a slightly hyper-reflective elevation of retinal pigment epithelium visible in optical coherence tomography. Visual acuity and central retinal thickness decreased after anti-VEGF treatment. The vessels did not completely disappear despite anti-VEGF treatment. ConclusionThis study shows that SS-OCTA enables us to identify neovessels during the course of CSC. In diagnosing this entity, SS-OCTA appears superior to fluorescein angiography and might also enable us to decide on the best timing for anti-VEGF injections." .

The aim of the study was to evaluate retinal parameters by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in WFS patients after 2 years of follow-up and analysis of the parameters in relation to visual acuity. MethodsOCT parameters and visual acuity were measured in 12 WFS patients and 31 individuals with type 1 diabetes. ResultsTotal thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), average retinal thickness and total retinal volume decreased in comparison with previous OCT examination. Significant decreases were noted for RNFL (average difference −17.92 µm 95% CI −30.74 to −0.10; p = 0.0157), macular average thickness (average difference −5.38 µm 95% CI −10.63 to −2.36; p = 0.0067) and total retinal volume (average difference −0.15 mm3 95% CI −0.30 to −0.07; p = 0.0070). Central thickness remained unchanged (average difference 1.5 µm 95% CI −7.61 to 10.61; p = 0.71). Visual acuity of WFS patients showed a strong negative correlation with diabetes duration (R = −0.82; p = 0.0010). After division of WFS patients into two groups (with low-vision and blind patients), all OCT parameters except for the RNFL value were lower in blind WFS patients. ConclusionsOCT measures structural parameters and can precede visual acuity loss. The OCT study in WFS patients should be performed longitudinally, and serial retinal examinations may be helpful as a potential end point for future clinical trials." .

Pigmented rabbit eyes were irradiated with radiant exposures from 140 Jm−2 to 10,000 Jm−2 and evaluated by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, light and electron microscopy. Corneal threshold (Hc) was 200 Jm−2 and lens threshold (HL) was 7,500 Jm−2. The most repeatable and reliable corneal response to these levels of UV was the development of corneal epithelial granules. Histological changes included a loss of superficial epithelial cells and selective UV induced autolysis of the wing cells. It is suggested that the biomicroscopically observed granules are the clinical manifestation of the secondary lysosomes revealed by light and electron microscopy. It is proposed that UV breaks down the primary lysosome membranes to release hydrolytic enzymes which in turn form the secondary lysosomes during autolysis. Extreme levels of radiant exposure at 295 nm result in indiscriminate destruction of all layers of the corneal epithelium, but the posterior cornea was spared." .

Yet it has not been clearly demonstrated that IOP-lowering treatment can reduce the incidence of glaucoma damage in patients with ocular hypertension. The aim of the current paper was to report the results of a long-term study addressing this very problem. Methods: We conducted a randomised, double-masked study comparing timolol and placebo treatment in 90 patients with ocular hypertension plus some additional risk factor. Patients were followed at 3-month intervals prospectively for 10 years or until glaucomatous field loss could be demonstrated with computerised perimetry. A post-study analysis was performed including all available data, thus extending maximum follow-up to 17 years. Results: After 5 years of follow-up eight patients in the placebo group and five patients in the timolol group had developed glaucomatous field loss (NS); the corresponding figures after 10 years were 15 patients in the placebo group and seven patients in the timolol group. Survival analysis showed a tendency but no statistically significant difference between treatment groups (P=0.07). Study attrition was large. Eighteen patients in each group had developed glaucomatous field loss when also post-study data were included. IOP reduction was greater in eyes passing the 10-year visit without field loss (5.7 mmHg), than in those that reached an endpoint (2.3 mmHg; P=0.0002). Conclusion: In this long-term study we found a tendency but failed to prove a beneficial effect of topical timolol treatment in patients with elevated IOP, normal visual fields and some additional risk factor. The intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference between treatment groups. The high attrition shows the difficulties associated with very long follow-up." .

We have compared Pax6 expression during embryonic development in the eyed surface form (surface fish) and several different eyeless cave forms (cavefish) of the teleost Astyanax mexicanus. Despite lacking functional eyes as adults, cavefish embryos form small optic primordia, which later arrest in development and show various degrees of eye degeneration. The pattern of Pax6 mRNA expression was modified early and late during cavefish development. In early surface fish embryos, two bilateral Pax6 expression domains are present in the anterior neural plate, which extend across the midline and fuse to form the forebrain and optic primordia. In cavefish embryos, these Pax6 domains are diminished in size and remain separated, resulting in an anterior gap in Pax6 expression and presumably the formation of smaller optic primordia. The anterior gap in Pax6 expression was confirmed by double staining for Pax6 and distalless-3 mRNA, which marks the anterior margin of the neural plate and is unaltered in cavefish. Similar anterior gaps in Pax6 expression occurred in independently derived cavefish populations, suggesting that they are important in eye degeneration. Later during surface fish development, Pax6 protein is expressed in the cornea, lens, and ganglion and amacrine cells of the neural retina. Pax6 expression was gradually reduced during cavefish lens development, concomitant with lens arrest and degeneration, and was absent in the corneal epithelium, which does not differentiate in cavefish. In contrast, Pax6 expression in the retinal ganglion and amarcine cells is unmodified in cavefish, despite retarded retinal development. The results suggest that changes in Pax6 expression are involved in the evolution of cavefish eye degeneration." .

We conducted a multicenter observational study in 1999 in seven hospital ophthalmology departments in northern and central Italy. A total of 476 patients aged over 50 years with the diagnoses were classified into three prognostic groups: (a) drusen (23.7%), (b) geographic atrophy (16.4%), and (c) retinal changes associated with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (59.9%). In addition to the costs reimbursed by the Italian National Health Service, we estimated also patients' out of pocket expenses. The mean cost per patient per year was €383.2; patients with CNV were by far the most costly (€540.1, vs. €158.1 for drusen and €147.9 for geographic atrophy). Hospital costs and diagnostics were the main cost determinants. Services directly paid for by patients (private consultations and OTCs) amounted to €46.5 for patients with CNV, €50.3 for drusen, and €68.8 for geographic atrophy. The major finding of the study was that the presence of CNV involved higher expenditure than drusen or geographic atrophy. This suggests that the costs of AMD rise significantly with the severity of the illness." .

MethodsRetrospective review of 32 eyes from 30 consecutive patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) who showed no response to treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab and were switched to aflibercept. Visual acuity, central macular thickness (CMT) and presence or absence of intraretinal or subretinal fluid were analyzed before switching to aflibercept, after each of three uploading dose injections of aflibercept and 6, 8 and 10 weeks after the third aflibercept injection.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study. Data of 2,533 patients with type 2 diabetes were studied from the Shanghai Diabetes Registry Database. DR was assessed using non-mydriatic fundus photography and graded as non-DR, mild–moderate (DR I–II), and sight-threatening (DR III–IV). BMI (kg/m2) was classified as normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30), and obese (BMI ≥ 30). β cell function was evaluated by fasting C-peptide (FCP). ResultsDR was present in 701 (27.7 %) patients. Patients with DR had lower BMI (24.3 vs. 24.9 kg/m2, P = 0.001) and fasting C-peptide (1.46 vs. 1.86 ng/ml, P < 0.001) than those without DR. The association between BMI (2 kg/m2 interval) and DR was U-shaped; patients with BMI 28–29.9 kg/m2 had the lowest DR rate. Compared with normal weight, overweight was associated with reduced risk of any DR [odds ratio (OR) 0.73], DR I–II (OR 0.76), and DR III–IV (OR 0.64) after adjustment for sex, age at diabetes diagnosis, and duration of diabetes. This negative association attenuated after adjustment for other confounders and became nonsignificant after further adjustment for FCP. Patients with different BMI categories had similar DR risk when stratified by FCP tertiles. ConclusionOverweight patients have lower DR prevalence than normal weight individuals, which may be attributable to better β cell function in overweight patients." .

Injury of the optic nerve causes various metabolic and morphological changes in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) perikarya and in the dendrites. The present work examined the dendritic trees of those ganglion cells surviving axotomy and of those whose severed axons re-elongated in PN grafts to reach either the superior colliculus (SC), transplanted SC, or transplanted autologous thigh muscle. The elaboration of the dendritic trees was visualized by means of the strongly fluorescent carbocyanine dye DiI, which is taken up by axons and transported to the cell bodies and from there to the dendritic branches. Alternatively, retinofugal axons regrowing through PN grafts were anterogradely filled from the eye cup with rhodamine B-isothiocyanate. The transection of the optic nerve resulted in characteristic changes in the ganglion cell dendrites, particularly in the degeneration of most of the terminal and preterminal dendritic branches. This occurred within the first 1 to 2 weeks following axotomy. The different types of ganglion cells appear to vary in their sensitivity to axotomy, as reflected by a rapid degeneration of certain cell dendrites after severance of the optic nerve. The most vulnerable cells were those with small perikarya and small dendritic fields (type II), whereas larger cells with larger dendritic fields (type I and III) were slower to respond and less dramatically affected. Regrowth of the lesioned axons in peripheral nerve grafts and reconnection of the retina with various tissues did not result in a significant immediate recovery of ganglion cell dendrites, although it did prevent some axotomized cells from further progression toward posttraumatic cell death." .

Further, we identify two transcripts of the GAD67 gene, full-length GAD67 and the truncated 25 kDa alternative splice variant (ES), as the major GAD isoforms in this tissue. GAD-positive neurons were identified immunocytochemically by probing retinal sections with K2, an antibody to the GAD67 isoform, and with an antibody specific for the 25 kDa splice variant. For both antibodies, GAD-immunoreactivity was observed in horizontal cells in the distal retina and amacrine cells in the proximal retina, with both cell bodies and processes labeled. No apparent difference in K2 labeling pattern was observed in tissue harvested 8 hrs after light offset or onset, whereas ES label was identified in more structures in dark tissue. Quantification of GAD levels was determined by densitometry of Western Blots. The protein content of GAD67 and ES varied between tissue harvested during the light and the dark. ES expression was up-regulated in dark tissue; whereas, full-length GAD67 expression increased in light tissue. In vivo GABA content, measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), was found to increase in light tissue, paralleling the expression of full-length GAD67 transcripts. Expression of ES did not correlate with measured GABA levels, suggesting this isoform, which lacks the catalytic domain necessary for enzymatic activity, may have a different physiological role in retinal tissue. The inverse expression patterns of full-length GAD67 and ES suggest that alternative splicing of GAD67 may be triggered by the light and/or dark cycle, resulting in a change in inhibitory neurotransmitter content in retinal tissue." .

If the disease is detected early then proper treatment can be provided to prevent loss of vision. Regular screening can reduce the incidence and prevalence of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. Health personnel, optometrists and primary care providers can perform the screening using digital nonmydriatic fundus cameras. Digital data can be archived, stored, manipulated and sent via telecommunication networks, e.g. the Internet, to ophthalmologists for diagnosis and second opinions. Easy-to-operate, low cost and portable digital fundus cameras and intuitive software are necessary to perform cost-effective screening of rural, remote and underserved communities using trained lay personnel. Several feasibility studies of telemedicine screening for diabetic retinopathy have been reported. These studies demonstrate the enormous usefulness of this technology for communities living in rural and remote areas. Further studies are needed to prove the cost benefit of telemedicine technology for diabetic retinopathy screening." .

The detailed ocular and radiographic status of 33 unoperated craniosynostosis (CS) was documented prospectively; the ON was also assessed by flash VER and A-scan echography for ON thickness. Fluorescein angiography (FA) was done for all suspected and early papilloedemas. ON involvement diagnosed in 10/33 showed highly significant correlations with multiple suture synostoses (p = 0.004) and exorbitism (p < 0.001). VER latency was increased in all 5 ON atrophies; and also in 1/5 papilloedemas without atrophic changes, urgent surgery in which reversed VER changes, and vision later improved from 6/60 to 6/9. FA was valuable for confirming the clinical diagnosis of the earliest papilloedemas; the FA also returned to normal with immediate therapy along with reversal of the clinical picture. ON echography especially helped in monitoring regression of disc oedema. Ours seems the first report especially in CS where a critical follow-up of all above parameters in 21 operated / 33 could objectively establish the role of each investigation in conjunction with careful clinical monitoring especially of the ON head. Such comprehensive evaluation should help reduce the blindness often seen in such children." .

Results: As compared to the control group, there was no significant change of VOL, FLOW, and VEL in patients with early ARM. In patients with late ARM (exudative), there was a significant higher FLOW in sectors I, II, and IV and a higher VOL and VEL in sectors III and IV. The group with late ARM (fibrotic) showed a reduction of VOL and FLOW in sectors I–IV and of VEL in sectors II and IV. In children of ARM patients, VOL, FLOW, and VEL of sectors I–VI did not differ from the control group. Conclusion: HRF measurements in patients with ARM indicate an increased macular retinal capillary blood flow in patients with the exudative form of late ARM and a decreased macular perfusion in those with the fibrotic form." .

However, when pigmented cells from the eye margin (peripheral retinal pigment epithelium) are added to the system, the sequence of layers is identical with that of an in-situ retina (laminar vitroretinae). In order to elucidate further the lamina-stabilizing effect exerted by the retinal pigment epithelium, we have compared both systems, laying particular emphasis on the ultrastructure of the basal lamina and of Müller glia processes. Ultrastructurally, in both systems, an outer limiting membrane, inner segments of photoreceptors and the segregation of cell bodies into three cell layers develop properly. Synapses are detectable in a premature state, although only in the inner plexiform layer of laminar vitroretinae. Although present in both systems, radial processes of juvenile Müller glia cells are properly fixed at their endfeet only in laminar vitroretinae, since a basal lamina is only expressed here. Large amounts of laminin are detected immunohistochemically within the retinal pigment epithelium and along a basal stalk that reaches inside the laminar vitroretinae. We conclude that the peripheral retinal pigment epithelium is essential for the expression of a basal lamina in vitro. Moreover, the basal lamina may be responsible both for stabilizing the correct polarity of retinal layers and for the final differentiation of the Müller cells." .

In this study, two Teflon rings were made for culturing the cells on the LAM and CAM, and were then used to support the AM, which is referred to in this paper as an Ahn’s AM supporter. The primary corneal epithelial cells were obtained from the limbus, using an explantation method. The corneal epithelium could be reconstructed by culturing the third-passage corneal epithelial cells on the AM. A lyophilized amniotic membrane (LAM) has a higher rate of graft take, a longer shelf life, is easier to store, and safer, due to gamma irradiation, than a CAM. The corneal epithelium reconstructed on the LAM and CAM, supported by the two-Teflon rings, was similar to normal corneal epithelium. However, the advantages of the LAM over that of the CAM make the former more useful. The reconstruction model of the corneal epithelium, using AM, is considered as a goodin vitro model for transplantation of cornel epithelium into patients with a severely damaged cornea." .

Significant amounts of soluble blood protein and prostaglandin-like (PG) material are found in the aqueous and vitreous humours withdrawn at 24 h. Endotoxin injected into the sensory denervated eye elicits similar vascular changes which appear to occur less rapidly than in normal eyes. Conversely, the levels of aqueous and vitreal PG-like material, as well as the capacity of excised irides to form PG from exogenous precursors, seems greater in the denervated eyes. If PG is an important mediator of ocular changes in the early phases, the results suggest that the action of this inflammatory autacoid in facilitating the ocular changes is less effective in eyes deprived of functional sensory nerves." .

We investigated the association of disruptions of COL1A1 gene with high myopia by analyzing the frequency of ten SNPs in a Japanese population of 330 subjects with high myopia of −9.25 D or less and 330 randomized controls without high myopia. Two SNPs (rs2075555 and rs2269336) were significantly associated with high myopia (P < 0.05, Pc < 0.1).

CCT has a high heritability, and thin CCT is an independent risk factor for the diagnosis and progression of open-angle glaucoma. Genome-wide association studies thus provide genetic loci associated with CCT and potentially related to open-angle glaucoma. The distribution of CCT and prevalence of glaucoma in population-based studies have demonstrated ethnic differences suggesting ethnic-dependent variations in the genetic determinants of CCT. We conducted a genome-wide association study in Caucasians (n = 3,931) from the Gutenberg Health Study (Germany) followed by replication of 30 genome-wide significant SNPs or SNPs of interest (P < 10−5) in the Rotterdam Study (The Netherlands, n = 1,418). In a combined analysis, we confirmed quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 9q34 and 16q24 for association with CCT. On chromosome 16q24, the locus is located in an intergenic region near the ZNF469 gene (top SNP: rs9938149, P = 1.45 × 10−12). ZNF469 missense mutation is involved in a syndrome with very thin cornea (brittle cornea syndrome). The second locus on chromosome 9q34 represents the intergenic region between the RXRA and COL5A1 gene (top SNP: rs3132306, P = 2.71 × 10−10). Collagen type 5 determines the diameter of the corneal collagen fibrils.

In this paper, an algorithm for vessel detection in fundus images is employed. First, a denoising process using the noise-estimation-based anisotropic diffusion technique is applied to restore connected vessel lines in a retinal image and eliminate noisy lines. Next, a multi-scale line-tracking algorithm is implemented to detect all the blood vessels having similar dimensions at a selected scale. An openly available dataset, called “the STARE Project’s dataset,” has been firstly utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method. Accordingly, our experimental results, performed on the STARE dataset, depict a maximum average accuracy of around 93.88%. Then, an experimental evaluation on another dataset, named DRIVE database, demonstrates a satisfactory performance of the proposed technique, where the maximum average accuracy rate of 93.89% is achieved." .

In addition, laminin localization was also performed with the Protein A-horseradish peroxidase (PA-HRP) method. NBD-Ph staining gave strong fluorescence in both retinal capillaries and larger vessels. Anti-myosin fluorescence could also be observed in trypsin digests of the retinal vasculature. Strong fluorescence of PA-HRP reaction product could be detected in the walls of vessels exposed to antilaminin antibody. Actin distribution in vessels of the RCS rat with inherited retinal degeneration (retinal dystrophic RCS rat) was also studied. After exposure to NBD-Ph, all capillaries showed fluorescence. However, it was more intense in many of the capillaries in the outer retina, which also appeared morphologically abnormal. Electron microscopy of retinal capillaries fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing 8% tannic acid revealed numerous micro filaments in the pericyte cytoplasm amd some in the basal portion of endothelial cells. In pericytes, these microfilaments are in close association with the endothelial side of the cell.

The stroma layer comprises nearly 90 % of the thickness of the cornea and thus plays a pivotal role in normal visual function. The bulk of this layer is constituted by proteins in the extracellular martrix secreted by the corneal epithelial, stroma, and endothelial cells. Clinical research has shown that corneal stroma diseases are common and involve conditions such as infections, injuries, and genetic defects, which cause severe visual disturbances or even blindness. To improve our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms involved in the physiological and pathological activities of the corneal stroma, its proteins have been brought into the limelight to determine their crucial and irreplaceable roles. The data presented in a previous study have demonstrated the presence of 1679 proteins in the stroma, and this data set has subsequently been perfected by utilizing a highly sensitive isobaric peptide-labeling approach. According to their manifestations, these proteins can be classified as a gel-like organic material composed of proteoglycans, enzymes, and hemocyanin-binding proteins and a network of filaments composed of collagen, elastin, keratin, vimentin, and interconnected filaments comprising fibronectin and laminin. The aim of this review is to describe some corneal stroma proteins by highlighting their major functions and valuable applications in ophthalmologic research toward the better characterization and treatment of eye diseases." .

Male Wistar rats, aged 4, 12, and 24 mo, were used. From the results obtained the following conclusions may be drawn:1.In assaying the lipid biosynthesis during aging, a striking difference between the retina and optic nerve clearly emerged;2.In isolated retina, [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA was relatively constant at the three ages, whereas both [14C]palmitate and [3H]choline incorporation into lipids showed a substantial increase in rats at 24 mo of age compared with those at 4 mo;3.In contrast, in the optic nerve of the oldest rats, compared with the youngest, a significant decrease of [14C]acetate and [14C]palmitate incorporation into acylglycerols, cerebrosides, and phospholipids was found. Each fatty acid precursor label was incorporated to a proportion that reflected the typical acyl group composition of individual lipids;4.Following labeling of the optic nerve with [3H]choline, the specific radioactivity of choline-containing phospholipids was drastically decreased with increasing rat age; and5.The incorporation of [2-3H]glycerol into optic nerve diacylglycerols, PtdEtn, and PtdIns declined with age, whereas no significant change took place in the incorporation into PtdCho. The results strongly support the concept that RNA metabolism of rat retina (most likely photoreceptor cell layer) is not altered during aging; on the contrary, phospholipid synthesis is stimulated in comparison with that of the optic nerve, for which a serious impairment was concomitantly observed. The physiological significance of these responses, and the mechanism by which retinal tissue is spared from the general age derangement of the nervous system, remain to be defined." .

In addition, the period necessary for metaplasia of limbus epithelial cells into typical corneal epithelia was studied in light of these two criteria. It was proven that, on completion of the morphological transformation, after 7 days the positive carbonic anhydrase reaction was identifiable only in the basal cells of the limbus area, as in those of the control animals. It is concluded that in the early phase of reepithelialization, the forward-proliferating epithelial cells can be directly traced to the basal limbus epithelial cells." .

In recent years impressive progress has been made in the molecular genetic studies of POAG and PCG. These include the discovery of three genes – Myocilin, Optineurin and CYP1B1 – defects in which results in Mendelian transmission of glaucoma.

A pigmented ocellar field with four eyes arranged in a rhomboid configuration is present frontolaterally on both sides of the head. Each lateral ocellus is cup-shaped and consists of a deeply set biconvex corneal lens, which is formed by 230–2,240 cornea-secreting epithelial cells. A crystalline cone is not developed. Two kinds of photoreceptive cells are present in the retinula. 561–1,026 cylindrical retinula cells with circumapically developed microvilli form a large distal rhabdom. Arranged in 13–18 horizontal rings, the distal retinula cells display a multilayered appearance. Each cell layer forms an axial ring of maximally 75 rhabdomeres. In addition, 71–127 club-shaped proximal retinula cells make up uni- or bidirectional rhabdomeres, whose microvilli interdigitate. 150–250 sheath cells are located at the periphery of the eye. Radial sheath cell processes encompass the soma of all retinula cells. Outside the eye cup there are several thin layers of external pigment cells, which not only ensheath the ocelli but also underlie the entire ocellar field, causing its darkly pigmented. The cornea-secreting epithelial cells, sheath cells and external pigment cells form a part of the basal matrix extending around the entire eye cup. Scolopendromorph lateral ocelli differ remarkably with respect to the eyes of other chilopods. The dual type retinula in scolopendromorph eyes supports the hypothesis of its homology with scutigeromorph ommatidia. Other features (e.g. cup-shaped profile of the eye, horizontally multilayered distal retinula cells, interdigitating proximal rhabdomeres, lack of a crystalline cone, presence of external pigment and sheath cells enveloping the entire retinula) do not have any equivalents in scutigeromorph ommatidia and would, therefore, not directly support homology. In fact, most of them (except the external pigment cells) might be interpreted as autapomorphies defining the Pleurostigmophora. Certain structures (e.g. sheath cells, interdigitating proximal rhabdomeres, discontinuous layer of cornea-secreting epithelial cells) are similar to those found in some lithobiid ocelli (e.g. Lithobius). The external pigment cells in Scolopendra species, however, must presently be regarded as an autapomorphy of the Scolopendromorpha." .

Recently, we found that taurine deficiency contributes to the retinal toxicity of vigabatrin, an antiepileptic drug. However, in this toxicity, retinal ganglion cells were degenerating in parallel to cone photoreceptors. The aim of this study was to re-assess a classic mouse model of taurine deficiency following a treatment with guanidoethane sulfonate (GES), a taurine transporter inhibitor to determine whether retinal ganglion cells are also affected. GES treatment induced a significant reduction in the taurine plasma levels and a lower weight increase. At the functional level, photopic electroretinograms were reduced indicating a dysfunction in the cone pathway. A change in the autofluorescence appearance of the eye fundus was explained on histological sections by an increased autofluorescence of the retinal pigment epithelium. Although the general morphology of the retina was not affected, cell damages were indicated by the general increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. When cell quantification was achieved on retinal sections, the number of outer/inner segments of cone photoreceptors was reduced (20 %) as the number of retinal ganglion cells (19 %). An abnormal synaptic plasticity of rod bipolar cell dendrites was also observed in GES-treated mice. These results indicate that taurine deficiency can not only lead to photoreceptor degeneration but also to retinal ganglion cell loss. Cone photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells appear as the most sensitive cells to taurine deficiency. These results may explain the recent therapeutic interest of taurine in retinal degenerative pathologies." .

ProceduresThe γ-eye is based on two position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes, coupled to a CsI(Na) pixelated scintillator and a low-energy lead collimator with parallel hexagonal holes. ResultsThe spatial resolution of the system is 2 mm at 0 mm. The energy resolution is 26 % at 140 keV and the maximum recorded sensitivity 210 cps/MBq. The system was evaluated in a proof-of-concept animal study, using three different clinical Tc-99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals.

Designing an effective therapy for ocular diseases, especially for the posterior segment, has been considered as a formidable task. Limitations of topical and intravitreal route of administration have challenged scientists to find alternative mode of administration like periocular routes. Transporter targeted drug delivery has generated a great deal of interest in the field because of its potential to overcome many barriers associated with current therapy. Application of nanotechnology has been very promising in the treatment of a gamut of diseases. In this review, we have briefly discussed several ocular drug delivery systems such as microemulsions, nanosuspensions, nanoparticles, liposomes, niosomes, dendrimers, implants, and hydrogels. Potential for ocular gene therapy has also been described in this article. In near future, a great deal of attention will be paid to develop non-invasive sustained drug release for both anterior and posterior segment eye disorders. A better understanding of nature of ocular diseases, barriers and factors affecting in vivo performance, would greatly drive the development of new delivery systems. Current momentum in the invention of new drug delivery systems hold a promise towards much improved therapies for the treatment of vision threatening disorders." .

Meningiomas of the supra- and parasellar region can cause insidious visual loss by optic nerve compression. 62 cases with such tumours affecting the anterior optic pathways were analysed to assess the surgical results and prognostic factors with particular attention to visual outcome.  Method. In all patients, visual deterioration was the first clinical manifestation. Eleven lesions had their origin at the anterior clinoid process, 24 at the tuberculum sellae, 10 at the planum sphenoidale, two in the optic canal, 10 in the medial sphenoidal wing, and five in the olfactory groove. All patients underwent microsurgical tumour resection. Median age at the time of operation was 54 years, median duration of symptoms seven months. The mean follow-up time was 5.2 years (range 2 to 8 years). Statistical analysis of prognostic factors (gender, age, tumour location, tumour size, duration of symptoms, brain tumour interface, resection grade, preoperative visual loss, Glascow Outcome Score) was performed using univariate and multivariate analysis.  Findings. The severe morbidity rate was 6,4%. Two patients died within the first 30 postoperative days. Overall, vision improved in 39 (65%) patients, in 11 (18%) it was unchanged, and worse in 10 (17%). Visual prognosis was favourably affected by age under 54 years (p<0,025), duration of symptoms of less than seven months (p<0,037), and the presence of an intact arachnoid membrane around the lesion (p<0,001). Severe preoperative loss of visual acuity (<0,02) appeared to be an unfavourable prognostic factor (p<0,047).  Interpretation. Possible difficulties and surgical outcome in such patients can be predicted successfully. These facts in connection with new therapeutic modalities (radiosurgery, adjuvant therapies) will demand a careful risk assessment and should influence the treatment strategies and the degree of operative aggressiveness in the future." .

In a first series of experiments eye imaginal discs of increasing age were implanted into larvae ready to pupate, thus losing variable amounts of the normal time for development. A sequence of differentiative abilities was found in the metamorphosed test pieces. As far as the photoreceptor cells are concerned, the most prominent steps of this sequence are: ability to form groups with other similar elements, anatomical polarization of microvilli, establishment of the rhabdomeric pattern and formation of an equator line. The stability of determination of the equator line was tested in a second experimental series. Fragment of different topographical origin within the mature eye anlage were brought to metamorphosis by implantation into larvae ready to pupate. It was found that an equator line differentiates only in those pieces which according to the published anlage maps contain the prospective equator region prior to metamorphosis. The mitotic abilities of implanted eye imaginal discs were investigated by means of “in vitro”3H-thymidine pulse-labelling and light microscope autoradiography of the differentiated test pieces. During the third larval stage the eye anlage is traversed by two consecutive mitotic waves, each one of them producing different categories of receptor cells. The first, anterior wave predominantly produces cells oriented toward the poles of the eye within the ommatidia, while the second, posterior wave gives rise to elements exclusively in an equatorial position. The dynamics of this proliferation are discussed in relation to the findings in the implantation experiments. Silver-grain counts support the possibility that at least two successive cell divisions occur in the eye anlage between labeling with tritiated thymidine and beginning of morphological differentiation. The relevance of this finding for the understanding of the concept of acquisition of competence is discussed." .

Visual observation and photography show that when a magnification of 15 × is used, as in our case, venous pulse is seen only at the emerging part of the big veins and in their immediate neighborhood, whereas veins of 100 μm diameter or less show no pulsation. Over relatively short time intervals (some minutes) the temporal course of venous pulse in terms of vessel width is a more or less periodic phenomenon; for longer periods (months) a study is underway. In the majority of cases the filling state of pulsating veins seems to reach a minimum shortly after the R peak of the ECG. An investigation as to whether the interference of venous pulse can be reduced by coupling the camera flash to the R peak has been begun. However, for the time being, it appears that the best method is to pass over the pulsating vessel parts, and to observe Sc effects only in the small vessels, when Sc evaluation is applied. Statistics show that venous pulse is significantly more frequent in suspected and early glaucoma subjects (T>21 mm appl.) than in healthy subjects. We feel that with the methods proposed all conditions pertaining to an extensive follow-up of ocular hypertension and early glaucoma cases are now established." .

Currently available therapies for this disease only attempt to reduce intraocular pressure, the major risk factor, without addressing the associated optic neuropathy and retinopathy. Development of glaucoma neuroprotective treatment is therefore a pressing unmet medical need. Unfortunately, many challenges hinder this effort, including an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis, leading to uncertain therapeutic targets and confounded by not yet validated preclinical models. Most importantly, with slow disease progression and a less than ideal endpoint measurement method, clinical trials are necessarily large, lengthy, expensive and, to many, prohibitive. No easy solution is available to overcome these challenges. Increased commitment to basic mechanistic research is an essential foundation for dealing with this problem. Innovations in clinical trials with novel surrogate endpoints, nontraditional study designs and the use of surrogate diseases might shorten the study time, reduce the patient sample size and consequently lower the budgetary hurdle for the development of new therapies." .

The retina ofS. lepidus contains two spatially separate classes of visual cells, viz. cones, mostly twin cones, in the temporal (caudal) region subserving binocular vision in the rostral direction, and rods grouped in bundles in the rest of the retina. A deep convexiclivate pure-cone fovea is located in the temporal part of the retina. The outer segments of each pair of twin cones and of the rod bundles are located in reflecting pits formed by the processes of the retinal pigment epithelium which contains reflecting crystals believed to be of guanine. Each pit contains concentric layers of radially orientated elongated crystals in the wall surrounding the photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, in the temporal pure-cone region the pigment cells possess discrete cylindrical piles of tangentially orientated crystals, so-called reflectors, apposed to the tips of each pair of twin cone outer segments. Comparisons are made with the retinae of other deep-sea teleosts. The centre of the pure-cone fovea ofS. lepidus is thought to have a fairly high resolving power and a correspondingly low threshold for minimal angular displacement which will increase the possibility of maintaining foveal fixation of the relatively small prey animals during approach." .

A cross-sectional study was carried out in 90 subjects divided in three groups of 30 each (FD subjects, asymptomatic carriers and controls). The study was developed at the Dysautonomia Center, New York University Medical Center. All subjects underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and full neuro-ophthalmic examinations. In a subset of affected subjects, visual evoked potentials and microperimetry were also obtained. We compared the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness from OCT between the three groups. OCT showed loss of the RNFL in all FD subjects predominantly in the maculopapillary region (63 % temporally, p < 0.0001; and 21 % nasally, p < 0.005). RNFL loss was greatest in older FD subjects and was associated with decreased visual acuity and color vision, central visual field defects, temporal optic nerve pallor, and delayed visual evoked potentials. Asymptomatic carriers of the FD gene mutation all had thinner RNFL (12 % globally, p < 0.005). OCT and clinical neuro-ophthalmological findings suggest that maculopapillary ganglion cells are primarily affected in FD subjects, leading to a specific optic nerve damage that closely resembles mitochondrial optic neuropathies. This raises the possibility that reduced IKAP levels may affect mitochondrial proteins and their function in the nervous system, particularly in the retina." .

The presumed close inverse correlation between the axial length of the eye and ocular coat dimensions was confirmed by statistical analysis. These values were used to calculate the approximative volume of the posterior half of the ocular coats. There was evidence for a constant tissue volume regardless of the difference in surface and axial length parameters between hyperopic and myopic eyes. Results are discussed and compared with theories of axial growth under physiological and pathological conditions." .

Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) comprise a recently characterized family of antioxidant enzymes. To date, little information exists regarding the distribution of Prdxs in the eye. Herein, we employed a combination of qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to determine the level of expression and distribution of the six Prdx isoforms in the retina and optic nerve of the rat. In addition, we performed some parallel analyses on the common marmoset (Callithrix Jacchus). In the rat, all of the Prdx transcripts were expressed in relatively high amounts in both retina and optic nerve, with abundances ranging from approximately 3–50 % of the level of the housekeeping gene cyclophilin. With regard to protein expression, each isoform was detected in the retina and optic nerve by either Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry. Excepting Prdx4, there was a good correspondence between the rodent and primate results. In the retina, Prdx1 and Prdx2 were principally localized to neurons in the inner nuclear layer and cone photoreceptors, Prdx3 and Prdx5 displayed characteristic mitochondrial immunolabeling, while Prdx6 was associated with astrocytes and Müller cells. In the optic nerve, Prdx1 was robustly expressed by oligodendrocytes, Prdx3 and Prdx5 were observed in axons, and Prdx6 was restricted to astrocytes. The present findings augment our understanding of the distribution and expression of the Prdxs in the retina and optic nerve of rodents and primates and lay the foundation for subsequent analysis of their involvement in relevant blinding diseases." .

In spite of its ophthalmic usage in degenerative retinal disease and glaucoma, buphenine's ocular effects and their mechanisms are not sufficiently established. Consquently, we studied the action of 4.5–120 μM buphenine in isolated, arterially perfused cat eyes, and then used light-evoked electrical signals, perfusion flow rates and the diameters of the retinal vessels as parameters for the drug's effect. Our findings showed that buphenine induced a marked, dose-related, reversible increase in the amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, a decrease in the c-wave, but no significant changes in the standing potential and light peak of the DC-ERG. The compound action potential of the optic nerve revealed dose-dependent and reversible changes in configuration. However, the flow of perfusate was not affected by the drug, and the diameter of retinal vessels did not change significantly. Our studies suggest that the interaction of buphenine with retinal adrenergic receptors is not related to the vasculature present but to elements involved in information processing. It is likely that these receptors are linked to neurons, since the β-agonist affected the ERG b-waves as well as the compound action potential of the optic nerve." .

This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that the subretinal fluid producing the macular detachment originates from leakage of vessels located in the floor of the pit. In addition a high incidence of anomalies was found to be associated with optic pits. Therefore the author suggests to call the association between optic pit and large optic disc, parapapillary chorioretinal changes, cilioretinal vessels, situs inversus and eventual other vessel abnormalities, the ‘optic pit syndrome’." .

The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-cataract effects and the underlying mechanisms of selenite and ebselen supplementation on galactose induced cataract in rats, a common animal model of sugar cataract. Transmission electron microscopy images of lens fiber cells (LFC) and lens epithelial cells (LEC) were observed in d-galactose-induced experimental cataractous rats treated with or without selenite and ebselen, also redox homeostasis and expression of proteins such as selenoprotein R (SELR), 15kD selenoprotein (SEP15), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT), β-crystallin protein, aldose reductase (AR) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were estimated in the lenses. The results showed that d-galactose injection injured rat lens and resulted in cataract formation; however, selenite and ebselen supplementation markedly alleviated ultrastructural injury of LFC and LEC. Moreover, selenite and ebselen supplementation could mitigate the oxidative damage in rat lens and increase the protein expressions of SELR, SEP15, SOD1, CAT and β-crystallin, as well as decrease the protein expressions of AR and GRP78. Taken together, these findings for the first time reveal the anti-cataract potential of selenite and ebselen in galactosemic cataract, and provide important new insights into the anti-cataract mechanisms of selenite and ebselen in sugar cataract." .

Comparison of the staining patterns of marginal and nonmarginal Rh3-lacZ-expressing photoreceptor cells in the same histological preparations suggests that the marginal cells possess morphologically specialized axons and synaptic terminals.

An amphipod type of compound eye can be characterized by the constellation and consistency of a number of morphological features, most of which are also found in other compound eyes. The amphipod eye falls into four sub-categories (types). The ampeliscid type has a tripartite aberrant lens eye; the lysianassid type has a reduced or no dioptric apparatus and a hypertrophied rhabdom; the hyperid type possesses a large number of ommatidial units with long crystalline cones and dark instead of reflecting accessory pigment; and finally, the gammarid type can be interpreted as a generalized amphipod type. The lysianassid type is adapted to low light intensities and demonstrates convergent development with the compound eyes of other deep-sea crustaceans. The ampeliscid type is more similar to the gammarid type. The type characterization of the amphipod compound eye might well serve as a basis and incentive for functional studies also revealing adaptational mechanisms." .

The effect of TPEN in vivo on taurine and zinc levels was determined. Isolated cells were incubated in Ringer with zinc (0.1–100 μM). Taurine transport was done with taurine (0.001–1 mM) and 50 nM [3H]taurine. Zinc (100 μM) noncompetitively inhibited taurine transport. TPEN was administered intraocularly and retinas extracted 3, 5 and 10 days later. Taurine was determined by HPLC (nmol/mg protein) and zinc by spectrophotometry ICP (mg/mg protein). Taurine and zinc levels decreased at 3 days and increased at 10 days after TPEN administration. At 10 days after intraocular TPEN, taurine transport affinity increased (K s = 0.018 ± 0.006 vs. 0.028 ± 0.008 mM).

It is estimated that the projected number of people with AMD will be 196 million worldwide by the year 2020, increasing to 288 million by 2040. Of these patients, 10–20% suffering from the fast progressing neovascular form of the disease (nAMD) account for 90% of all cases of severe vision loss. In fact, AMD is responsible for 8.7% of all cases of blindness worldwide. These numbers indicate the substantial burden of the disease. The WHO estimates that 246 million people worldwide currently have low vision and 39 million are blind. A literature (Medline) and Internet research was performed to better understand the prevalence of AMD and how health care could be prepared to cope with it in the future. In 2015, there were 90,010 intravitreal injections (IVI) in Austrian hospitals and primary care units. In 2016, this number rose to >100,000 IVI as the applications increase by approx. 15–20% every year. Since health insurances do not refund IVI in primary care, these services are channeled toward clinical wards, causing overcrowded waiting rooms and dissatisfied patients. Despite this high number of IVI in Austria, real-life data show that the number of IVI given today is not sufficient to keep visual acuity on a steady level. Therefore, new and long-acting treatment options are needed to end the burden for clinics and patients and to increase treatment efficiency by simplified protocols. Herein, a potential new gene-therapeutic approach using nonviral vectors and somatic pigment epithelial cells to overcome the imbalance of pigment epithelium-derived factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in nAMD is described." .

MethodsData sets of 9 mm × 9 mm with 512 × 512 A OCT-A scans were collected from patients with various diseases using a Topcon DRI OCT Triton® Swept Source OCT. The en face OCT data were inverted and 26 µm Bruch’s membrane fit slabs were created using Topcon IMAGEnet 6 1.21 viewer software. This slab was moved through the choroid at 2.6 µm intervals in order to create a fluid fly-through of the choroidal vasculature. The slab was moved to a depth of up to 450 µm beneath the Bruch’s membrane. Where available, the indocyanine green angiography (ICG) of the same patient was compared with the resulting visualization. ResultsA total of 20 data sets from 10 patients were collected for this initial evaluation. The pathologies included 5 central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) patients, 3 diabetic retinopathy (DRP) patients, one sub choroidal mass, and one normal patient. The inversion of the en face data made the vessels clearly visible in the visualization. The high density of the OCT-A scans made it possible to visualize even small vessels in Sattler’s and Haller’s layer. In the cases where a comparison with ICG was possible there was a high correlation between the imaging modalities. As with OCT-A, leakage was not visible. ConclusionsThis is an effective method of visualizing the choroidal vasculature. It is comparable to ICG in visualizing the choroidal vascular structure. It of course does not show leakage. As it does not show blood flow like OCT-A but shows vascular structures, we propose the term choroidal vasculography (CVG) to describe this method. The clinical relevance of this method needs to be studied further." .

Ultrasonography of the eyes, using Titan TM machine and 7 MHz linear array transducer, was performed transpalpebrally. Ocular ultrasonographic findings revealed two cases of increased corneal thickness, seven cases of change in the anterior chamber depth, one case of increased echogenicity in the anterior chamber, three cases of retinal detachment, one case of increased iris and ciliary body thickness and six cases of change in axial globe length. Increased echogenicity of the capsule, cortex and nucleus was found in two cases. Six cases showed change in lens diameter. Increased echogenicity and altered lens diameter are typical of cataract. Two cases of point-like lesions, mass and/or linear echodensities in mild extent were observed within the vitreous representing haemorrhage, vitreous degeneration or detachment. The B-mode ultrasonographic imaging technique has become an essential diagnostic tool in most ocular disease.

Recently, it has also been found to inhibit excessive scarring in wound healing processes. In this study, we examined the effects of tranilast on the treatment for experimental proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). · Methods: Cultured rabbit conjunctival fibroblasts were injected intravitreously (50 000 cells/eye) into the rabbit vitreous to induce experimental PVR. Immediately after that, tranilast (0.5–5 mg/ml, 0.1 ml/eye) was injected into the vitreous. Injection of vehicle solution was used as a negative control. PVR was clinically evaluated by masked observers using ophthalmoscopy and graded into six stages: 0 (no PVR) to 5 (severe PVR). The amount of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) in the vitreous was measured by ELISA method. Functional and morphological changes induced by 5 mg/ml tranilast were sought by electroretinography, light microscopy, and electron microscopy on day 28. · Results: The average stage of PVR in the eyes treated with tranilast (1 or 5 mg/ml) was significantly lower than that in the control group on days 14 and 28. There was no difference between the eyes treated with low-dose tranilast (0.5 mg/ml) and the control group. The amount of TGF-β1 in the vitreous of tranilast-treated eyes was significantly lower than in the control group. The morphological and functional studies did not show any deleterious effect of tranilast on the retinal function and morphology. · Conclusion: Tranilast effectively inhibits the progression of PVR without showing apparent toxicity of the eye.

High levels of NADPH-d activity were seen in the inner segments of light-sensitive cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells. The population of NADPH-d-positive amacrine cells included three types of neuron. Type 1 neurons were large and had sparse dendritic fields occupying the inner nuclear and outer retinal layers. Small type 2 neurons were located in the inner retinal layer. Ectopic amacrine cells, type 3, were located in the outer part of the ganglion layer. A high density of NADPH-d-positive neurons was seen in the central part of the retina, surrounding the central fovea and optic disk area. NADPH-d activity increased progressively during ontogenesis and correlated with the appearance of immunoreactive iNOS in neurons. iNOS labeled a subpopulation of amacrine and ganglion cells, which appeared at 20–21 weeks of development and reached a peak of immunoreactivity by the end of the third trimester. TUNEL-immunopositive neuron nuclei with signs of apoptotic destruction were seen at 30–31 weeks of pregnancy. The greatest apoptotic index was seen in the ganglion and amacrine cell populations.

The fundus examination of a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus receiving HCQ revealed left incomplete bull's eye and pigmentary changes in macula in the right eye. Repeated visual field tests showed the paracentral and peripheral defects in the right eye and the pericentral ring scotoma in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans revealed the photoreceptor loss, retina pigment epithelium (RPE) irregularities, and a cyst-like hypo reflective space over RPE layer on the nasal perifoveal region in the left eye. On the ophthalmoscopic examination, the perifoveal pigmentation was not altered after the discontinuation of HCQ. However, the bilateral visual field defects were improved and the photoreceptor destruction and cyst-like hyporeflective space disappeared in the left eye. Mild RPE irregularities remained in both eyes as revealed by OCT scans. Even if OCT is used to evaluate the regression of HCQ retinopathy, it only shows advanced stage of retinopathy." .

They are responsible for integrating electrical signals that originate with the photoreceptors and, via their axons that comprise the optic nerve, transmit that information to higher visual centers of the brain. The retinal ganglion cells reside on the inner surface of the retina and their axons course across the inner surface to exit at the back of the eye through a region known as the optic nerve head. Within this region, initiation of the degenerative processes associated with glaucoma are thought to occur, leading to degeneration of not only the optic nerve but also the retinal ganglion cells themselves. Studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind glaucoma have identified diverse cellular components and molecular events that occur in response to nerve injury. The challenge to date has been to identify and promote pro-survival events while suppressing those that support further degradation and loss of vision. Complicating this process is the fact that the cells and molecules involved can play multiple roles. An understanding of the players and their complex relationships is central to the development of a successful treatment strategy." .

Material and methodsThis retrospective, noncomparative, interventional study included patients undergoing a second GDD for uncontrolled glaucoma from a tertiary care glaucoma service. Data were obtained from the medical records for the preoperative period and after the 1st, 15th, and 30th day, 3, 6, and 12 months, and then yearly until the last postoperative visit. Visual acuity, IOP, and number of glaucoma medications (NGM) from the follow-up visits were compared to baseline. Success and failure criteria were analyzed based on IOP level or need of glaucoma medications. ResultsForty-nine patients were studied, with a mean follow-up time of 25 ± 21 months. The mean preoperative IOP was 23.7 ± 8.2 mmHg, and decreased to 14.8 ± 4.0 mmHg after 1 year, 14.4 ± 3.9 mmHg after 2 years, and 16.6 ± 8.5 mmHg after 3 years.

We evaluated the effect of latanoprostene bunod 0.024% instilled once daily (QD) on lowering IOP over a 24-h period in healthy Japanese subjects following 14 days of treatment. MethodsThis was a single-arm, single-center, open-label clinical study of 24 healthy Japanese male volunteers. A baseline IOP profile was established in both eyes in the sitting position at 8 PM, 10 PM, 12 AM, 2 AM, 4 AM, 8 AM, 10 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Subjects subsequently instilled latanoprostene bunod 0.024% QD at 8 PM for 14 days in both eyes. The absolute and change from baseline in sitting IOP was assessed on day 14. ResultsThe mean (SD) age of the subjects was 26.8 (6.3) years, and mean (SD) baseline IOP was 13.6 (1.3) mmHg in the study eye. Latanoprostene bunod 0.024% instilled QD for 14 days reduced IOP at all the evaluated time points (P < 0.001) with a mean (SD) 24-h reduction of 3.6 (0.8) mmHg or 27% from the baseline in the study eye. Peak and trough IOP lowering occurred at 8 AM and 8 PM (12 and 24 h following instillation) with a mean reduction of 4.2 (1.8) mmHg, or 30%, and 2.8 (2.2) mmHg, or 20%, respectively. Punctate keratitis and ocular hyperemia, both mild in severity, were the most common adverse events. ConclusionLatanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution 0.024%, dosed QD for 14 days, significantly lowered mean IOP in healthy Japanese subjects during the entire 24-h period. Studies of latanoprostene bunod in patients diagnosed with normal tension glaucoma are warranted. Trial RegistrationClinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01895985. FundingBausch & Lomb, Inc." .

The RPE consists of a single layer of cells which are columnar posteriorly but become cuboidal and even squamous moving peripherally in the fundus. The cells of the RPE layer regardless of location display basal (scleral) infoldings and apical (vitreal) processes and are joined laterally by junctional complexes. Throughout the retina the epithelial cells are rich in smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria but less so in rough endoplasmic reticulum and polysomes. The epithelial nucleus is vesicular and basally located. In the superior fundus an area of the RPE is very lightly pigmented and richer in lysosomes than is this layer in the inferior and peripheral fundus. The choroid overlying this area is also lightly pigmented and contains much collagen in a lamellar arrangement. This region may represent a vestigial tapetum fibrosum. Bruch's membrane is slightly thicker posteriorly but is everywhere seen to have a pentalaminate substructure. The choriocapillaris is a single layer of large capillaries which show numerous fenestrations facing the RPE. In the superior fundus the choriocapillaris is also highly fenestrated facing the choroid." .

The retina consists of two different types of cells: sensory cells and supportive cells. The present study confirms earlier results and demonstrates that the distal part of the sensory cells is altered during ontogenesis. In metamorphically competent larvae, the sensory cells are exclusively ciliary. In newly metamorphosed larvae and in adults, however, the sensory cells are of the mixed type, bearing both cilia and microvilli.

Pre- and post-exposure diapositives were compared in a randomized and double blind design by a panel of five members. By evaluating the photographs we found a high reproducibility between panel members and for repeated evaluation by the individual panel member. Furthermore, we found that the photographic method was more sensitive for measurements of changes in eye redness than the observations normally performed during such conjunctival provocation tests. The correlations of the objective findings with the symptoms reported were good at high pollen doses, but at lower doses of birch pollen (about half the effective dose) a decreased eye redness was observed. We found that sensory irritation (often expressed as dryness) measured simultaneously by questionnaires, in general occurred before any increased eye redness. The study indicates that photographic measurement of eye redness is reproducible, sensitive, unbiased and therefore a useful tool in environmental studies. Furthermore we demonstrated that the relation between eye redness and eye irritation is interestingly biphasic and may need further clarification." .

Peripheral degenerations of the snail-track and typical lattice-like types occurred with reasonable uniformity throughout the periphery and were seen symmetrically in both eyes. Atrophic retinal holes frequently occurred within these degenerative areas. Peripheral degenerations with or without holes were often seen in young myopes and occurred mostly without giving rise to symptoms. Retinal tears occurred in older, predominantly hyperopic or emmetropic subjects, and usually presented with symptoms of acute entopsiae and/or photopsiae. The tears presented mainly in the upper temporal quadrants and were only associated with lattice degenerations of the ipsi or contralateral eye in one-third of cases. It was concluded that the population suffering from retinal tears only partially overlaps with that presenting with lattice degeneration of the retinal periphery, and that it is questionable if a causal link is present between these two conditions. As a result the raison d'être of prophylaxis can be called into question." .

At an age older than embryonic day 4 (E4) more than 90% of the embryos survive this treatment. The drug induces various malformations; in particular the retina is heavily affected. This simple method offers the possibility to study the effect of a more or less decreased cell production on processes of further differentiation and histogenesis of retinal tissue. The following results are obtained: (1) In spite of the inhibition of cell proliferation in the retina by AraC an abnormally thick basal lamina is found and the expansion of the eye still proceeds, indicating that eye growth is not only dependent on retinal cell numbers. (2) Stereotyped malformations of retinal histogenesis are induced and categorized into three groups: in addition to areas of normal structure cells are found arranged in rosettes and in half-rosettes sometimes linked by areas of undefined transient cell arrangements. The results point to a strong tendency of a severely diminished cell population to form regularly laminated retinal-like structures as long as a minimal ratio of cell types is given. (3) The spatio-temporal appearance of the type of retinal malformation in a given retinal area is dependent on the time of AraC exposure and thus on the degree of differentiation reached at a “spatio-temporal spot”: Full rosettes develop at earlier, and half-rosettes at later stages of AraC interference. Furthermore, deformities first appear on temporal and ventral sides. Thus, the establishment of these malformations follows and reflects the normal sequence of differentiation within the retina. (4) Cells within rosettes organize in specific layers and start to differentiate normally. This shows that earlier formed cells are not dependent on the influence of factors derived from cells that are formed later for their proper differentiation." .

Shortage of donor tissue makes the biomaterials for corneal regeneration a hot area of research. Collagen is the main component of corneal stroma, so collagen becomes a promising material for corneal repair. However, due to the drawbacks of collagen, it needs to be further modified to satisfy the requirement of corneal regeneration. In this article, we highlight the importance of collagen materials for corneal repair, and summarize several methods of preparing collagen based corneal regeneration materials, including chemical crosslinking, plastic compression of collagen, and collagen vitrigel. These modification methods can make collagen membranes with remarkable properties such as enough mechanical and suture retention strength, antibacterial property and excellent optical property. These materials may provide potential treatment for corneal disease." .

The large lizard family Gekkonidae comprises about 90 genera (1000 species). While most geckos are nocturnal, the members of about 15 genera are diurnal. All of these species are 'tertiarily' diurnal, i.e. they are descended from 'secondarily' nocturnal ancestors. They have adapted to a diurnal lifestyle in quite different ways, as can be deduced by the crystallin proteins in their lenses. Evaluation of the heterogeneous lens crystallin compositions of diurnal geckos reveals that there are at least three lineages that regained diurnality independently." .

Best-corrected visual acuity was significantly better either in the right eyes or in the left eyes with greater retinal thickness of all four quadrants of the macular area in the inner ring, encompassing 1–3 mm from the foveal center (P < 0.05, Spearman rank correlation test), and also with the presence of the IS/OS line at the fovea (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon–Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test). Retinal average thickness in the posterior pole covering the 6 × 6 mm square area was positively correlated with peripapillary RNFL average thickness either in the right eyes or in the left eyes (P < 0.05). The average thickness of the peripapillary RNFL became significantly less with age (P < 0.05), but was not related with visual acuity. Macular retinal thickness and the presence of the IS/OS line, but not peripapillary RNFL thickness, could serve as objective signs for better visual acuity in retinitis pigmentosa. The macular retinal thickness might be used as an objective predictor to choose patients with retinitis pigmentosa who would be expected to gain vision after retinal prosthesis implantation." .

Patients and methods33 children (29 boys and 4 girls) with a mean age of 12 years (2–16 years) underwent complex retinal detachment surgery including p. p. vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade in 35 eyes because of severe trauma in 16 eyes (48.4%), giant retinal tears in 7 (21%), high myopia in 7 (21%), uveitis in 3 (9.9%) eyes, proliferative diabetic retinopathy in one and retrolental fibroplasia in one patient. A mean of 2.6 retinal surgical procedures were performed in each patient. The minimum follow-up was 6 months. ResultsTotal retinal reattachment was achieved in 21 eyes (60%). 6 eyes (17%) showed some residual retinal detachment, either anterior from the buckle or demarcated with laser scars, but with attached central retinas. 8 eyes (23%) were detached due to massive re-proliferation.In the group with secondary repair of severe trauma, 13 out of 16 eyes (81%) were able to be cured, 3(19%) remained uncured. ConclusionsAlthough the investment of time and effort in each single case is much higher in an infant than in an adult, one can obtain useful results in these eyes. Without a doubt, this complex surgery is always indicated in children with bilateral disease. In severe trauma of one eye, where the usefulness of surgery is sometimes questioned, more than 80% can be cured and gain vision. With better anatomic results, efforts to gain better visual rehabilitation and binocularity must be maximised." .

MethodHemoglobin oxygen saturation was measured in retinal vessels of both eyes in 14 patients with unilateral CRVO. The noninvasive spectrophotometric retinal oximeter is based on a fundus camera and simultaneously captures two images at 570 nm and 600 nm wavelengths. Five of the patients were followed with repeated retinal oximetry images over time. ResultsThe mean oxygen saturation in retinal venules was 31 % ±12 % in CRVO eyes and 52 % ±11 % in unaffected fellow eyes (mean ±SD, n = 14, p < 0.0001). The arteriovenous difference was 63 % ±11 % in eyes with CRVO and 43 % ±7 % in fellow eyes (p < 0.0001). The variability of retinal venous oxygen saturation was substantial within and between eyes affected by CRVO. Venular oxygen saturation improved with treatment and over time in all five patients that were followed. ConclusionCRVO eyes are hypoxic compared to fellow eyes and arteriovenous difference in hemoglobin oxygen saturation is increased. This is consistent with tissue hypoxia resulting from reduced blood flow. Further studies are needed to understand the correlation between hypoxia, severity of disease and prognosis." .

Increase in intraocular pressure caused by intraoperative suction with subsequent deforming of the ocular globe and excimer laser shock during the ablation have been discussed as possible causes. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of LASIK on the vitreous body. Patients and methodsIn a prospective study we performed ocular ultrasonography (B scan) immediately before and 1 week after LASIK procedure in 103 myopic or myopic–astigmatic eyes (53 patients, mean age 36.3 years, 32 women, 21 men). In particular, the prevalence, localization, and extent of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) were determined. ResultsThe mean spherical equivalent was −4.85 D (range −1.25 to −8.38) and the mean anteroposterior ocular globe length was 25.13 mm (range 23.31–27.65). Ninety-five eyes (92.2%) had no PVD preoperatively. Nine eyes out of this group (seven patients, 9.5%) developed incomplete PVD as assessed 1 week postoperatively. Eight eyes (7.8%) had a partial PVD preoperatively and in only one eye was an extension of vitreous detachment observed after the surgery. None of the preoperatively measured parameters could predict the occurrence of PVD by LASIK. ConclusionsLASIK may in rare cases lead to new occurrence of PVD or extension of a previously existing partial PVD." .

The eye rotates through 20–30° in snakes and turtles, 50° in crocodiles and 60° in rhynochocephalians. The eye fully compensates for changes in pitch of the head over about 1/2 the range of its response. This response is largley mediated by vestibular position reflexes. It is relatively independent of the visual horizon, body proprioceptors and temperature. Rotation of the eye bulb can be related to pupillary shape and to the reported organization of the visual projections to the optic tectum. Regardless of head position, reptiles orient their eyes to keep the horizon under close inspection." .

One system branches predominantly in the dorsoventral direction, the other one in the anterior-posterior direction. Both systems of the giant units have a twin system composed of elements smaller in diameter and strictly parallel to the main units. The two systems have been termed the Vertical and Horizontal Systems. The elements of the two systems of fibers project into the periesophageal region where they come into contact with other descending elements. Electron microscopic investigations show that the two systems are post-synaptic at the level of the ganglion from which they originate. The horizontal system has been shown to be post and pre-synaptic in nature during its course in the mid-brain and ultimately presynaptic at its endings in the periesophageal ring. The peculiar geometric arrangement of the two anatomical systems of fibers suggests a precise function in relation to the visual world and in particular to the detection of the direction of motion. The accuracy of the structural pattern displayed by the giant units in the lobular plate seems to suggest that this optic ganglion represents the ultimate orderly projection of the external world in the brain of the fly. A short review of the electrophysiological data concerning this ganglion has been tentatively correlated with some behavioral data related to the visual orientation and fixation in insects." .

It might therefore supply UTP for the formation of UDP-GlcNAc from glucose. As NDPKB contributes to vascular dysfunction, we speculate that NDPKB might play a role in microangiopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). Therefore, we investigated the impact of NDPKB on retinal vascular damage using NDPKB−/− mice during development of DR and its possible mechanisms. MethodsPericyte loss and acellular capillary (AC) formation were assessed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic NDPKB−/− and wild-type (WT) mice. Expression of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) and protein N-acetylglucosamine modification (GlcNAcylation) were assessed by western blot and/or immunofluorescence in the diabetic retinas as well as in endothelial cells depleted of NDPKB by siRNA and stimulated with high glucose. ResultsSimilar to diabetic WT retinas, non-diabetic NDPKB−/− retinas showed a significant decrease in pericyte coverage in comparison with non-diabetic WT retinas. Hyperglycemia further aggravates pericyte loss in diabetic NDPKB−/− retinas. AC formation was detected in the diabetic NDPKB−/− retinas. Similar to hyperglycemia, NDPKB deficiency induced Ang2 expression and protein GlcNAcylation that were not further altered in the diabetic retinas. In cultured endothelial cells, stimulation with high glucose and NDPKB depletion comparably increased Ang2 expression and protein GlcNAcylation. ConclusionsOur data identify NDPKB as a protective factor in the retina, which controls Ang2 expression and the hexosamine pathway. NDPKB-deficient mice are a suitable model for studying mechanisms underlying diabetic retinal vascular damage." .

Some of the animals were intact, some had one optic nerve cut (1-nerve-x group) and others had both optic nerves cut (2-nerve-x group). We compared the two eye rhythms with each other and with the foregoing locomotor rhythms. 1.The procedures of eye removal and setting up for recording shifted the phase of the eye rhythm by a maximum of ±2.5 h. The largest phase shifts occurred when the eyes were removed during the middle of the subjective night. The phase shifts were similar in magnitude to those caused by 1 h pulses of light and were not large enough to invalidate the estimation of the approximate phase of the eye rhythm in vivo from data obtained subsequently in vitro.2.After three or more weeks of constant conditions, the two eye rhythms of intactAplysia were usually out of phase with each other. There was a preference for very large interocular phase differences near 180 ° at the expense of medium interocular phase differences near 90 °. The large phase differences developed as soon or sooner after the beginning of CC than medium phase differences (Fig.3A).3.InAplysia with one or both optic nerves cut, the two eye rhythms also got out of phase, but large phase differences were not more numerous than medium ones and medium phase differences developed sooner than large ones. Ocular desynchrony developed earlier in 1-nerve-x animals than in either intact or 2-nerve-x animals. Ocular desynchrony developed no sooner and perhaps later in the 2-nerve-x animals than in the intact animals (Fig. 3).Findings 2 and 3 mean that neural coupling does not assist at all in keeping the two eye clocks in phase with each other as they are in LD 12∶12. The rate of development of ocular desynchrony and the preferred interocular phase difference, however, may be weakly influenced by some type of efferent regulation of the eye clocks.4.IntactAplysia that had medium or large interocular phase differences seldom expressed strong rhythmicity in their locomotor behavior, and animals that had strong behavioral rhythmicity had small interocular phase differences (Fig. 4).5.The locomotor rhythmicity of 1-nerve-x animals was as strong as that of intact animals, but unlike intact animals, the strength of rhythmicity in the 1-nerve-x animals was unrelated to the size of the interocular phase difference (Figs. 5, 6).6.In most 2-nerve-x animals, locomotor circadian rhythmicity was weak or nonexistent (Fig. 6). Nonetheless, there were a few 2-nerve-x animals that had convincing locomotor freeruns, indicating that a circadian oscillator can be coupled to locomotion even after both optic nerves are cut (Fig. 7).7.In intactAplysia with strong behavioral rhythmicity and small interocular phase angles, the rising phase of the eye rhythm usually occurred at, or slightly before, the rising phase of the locomotor rhythm. There were exceptions to this rule, however (Fig. 8).8.In 1-nerve-x animals the phase of the rhythm of the attached eye, but not of the detached eye, corresponded to the phase of the locomotor rhythm (Fig. 9). Results 4 through 8 strengthen the conclusion that the eyes participate in the control of the circadian locomotor rhythm. Further, the eyes are neurally, not hormonally, coupled to the locomotor system. The eyes, however, may not be the driver oscillators for the locomotor rhythm." .

The comprehension of the dynamics of primary blast injury mechanisms is a challenging issue. The question is whether the pressure wave propagation and reflection alone could cause ocular damage. To date, there are dissenting opinions and no conclusive evidence thereupon. A previous numerical investigation of blast trauma highlighted the dynamic effect of pressure propagation and its amplification by the geometry of the bony orbit, inducing a resonance cavity effect and a standing wave hazardous for eye tissues. The objective of the current work is to find experimental evidence of the numerically identified phenomenon. Therefore, tests aimed at evaluating the response of porcine eyes to blast overpressure generated by firecrackers explosion were performed. The orbital cavity effect was considered mounting the enucleated eyes inside a dummy orbit. The experimental measurements obtained during the explosion tests presented in this paper corroborate the numerical evidence of a high-frequency pressure amplification, enhancing the loading on the ocular tissues, attributable to the orbital bony walls surrounding the eye." .

Afferent fibers of these nerves form terminal ramifications (chiefly dorsally) in the middle part of the cerebral ganglion. Some of them pass through the commissure to the symmetrical region of the opposite cerebral ganglion. Neurons innervating the eyes are located in several regions of both cerebral ganglia. InLymnaea they are distributed near the point of entry of the optic nerve, in the region of the commissure, the mesocerebrum, and the posterior part of the ganglion. InHelix these neurons are found in the same regions except in the posterior part of the ganglion. In electrophysiological experiments responses of neurons in these parts of the cerebral ganglion to adequate stimulation of the eye were recorded. Differences in the character of responses and also the presence of neurons indifferent to stimulation of the eye are evidence of the functional heterogeneity of these areas. This suggests that morphologically separate visual centers do not exist in the cerebral ganglion of the Pulmonata. Neurons giving specific responses to stimulation of the eye and evidently belonging to different levels of the visual system (afferent or efferent divisions) are closely connected both with each other and with cells of other functional systems." .

In addition to the central role they play in vision, some or all of these photoreceptors translate photoperiodic information into a day–night rhythm of melatonin production. This indolic hormone plays an important role in the photoperiodic regulation of retinal physiology. Previous studies have stopped short of establishing whether melatonin synthesis takes place in all the photoreceptor spectral subtypes. Another issue that has been left unsettled by previous studies is when during development are retinal precursor cells committed to a specific photoreceptor subtype and to a melatoninergic phenotype? To address the first question, in situ hybridization of the five opsins was combined with immunofluorescent detection of the melatonin-synthesizing enzyme hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase (HIOMT, EC.2.1.1.4). Confocal microscopy clearly indicated that all photoreceptor spectral subtypes are involved in melatonin synthesis. To tackle the second question, retinal precursor cells were dissociated between embryonic day 6 (E6) and E13 and cultured in serum-free medium for 4 days to examine their ability to autonomously activate the expression of opsins and HIOMT. Real-time PCR on cultured precursors indicated that red-, green- and violet-sensitive cones are committed at E6, rods at E10 and blue-sensitive cones at E12. HIOMT gene expression was programmed at E6, probably reflecting the differentiation of early cones. The present study provides a better characterization of photoreceptor subtypes in the chicken retina and describes a combination of serum-free culture and real-time PCR that should facilitate further developmental studies." .

MethodsIn this retrospective pilot study 11 eyes of 11 patients with submacular hemorrhage secondary to AMD were analyzed.A limited 23 g-one-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed and 50 μg rt-PA, 1.25 mg bevacizumab and about 1.5 mL of 100 % sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) were injected into the vitreous. The best and the final visual acuity and blood displacement from the fovea were evaluated postoperatively. ResultsThe best postoperative visual acuity (VA) was obtained at a median of 1 month after surgery (range 0.5–6 months) and demonstrated significantly better results than baseline VA for a short period of time (p = 0.04). No statistically significant improvement (p = 0.11) of the final visual acuity at a median of 3 months (range 0.5–6 months) compared to preoperative was found. Final visual acuity improved in 7 eyes, remained stable in 2 eyes and worsened in 2 eyes.

Leonardo invented a new technique of representation which combines the building plan and a bird’s-eye perspective of the whole into a single system. Bird’s eye perspective may have developed out of cavalier perspective, and instances pre-dating Leonardo can be found, but not used in the same way as he employed it. Though not pre-axonometric, Leonardo took advantage of axonometric representation’s capacity to construct/deconstruct an object into its component parts in order to clarify fitting and functioning. This paper investigates the originality of the technique and special relationship with his research on centrally-planned churches, while examining it in the context of contemporary developments and architects." .

Traditionally, interest was directed toward the appearance of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer. With the improvement of the resolution of optical coherence tomography, the ganglion cell complex has also become routinely accessible in the clinic. Further advances have been made in understanding the structure-function relationship in glaucoma. Nevertheless, direct imaging of the retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma would be advantageous. With the currently used techniques, this goal cannot be achieved, because the transversal resolution is limited by aberrations of the eye. The use of adaptive optics has significantly improved transversal resolution, and the imaging of several cell types including cones and astrocytes has become possible. Imaging of retinal ganglion cells, however, still remains a problem, because of the transparency of these cells. However, the visualization of retinal ganglion cells and their dendrites has been achieved in animal models. Furthermore, attempts have been made to visualize the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells in vivo. Implementation of these techniques in clinical practice will probably improve glaucoma care and facilitate the development of neuroprotective strategies." .

The father showed only subclinical disease with subtle endothelial blisters like those found in Schlichting's dystrophy. His daughter and grandson, however, both suffered from a peculiar, prominent, ring-shaped clouding of the cornea which progressed to severe edema, necessitating keratoplasty. Light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy revealed an epithelial transformation of the endothelium. While the anterior banded part of Descemet's membrane was well-formed in the central cornea, it was missing in the periphery. This corresponded with the ring-shaped opacity and indicated a very early transformation of the endothelium in this area. We believe that this pedigree represents an unusual clinical variant of posterior polymorphous dystrophy of the cornea." .

The detection of polarized sky light is mediated by the ommatidia of a small specialized part of the compound eye: the dorsal rim area (DRA). We describe the morphology and fine structure of the DRA in monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). The DRA consists of approximately 100 ommatidia forming a narrow ribbon along the dorsal eye margin. Each ommatidium contains two types of photoreceptor with mutually orthogonal microvilli orientations occurring in a 2:6 ratio. Within each rhabdomere, the microvilli are well aligned. Rhabdom structure and orientation remain constant at all retinal levels, but the rhabdom profiles, as seen in tangential sections through the DRA, change their orientations in a fan-like fashion from the frontal to the caudal end of the DRA. Whereas these properties (two microvillar orientations per rhabdom, microvillar alignment along rhabdomeres, ommatidial fan array) are typical for insect DRAs in general, we also report and discuss here a novel feature. The ommatidia of monarch butterflies are equipped with reflecting tapeta, which are directly connected to the proximal ends of the rhabdoms. Although tapeta are also present in the DRA, they are separated from the rhabdoms by a space of approximately 55 μm effectively inactivating them. This reduces self-screening effects, keeping polarization sensitivity of all photoreceptors of the DRA ommatidia both high and approximately equal." .

During this process, the area of the peripodial membrane is substantially reduced. The peripodial membrane is taut at this stage, and if it is cut the curling of the disc cannot continue, and the eye anlagen returns to its original position within one minute of the operation. In contrast, cutting the columnar epithelium between the eye and antennal anlagen does not disrupt curling, but actually facilitates it. During curling, the cells of the peripodial membrane appear healthy, and exhibit basal extensions. We suggest that the curling of the eye is mediated by the conversion of cuboidal peripodial membrane cells into pseudostratified columnar epithelium at the edges of the peripodial membrane. Subsequently, cells of the peripodial membrane secrete first a pupal cuticle, and then an imaginal cuticle." .

A prospective longitudinal study was initiated to analyze the correlation between the prognosis for the second eyes of patients with unilateral late exudative AMD and the disease phenotype. Methods. Of the187 patients with unilateral late exudative AMD recruited, 130 (69.5%) had predominantly classic CNV without pigment epithelium detachment (PED) (CNV group), and 57 (30.5%) had occult CNV with serous PED (PED group). Patients were reexamined by ophthalmoscopy and angiography every 6 months for up to 80 months. The end point was ETDRS visual acuity change of 3 lines or more due to late AMD in the second eye. Results. During follow-up 53 (28.3%) patients reached the end point: 32 (24.6%) in the CNV group and 21 (36.8%) in the PED group. The major prognostic factor for the risk of visual loss in the second eye was the type of late AMD in the first eye (CNV group 6–7% per year, PED group 15–16% per year (P<0.001). There was significant symmetry between the new exudative lesion in the second eye and that in the first, and significant differences in the density and fluorescence of drusen in the second eye between the two groups. Conclusions. Patients with occult CNV with serous PED in the first eye have a significantly higher risk of visual loss in the second eye than patients with CNV without PED. This distinction may be important for future clinical studies. In addition, segregation of AMD by phenotype is necessary in the analysis of genes conferring risk of AMD." .

The classification system for ROP according to the International Committee is presented as well as our screening policy in relation to the literature. The effectiveness in preventing severe cases of ROP and the toxicity of vitamin E supplementation in high-risk premature infants is still disputed and no recommendations can be given.

However, under certain circumstances, adverse responses can occur during contact lens wear and several microorganisms—including bacteria, fungi, and free living amoebae—can cause several eye infections in wearers. Extended wear of contact lenses is the major risk factor of eye infections such as microbial keratitis, besides contaminated contact lens storage case, contaminated lens care solutions, and inaccurate contact lens handling. In this study, we collected contact lens storage case and domestic tap water samples from 50 asymptomatic contact lens wearers. We determined that total aerobic mesophilic bacteria were isolated in 45 (90 %), Gram negative rod bacteria were isolated in 20 (40 %), Pseudomonas spp. were isolated in 2 (4 %) and fungi were isolated in 18 (36 %) out of 50 contact lens storage cases. Free living amoebae were not detected in investigated contact lens storage cases. At the same time, out of 50, total aerobic mesophilic bacteria were isolated in 34 (68 %), fungi were isolated in 15 (30 %) and free living amoebae were isolated in 15 (30 %) domestic tap water samples. No Gram-negative rod bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. were detected in investigated water samples. Two contact lens case samples and two tap water samples were excluded from the analysis for Pseudomonas spp. for technical reasons. According to our findings, inadequate contact lens maintenance during lens wear may result in the contamination of contact lens storage cases. This situation can lead to severe eye infections in contact lens wearers over time." .

Regardless of the primary risk factor, degeneration may continue, resulting in further loss of neurons and subsequent glaucomatous damage. During the past decade, scientists and clinicians began to accept that, in addition or as an alternative to fighting off the primary risk factor(s), there is a need to protect the tissue from the ongoing spread of damage—an approach collectively termed “neuroprotection.” We found that the immune system, the body’s own defense mechanism, plays a key role in the ability of the optic nerve and the retina to withstand glaucomatous conditions. This defense involves recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells that together create a protective niche and thereby halt disease progression. The spontaneous immune response might not be sufficient, and therefore, we suggest boosting it by immunization (with the appropriate antigen, at specific timing and predetermined optimal dosing) which may be developed into a suitable therapeutic vaccination to treat glaucoma. This view of immune system involvement in glaucoma will raise new challenges in glaucoma research, changing the way in which clinicians perceive the disease and the approach to therapy." .

This study was to investigate the role of moesin and its underlying signal transduction in retinal vascular hyper-permeability induced by AGE-modified mouse serum albumin (AGE-MSA). Female C57BL/6 mice were used to produce an AGE-treated model by intraperitoneal administration of AGE-MSA for seven consecutive days. The inner blood–retinal barrier was quantified by Evans blue leakage assay. Endothelial F-actin cytoskeleton in retinal vasculature was visualized by fluorescence probe staining. The expression and phosphorylation of moesin in retinal vessels were detected by RT–PCR and western blotting. Further studies were performed to explore the effects of Rho kinase (ROCK) and p38 MAPK pathway on the involvement of moesin in AGE-induced retinal vascular hyper-permeability response. Treatment with AGE-MSA significantly increased the permeability of the retinal microvessels and induced the disorganization of F-actin in retinal vascular endothelial cells. The threonine (T558) phosphorylation of moesin in retinal vessels was enhanced remarkably after AGE administration. The phosphorylation of moesin was attenuated by inhibitions of ROCK and p38 MAPK, while this treatment also prevented the dysfunction of inner blood–retinal barrier and the reorganization of F-actin in retinal vascular endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that moesin is involved in AGE-induced retinal vascular endothelial dysfunction and the phosphorylation of moesin is triggered via ROCK and p38 MAPK activation." .

Within the visual system of the adult rat JONES gangliosides are found only in those regions where neuronal regeneration is known to occur, i.e. the unmyelinated retina and optic nerve head. A transient increase in JONES ganglioside expression could be observed in the retinae of adult rats after optic nerve axotomy or in the retinae of animals receiving autologous sciatic nerve grafts. The highest levels of gangliosides identified by JONES were observed five days after surgery — contemporaneous with the maximum regenerative response of the adult rat retina after crush lesions. By double-labelling experiments using antibodies against glial cell markers — glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 and vimentin in conjunction with JONES—JONES gangliosides were shown to be expressed on retinal glial cellsin vivo andin vitro. Elimination of glial cells by intraocular injection of aminoadipic acid abolished JONES labellingin vivo." .

At these sites, two mitochondria appear like “sentinels” attached to the cytoplasmic surfaces of their respective sides of a desmosome. In other instances, only one side of the junction may be afforded an associated mitochondrion. In each case the cytoplasmic filaments of the desmosome are seen to blend with the outer membrane of the mitochondrion. The relationship between desmosomes and mitochondria in the ciliary epithelium is unique among ocular tissues. A survey of ocular epithelia in the various species examined, failed to give any evidence of similar junctional/organelle complexes. Various functional roles for this relationship are discussed including the possibility that the mitochondria could control the cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration in the microenvironment of their associated desmosomal junctions." .

The hyaloid conus consists of a tapering sheath of unpigmented, vascularized connective tissue enveloping the proximal part of the hyaloid artery which proceeds from the optic nerve head through the vitreous body to the ventrally located falciform process and lens muscles. The hyaloid artery passes through the hyaloid conus without giving off any branches. The conus vessels encircling the hyaloid artery receive arterial blood from the choroid via small arteries and are drained to the choroid by a single vein. The hyaloid conus is compared with the lacertilian conus papillaris. The function of the hyaloid conus is unknown. Because of its small dimensions relative to those of the eyeball and its few capillaries, it is unlikely that the hyaloid conus is a supplemental nutritive device for the retina." .

Manifestation of inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases in both systems seems perspicuous, yet during check-up of patients with uveitis they are rarely considered. In this study we aimed to determine the frequency of neurologic diseases in our uveitis patients and to describe the characteristics of ophthalmologic findings. METHODS: We analyzed the database of 1973 consecutive patients seen between 2000 and 2004 at the uveitis clinic at the hospital of the Medical University of Vienna. All cases of uveitis associated with neurologic co-manifestations of immune-mediated diseases were selected. RESULTS: Of 1973 patients with uveitis, 52 (2.6 %) had neurologic diseases that were considered to be related to the eye inflammation. The most frequent entities were multiple sclerosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's disease, neurobehcet, central nervous system lymphoma, neurosyphilis and neurosarcoidosis. Uveitis was only rarely seen with infectious meningoencephalitis (neuroborreliosis, mumps, measles), Takayasu arteritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or orbital pseudotumor. CONCLUSIONS: Several diseases can cause both ocular and/or central nervous system inflammation. This should prompt ophthalmologists and neurologists in the presence of one to rule out the other. In uveitis patients without evident neurological symptoms, specific ocular pathologies can help the treating ophthalmologist to tailor the work-up, whereas neurologists should always screen their patients, even when they are asymptomatic for ocular disease. Early diagnosis in both cases can help to initiate adequate treatment, thereby modulating the course of the disease and preventing complications." .

Oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular manifestations are associated with Chiari 1 malformation. Reports of the results of decompression of CM1 in resolution of these manifestations are limited. Methods. A retrospective review of case notes were undertaken from Jan 1998 to March 2003 of all the cases undergoing posterior fossa decompressions by the senior author. Forty patients were identified of which 12 had oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular manifestations. Results. Oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular symptoms were present in seven patients and eleven patients had clinical signs. There were only 2 patients who had symptoms and no objective findings. There was complete resolution of oculomotor and vestibulo-ocular manifestations in 8/12 patients and partial improvement in another one, leading to improvement in 9/12 patients. The mean time span to complete resolution was 15.5 months (range 3–71 months). Conclusion. Posterior fossa decompression appears to be highly effective in causing complete resolution of disabling oculomotor and vestibule-ocular manifestations in most cases of CM1." .

We report about the outcome of excimer laser trephination in aphakic eyes. MethodsWe examined 17 eyes of 17 patients. Diagnosis in 11 eyes was endothelial decompensation and in six, corneal scars. We performed an excimer laser keratoplasty with intraoperative “Flieringa ring” suturing. Follow-up ranged between 3 and 41 (17.6 ± 11.7) months. Main outcome measures included: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), topographic astigmatism, corneal refractive power (CRP), central corneal thickness (CCT) and endothelial cell density (ECD). ResultsPreoperative BCVA was light perception in two eyes, hand motion in seven, finger counting in one eye, under 20/400 in six eyes and 20/200 in one eye. IOP ranged between 4 and 28 (13.6 ± 5.1) mmHg. Topographic astigmatism ranged from 0.5 to 18.5 (7.0 ± 6.9) dioptres. CRP was between 38 and 59 (46 ± 9) dioptres. CCT was between 404 and 1069 (748 ± 181) μm. Postoperative BCVA was hand motion in five eyes, under 20/400 in two and ranged between 20/200 and 20/20 in ten eyes. IOP ranged between 10 and 40 (18.3 ± 8.5) mmHg. Topographic astigmatism ranged from 0.9 to 13 (5.5 ± 3.2) dioptres. CRP was between 31.9 and 46.7 (42 ± 4.1) dioptres. CCT was between 349 and 820 (552 ± 115.57) μm. ECD was between 592 and 2319 (1674 ± 553) cells/mm2. ConclusionsExcimer laser trephination can deliver beneficial visual outcomes in most of the aphakic eyes." .

We compared the immunolocalization of the 70-kDa stress protein (SP70) in the ocular tissue of the normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat with that in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat with retinal dystrophy. SP70 was present in the maturing ocular tissues of both rat strains. However, once retinal degeneration began in the RCS rat, the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells showed increased immunostaining for SP70 over that observed in age-matched SD rats. In late stages of retinal degeneration, immunostaining for SP70 was considerably reduced in the RCS retina, whereas normal distribution of immunostaining for SP70 in the SD retina was preserved, albeit decreased, through postnatal day 180. The optic nerve, ciliary body, and corneal epithelium were also influenced by the dystrophic disease condition, although the pattern of changes in SP70 immunostaining differed for each tissue. These results suggest that the genetic defect in the RCS rat produces a state of metabolic stress in all ocular tissues as the degeneration progresses, but that the subsequent rise in ocular SP70 is insufficient to prevent progression of the disease." .

The elastomer is originated upon cross-linking of a silicone matrix. UV irradiation of one side of the lens polymerizes selectively a photosensitive macromer, causing local variations of its concentration. The subsequent diffusion of macromers from high concentration to low concentration zones modifies the shape of the lens and thus its dioptric power. In vitro experiments on artificial lens showed that the power change is dependent on UV exposure time, irradiation intensity and light pattern. With the aim to define a numerical tool able to predict the dioptric power adjustment as a function of the UV irradiation parameters, we setup a purely mechanic finite element model of the lens, adopting a hyperelastic material model embedded with eigen-deformations. Numerical simulations of axis-symmetric irradiation closely reproduced the experimental results, in terms of both lens geometry and dioptric power, for positive, negative and lock-in corrections." .

Using a bottom-up approach based on retrospective data, this cross-sectional study estimated average annual direct costs of nvAMD to be £4,047, and average annual indirect costs to be £449. An attempt to measure intangible costs through willingness-to-pay yielded a lower response rate and estimated intangible costs to be 11.5% of monthly income. Direct costs were significantly higher for male participants, for those who have mild or moderate visual impairment in both eyes, and for those who have been diagnosed for a shorter time. The findings of this study suggest that the availability of early diagnosis, effective treatment, support services, and sustained research into the management of nvAMD may reduce the burden of visual impairment caused by nvAMD to affected individuals and the state." .

Here, we consider which of the available methods provides the most information concerning glaucomatous optic nerve disease. The multifocal electroretinogram (ERG), although often employed, is less affected in glaucoma than two direct measurements of retinal ganglion cell function, namely the pattern ERG (PERG) and the photopic negative response (PhNR) of the ERG. For the PERG, longitudinal studies have been reported, suggesting that this method can be used for the early detection of glaucoma; for the PhNR, no longitudinal study is available as yet. The multifocal PERG can spatially resolve ganglion cell function but its glaucomatous reduction is typically panretinal, even with only local field changes and so, its topographic resolution is of no advantage in glaucoma. The multifocal visual evoked potential promises objective perimetry and shows sensitivity and specificity comparable with standard automated perimetry but has not been established as a routine tool to date." .

MethodsIn this retrospective study 20 consecutive patients (20 eyes) undergoing verteporfin PDT for extrafoveal predominantly classic CNV in AMD were examined. Colour photography of the fundus, fluorescein angiography and complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity assessment with ETDRS charts, were performed before treatment and at 3-month intervals thereafter. The primary outcome criterion was the change in visual acuity. The secondary outcome criterion was the extension of the CNV beneath the centre of the fovea during the follow-up period. ResultsMean follow-up time of the patients was 24.2 months (range 12 to 58 months). Visual acuity at baseline varied from 20/200 to 20/20 (mean 20/50±2.3 lines). Final visual acuity ranged from 20/1000 to 20/20 (mean 20/200±5.1 lines) (P<0.001). In 85% (17/20) of the eyes visual acuity worsened. Visual acuity improved in 15% (3/20) of the eyes. During the course of the follow-up period, subfoveal extension of the CNV was detected in 80% (16/20) of the eyes. ConclusionIn 85% of the eyes with extrafoveal predominantly classic CNV secondary to AMD, visual acuity worsened after verteporfin PDT in an average follow-up time of 24 months. Subfoveal CNV was found in 80% of the eyes during follow-up. Even though verteporfin PDT can preserve visual acuity in selected cases, deterioration was seen in the majority of the patients." .

The converter has more than 180° view angle and lens distortion. The objectives of the present study were to develop a procedure for calibrating the view angle and lens distortion of the fish-eye converter, and to examine the effect of the calibration on light environment estimates. Based on unpublished data provided by the Electric Image Technical Center of Nikon, a 12-order poly-nomial expression for the calibration was derived. The expression enabled us to calibrate the view angle and lens distortion for all selectable resolution digital images. Using a Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera with the fish-eye converter, 105 hemispherical photographs were taken in 15 stands, and then the canopy cover and weighted openness were measured as the light environment estimates. The calibrated estimates were significantly higher than uncalibrated ones, but the differences were comparatively small, with the average differences being 0.658% for canopy cover and 0.344% for weighted openness. A strongly positive correlation between calibrated and uncalibrated estimates was observed. Both slope and intercept of the regression lines of the calibrated estimate against the uncalibrated one were significantly different between canopy cover and weighted openness, suggesting that the calibration effect would be different among light environment estimates. In conclusion, we should pay attention to the view angle and lens distortion of the fish-eye converter in estimating light environments using the Coolpix digital camera." .

However, we have to remember that vitreous and retinal changes in high myopic eyes can lead to retinal detachment (RD), in some cases with a poor visual outcome even after successful surgery. Moreover, it is well known that cataract extraction is a major cause of later RD with a further significant increase of the incidence of RD after Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. The increased risk rates of RD for high myopia and cataract extraction are probably to be additive; therefore, high myopic eyes are significantly more exposed to postoperative complications. The greater incidence of RD in these eyes can be explained considering the anomalous vitreous changes occurring in high myopia, precipitated by the molecular and structural changes of the vitreous following cataract surgery. There are anomalous vitreo-retinal separation that are most frequently observed in very high myopic eyes: anomalous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and posterior vitreous schisis (PVS), the latter generally observed in association with a prominent posterior stafiloma. Intraoperative observations and recent studies of the macular area by means of optical coherence tomography (OCT) allowed the detection in these eyes of a thin layer of epiretinal tissue strictly adherent to the retina involved by the staphyloma; in these cases tractional retinal detachment, macular schisis or holes can occur. There are only few reports on the vitreo-retinal complications of CLE; for this reason, most conclusions have been derived from studies on RD occurred after cataract extraction in high myopic eyes. These data suggest that the risk/benefit ratio for this operation is probably too high to be recommended." .

Methods: Twenty-seven patients suffering from visually significant cataract (visual acuity <5 Snellen lines) and PEX glaucoma were randomly assigned to either phaco combined with trabecular aspiration (14 eyes of 14 patients) or phaco alone (13 eyes of 13 patients). Inclusion criteria for glaucoma were IOP ≤22 mmHg under treatment with up to two antiglaucomatous agents, excluding pilocarpine 4%, and no previous surgery or laser trabeculoplasty treatment. Clear cornea phaco with foldable acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was carried out in all patients uneventfully. Trabecular aspiration was performed using a special probe in the inferior 180 deg of the angle after IOL implantation. Results: Follow-up duration ranged from 12 to 18 months. In the combined procedure group there was a statistically significant decrease in postoperative IOP during the whole follow-up period (P<0.01), while in 9 of the 14 patients the IOP was controlled without medications at the last examination. In the phaco alone group a statistically significant decrease in postoperative IOP was recorded at 9 and 12 months after surgery (P<0.05), while in 4 of the 13 patients the IOP was controlled without medications at the last examination. Comparing the two groups, a statistically significantly lower number of medications was being used in the combined procedure group at the last recorded examination (P<0.05). Conclusions: It seems that the combined clear cornea phaco and trabecular aspiration procedure in cases of PEX glaucoma associated with cataract is a safe and effective method. This technique controls IOP more effectively and with fewer postoperative medications than clear cornea phaco alone." .

The open rhabdoms of all four species have a central pair of rhabdomeres surrounded by six peripheral rhabdomeres. At night, a distal pigment aperture is fully open and the rhabdom receives light over an angle approximately six times the interommatidial angle. Different rhabdomeres within the same ommatidium do not share the same visual axis, and the visual fields of the peripheral rhabdomeres overlap the optical axes of several near-by ommatidia. During the day, the pigment aperture is considerably smaller, and all rhabdomeres share the same visual field of about two interommatidial angles, or less, depending on the degree of light adaptation. The pigment aperture serves two functions: (1) it allows the circadian rhythm to switch between the night and day sampling patterns, and (2) it works as a light driven pupil during the day. Theoretical considerations suggest that, in the night eye, the peripheral retinula cells are involved in neural pooling in the lamina, with asymmetric pooling fields matching the visual fields of the rhabdomeres. Such a system provides high sensitivity for nocturnal vision, and the open rhabdom has the potential of feeding information into parallel spatial channels with different tradeoffs between resolution and sensitivity. Modification of this operational principle to suit a strictly diurnal life, makes the contractile pigment aperture superfluous, and decreasing angular sensitivities together with decreasing pooling fields lead to a neural superposition eye." .

Both patients improved in visual acuity and central retinal artery pressure as well as in signs of transient ischaemic attack. Postoperative angiography showed a marked decrease in collateral flow through the ophthalmic artery, which is reversed from the normal direction, with the development of blood flow through the anastomosis. Discussion is offered indicating that the lack of collateral flow through both the anterior and posterior communicating arteries is important in addition to occlusion of the internal carotid artery in order to produce full-blown ischaemic oculopathy such as venous stasis retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma or rubeosis iridis. It is stressed that EC-IC bypass surgery should be performed soon after the appearance of ischaemia and before the development of neovascular glaucoma or rubeosis iridis in order to obtain normal vision. In ischaemic oculopathy the results of EC-IC bypass can be evaluated objectively and quantitatively by many noninvasive neuro-ophthalmological tests which are important in discussing the efficacy of the bypass surgery." .

It is commonly treated with retinal photocoagulation therapy; however, progression to blindness remains a significant problem. To determine the feasibility of adjunctive anti-angiogenic gene therapy, we evaluated the capability of retroviral vectors, which transfer exogenous genes only into dividing cells, to transfer and express a β-galactosidase gene selectively into photocoagulation sites. Thirty-five rabbits received 30 retinal photocoagulation burns in the right eye followed 2 days later by β-galactosidase (G1nBgSvNa) or control (G1XSvNa) vector injection into the subretinal space. β-galactosidase expression was observed in the photocoagulation sites from 5 days after vector administration (31.7 ± 7.0 %) to 12 weeks (6.7 ± 3.4 %). Immunohistochemical studies of the treated retinas using antibody Ber-MAC3 and anti-cytokeratin antibodies revealed that transduced cells were macrophages and retinal pigment epithelial cells. To determine feasibility in a primate, two monkeys received 10 laser burns in the macula superior to the fovea followed 2 days later by G1nBgSvNa vector. β-galactosidase expression was found in photocoagulation sites and foveal retina was well preserved. We conclude that gene transfer to retinal photocoagulation sites provides stable expression of the transduced gene with relatively high efficiency. This feasibility study suggests the possibility of transferring genes encoding for anti-angiogenic factors into photocoagulation sites to improve the efficacy of laser photocoagulation therapy.

This is a retrospective study including the 18 eyes of 18 patients. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and visual field testing were performed in all cases. ResultsDiseases associated with BRAO included active ocular toxoplasmosis in 7 patients, rickettsiosis in 4, Behçet’s uveitis in 2, West Nile virus infection in 1, idiopathic retinal vasculitis in 1, Crohn’s disease in 1, ocular tuberculosis in 1, and idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis syndrome in 1 patient. The mean initial visual acuity was 20/50. BRAO involved the first order retinal artery in 33.3% of the eyes, the second order retinal artery in 33.3%, an arteriole in 27.8%, and a cilioretinal artery in 5.5%. The macula was involved in 44.4% of the eyes and an acute focus of retinitis or retinochoroiditis was associated to BRAO in 55.5%. Repermeabilization of the occluded artery occurred in all patients with permanent scotomas in the corresponding visual field. The mean visual acuity at last visit was 20/32. ConclusionsBRAO, with subsequent visual impairment, may occur in the eyes with posterior uveitis. Physicians should be aware of such vision-threatening complication of infectious and inflammatory eye diseases." .

An experiment was conducted to survey the effects of thyroidectomy on rabbit retina. In this study, 10 male rabbits of New Zealand strips were divided into two groups of five animals each (control group and thyroidectomy group). Before surgery, the rabbits were maintained in 12-h light and 12-h dark. The animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg xylazine and 6 mg/kg ketamine, and bilateral thyroidectomy was performed. One and 2 weeks after surgery, the rabbits were sacrificed by humane methods. Then, retinas of the killed rabbits were isolated in the laboratory and examined by electron microscopy for evaluating cells and changes in inner segment, outer segment, outer limiting membrane, and outer nuclear layer. The result of this experiment showed vacuolization in inner section and endoplasmic reticulum of rabbit retina in group two. It was also observed that mitochondria of the inner segment of retina were larger and more circular than mitochondrial in control group; moreover, most of them had lost their crystal. The core in the control group was normal and had round to oval shape and distributed chromatin, but in thyroidectomy group, the mode of the nucleus was small and dark (pyknosis) and some nucleus had been destroyed." .

The parietal nerve enters the left habenular ganglion where it branches into a medial and a lateral route. Some nerve fibers decussate within the habenular commissure. Whereas this pathway exhibits a striking asymmetry at the level of the habenular ganglia, its projections to the dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the periventricular hypothalamic area, the preoptic hypothalamic and telencephalic regions, and the pretectal area are arranged in a strictly symmetric manner. A possible innervation of tegmental areas could not be proven due to the presence of endogenous peroxidase within these regions. No parietal nerve fibers were observed in the optic tectum. In a few animals investigated, scattered labeled perikarya were located in the periventricular hypothalamic gray indicating a parietopetal innervation in Lacerta sicula. The injection of horseradish peroxidase into one of the lateral eyes revealed terminal areas of the optic nerve within the preoptic region, and the thalamic and pretectal nuclei, displaying partial overlapping with the projections of the parietal nerve to these areas. From the present investigation further evidence is obtained that the pineal complex of lower vertebrates is a component of the photoneuroendocrine system. Particular emphasis is placed upon the nervous connections between the parietal eye and the hypothalamus, described for the first time in the present study." .

In the distal region, the open rhabdomeres of retinula cells 1–6 are arranged in a symmetrically circular pattern with their microvilli directed radially. Immediately beneath the crystalline cone, cell 7 forms a rhabdomere that is about 1 μm long and lies in the center of the circle formed by the rhabdomeres of cells 1–6. For the remaining length of an ommatidium it is replaced by the rhabdomere of retinula cell 8. The cell body of this retinula cell almost encloses its own rhabdomere by forming a deep invagination. Consequently, no ommatidial cavity is present. In the left eye rhabdomeres R 3, 5 and 6 first twist clockwise along their longitudinal axes, while rhabdomeres R1, 2, 4 and 8 twist counterclockwise. Opposite twisting is observed in the right eye. The twist rate varies along the length of the rhabdomeres. In a middle region of 60 μm, within which the direction of twist does not change, the maximal twist rates are approximately 2°–5°/μm in R1–6 and even higher in R 8. In a proximal region, the direction of twist is reversed, but the initial orientation of the microvilli not reestablished. Both the cross-sectional shape of the rhabdomeres and their geometric arrangement in the retinula change along with the twisting. It is substantiated that the rhabdomeric twist is not due to artifactual deformation." .

In patients carrying one of the primary mutations the risk to develop LHON is 50% for males and 10% for females. We report a family with predominantly young girls affected. · Methods: In a family with 14 known maternal relatives (11 females, 3 males) 9 patients in 4 generations developed LHON. Eight of the 9 patients were females. Three affected females could be examined and followed. · Results: The only affected male showed the typical course of LHON with acute visual loss in both eyes (20/400–20/800) within 6 weeks at 20 years of age. Eight of 9 females developed signs of LHON. In these females acute visual loss occurred at about 10 years of age. Final visual acuity was about 20/200. Central or paracentral scotomata, color vision defects and delayed P100 latencies in the VEP were seen. Ophthalmoscopy showed hyperemic discs in the acute stage and optic atrophy in later stages. Molecular genetic analysis revealed the presence of the mtDNA ND4/np11778 mutation in this family. Specific clinical or additional molecular genetic risk factors could not be detected. · Conclusion: Families with LHON may show considerable variations of the clinical course and the gender- or age-specific risk. We present a family with a high disease penetrance of 64% and a 2 times higher risk for young females than for males. Furthermore, early visual loss in this family is permanent." .

Changes in IOP caused by frontal passages are evident; the response is not identical in all the patients near the day of the passage of a warm front, while on the third day following the passage of the front a well pronounced drop in IOP occurs. Anomalous increases of IOP over several months' duration occurred in the years 1986–7. This finding is explained in relation to the hypothesis of environmental contamination in Central Europe by radioactive cesium nuclides due to the Chernobyl accident." .

They are compared with non-eye-frequenting representatives of these families. In Noctuidae, highly specialized fruit-piercing, skin-piercing blood-sucking, and sweat-feeding representatives have been included. All hemi- and eulachryphagous species have a soft proboscis tip which is characterized by few sensilla and strongly elongated, dentate plates of the dorsal galeal linkage. The latter structures leave broad gaps between them that lead into the food canal at the tip. This arrangement permits the uptake of fluid suspensions such as lachrymal fluid, wound exudates and pus. The modified dorsal galeal linkage is regarded as an adaptation for this highly derived feeding habit. The rough surface of the proboscis is likely to cause irritation and possible mechanical damage to the conjunctiva and cornea which results in an increased lachrymal flow and production of pus. In contrast to fruit-piercing and skin-piercing Noctuidae, there are no erectile structures on the proboscis of eye-frequenting species.—The comparison with related non-eye-frequenting species demonstrates that the particular morphology of the proboscis tip in lachryphagous moths evolved convergently in different families of Leipdoptera." .

The eyes were divided into: group A, which had good visualization of optic disc details, and group B, whose media allowed only disc outline or less to be seen. We found that in group A eyes, both instruments were reliable (with accuracies of 94% for the PAM and 88% for the LI). However, in group B eyes (advanced cataracts), both instruments were unreliable (accuracies of 33% for the PAM and 53% for the LI). Interestingly, in a subgroup of high myopes (axial length >29 mm) with moderate cataracts and poor visual acuties, both instruments were very reliable and helpful in determining how much of the vision loss was due to the cataracts. We therefore strongly recommend potential acuity testing in high myopes with moderate cataracts and poor visual acuity." .

MethodsIn all, 34 consecutive patients with new-onset CNV were randomized 1:1 to receive either ranibizumab monotherapy or ranibizumab combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin. After three initial injections with ranibizumab, re-treatment was performed according to an as-needed scheme; PDT was performed once at baseline. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT parameters like central macular volume (CMV), central macular thickness (or central retinal thickness (CRT)), subretinal and intraretinal fluid, fibrovascular lesion thickness, or inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction were analyzed. ResultsAfter 12 months, a visual gain of 6.1 letters was found in the monotherapy group, whereas patients in the combination therapy group lost − 4.8 letters from baseline to the 12-month visit. CMV and CRT decreased considerably between baseline and month 2–3 in both groups, with a following slight increase until month 12. Additional application of PDT had negative effect to 12-month BCVA, whereas higher baseline BCVA and integrity of the IS/OS junction at month 12 had positive effect to 12-month BCVA. ConclusionsBetter baseline BCVA and the integrity of IS/OS junction at 12-month visit were the most important predictive factors for final BCVA. Combination therapy caused worse final BCVA and a higher degree of IS/OS disruption." .

In recent years, anti-VEGF agents have emerged as new approaches to the treatment of these devastating diabetic complications. Although Phase III studies in the diabetic population are needed, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is currently being used in clinical practice. Intravitreal injection is an effective means of delivering anti-VEGF drugs to the retina. However, this is an invasive procedure associated with potentially serious complications, such as endophthalmitis or retinal detachment, which may be significant for patients requiring serial treatment over many years. In addition, although delivered within the vitreous, anti-VEGF drugs could pass into the systemic circulation, which could potentially result in hypertension, proteinuria, increased cardiovascular events and impaired wound healing. Pegaptanib, ranibizumab and bevacizumab are the currently available anti-VEGF agents. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab block all VEGF isoforms, thus impairing both physiological and pathological neovascularisation. Pegaptanib only blocks the VEGF165 isoform, and would therefore seem the best option for avoiding systemic adverse effects in diabetic patients, although this remains to be demonstrated in clinical trials. In this regard, head-to-head studies designed to evaluate not only the efficacy, but also the systemic adverse effects of these drugs in a high-risk population such as diabetic patients are warranted." .

The whole operation is performed with the naked eye, vascular anastomoses included. From January of 1992 to December of 1993, 37 free tissue transfers have been performed on 36 patients. An operating microscope was used in only 6 cases (5 free flaps, and 1 emergency exploration for thrombosis). In the other 37 cases (33 free flaps, and 5 emergency explorations for thrombosis), the anastomoses were performed with the naked eye. In a total number of 103 vascular anastomoses, the microscope was used in 14 cases, and the naked eye in 89 cases. The only failure of our series was performed in the classical way, in addition to the emergency exploration and its salvage by a second free flap. There were no failures in the naked eye cases. In the 5 other cases, emergency exploration allowed salvage of the flap. No technical error in the vascular anastomoses occurred in any of those cases. The authors conclude that elective free-tissue transfer in plastic surgery is routinely possible, safe and reliable, without the microscope or magnifying glasses, provided that vessels of the flap and recipient vessels be chosen with sufficient diameter.

Blastema formation has been prevented either by covering the amputation surface with the skin or by reconnecting the amputated part to the limb stump. Results show that stage 52 non-regenerating limbs could promote lens formation from corneal implants not only when innervated but also when denervated. A similar result was observed in stage 57 limbs where blastema formation was prevented by reconnecting the amputated part to the stump. In this case, relevant tissue dedifferentiation was observed in the boundary region between the stump and the autografted part of the limb. However, stage 57 limbs, where blastema formation was prevented by covering the amputation surface with skin, could promote lens formation from the outer cornea only when innervated. In this case, no relevant dedifferentiation of the stump tissues was observed. These results indicate that blastema formation is not a prerequisite for lens-forming transformations of corneal fragments implanted into amputated hindlimbs of larval X. laevis and that lens formation can be promoted by factors delivered by the nerve fibres or produced by populations of undifferentiated or dedifferentiated limb cells." .

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational, consecutive case series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred to ten ophthalmic centers within a defined 10-week period with a newly diagnosed exudative macular and/or neovascular retinal disease were examined fundoscopically and angiographically and quantified according to age and underlying disease. RESULTS: A total of 527 eyes of 426 patients were referred. The most frequent disease was neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (199 of 527, 37.8%, 184 patients), followed by diabetic maculopathy and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (199 of 527, 37.8%, 128 patients) and venous occlusive disease (67 of 527, 12.7%, 67 patients). The majority of neovascular AMD consisted of occult without classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (115 of 199, 57.8%); predominantly classic CNV was seen more often than minimally classic CNV (43 of 199, 21.6%, vs. 27 of 199, 13.6%). The overwhelming majority of the diabetic cases had diabetic macular edema (179 of 199, 89.9%); only 10.1% had vasoproliferative disease. All other causes of CNV, macular edema and exudation, and retinal neovascularization were observed in <5% of all patients. CONCLUSION: The main causes of exudative maculopathy are CNV due to neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is the main cause of retinal neovascularization. The number of patients with neovascular AMD presents a future challenge for ophthalmologists." .

However, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells have their peak sensitivity at 480 nm, and their sent information influences melatonin production in the pineal gland. Material and MethodsTo analyze the effect of these blue-light-filtering intraocular lenses we compared the change in melatonin daytime levels after implantation of blue-light-filtering or white intraocular lenses. Eight subjects with cataract were randomized to receive either blue-light-filtering or white intraocular lenses. Melatonin analysis, visual acuity, complete slit lamp analysis, and questionnaire about sleeping habits and quality were performed before and 1 month after cataract surgery. ResultsFive subjects received a blue-light-filtering and three a white intraocular lens. The average amounts of wakes during the night increased postoperatively in three out of the five subjects who received the blue-light-filtering lens. Subjects with the white lens only had < 1.0 pg/ml increase, while subjects with blue-light-filtering intraocular lenses had > 1.0 pg/ml increase of melatonin after surgery. ConclusionWe found that subjects who received blue-light-filtering intraocular lenses had an increase in uneasy sleep and more wakes during the night. Since melatonin secretion is not blocked by the blue-light-filtering lenses, which leads to elevated levels of melatonin during day time, and can increase retinal damage in light, the effectiveness of the blue-light-filtering intraocular lenses has to be questioned and needs to be further investigated." .

The following morphologic results were observed:1.Epiretinal cell layers in the peripapillar and foveolar regions which caused no ‘puckering’ of the retinal surface. These cell layers were mainly composed of glial cells. Some Müller cell processes and macrophages were also present. The epiretinal glial cells stem from the surface of the papilla and of the retina. They leave the retina through breaks of the basal lamina (especially where the latter is only a thin layer).2.Folding (puckering) of the retinal surface was exclusively observed under condensed masses of fibrous tissue. The epiretinal fibrous tissue is composed of immature collagen fibrils of various diameters, of acid glycosaminoglycans, and of granular deposits of long-spacing collagen. The fibrillar material is firmly attached to the basal lamina of the retina. Shrinkage of the epiretinal fibrous tissue similar to the shrinkage of scar tissue is assumed to be the reason for the development of traction to the retinal surface. The epiretinal glial cells are assumed to be the sites of synthesis of the preretinal fibrous masses and glycosaminoglycans." .

MethodsA 55-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of acute painless bilateral loss of vision; she also complained of fever and weight loss. Examination showed a CRAO in the left eye and angiographically documented choroidal ischemia in both eyes. ResultsThe possibility of systemic vasculitis was not kept in mind until further studies were carried out; methylprednisolone pulse therapy was then started. Renal biopsy disclosed focal and segmental necrotizing vasculitis of the medium-sized arteries, supporting the diagnosis of WG, and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was administered with gradual improvement, but there was no visual recovery. ConclusionCRAO as presenting manifestation of WG, in the context of retinal vasculitis, is very uncommon, but we should be aware of WG in the etiology of CRAO. This report shows the difficulty of diagnosing Wegener's granulomatosis; it requires a high index of suspicion, and we should obtain an accurate medical history and repeat serological and histopathological examinations. It emphasizes that inflammation of arteries leads to irreversible retinal infarction, and visual loss may occur" .

We have compared retinal cell populations of D2 mice with those in control C57BL/6J mice to provide information on retinal histopathology in the D2 mouse. The D2 mouse retina is characterized by a reduction in retinal thickness caused mainly by a thinning of the inner retinal layers. Immunocytochemical staining for specific inner retinal neuronal markers, viz., calbindin for horizontal cells; protein kinase C (PKC) and recoverin for bipolar cells, glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for amacrine cells, and osteopontin (OPN) for ganglion cells, was performed to detect preferentially affected neurons in the D2 mouse retina. Calbindin, PKC, and recoverin immunoreactivities were not significantly altered. Amacrine cells immunoreactive for GABA, ChAT, and OPN were markedly decreased in number, whereas NOS-immunoreactive amacrine cells increased in number. However, no changes were observed in the population of glycine-immunoreactive amacrine cells. These findings indicate a significant loss of retinal ganglion and some amacrine cells, whereas glycinergic amacrine cells, horizontal, and bipolar cells are almost unaffected in the D2 mouse. The reduction in amacrine cells appears to be attributable to a loss of GABAergic and particularly cholinergic amacrine cells. The increase in nitrergic neurons with the consequent increase in NOS and NO may be important in the changes in the retinal organization that lead to glaucomain D2 mice. Thus, the D2 mouse retina represents a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of glaucoma and mechanisms of retinal neuronal death and for evaluating neuroprotection strategies." .

The wound healing response can be augmented by Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) exposure originating from sun or solarium. Clinically Laser in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) even in high diopter range is associated with less subepithelial haze and regression than PRK. In an animal model, the morphologic changes of the rabbit cornea were evaluated following LASIK and secondary UV-B exposure. Light microsopic changes were found to be insignificant. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) normal epithelium, epithelial adhesion structures and normal anterior stroma showed in the LASIK treated UV-B irradiated rabbit eyes. Around the peripheral LASIK cut, migrating keratocytes with pseudopodia were observed. Under the flap (160 μm depth) the overall stromal collagen structure was normal, some activated keratocytes and mild extracellular matrix formation within and around keratocytes were noted. Within activated keratocytes TEM showed prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and extracellular vacuoles, which showed resolution with time. These changes were much milder than in PRK treated-UV-B irradiated eyes. Secondary UV-B caused no long-term disturbance in corneal transparency in LASIK and UV-B treated rabbit eyes." .

Expression of mucins in human lacrimal glands was monitored by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, the presence and distribution of MUC1, -2, -4, -5AC, -5B, -6 and -7 in epithelia of the human lacrimal gland and its excretory duct system were assessed with antisera to mucin peptide cores. Thirty normal tissues from cadavers of different ages were tested, plus four with dry eye treated with artificial tears. Expression studies detected mRNAs for mucins MUC1, -4, -5AC, -5B, -6 and -7; whereas the MUC2 message was absent. The message for MUC4 was present in all four cases of dry eye, but only in six out of the 30 normal glands from individuals who did not receive artificial tears. MUC6 mRNA was detected only in about half of the investigated samples. Immunohistochemistry revealed membrane-bound MUC1 at the apical surface of acinar cells, absence of MUC2, MUC5AC associated with goblet cells of excretory ducts, MUC5B and -7 in the cytoplasm of acinar cells, and MUC7 also in epithelial cells of excretory ducts. MUC4 mucin was detected only in those individuals in which message was identified. In dry eyes, MUC5AC and -5B were localized in the same acinar cells; whereas MUC2 and MUC6 were not detectable. Dot-blot analysis clearly revealed increased amounts of MUC4, -5AC, and -5B in the glands of elderly women who received treatment for dry eyes. These results confirm that the human lacrimal gland synthesizes a spectrum of mucins; part of them might be correlated with age." .

The EEG was recorded on magnetic tape from normal subjects, (medical students) in a constant environment and subsequently analysed by an analogue computer (Noratom Instrument for Statistical Analysis and Computation, ISAC). Absolute measurements made from 15 subjects with eyes closed have shown that peaks of power at 10 Hz vary from 9 to 46 μV2 per Hz. Qualitatively, suppression of power at 10 Hz is greater due to eye-opening than mental arithmetic. Analysis of pooled power spectral density functions from 11 subjects showed that the effect of eye-opening differed significantly from the effect of mental arithmetic at 2.5 and 12.5 Hz. Suppression of lower frequency alpha activity was more pronounced during calculation than during eye-opening. Compared with the eyes closed condition, eye-opening showed a highly significant suppression at 10 and 12.5 Hz (alpha activity) and from 15 to 25 Hz (beta activity). Mental arithmetic induced significant suppression at 7.5 and 10 Hz and from 15 to 30 Hz. Eye-opening enhanced lower frequency activity which calculation suppressed. Variation was greater between first, second and third calculations in pooled power spectral densities than between corresponding eye-opening epochs. It is suggested that these differences in effects of eye-opening and mental arithmetic reflect differences in underlying cerebral activity, rather than that an underlying factor common to both effects may be orbital in origin." .

The clinical course and visual impairment of ODD is usually mild; however, significant ocular morbidity may occur, such as visual field defects and retinal haemorrhages. Optic disc drusen may pose a diagnostic dilemma and differentiating these from other entities that can lead to similar compressive axonal distress is imperative. We present a novel technique for three-dimensional (3D) characterisation of superficial ODD based on 3D volume rendering of optical coherence tomography angiography (3DOCTA) scans. Material and methodsOptical coherence tomography (Cirrus™ HD-OCT Model 5000 with AngioPlex, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, USA) scans were obtained from the optic nerve head of a healthy 22-year-old female. Consequently, 3D structural OCT data and OCTA were analysed, enabling ODD segmentation and spatial characterization. ResultsVolumetric analysis of superficial ODD showed a maximal drusen horizontal diameter of 223 μm, maximal vertical diameter of 268 μm, surface area of 6617 μm2 and volume measurement of 12,875 μm3. The drusen were characterised by a connected network of multiple drusen islands instead of forming a dense mass. Multiple vascular channels with perforating vessels were found across the drusen. ConclusionThree-dimensional volume rendering of OCTA scans provided new insight on the spatio-anatomical features of superficial ODD. The new features herein described, namely multilobulated drusen islands and intradrusen channels, may directly contribute to the pathogenic events leading to transient non-embolic visual loss and small vessel occlusion secondary to ODD." .

Key findings are as follows: The pseudocone cavity is enclosed by six corneal pigment cells. The nuclei of the six cells are firmly anchored to the underside of the lens and portions remain after lens delamination from the pseudocone cavity. An eccentrically-positioned, short photoreceptor cell was observed near the region where the inferior central cell initiates its rhabdom. This eminence may represent that cell's soma. The basement membrane is revealed as a two-tiered, fibrous layer with ovoid fenestrations. Each opening is sealed with a diaphragm perforated by eight retinular axons and a trachea. Conjoined distal surfaces of the satellite glial cells form a membrane-like barrier immediately underlying the basement membrane. Monopolar somata from the lamina are covered with glial cells which possibly make more intimate contact with the somata through miniscule projections. Optic cartridges with monopolar interneurons were noted. Spherical to slightly biconcave processes of these interneurons contact retinular axons. Very fine (1000 Å) filaments interweave among and contact lateral processes. Further implications are discussed as they relate to observed structures." .

In situations of severe shortage in supply of donor corneal tissue, we may consider the use of seropositive donors for transplantation if we can prove with high certainty the absence of HCV RNA in the donor corneal tissue. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific technique for direct detection of HCV RNA and can be used for this purpose. Nevertheless, it is not applicable for routine clinical use in most eye departments due to its unavailability and cost effectiveness.Purpose: To study the possible use of immunohistochemical method for detection of HCV antigen in corneal tissue of seropositive donors and correlate the results with those of PCR. Immunohistochemical methods have not yet been studied in donor corneal tissue.Materials and methods: Eight corneas of 4 seropositive and 8 corneas of 4 seronegative corneal donors were studied by immunohistochemical and PCR methods for the presence of HCV antigen in their corneal tissue and sera.Results: HCV RNA was not detected in the sera and corneal tissue of all seropositive and seronegative corneal donors by either PCR and immunohistochemical methods.Conclusion: Although the study is too small for conclusive results, the correlation between the immunohistochemical and PCR studies for direct detection of HCV antigen in corneal tissue of seropositive donors may raise the possibility of using the immunohistochemical method for screening of donor corneas for the detection of HCV antigen. A larger prospective study investigating the sensitivity, specificity and clinical applicability of the immunohistochemical method is warranted." .

The purpose of this study is to assess visual outcomes following bilateral cataract surgery and the implant of a FineVision® trifocal intraocular lens (IOL). MethodsProspective, nonrandomized, observational study. Vision was assessed in 44 eyes of 22 patients (mean age 68.4 ± 5.5 years) before and 3 months after surgery. Aberrations were determined using the Topcon KR-1 W wave-front analyzer. LogMAR visual acuity was measured at distance (corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA 4 m), intermediate (distance corrected intermediate visual acuity, DCIVA 60 cm) and near (distance corrected near visual acuity, DCNVA 40 cm). The Pelli-Robson letter chart and the CSV-1000 test were used to estimate contrast sensitivity (CS). Defocus curve testing was performed in photopic and mesopic conditions. Adverse photic phenomena were assessed using the Halo v1.0 program. ResultsMean aberration values for a mesopic pupil diameter were: total HOA RMS: 0.41 ± 0.30 μm, coma: 0.32 ± 0.22 μm and spherical aberration: 0.21 ± 0.20 μm. Binocular logMAR measurements were: CDVA −0.05 ± 0.05, DCIVA 0.15 ± 0.10, and DCNVA 0.06 ± 0.10. Mean Pelli-Robson CS was 1.40 ± 0.14 log units. Mean CSV100 CS for the 4 frequencies examined (A: 3 cycles/degree (cpd), B: 6 cpd, C: 12 cpd, D: 18 cpd) were 1.64 ± 0.14, 1.77 ± 0.18, 1.44 ± 0.24 and 0.98 ± 0.24 log units, respectively. Significant differences were observed in defocus curves for photopic and mesopic conditions (p < 0.0001). A mean disturbance index of 0.28 ± 0.22 was obtained. ConclusionsBilateral FineVision IOL implant achieved a full range of adequate vision, satisfactory contrast sensitivity, and a lack of significant adverse photic phenomena.

No special artery supplying the submacular choroid was seen. All the temporal SPCAs entered the eyeball in the macular region and each artery supplied a segment of the choroid, with no anastomoses between the adjacent segments. Most of the segments of the choroid supplied by the temporal SPCAs and their watershed zones met in the macular region. Similarly the four quadrants of the uveal tract drained by the four vortex veins and their watershed zones met in the macular region. Since an area where numerous watershed zones meet is most vulnerable to ischaemic disorders, the macular region is likely to show special vulnerability to any generalized chronic ischaemic disorder of the choroid. This, however, would not hold good in occlusion of a single SPCA, because the latter supplies only a small segment of the macular region. It is postulated that senile macular degeneration, senile disciform macular degeneration and allied macular disorders are most probably due to this unusual pattern of the submacular choroid and its special vulnerability to suffer in generalized chronic choroidal ischaemia as compared to the rest of the choroid." .

The goal of this study is to estimate the degree, duration, and causes of visual impairment in eyes affected by ocular TB. ResultsThis was a retrospective study of patients diagnosed as ocular TB based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. We applied the World Health Organization definition of visual impairment (VI) to affected eye(s), instead of better-seeing eye. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of <6/18 and ≥6/60 in the affected eye was classified as moderate VI and <6/60 and ≥3/60 as severe VI. Data collected included presenting and final BCVA of affected eyes and the worst BCVA during the study period. Sixty-one eyes of 40 patients were analyzed. Twenty-five patients (52.1%) had bilateral disease. The mean worst BCVA and mean final BCVA (logMAR) were 1.26 ± 0.87 and 0.61 ± 0.85, respectively, and their difference was highly significant (p < 0.0001, Friedman test). The median worst and final BCVA results were 1.30 (range 0.0 to 3.0) and 0.20 (range 0.0 to 3.0), respectively. The mean duration of follow-up was 98.34 ± 81.81 weeks. Moderate and severe VIs were seen in 14 (22.9%) and 12 (19.7%) eyes, respectively, during the course of follow up. Twenty eyes (32.8%) had BCVA of <3/60. Moderate VI or worse was most commonly seen in eyes with multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis (n = 6; 100%), retinal vasculitis (n = 25; 80.6%), and panuveitis (n = 12; 80%). The mean duration of visual loss was 25.2 ± 42.37 weeks (median 6.43 weeks, range 0 to 206.42 weeks). Vitreous hemorrhage, complicated cataract, and macular scarring were the common causes of VI. ConclusionOcular TB can result in prolonged visual impairment, more commonly in patients with posterior uveitis or panuveitis." .

At early metamorphic stages (stages I and II), photoreceptors are present in a small zone of the retina. During these stages, the lateral surface of the epithelial cells shows zonulae occludentes and adhaerentes. The degree of cell differentiation varies throughout the retinal pigment epithelium. Cells covering the differentiated photoreceptors in the central retina have phagosomes, whereas pigment granules appear only in the retinal pigment epithelium dorsal to the optic nerve head. Most epithelial cells have myeloid bodies; their morphology is more complex around the optic nerve head. At stage III, when photoreceptors develop over the whole retina, the distribution of cytoplasmic organelles is almost homogeneous in the retinal pigment epithelium. Subsequently, the basal plasma membrane of the epithelial cells becomes progressively folded and their apical processes enlarged. In addition, extensive gap junctions develop between retinal pigment cells. In late metamorphic stages, noticeable growth of myeloid bodies occurs and consequently the retinal pigment epithelium resembles that of the adult. This study also describes, for the first time, the presence of wandering phagocytes in the retinal pigment epithelium of lampreys; their role in melanosome degradation is discussed." .

Both experimental and clinical data suggest that improved diagnostic and prognostic information can be derived from the assessment of the mechanical responsiveness of the sclera and lamina cribrosa to intraocular pressure (IOP). Controlled mutagenesis of the sclera has produced a mouse strain that is relatively resistant to increased IOP. Alteration of the baseline scleral state can be accomplished through either increased cross-linking of fibrillar components or their reduction. The sclera is a dynamic structure, altering its structure and behavior in response to IOP change. The biochemical pathways that control these responses are fertile areas for new glaucoma treatments." .

MethodsA model was created with patient-level data from the RESPOND/RESTORE trials to estimate the impact of baseline characteristics on increases in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies, measured by letters gained on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale from baseline to month 12. Mean BCVA gains with ranibizumab 0.5 mg pro re nata or laser photocoagulation monotherapy were predicted, assuming baseline characteristics equivalent to those in the VIVID-DME/VISTA-DME trials. These results were compared with the gain with aflibercept 2.0 mg every 8 weeks in VIVID-DME/VISTA-DME. Sensitivity analyses assessed outcome robustness. ResultsBaseline BCVA and central retinal thickness differed significantly between trials. In unadjusted data, patients in RESPOND/RESTORE receiving ranibizumab gained an additional 6.6 letters [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.5–8.7] compared with patients receiving laser monotherapy. After adjusting data to assume baseline characteristics equivalent to VIVID-DME/VISTA-DME, patients receiving ranibizumab were predicted to gain an additional 9.9 letters (95% CI: 7.3–12.4) compared with those receiving laser monotherapy. These results were similar (0.1-letter difference in favor of aflibercept; 95% CI: −2.9 to 3.2; P = 0.94) to the gain in BCVA in patients receiving aflibercept in VIVID-DME/VISTA-DME compared with those receiving laser monotherapy (10.0 letters, 95% CI: 8.3–11.7). ConclusionAfter adjusting for baseline characteristics, the difference in letters gained between patients receiving ranibizumab versus aflibercept was non-significant across trials, highlighting the importance of adjusting for baseline characteristics in future comparisons.

The real-life applicability of OCTA was assessed in a busy outpatient eye clinic using the same hardware (Triton, TOPCON, Tokyo, Japan) but different software versions 1 year apart. The influence of various parameters on OCTA performance was assessed. Materials and methodsTwo groups of 100 patients with intravitreal injections for maculopathy were evaluated with OCTA. Demographic characteristics did not differ significantly. Group A was assessed in February 2016, group B in February 2017. Recording time, scan quality, visual acuity, patient age, diagnosis, and lens status were recorded for statistical evaluation. ResultsThe time taken for examination differed significantly between the two groups. In group A, average recording time was 44.7 s (standard deviation, SD, 26.9 s; range 10–103 s), in group B 17.1 s (SD 9.0 s, range 7–53 s; P = 0.001). Image quality was higher in group B (P = 0.03). In bivariate analysis, recording time, age, and visual acuity correlated with image quality. In univariate regression analysis, recording duration and visual acuity were associated with a higher risk of poor OCTA quality. In multivariate regression analysis, scan duration was the sole predictor of a higher risk for poor OCTA quality (group A: odds ratio, OR, 5.9; confidence interval, CI, 2.0–17.5; P = 0.001; group B: OR 3.9, CI 1.3–11.9, P = 0.01). ConclusionAdvances in software-based artefact correction reduce recording time and improve SS-OCTA quality significantly. Although SS-OCTA is still more time consuming than conventional SS-OCT, current performance enables routine application even in a busy retina outpatient clinic. Further hardware and software improvements should focus on recording time." .

Healon 5 is a new viscoelastic product with special rheological properties. We evaluated the postoperative effect of Viscoat and Healon5 on intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell counts and laser flare. Methods: Forty-eight eyes of 48 patients undergoing routine phacoemulsification followed by foldable IOL implantation were enrolled. Either Healon5 or Viscoat was used according to a block- randomization scheme. The aspiration technique was standardized. IOP, CCT, endothelial cell counts and laser flare were compared pre- and postoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-sample Wilcoxon test. Data description was based on median and quartiles, while graphic description was performed by non-parametric box plots. Results: Viscoat demonstrated a statistically significant higher IOP than Healon5 at 4 and 8 h postoperatively (P<0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Further, the laser flare values were statistically significantly higher for the Viscoat than for the Healon5 group 8 h postoperatively (P<0.05). Endothelial cell loss did not differ significantly between the two groups (relative change in endothelial cell density after 3 months: –4.3% for the Healon5 group and –6.2% for Viscoat group). Conclusion: There was neither a statistically nor a clinically significant difference in endothelial cell loss after the use of Healon5 or Viscoat in routine cataract surgery. However, the IOP in the early postoperative period was higher in the Viscoat group than in the Healon5 group." .

Clinical examinations revealed comedones, seborrhea, thickening, and hyperpigmentation of the skin. Conjunctival congestion, hyperemia, and a white central corneal deposit on both eyes were observed during eye examination. Hematological investigations showed hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. The Hormone profile revealed low serum levels of total and free thyroxin and an increased serum level of TSH. The appearance of ocular lesion as well as increased levels of blood cholesterol and triglyceride confirmed our diagnosis of corneal lipidosis, and considering the hormonal changes and symptoms, hypothyroidism was considered as the cause of corneal lipidosis. The dog was treated with levothyroxine and atorvastatin." .

MethodsResearch work included 27 patients (27 eyes) who underwent uneventful cataract surgery with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation on one eye. Optical coherence tomography was used to obtain data of macular thickness before surgery and for patients who attended scheduled control measurement 1 month (22 patients), 3 months (23 patients), and 6 months (20 patients) after the surgery. ResultsThe greatest increase in average macular thickness was seen 1 month after cataract surgery, statistically significant in all areas except in fovea and superior quarter of macula. Statistically significant decrease in macular thickness was noticed 3 and 6 months after the surgery. Comparison of macular thickness 6 months after cataract surgery and values before surgery showed no statistically significant difference. ConclusionFindings confirmed the reversibility of macular thickness changes 6 months after cataract surgery and its return to preoperative values." .

The cells from these layers have different electrophysiological responses, the distal cells giving primary “off” responses, and the proximal cells giving “on” responses. The receptor surfaces of the distal retinal cells are formed from lamellae produced by the outer membranes of flattened cilia. These cilia have a basal body, basal foot, no root system and a 9 + 0 internal filament content. Each cell gives rise to an axon from its distal side, and this process goes up to the basement membrane, which is present below the cellular lens, passes along beneath it, and joins the distal optic nerve. The receptor part of the proximal retinal cells is formed from a vast array of microvilli. Each of these cells also bears one or two cilia with a probable 9 + 0 internal filament complement and no roots. The proximal cells give rise to axons, forming the proximal optic nerve. Below the proximal retina is a reflecting layer, the argentea, and below this is a pigment cell layer." .

The retina contains at least two types of cell: sensory cells bearing long tufts of microvilli with a central cytoplasmic core, and pigment cells with short microvilli. New eyes became visible at the tips of the eyestalk stump 5–16 days after amputation. When the regenerated eyes first appear, they consist of hollow balls of cells with a pigment lined cavity; two types of retinal cells are already distinguishable but their microvilli and cilia are small and sparse. The microvillous tufts and sensory cell contents develop quickly and about 14 days after their first appearance, the eye is a fully formed but miniature organ." .

Three indices of anaemia, namely packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell (RBC) counts and haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations were compared with the colour of the ocular membranes of the goats. The colours of the ocular conjunctiva of all animals were scored on a 1–5 scale using the FAMACHA© card, and blood samples were collected from each animal for determination of PCV, RBC counts and Hb concentration. Correlations between eye colour scores and the duo of PCV and Hb concentrations were highly significant and negative. Haemonchus contortus was the most predominant gastrointestinal nematode parasite observed in the study with average larval recovery of 70.18 %. Age has no effect on the predictability of anaemia by the FAMACHA© technique. It was concluded that the FAMACHA method can be used by farmers in Nigeria to identify anaemic goats particularly in conditions of haemonchosis which is one of the main causes of anaemia in goats and the most predominant gastrointestinal nematode in small ruminants in the study area. It is, therefore, believed that these preliminary findings will form a basis for further work on validating the use of FAMACHA© in Nigerian goats." .

One chamber was equipped with clear incandescent light with a maximum intensity of 0.66µW cm−2 mµ −1 and the remaining chamber was equipped with blue light with a maximum intensity of 0.015µW cm−2 mµ −1. Both groups received a daily photoperiod of 14 hours' light and 10 hours' dark. Low intensity blue light caused a definite eye enlargement after 7 weeks of exposure.The eye enlargement was not related to an increase release rate of thyroidal131I or oxygen consumption. Intraocular pressure was no greater in the enlarged eyes than in control eyes.Length of exposure to light and dark cycles caused a daily rhythm in intraocular pressure which was not different in the two light treatments. Associated with the eye enlargement was an exophthalmic condition during the developmental stages, a slight flattening of the cornea, and definite alterations in visual parameters resulting in an axial length myopia. Some lenticular contribution to the myopia was inferred by reason of an increase in size of the lens." .

The control group consisted of lenses from young men dying from accidents and serving as corneal donors (n = 10, not more than one hour after death). Lenses from patients (aged 60–70 years) undergoing surgery for cortical (n = 20) and nuclear (n = 20) cataracts were studied. The investigations demonstrated plasticity in the phenotype of lens cells in age-related cataract. Changes in the phenotype of lens cells were found to depend on the type of age-related cataract. Development of the cortical variant of age-related cataract was associated with positive reactions with monoclonal antibodies to neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, and vimentin only within the lens cortex. Formation of age-related nuclear cataract was associated with positive reactions with antibodies to α-smooth muscle actin and pancytokeratin, which were detected only in the lens nucleus. This provides evidence of the need to develop a differential approach to the treatment of different types of age-related cataract." .

STUDY DESIGN: Evaluation of a new technology. METHODS: 144 participants, consisting of 20 patients about to undergo cataract surgery (Group 1), 18 ophthalmologists and ophthalmic registered nurses (Group 2), 18 medical interns (Group 3), and 88 lay-persons (group 4) were shown varying interactive computer animations from the 3D-Eye-Office™ (Eyemaginations™) software package which lasted between 4 minutes (Group 1) and 2 hours (Group 2). These videos explained the physiology and the anatomy of the human visual system, as well as the patho-physiology of myopia, hyperopia, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, retinal detachment, retinal tears, and glaucoma. They also explained in depth the ophthalmic surgical procedures relating to these diseases and the possible risks and complications. After the participants had viewed the videos, they were asked to fill out questionnaires relating to the quality and usefulness of the videos. RESULTS: 144 participants were asked to answer a total of 1254 questions about a total of 9 ophthalmic subjects taught to them using the 3D-Eye Office™ patient education system. The results of the questionnaires showed overwhelming approval of the quality of the videos from all participant groups. If the results from Groups 1 and 4 are added together and expressed as a percentage, the average approval rating for the videos from patients is 92.7%. If the results from Groups 2 and 3 are added together and expressed as a percentage, the average approval rating for the videos from medical professionals is 88.9%. CONCLUSION: The 3D-Eye Office™ system is a clear and concise method of educating patients about complex subjects in ophthalmology. However, the system should not be used as a replacement for the standard informed consent process, but rather as a precursor to it. This may help to streamline the informed consent process. The 3D-Eye Office™ system could also be very useful in the education of student nurses and non-ophthalmic medical professionals. These points need to be verified in a larger multi center study." .

Here we report the case of a patient with ciliary body ring melanoma who developed lymph node metastases after a fistulating glaucoma operation. A 40-year-old female Caucasian patient presented with unilateral pigment dispersion. Pigment dispersion glaucoma was diagnosed and since the intraocular pressure could not be managed with topical medication, transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and two trabeculectomies had to be performed. Due to enlargement of the pigmented iris mass and cell deposits in the chamber angle, a ciliary body ring melanoma was presumed and the eye enucleated. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of “ciliary body ring melanoma”. Six months after enucleation the patient presented multiple metastases including ipsilateral preauricular and submandibular lymph node metastases. The patient died two months later. Lymph node metastases arising from ciliary body melanomas are very rare. Tumor seeding through the trabeculectomy site into the bleb and then via conjunctival lymphatic vessels might be the crucial factor for this pathway of metastases. Therefore, in cases of unilateral pigment dispersion, malignancy should be excluded before fistulating operations are performed." .

F-actin is localized (1) in the rhabdomeres, (2) in the Semper cells, (3) in the basement membrane, and (4) associated with desmosomes and membranes.

The MEMS retinal tack presented in this paper has barbs, which are intended for the fixation of the epiretinal-type retina-stimulating microelectrode array. Although conventional retinal tacks made of titanium are available, they are expensive, invasive, and restricted in shape. The silicon retinal tack is fabricated using silicon micromachining, and the PMMA retinal tack is fabricated by X-ray lithography for accurate micro-patterning, which is very scalable and is suitable for inexpensive and repeatable mass production. In this paper, long-term in vivo biocompatibility evaluation of silicon and PMMA retinal tacks is presented. The MEMS retina tack is implanted with epiretinal microelectrodes onto the retinal surface of the rabbit eye and harvested after 1 year for the silicon retinal tack and 6 months for the PMMA retinal tack. Through histological examination, no inflammatory infiltrates in retina, choroid, nor sclera are revealed. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show no chemical reaction trace nor mechanical fracture of the implanted device. The results indicate that both silicon and PMMA retinal tacks are suitable for mechanical fixation of microelectrode arrays. Also, the long-term evaluation of the durability in vivo shows acceptable biocompatibility for further use in retinal prostheses." .

Those few genera which lack parietal eyes in the families where the very great majority have parietal eyes are confined to ranges rather close to the equator. The parietal eye may be important in thermoregulatory or reproductive adaptations at higher latitudes where seasons are more severely varied than at lower latitudes. A pineal body is reported to be absent in crocodilians, edentates and, perhaps, dugongs. All these animals tend to inhabit tropical regions. In contrast, seals and walruses have remarkably large pineal glands and are found at very high latitudes. These few fragments of information cannot be used to support any conclusions, but they do suggest that it might be productive to consider the pineal complexes of animals in the context of their geographical distribution." .

The Nd-YAG laser beam was focused on the detached posterior hyaloid in front of the macular region. Some holes were made in this membrane or in the adjacent collapsed vitreous cortex. Treatment increased the visual acuity in the three eyes; the vitreous remained partially detached in the two eyes with idiopathic PMF and detached completely in the eye with the secondary PMF.

The latter is composed of three distinct cell types. The guanophores, located between cuticular cones, contain guanine as a reflecting pigment. The distal pigment cells, which clothe the sides of the cuticular cones and form a sheath around the underlying ommatidium, contain massive bundles of microtubules, abundant pigment droplets and a large Golgi system. The cone cells are positioned between the flattened tip of the cuticular cone and the apex of the ommatidium. They serve to anchor the retinula cells to the cuticle and, by virtue of long processes along the periphery of the rhabdome, perform a glial function with respect to the interaction of adjacent retinula cells. The geometry and fine structure of the dioptric apparatus provide supporting evidence for the wide angle of acceptance and lack of polarized light perception by the ommatidia." .

Plasminogen kringle 5 is an endogenous angiogenic inhibitor. The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential application of kringle 5 in the treatment of retinal neovascularization. Methods. Plasminogen kringle 5 was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. Its anti-angiogenic activity was determined in cultured primary human capillary endothelial cells. Retinal neovascularization was induced in newborn rats by exposure to hyperoxia and then normoxia. Kringle 5 was intravitreally injected into the rat model. Retinal neovascularization was visualized by fluorescein angiography on flat-mounted retina and quantified by counting preretinal vascular cells. Results. Plasminogen kringle 5 inhibited primary endothelial cells but not retinal neuronal cells, suggesting cell type-specific inhibition. The oxygen-induced retinopathy rat model showed an over-expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, preretinal neovascularization and haemorrhage. Intravitreal injection of kringle 5 before the development of neovascularization resulted in fewer neovascular tufts and pre-retinal vascular cells than in control rats with PBS injection (p < 0.01). Moreover, injection of kringle 5 after the development of neovascularization inhibited the increase in the preretinal vascular cells (p < 0.05). These results suggest that kringle 5 both prevents the development and arrests the progression of retinal neovascularization. The injection of kringle 5 did not result in any detectable inflammatory response in the retina or histological toxicity to retina neurons and pre-existing vessels. Conclusion/interpretation. These observations suggest that intravitreal delivery of angiogenic inhibitors could have therapeutic benefits in neovascular diseases of the retina. [Diabetologia (2001) 44: 757–765]" .

Lens alpha-crystallin, composed of two subunits alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin, forms large aggregates in the lens of the eye. The present study investigated the aggregate of human lens alpha-crystallin from elderly and young donors. Recombinant alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins in molar ratios of alpha A to alpha B at 1:1, corresponding to the aged sample, were also studied in detail. We found by ultra-centrifugation analysis that the alpha-crystallin aggregate from elderly donors was large and heterogeneous with an average sedimentation coefficient of 30 S and a range of 20–60 S at 37 °C. This was higher compared to the young samples that had an average sedimentation coefficient of 17 S. The sedimentation coefficients of recombinant alpha A- and alpha B-crystallins were approximately 12 S and 15 S, respectively. Even when recombinant alpha-crystallins were mixed in molar ratios equivalent to those found in vivo, similar S values as the native aged alpha-crystallin aggregates were not obtained. Changes in the self-association of alpha-crystallin aggregate were correlated to changes in chaperone activity. Alpha-crystallin from young donors, and recombinant alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin and their mixtures showed chaperone activity, which was markedly lost in samples from the aged alpha-crystallin aggregates." .

Variations in the size of the rhabdomes and corneal facets, as well as the size and extent of the accessory reflecting pigment cells, have been found. It was determined that the mean rhabdome diameter within a 70° arc in the dorsal quadrant of the retina is 11–19% smaller than the mean rhabdome diameter in the remaining areas of the eye. Also, the extent of the accessory reflecting pigment cells is diminished over an area corresponding generally to the dorsal region of smaller rhabdomes. Corneal facet size and shape vary over the surface of the cornea, with smaller facets occurring in the dorsal region. Both the mean rhabdome diameter and the mean corneal facet area for whole eyes increases linearly in animals ranging in size from 3.9–12 cm. The estimated number of corneal facets, and therefore the number of rhabdomes, increases from an average of 4700 in the 3–6.9 cm size range to about 6000 in 7–12 cm animals. These data indicate that structural asymmetries and various size-related parameters exist in the crayfish eye and should be considered in any quantitative analysis of this structure." .

Material and methodSix hundred fourteen eyes of 307 subjects with no history of ocular diseases and normal ophthalmic examination were recruited in this cross-sectional, prospective study. The participants were divided into three groups based on age (between 20 and 29 years: group 1, between 30 and 39 years: group 2, between 40 and 49 years: group 3). All subjects were scanned with spectral OCT/SLO, performed by one examiner to acquire the retinal thickness map in the ETDRS grid, and values were recorded for nine sectors, and effects of age and gender were evaluated. ResultsWhen all the subjects were evaluated, the thicknesses were lower in women than men in all sectors (p < 0.001). When divided in groups based on age, this difference remained only in the outer segments. However, the differences in outer layers, except outer nasal layer, were thicker in women in group 3 when compared to others in group 3. When compared between groups, only central thickness in group 3 was shown to be higher than group 1 (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference of thicknesses in any sector when compared right and left eyes of all subjects. ConclusionsThe study reports the variation in retinal thickness between age and gender in a relatively large sample of a Turkish population. It is important to consider these effects while interpreting the OCT images to make an appropriate diagnosis in retinal diseases." .

We evaluated the effects of U18666A on the sterol composition, de novo sterol synthesis, and histological structure of the retina. Neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were injected subcutaneously with U18666A (15 mg/kg, in olive oil) every other day from birth through 3 wk of age; in parallel, control rats received olive oil alone. At 21 d, treated and control groups each were subdivided into two groups: one group of each was injected intravitreally with [3H]acetate; retinas were removed 20 h later and non-saponifiable lipids (NSL) were analyzed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. The other group was injected intravitreally with [3H]leucine; 4 d later, one eye of each animal was evaluated by light and electron microscopy and light microscopic autoradiography, while contralateral retinas and rod outer segment (ROS) membranes prepared thereform were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/fluorography. In the treated group, the Δ5/Δ5,24 mole ratio of retinas was ca. 1.0, and >88% of the NSL radioactivity was in Δ5,24; in contrast, control retinas had Δ5/Δ5,24 >170, with >80% of the NSL radioactivity in Δ5. Retinal histology, ultrastructure, ROS renewal rates, and rhodopsin synthesis and intracellular trafficking were comparable in both treated and control animals.

One interesting combination is to provide the master of a Fresnel lens (microstructure) with a moth-eye anti-reflective layer (nanostructure) (Wilson and Hutley in Opt Acta 29(7):993–1009 1982). Then in replication processes both the Fresnel lens and the anti-reflective layer are replicated in one process step. For example Fresnel lenses can be found in overhead projectors. It is state of the art to endow the planar backside of such a Fresnel lens with an anti-reflective layer. For the front side one would have to put the moth-eye nanostructure onto the Fresnel microstructure. But how to generate the combination of micro- and nanostructures, especially on such a large area? Interference lithography is suited very well for the generation of nanostructures on large areas. It provides a great depth of focus and can be used to generate surface relief nanostructures on already (pre-)microstructured surfaces. Unfortunately, by using conventional interference lithography processes for this purpose several negative effects during lithography prevent a successful exposure. In addition to that spin coating of photo resist on non-planar surfaces results in uneven resist thicknesses throughout the substrate. We have developed a novel, easy process that overcomes all the disadvantages mentioned above and furthermore the process works with almost arbitrary and varying resist thicknesses throughout the substrate. By using this novel process we were able to combine a moth-eye nanostructure with a Fresnel microstructure." .

Very noticeable are extensive projections to most of the dorsal thalamus, to all layers of the optic tectum, and into the periaqueductal gray of the torus semicircularis. The salmon smolt has bilateral retinal projections to the diencephalon and pretectum. A small retinal projection to the lateral habenular nucleus has not been described previously. Although these findings suggest striking differences in retinal projections among teleosts, this variation may relate to age differences since the previously studied teleosts were adults." .

The contralateral fibres projected to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the nucleus opticus dorsolateralis, the nucleus of the posterior commissure, the nucleus geniculatus lateralis, pretectal nuclear complex, and to two layers of the optic tectum, i.e., stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale and stratum griseum centrale. The accessory optic tract arose from the inner area of the optic tract and extended ventromedially to the accessory optic nucleus. The ipsilateral fascicles projected to almost all the above mentioned nuclei, but these projections were comparatively sparse. The ipsilateral retinal projection was restricted to the rostral tectum." .

The available data strongly indicate that TGF-β2 is a key player contributing to the structural changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the trabecular meshwork and optic nerve head as characteristically seen in POAG. The changes involve an induction in the expression of various ECM molecules and are remarkably similar in trabecular meshwork cells and optic nerve head astrocytes. The ECM changes in the trabecular meshwork most probably play a role in the increase of aqueous humor outflow resistance causing higher intraocular pressure (IOP). In the optic nerve head, TGF-β2-induced changes might contribute to deformation of the optic nerve axons causing impairment of axonal transport and neurotrophic supply and leading to their continuous degeneration. The increase in IOP further adds mechanical stress and strain to optic nerve axons and accelerates degenerative changes. In addition, high IOP might induce the expression of activated TGF-β1 in trabecular meshwork cells and optic nerve head astrocytes; this again might significantly lead to the progress of axonal degeneration. The action of TGF-β2 in POAG is largely mediated through the connective tissue growth factor, whereas the activities of TGF-β1 and -β2 are modulated by the blocking effects of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) and BMP-7, by gremlin that inhibits BMP signaling and by several species of microRNAs." .

In the whole group, while exudates, retinitis proliferans and visual acuity did not improve, haemorrhages and microaneurysms, new vessels and venous irregularities had improved after 1 year, and these continued improving up to the latest assessment. — 4. On comparing the outcome at either 1 year or the final assessment, the effects of “maximal” or “intermediate” pituitary ablation appeared equivalent, but clearly superior to “slight” ablation. In particular, haemorrhages and microaneurysms showed equal improvement postimplant in all three ablation categories. New vessels improved in the “maximal” and “intermediate” ablation categories equally, but not in the “slight” category. Venous irregularities improved discernibly only after “maximal” ablation. Retinitis proliferans deteriorated in all three ablation categories, although “maximal” was more effective than “slight” in preventing new lesions.

Binocular adjustments to the visual vertical during body tilt were influenced by the point separation (Exp. 1), but monocular adjustments with the head upright were not (Exp. 2). Using the larger point separation and fixating the top point the visual vertical using the right eye was counterclockwise of that with fixation of the bottom point when the head was upright (Exp. 3), but this difference was not found for judgments during tilt (Exp. 4). The results were discussed in terms of the rotational changes in eye position accompanying scanning eye movements and ocular elevation and depression." .

Methods: The effect of diclofenac/HA on angiogenesis was determined by choriocapillary endothelial cells on Matrigel stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The tube areas were quantified by image digital analysis. For toxicity study, diclofenac/HA was injected intravitreally with a dose range from 100 to 1080 µg in 26 rabbits following gas compression vitrectomy. Potential toxicity was assessed by indirect ophthalmoscopy and by histological studies (light and electron microscopy). Retinal function was monitored by electroretinography (ERG) in six rabbits that received 400 µg of diclofenac/HA. Results: Diclofenac/HA, 180, 90 µg/ml, inhibited tube formation to 24% and 55% of the standard group (Media Ham’s F12 plus 5% fetal calf serum and 50 ng/ml VEGF) respectively (P<0.01). Intravitreal injection of 540 µg or higher doses of diclofenac/HA resulted in ocular toxicity in the rabbit, demonstrated as cataract, vitreous haze and retinal damage observed by indirect ophthalmoscopy and light- and electron- microscopic examinations. No toxicity was observed in the eyes that received 400 µg or less diclofenac/HA, which was further supported by the normal ERG examined at 4 and 25 days post injection. Conclusions: Diclofenac/HA inhibits tube formation in vitro and is nontoxic to the rabbit retina at concentrations that are inhibitory to tube formation. Our results suggest diclofenac/HA may be an effective candidate to inhibit ocular neovascularisation related to granulomatous reaction in the eye." .

The major signs of ophthalmic toxicity of DZN have been reported to be cholinergic overstimulation (lacrimation, myosis). Here, we report, for the first time, ulcerative keratitis in C57bl/6 mice secondary to sub-acute exposure to DZN. Four groups of female C57bl/6 mice were administered intraperitoneally either DZN (1, 5, 25 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 14 consecutive days. Then, histopathological examinations on mice eyes were performed using light microscope and scored for corneal keratitis. Furthermore, blood cholinesterase activity, and hematologic examinations were performed. Data indicated a significant ulcerative keratitis with prompt vision loss in mice exposed to 25 and 5 mg/kg/day (P < 0.05) doses. These results suggest that diazinon might induce ulcerative keratitis secondary to its immunosuppresive effects at high doses in C57bl/6 mice." .

Two retrospective case studies are presented. FindingsA 40-year-old immunocompetent lady with a history of Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis with secondary glaucoma in the right eye since 2005 was diagnosed to have CMV anterior uveitis by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 2009. She developed a reactivation of anterior uveitis following the addition of latanoprost 0.005% eye drops unknowingly by her local ophthalmologist. The pattern of endothelial deposits seen with this reactivation of uveitis was different from that seen in earlier or in subsequent reactivations. A 46-year-old immunocompetent lady with a history of primary open-angle glaucoma and no history of uveitis presented with anterior uveitis with medium-sized keratic precipitates following administration of travatoprost 0.004% eye drops. In both cases, the CMV antigen was demonstrated in the aqueous by multiplex PCR at the time of reactivation. Both cases required treatment with dexamethasone eye drops, ganciclovir 1% gel and oral valganciclovir for the control of inflammation along with antiglaucoma medications. ConclusionsWe report two immunocompetent cases with the development of CMV-related anterior uveitis following administration with prostaglandin analogues. These cases increase the awareness of CMV anterior uveitis in immunocompetent individuals and the need to use prostaglandin analogues with caution." .

Methods: Lewis rats underwent laser keratectomy using a 193-nm excimer laser. The central corneas were ablated in three depths: group A, epithelium; group B, superficial stroma; group C, deep stroma. Eyes were collected at 1, 12, 24, and 36 h and 1 week. Cellular markers associated with apoptosis – Fas, Fas ligand (FasL), Bcl-2, and Bax – were examined by immunohistochemistry. Keratocyte depletion and endothelial changes were evaluated histologically. In situ end labeling of double-stranded DNA breaks was used to demonstrate apoptosis in corneal sections. Results: Keratocyte depletion was observed in 6 (50%) of 12 rats (total from groups A, B, and C) at 12 h, 11 (73%) of 15 at 24 h, 3 (20%) of 15 at 36 h, and 2 (15%) of 13 at 1 week after laser surgery. Corneal endothelial edema was observed in the ablation zone. Expression of Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, and Bax in corneal cells showed dynamics similar to that of keratocyte depletion and endothelial changes. There was less expression of apoptotic molecules in newly generated epithelial cells and more in endothelial cells of the stromal ablation groups. Conclusions: Excimer laser keratectomy triggered apoptosis of corneal keratocytes and endothelial cells. More endothelial edema was observed in the stromal ablation than in the epithelial ablation group. The expression of apoptotic molecules coincided with the period of keratocyte depletion and regeneration and of endothelial recovery, suggesting that apoptosis is a dynamic part of corneal wound healing and remodeling after excimer laser keratectomy." .

However, information on their specific role in cystic macular edema remains sparse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anti-TNF-α agents for the treatment of uveitis-related refractory cystoid macular edema. MethodsThe files of 23 consecutive patients treated for cystoid macular edema at the uveitis services of two tertiary medical centers in 2006-2011 were reviewed for demographic data, visual acuity, and optical coherence tomography measurements at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Changes in mean visual acuity and macular thickness were analyzed. Findings were compared between patients treated with a conventional immunosuppressive regimen only (n = 18, 27 eyes) and patients treated with an anti-TNF-α agent after proving refractory to conventional treatment (n = 9, 15 eyes). ResultsMean duration of cystoid macular edema before initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy was 12 ± 8 months. The two groups had similar baseline values of mean central macular thickness and visual acuity. Significant improvement in macular thickness was noted at 3 months in both groups, with a maximal effect at 6 months for the anti-TNF-α group (p = 0.002). Maximal improvement in visual acuity was achieved at 3 months in both groups, with a reduced effect towards 12 months. Mean visual acuity at 12 months was similar in both groups. ConclusionsAnti-TNF-α agents may serve as an effective lasting treatment for long-standing refractory uveitis-related cystoid macular edema. Their role as first-line therapy in this setting warrants further investigation." .

We examined RT in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with or without minimal diabetic retinopathy (MDR) to test whether OCT is able to identify early retinal changes and potential correlations with metabolic parameters. RT of 102 patients with T1D (53 females, 49 males, aged 27.03 ± 7.4 years) and of 42 healthy controls was examined, with analysis of nine different sectors (fovea, four pericentral and four peripheral sectors). According to the results of basal fundus photography, patients were divided into two groups, without MDR (48 cases) and with MDR (54 cases). Patients with proliferative DR or macular edema were excluded. No difference was found between patients with or without MDR and the control group for all OCT parameters investigated. Mean HbA1c of the last 5 years (P < 0.001), microalbuminuria (P = 0.002), total (P = 0.046) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.007) and triglyceride (P < 0.001) levels were higher in patients with MDR, along with higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.013), younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.018) and longer diabetes duration (P < 0.001) with regard to the patients without MDR and controls, although no significant correlation between these parameters and RT was found.

The rank of the leakage correlated significantly with the vitreous fluorophotometry values (P < 0.01). The mean fluorophotometry result in the eyes with cystoid macular edema was greater than that in the phakic, control group (P < 0.01). However, eyes with minimal or no leakage visible on fluorescein angiography had fluorophotometry values indistinguishable from normal. The quantitative vitreous fluorophotometry results provided an indicator of cystoid macular edema that may prove useful in following this problem and evaluating therapy for it." .

Electroencephalographic findings and clinical signs were correlated to the levels of interferon α in cerebrospinal fluid. Analysis of exploratory eye movements revealed marked decreases in the number of eye fixations, mean eye-scanning length and total eye-scanning length.

Arising from the scleral collagen fibrils branches joined together to form thick bundles of collagen in lamina plates encompassing hundreds of pores. More than ten plates were observed stacked on top of each other forming the pore channels. Adjacent piled up plates were interconnected with branching collagen fibrils. Septal plates derived from pia mater collagen fibrils were formed by radially and obliquely arranged thick bundles of collagen piled up longitudinally in the optic nerve and merging into the most posterior lamina plate. In the septal plates many ovally shaped windows were observed, suggesting branching and regional irregularity in the shape of the myelinated nerve fiber bundle. Pia mater and dura mater collagen fibrils of the optic nerve merged into the outer layer of the scleral collagen fibris.

Each eye is composed of pigmented, rhabdomeric, and ciliated cells. The pigmented cells contain many electron-dense granules and form a cup that shades the sensory cells from all light except that entering from a dorsal-anterior direction. The rhabdomeric cells are similar to the photosensory cells described for other gastropods. They contain photic vesicles and are characterized by an array of microvilli that project into the interior of the eyecup. In the ciliated cells, the ciliary membranes are greatly expanded and form whorls that lie at the front of the eye, opposite the pigment cup. Axons from the bases of rhabdomeric cells have been traced into the optic ganglion, whereas nerve connections from the ciliated cells have not been observed. We suggest that both the rhabdomeric and ciliated cells are photosensory based on their morphological similarities to eyes in other invertebrates. The significance of ocelli with two types of sensory cells is discussed with regard to 1) phylogenetic schemes based on photoreceptor morphology, and 2) the function of such eyes in the interstitial habitat. In addition, the structure of the eye in Fartulum is compared with the description at the light microscopical level of the eye of a related interstitial gastropod." .

Grade 1 hemorrhages were observed in 30 patients (3.0 %) in group A and in 20 patients (2.0 %) in group B. No grade 2, 3, or 4 hemorrhage was encountered. There was no significant difference in the grading of hemorrhage between the groups (p = 0.017). Clopidogrel was not associated with a significant increase in potentially sight-threatening local anesthetic complications." .

This animal is closely related to the SJL/J mouse, which is homozygous for retinal degeneration (rd) and which also suffers from extraocular reticulum cell sarcomas at around 200 days of age. In the SJL/N animal, a high incidence of subretinal tumor is present at 9 days after birth. Furthermore, we have observed an extensive neuroretinal hyperplasia, a phenomenon that is termed “hyperplastic neuroretinopathy”, and that is probably the consequence of elevated levels of cytokines in the animals. In addition to these anomalies, the SJL/N mouse shows progressive dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from day 4 onwards, and accelerated photoreceptor cell degeneration is completed by day 16. The early RPE dystrophy appears to be a secondary autoimmune disease, since cells in this structure and in the choroid develop MHC class II antigens, whereas we suspect that the accelerated photoreceptor cell loss is induced by a soluble toxic agent. The F1 progeny derived from cross-breeding the SJL/N and Balb/c +/+ strains also shows a high incidence of subretinal tumor and hyperplastic neuroretinopathy, but neither the RPE dystrophy nor retinal degeneration." .

It has been noted that the centrioles of ganglion cells show clavate extensions similar to those seen in the basal bodies of photoreceptors and that these appear to give rise to the neurotubules. The neurotubules thus are shown to originate from the same organelle and have the same morphology as the spindle tubules in the mitotic cell, although the mode of origin is quite different.

The effect of the carotenoids on retinal function and morphology was tested against a control group in the course of 11 months. Electroretinography showed that in contrast to the control animals, β-carotene-treated rabbits produced increasing peak latencies of the scotopicb-waves. In the canthaxanthin-treated rabbits,a- andb-waves showed hypernormal amplitudes at low cumulative dosages (approximately 0.5–2 g) and reduced amplitudes at higher dosages (about 5 g). The peak latencies of the scotopica- andb-waves increased remarkably. This effect was still stronger in the carotenoid combination. Histology and electron microscopy indicated that in contrast to the control animals, canthaxanthin-treated rabbits showed a reduction in retinal thickness in some samples. In particular, they exhibited alterations in the granular layers and a marked diminuation of the photoreceptor outer segments and morphological alterations of the photoreceptor inner segments with massive deposition of electron-dense material.

Several studies have demonstrated that the exposure to a particular stress factor, such as UV-light, is able to modify the quality and the quantity of polyphenols produced by A. platensis. In this study, we compare the effects of polyphenol extracts from A. platensis (PEAP) and from UV-stressed A. platensis (PEAPUV) on endothelial cells exposed to TNFα by evaluating the expression of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and key markers of endothelial dysfunction. MMP-9 activity was measured by gel zymography. Western Blot analysis was performed to analyze eNOS, iNOS and VCAM-1 expression and signal transduction. The major evidence of this study is that PEAPUV is more efficient than PEAP in counteracting the TNFα-induced endothelial activation. Treatment with PEAPUV (0.10 mgGAE/ml) restored to basal levels the TNFα-induced expression of eNOS, iNOS, VCAM-1 and MMP-9 and the TNFα- triggered activation of Akt. The use of an Akt inhibitor mimicked the inhibitory effects of PEAPUV on eNOS and MMP-9 expression, suggesting that eNOS and MMP-9 induction by TNFα depends on Akt activation and that PEAPUV exerts its vaso-protective effect through Akt signalling inhibition. HPLC analysis confirmed a different composition both in polyphenols’ quality and in quantity of the two extracts. In conclusion, this study shows that a stress factor such as UV-light exposure leads to the production by A. platensis of molecules to potentially be used against the onset and progression of vascular diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction." .

Studies of the retina have been facilitated by improvements in imaging techniques. In vitro techniques such as immunohistochemistry and in vivo imaging using transgenic zebrafish have been proven useful for visualizing specific subtypes of retinal cells. In contrast, in vivo imaging using organic fluorescent molecules such as fluorescent sphingolipids allows non-invasive staining and visualization of retinal cells en masse. However, these fluorescent molecules also localize to the interstitial fluid and stain whole larvae. ResultsWe screened fluorescent coumarin derivatives that might preferentially stain neuronal cells including retinal cells. We identified four coumarin derivatives that could be used for in vivo imaging of zebrafish retinal cells. The retinas of living zebrafish could be stained by simply immersing larvae in water containing 1 μg/ml of a coumarin derivative for 30 min. By using confocal laser scanning microscopy, the lamination of the zebrafish retina was clearly visualized. Using these coumarin derivatives, we were able to assess the development of the zebrafish retina and the morphological abnormalities induced by genetic or chemical interventions. The coumarin derivatives were also suitable for counter-staining of transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorescent proteins in specific subtypes of retinal cells. ConclusionsThe coumarin derivatives identified in this study can stain zebrafish retinal cells in a relatively short time and at low concentrations, making them suitable for in vivo imaging of the zebrafish retina. Therefore, they will be useful tools in genetic and chemical screenings using zebrafish to identify genes and chemicals that may have crucial functions in the retina." .

The purpose of the study is to evaluate retinal haemodynamics by fluorescein angiography and to correlate arteriovenous passage times (AVP) with ocular perfusion pressure in patients with NTG and controls. MethodsThirty-five patients with NTG without any topical treatment (mean age 53 ± 11 years) and 35 age-matched controls (mean age 53 ± 11 years) were included in this study. Retinal AVP was assessed by video fluorescein angiography using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (Rodenstock, Germany). Dye dilution curves of temporal superior and inferior arterioles and venules were evaluated by digital image analysis. AVP was correlated to mean arterial blood pressure and ocular perfusion pressure. ResultsThe AVP was significantly prolonged in patients with NTG compared to controls (1.82 ± 0.57 versus 1.42 ± 0.46, p = 0.002). Patients with NTG and controls showed no significant differences in intraocular pressure, mean arterial pressure and mean and diastolic ocular perfusion pressure. The AVP was significantly correlated to mean arterial pressure and mean and diastolic ocular perfusion pressure in patients with NTG (r = −0.54; p = 0.0006, r = −0.51; p = 0.002, r = −0.49, p = 0.002), but not in controls (r = −0.21; p = 0.23, r = −0.19; p = 0.27, r = 0.02, p = 0.93).

Repair of such damage by cell transplantation is one of the most feasible types of central nervous system treatment. Retinal stem cells (RSC) are a substrate for cell-replacement therapy, and previous studies have shown that RSCs from different developmental stages have distinct properties in proliferative capacity and differentiation potential. The tailbud stage is of special interest in retinogenesis, because RSCs commence differentiation after this period. However, no information about the characteristics of RSCs from the tailbud stage is available. In this study, the characteristics of cell cultures from the rat optic cup (referred to as optic-cup-derived RSCs; OC-RSCs) at embryonic day 12.5 (tailbud stage) were analyzed. OC-RSCs grew either as monolayers or as neurospheres in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor and could be dissociated into a single cell suspension. Using the MTT assay, immunochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, and flow cytometry, we found that OC-RSCs were easily enriched to 92% by three passages, had a normal diploid karyotype, and exhibited no obvious differences in proliferative rate during eight passages (doubling time: 36 h). OC-RSCs produced retinal specific cells after the addition of serum to the medium, but the differentiation potential was affected by serum concentration. Preliminary results showed that transplanted OC-RSCs were incorporated into the degenerated retina of RCS rats and differentiated into rhodopsin-positive cells. Thus, OC-RSCs, after suitable enrichment, provide a population of stem cells with distinct growth and differentiation properties that make them suitable for research into RSC differentiation and transplantation." .

This study attempts to correlate pathological changes in the retina and intraorbital portion of optic nerve in four drug naïve patients of AIDS caused by HIV-1 clade C, who had abnormalities in the visual evoked potentials recorded antemortem. Three had no visual complaints and one patient had sudden loss of vision in the right eye. In all four patients, the visual evoked potentials disclosed variable prolongation of P100 latencies. Histologically axonal cytoskeletal breakdown and depletion in the optic nerves was the cardinal finding with variable myelin loss, even in the absence of overt visual dysfunction, or infective retinitis. The axonal loss was maximal in the symptomatic case. Retinal ganglion cell depletion was seen in only two patients. Sectoral infiltration of the optic nerve by cryptococci and Cryptococcal choroiditis was the only opportunistic infection to involve the eye. Axonal pathology in the optic nerve appears to be related to the abnormalities recorded in visual evoked potentials even in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. Opportunistic infections could be contributing to the axonal pathology in the optic nerve in patients with AIDS." .

In most reported cases of this rare disease no other vascular malformations or associated systemic diseases have been found. It can be complicated by retinal hemorrhages after minor stress or trauma, but prognosis is usually excellent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To assess function of retinal vessels in this disorder we performed a complete ophthalmological examination including fluorescein and indocyanin green angiography in a patient with fRAT. For static and dynamic retinal vessel analysis we used the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer both in the patient with fRAT and in an age-matched control group of 10 healthy male subjects. RESULTS: Ophthalmologic examination showed an extremely corkscrew-shaped tortuosity of small second- and third-order arterioles on both eyes and a small preretinal hemorrhage in the left eye. In the patient with fRAT, the arteriolar-to-venular ratio was similar to that of the control group and flicker-induced change of vessel diameter did not differ from the controls in both retinal arterioles and venules. CONCLUSIONS: Results from retinal vessel analysis suggest that patients with fRAT have normal endothelial function and regulation of vessel diameter." .

Despite wide clinical use little is known about its damaging effects on the ocular tissues particularly on the corneal endothelium. To evaluate the pathologic changes caused by high powered Nd:YAG laser pulses on the anterior segment of the eye we focused the beam of this laser on the anterior lens capsule in rabbit eyes. Six eyes underwent anterior capsulotomy and three power settings were used (3.4 mJ, 5.8 mJ, 8.6 mJ). The fellow eyes served as controls. We studied acute corneal endothelial changes 6 hours after the capsulotomy using transmission electron microscopy. Results indicate that especially in the high setting the laser energy can cause injury and destruction of endothelial cells and alterations in the Descement membrane. These effects may be crucial of patients with corneas in critical cell number after a cataract surgery." .

Rubbing of the posterior cerebral arteries against the tentorial edges during trauma instead of traction was believed to cause blindness in one patient and embolization due to hammering bone grafts home during cervical spinal fusion, in the other. Pattern reversal visual evoked responses (PRVERs) were absent during blindness; upon recovery P 100 with full amplitude and normal latency appeared despite the presence of tunnel vision. These are consistent with the fact that the central 8–10 degrees of visual field represented in the posterior occipital poles being the main sources of P 100 in association with the x-cells in the centre of the retina." .

This species possesses multiple central targets in the contralateral preoptic, diencephalic, pretectal, periventricular and tectal regions of the brain. In addition, a greater subdivision of the marginal optic tract is found to project to various nuclei. Ipsilateral projections are found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and in the region of the horizontal commissure. Projections are also found in the telencephalic region of the nucleus olfactoretinalis and the thalamic region of the nucleus thalamoretinalis.

The study was designed as a prospective randomized, controlled double-blind Multicentre Study. METHODS: A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 29 eyes of 29 patients. In case a natural lens was present simultaneous phacoemulsification was obligatory. The control group received standard therapy vitreous tamponade with pure 5000centistoke silicone oil while the silicone oil was suspended with AS to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the study group. After 6 months follow up the tamponade was removed in all eyes. RESULTS: The safety of AS SiO could be demonstrated: the AS SiO was well tolerated and stayed clear during the study period of 6 months. The clinical examination revealed no signs of local or systemic adverse effects in the study eyes. The visual acuities were well matched before inclusion into the study and there was no evidence of significant differences during the follow up period and in final visual outcome between the two groups.

When subjects were instructed to adjust the viewing distance so that all parts of the grating appeared clear, the smaller gratings were visible at greater distances. However, when subjects were asked to adjust the distance so that they could identify the orientation of the grating, stimulus area had little effect on acuity. The apparent loss of acuity for larger test patterns that was found when the first criterion was used resembles the loss of acuity in the parafoveal retina, and therefore is probably a result of requiring the subject to use peripheral regions of his retina, rather than a consequence of the phenomenal spreading of the lines in small gratings." .

To improve and accelerate the training of the student, we developed aVirtual Ophthalmoscopic Examination, a three-dimensional real-time computer simulation of the ophthalmoscopic procedure using virtual reality techniques. By navigating and manipulating the virtual ophthalmoscope in the simulation environment, the student learns how to position the instrument properly. Unlike other training aids that use photographic slides to show the full retina, theVirtual Opthalmoscopic Examination programme simulates an accurate view of the retina. By increasing the realism of the training, the transition from the training programme to live examination of patients will become less difficult. The programme was evaluated by graduate nursing students and was shown to be a promising training aid." .

Depending on the sector of the compound eye, the facets are either rectangular or hexagonal. The underside of each facet has indentations exactly aligned with those on top into which inserts an angulated sleeve of LPC's. Under the rectangular lens facet 6 or 8 small compact (in cross section) LPC's join four elongate LPC's. Clusters of compact cells alternate in this ring with elongate ones. Compact cells compress together and become quadrangular (in cross section) several microns below their insertion into the lens and form “building block” corners while elongate cells form “side rails” for the rectangular type of distal pseudocone enclosure. Beneath hexagonal facets all LPC's are rather elongate with out corner cells. In both facet types LPC's enclose the pseudocone for a longitudinal distance of 4 μm and then are displaced as bordering cells by a sleeve of two corneal pigment cells (CPC's), each of which encloses half of the proximal pseudocone. For the following 6 μm of longitudinal distance these concentric sleeves of CPC's and LPC's form a double layer around the pseudocone. At about 10 μm below lens base the two sleeves separate; LPC's become attenuated and extend cable-like to the basement membrane and CPC's enclose the proximal pseudocone, Semper cells and distal retinula. The junction between lens and LPC's has critical structural value in that (1) this is the sole anchorage to the lens by the lengthy remainder of the ommatidium, and (2) LPC's enclose the semiliquid pseudocone in the most distal portion of the pseudocone. In addition to vertical support, the LPC's send out numerous lateral processes that make structural contact among themselves, with the corneal pigment cells and the photoreceptor cells. The structural features of this array are discussed relative to possible physiological roles." .

T lymphocytes appear to play an important pathogenic role in uveitis, and these cells are therefore the logical target of drug therapy. Corticosteroids act nonspecifically, but are highly effective in controlling the inflammation rapidly. They are administered locally when disease is confined to the anterior portion of the eye. However, posterior eye involvement often requires systemic corticosteroid therapy, carrying a high risk of serious adverse effects when used for extended periods. In this situation, steroid-sparing agents are used. Few relevant randomised, controlled clinical trials have been performed, and the choice of systemic immunosuppressive regimen is usually guided by individual patient characteristics, cost, drug availability and physician preference. Patients should actively participate in therapeutic decision-making. Our first choice for steroid-sparing medication is often methotrexate, an anti-metabolite which carries a low risk of adverse reactions when appropriately prescribed and monitored, is relatively inexpensive, and has once-weekly ease of use. For more severe uveitis, we may combine the immunomodulating agent cyclosporin with methotrexate and a corticosteroid. Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide are other treatment options. Steroid-sparing drugs also have significant potential for causing adverse effects, albeit less frequently than corticosteroids. Future therapies aim to reduce this problem by increasing the specificity of the therapeutic action." .

This paper presents a novel automatic screening system for diabetic retinopathy that focuses on the detection of the earliest visible signs of retinopathy, which are microaneurysms. Microaneurysms are small dots on the retina, formed by ballooning out of a weak part of the capillary wall. The detection of the microaneurysms at an early stage is vital, and it is the first step in preventing the diabetic retinopathy. The paper first explores the existing systems and applications related to diabetic retinopathy screening, with a focus on the microaneurysm detection methods. The proposed decision support system consists of an automatic acquisition, screening and classification of diabetic retinopathy colour fundus images, which could assist in the detection and management of the diabetic retinopathy. Several feature extraction methods and the circular Hough transform have been employed in the proposed microaneurysm detection system, alongside the fuzzy histogram equalisation method. The latter method has been applied in the preprocessing stage of the diabetic retinopathy eye fundus images and provided improved results for detecting the microaneurysms." .

Thus, the PDA saturates only the peripheral retinula cells, allowing one to isolate and study extracellularly the summed receptor potentials (SR) of the central retinula cells (Fig. 1). The following lines of evidence support these ideas: a)The on and off transients, typical of the normal electroretinogram (ERG), are not present in the SR (Fig. 1).b)The intensity response curve of the intracellularly recorded responses of the peripheral retinula cells fits that of the ERG only after subtraction of the SR contribution from the latter (Fig. 2).c)The SR action spectrum is different from that of the dark adapted ERG and appears to arise from more than one spectral mechanism (Fig. 3)." .

Spatially heterogeneous patterns of intramembranous particles (IMPs) were observed on the E-fracture faces; particle distribution patterns ranged from clusters of 4–7 IMPs to linear arrays of particles 1–3 IMPs wide that apparently encircle the axon. These bands of particles displayed a periodicity of ∼0.16 μm. The present findings demonstrate that, in specialized regions, the axolemma of non-myelinated fibers not in the region of synapses can exhibit distinct spatial heterogeneity." .

Several prototypes, each with three electrodes to capture electrooculogram (EOG), are implemented on earphones and examined. Experiments with one subject over a 10-day period reveal that all prototypes capture EOG similarly but they differ as regards stability of the baseline and the presence of motion artifacts. Another experiment conducted on a simple eye-controlled application with six subjects shows that the proposed prototype minimizes motion artifacts and offers good performance. Artifacts induced by daily motion while wearing the proposed electrode and eye gesture performance are also measured, and we discuss how to deal with them. We conclude that conductive rubber with mixed Ag filler is the most suitable setup in our experiment." .

All the peripheral rhabdomeres contain a pigment with an extinction maximum at 560 nm. This pigment is sensitive to red light up to wavelengths > 700 nm. In a given ommatidium in the dorsal region of the eye, the two central rhabdomeres both contain one of two pigments, either a pigment with an absorption maximum in the UV, at 345 nm, or — in neighboring rhabdoms — a pigment with an absorption maximum at 445 nm. In the ventral part of the eye only the pigment absorbing maximally in the UV was found in the central rhabdomeres. The spectral absorption properties of various types of screening-pigment granules were measured." .

In this study, we investigated the effect of retinal overexpression of human Ang-2 (mOpsinhAng2 mouse) on vascular morphology in non-diabetic and streptozotozin-induced diabetic animals. Pericyte (PC) coverage and acellular capillary (AC) formation were quantitated in retinal digest preparations after 3 and 6 months of diabetes duration. The degree of retinopathy in non-diabetic mOpsinhAng2 mice at 3 months (−21% PC, +49% AC) was comparable to age-matched diabetic wild type mice. Diabetic mOpsinhAng2 mice exhibited significantly worse vascular pathology than wild type counterparts at 6 months. Quantitative PCR revealed that human Ang-2 mRNA was highly overexpressed in retinas of transgenic mice. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of Ang-2 in the retina enhances vascular pathology, indicating that Ang-2 plays an essential role in diabetic vasoregression via destabilization of pericytes." .

Electron microscopic examination of tissue from the macular region of 28 post-mortem eyes has shown that age-related deposits comprise mainly coated membrane-bound (CMB) bodies and their fragments. These bodies appear to be released from the RPE via the basal plasma membrane. Morphometric analysis of the average thickness and distribution of age-related deposits has demonstrated that as the thickness of the deposit increases with age, the major part is contained within the OCZ. The ICZ shows only a minimal increase in thickness during life. These results suggest that in the normal ageing eye the inner layers of Bruch's membrane (RPE basement membrane, ICZ and elastic layer) permit an unimpeded flow of CMB bodies from the RPE through to the OCZ." .
