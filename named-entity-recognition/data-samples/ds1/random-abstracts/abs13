The students’ data from the Gyeonggi Education Panel Study were used in this study for the actual data analysis. The study attempted to adjust for possible selection bias toward either the ASPs or private tutoring by using the inverse probability weight of the propensity score, which was derived from a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model. The results demonstrated that ASPs and private tutoring both contributed to increases in Korean secondary school students’ academic achievement, even after controlling for the selection biases toward both treatments. The magnitude of the effects of participating in ASPs or private tutoring was found to differ by education level; in middle schools, private tutoring showed a higher impact on academic achievement than did ASPs, whereas ASPs had a greater influence on high schools students’ academic achievement than did private tutoring. Moreover, it was also revealed that there was no interaction effect between ASP participation and private tutoring participation in middle schools, but that a negative interaction effect existed in high schools. In addition, the differential effect of region size was calculated in order to examine the effect of ASPs and private tutoring in more depth, and the results demonstrated that the positive effects of ASPs and private tutoring on secondary school students’ academic achievement were only significant in urban areas." .

In 2002 the Australian Government mandated that 25% of commencing Australian medical students be of rural origin. Meeting this target has largely been achieved through reduced standards of entry for rural relative to urban applicants. This initiative is based on the assumption that rural origin students will succeed during training, and return to practice in rural locations. One aim of this study was to determine the relationships between student geographical origin (rural or urban), selection scores, and future practice intentions of medical students at course entry and course exit. Two multicentre databases containing selection and future practice preferences (location and specialisation) were combined (5862), representing 54% of undergraduate medical students commencing from 2006 to 2013 across nine Australian medical schools. A second aim was to determine course performance of rural origin students selected on lower scores than their urban peers. Selection and course performance data for rural (461) and urban (1431) origin students commencing 2006–2014 from one medical school was used. For Aim 1, a third (33.7%) of rural origin students indicated a preference for future rural practice at course exit, and even fewer (6.7%) urban origin students made this preference. Results from logistic regression analyses showed significant independent predictors were rural origin (OR 4.0), lower Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) (OR 2.1), or lower Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test Section 3 (non-verbal reasoning) (OR 1.3). Less than a fifth (17.6%) of rural origin students indicated a preference for future generalist practice at course exit. Significant predictors were female gender (OR 1.7) or lower ATAR (OR 1.2), but not rural origin. Fewer (10.5%) urban origin students indicated a preference for generalist practice at course exit. For Aim 2, results of Mann–Whitney U tests confirmed that slightly reducing selection scores does not result in increased failure, or meaningfully impaired performance during training relative to urban origin students. Our multicentre analysis supports success of the rural origin WP pathway to increase rural student participation in medical training. However, our findings confirm that current selection initiatives are insufficient to address the continuing problem of doctor maldistribution in Australia. We argue for further reform to current medical student selection, which remains largely determined by academic meritocracy. Our findings have relevance to the selection of students into health professions globally." .

The aim was to find out whether the therapeutic attitude of medical students is trainable and whether there is a difference in therapeutic attitude before and after the communication skills training with standardized patients. The participating groups are medical students in their 4th year. The collected parameter is the therapeutic attitude on the basis of the therapeutic attitude questionnaire. The questionnaires are filled out at two different points in time, which are the following: once before and the second time after the communication skills training. The results of this study indicate that therapeutic attitude is trainable. Further studies in the area of communication skills training in medical students are needed to emphasise these results." .

However, valid assessments of teachers’ knowledge and skills are scarce. In this study, we report on our development and validation (following the international Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing) of a situation-based tool to assess pre-service and in-service teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of business and economics in vocational education and training. MethodsWe present a conceptual model and empirical evidence indicating the validity of test content and internal structure of the new developed assessment. We conducted conceptual analyses, interviews and standardized ratings with experts, and piloted the tool with 338 pre-service and in-service teachers. ResultsOur results indicate that our assessment tool is valid and reliable to measure case-related PCK (a central component of situation-oriented knowledge) of pre-service and in-service teachers. ConclusionsA video- and performance-based assessment tool for assessing the strategic component of PCK is developed and currently being validated. Together, these tools can serve to assess the professional knowledge and skills of business and economics teachers." .

From the empirical obtained, it was found that the proposed approach could effectively promote students’ learning achievement, as well as decrease their cognitive load of learning and perceptions of the use of M-IPG learning. It was found from the interviews that most of the participants perceived the M-IPG learning method to be a stimulating though challenging learning task that facilitated them in improving their location-based learning in the aspects of language learning and practice, learning contents recall, and confidence in using the language." .

Little, however, has been published with regard to electronic communication patterns between therapists and their supervisors. The purpose of this study was to understand if and how electronic communication is used between marriage and family therapy (MFT) supervisees and supervisors. To accomplish this, we administered a mixed data survey to MFT supervisors and supervisees across the United States regarding frequency of interaction via electronic methods. We also assessed comfort level with online supervision, how supervisory participants make determinations when to use online supervision, and when online communication is believed to be most appropriate within MFT supervision. We report both qualitative and quantitative findings regarding the use of online technologies in supervision. Implications for research, training, and supervision are discussed." .

Participants were tested on reading, spelling, grammar and punctuation, writing, and numeracy. In each domain, performance across time was highly correlated and this stability in performance was primary due to genes. Key findings on growth showed that reading followed a compensatory growth pattern that was largely due to genetic effects, while variation in growth in the other literacy domains was predominantly due to environmental influences. Genes and the shared environment influenced growth in numeracy for girls, while for boys it was influenced by the shared and unique environment. These results suggest that individual differences in growth of reading are primarily due to a genetically influenced developmental delay in the acquisition of necessary skills, while environmental influences, perhaps including different schools or teachers, are more important for the other domains." .

This case study documents the use of a situated instructional coaching process as a method of faculty professional development. In this model, a geoscience education graduate student (the coach) assisted a faculty member in reforming and teaching an introductory geoscience course on dinosaurs using evidence-based teaching strategies. The revision process occurred in three phases to progressively transfer responsibility for lesson design from the coach to the instructor over the length of the course. Data on instructional practices were collected using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP), and belief changes experienced by the instructor were captured using the Teacher Beliefs Interview (TBI) and Beliefs about Reformed Science Teaching and Learning (BARSTL) survey. ResultsRTOP data confirm that the instructor was successful in teaching the lessons as designed and also gained skills in designing reformed lessons. TBI and BARSTL were indicative of a shift in the instructor's beliefs toward a more student-centered perspective. ConclusionsData collected on instructional practice and teaching beliefs indicate that this model served as an effective method of professional development for the instructor." .

Yet despite the social and scientific importance of issues related to urban development, and the potential to actively engage students in biological topics relevant to their daily lives, few urban ecology courses have been developed and taught at the introductory level. This article describes an introductory nonscience majors’ urban ecology course that was designed and implemented to align with recent reform calls aimed at improving undergraduate biology education. The broader intent of this manuscript is to outline the design process and highlight resources and instructional strategies that may inform the efforts of faculty interested in teaching introductory or advanced urban ecology courses. Information on lecture topics, sample readings, and in-class activities is presented. The course emphasizes active learning and focuses on developing core scientific competencies and higher level thinking skills that encourage students to be inquisitive, analytical, and creative in the learning of ecological concepts. The described course is designed as a traditional 3-credit hour course with no formal laboratory component; however, the content and configuration of the urban ecology course would align well with a dedicated laboratory." .

To answer this question, we carried out a case study research aimed at testing graphic production skills in anatomy of nutrition. The graphics produced by 118 children in the final year of primary education were analysed. The children had to draw a diagram of a human cross section, integrating knowledge of anatomy acquired from longitudinal sections. The results show that they have very limited skills in producing these graphics judging by the dimensions (scale, shape, organs represented and its organization inside the section) and their conception of human anatomy at thoracic level (location of the organs, elements in the spaces between them and connections between organs). The results also indicate that the only exposure to cross-sections in daily life is not enough by itself to draw them correctly, so this type of graphic production should be addressed from the earliest stages of education, since it contributes to the development of visual literacy, and this is a crucial skill when it comes to learning science concepts and developing scientific literacy." .

This study was longitudinal. The data was collected from 1810 students and 90 teachers attending Estonian- and Russian-speaking schools. The students’ were tested twice, at the beginning of the third and at the beginning of the fifth grade. The teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their teaching practices. The results revealed that teachers from Estonian-speaking and Russian-speaking schools’ classrooms differed in their use of teaching practices and teaching experience. Teachers in Russian-speaking schools were slightly more experienced, and they reported using more teacher-centred practices compared to teachers in Estonian-speaking schools. The study showed different effects on the outcomes of the children attending classrooms where the study language was Estonian and Russian in solving arithmetic word problems when accounting for the teachers’ use of different learner-centred teaching practices in the classroom." .

Less work has addressed predictors of test anxiety in elementary school children. According to the control-value theory developed by Pekrun (Educ Psychol Rev 18:315–341. doi:10.1007/s10648-006-9029-9, 2006), academic self-concept and interest can be seen as such predictors. ObjectiveBased upon a control-value theory approach, the major objective of the present study is to examine the relationships between academic self-concept, interest, and text anxiety in elementary school children. A second aim is to explore moderating effects of gender for these relationships. Methods192 fourth graders aged 7–11 years from 11 classes across six schools completed a modified version of the German Self-Description Questionnaire 1 and a subscale of trait anxiety from the Anxiety Questionnaire for Students (German version). Self-concept and interest ratings were assumed to be negatively related to test anxiety. Gender was hypothesized as a moderator of the relationships between academic self-concept, interest, and test anxiety. ResultsChildren with a lower academic self-concept were more likely to be affected by test anxiety, and girls were more likely to be exposed to test anxiety than boys. Interest, in contrast, was not related to test anxiety and had no impact on test anxiety. ConclusionThe findings of the current research provided evidence that high test anxiety could be explained by a lower academic self-concept of elementary school children. Thus, school-based intervention programs targeting to decrease test anxiety of elementary school children should pay more attention to increasing students’ academic self-concept." .

In many STEM domains, instruction uses multiple visual representations such as graphs, figures, and diagrams. The use of visual representations implies a “representation dilemma”: students learn new content from visual representations they may not yet understand at the same time as they learn about visual representations that show content they do not yet understand. Therefore, students’ learning of content knowledge and of representational competencies (i.e., knowledge about representations) is invariably intertwined. Consequently, instruction may need to adapt not only to students’ acquisition of content knowledge but also to their acquisition of representational competencies. This claim corresponds to the hypothesis that knowledge-component models that describe content knowledge and representational competencies should be more accurate than knowledge-component models that describe only content knowledge. Yet, this hypothesis has not yet been tested. The work in this article tests this hypothesis by comparing knowledge-component models that describe representational competencies and content knowledge to knowledgecomponent models that describe only content knowledge. Analysis of log data from two experiments on chemistry learning with overall 203 undergraduate students suggests that including representational competencies into knowledge-component models increases model fit if the representational competencies are difficult. This finding suggests that students can learn abstract content knowledge only if they have a prerequisite level of representational competencies, and that educational technologies should use adaptive knowledge-component models that capture representational competencies the student has not yet mastered." .

The quality of clinical learning usually reflects the quality of the curriculum structure. The assessment of the clinical settings as learning environment is a significant concern within the contemporary nursing education. The nursing students’ satisfaction is considered as an important factor of such assessment, contributing to any potential reforms in order to optimize the learning activities and achievements within clinical settings.The aim of the study was to investigate nursing students’ satisfaction of the clinical settings as learning environments. MethodA quantitative descriptive, correlational design was used. A sample of 463 undergraduate nursing students from the three universities in Cyprus were participated. Data were collected using the Clinical Learning Environment, Supervision and Nurse Teacher (CLES + T). ResultsNursing students were highly satisfied with the clinical learning environment and their satisfaction has been positively related to all clinical learning environment constructs namely the pedagogical atmosphere, the Ward Manager’s leadership style, the premises of Nursing in the ward, the supervisory relationship (mentor) and the role of the Nurse Teacher (p < 0.001). Students who had a named mentor reported more satisfied with the supervisory relationship. The frequency of meetings among the students and the mentors increased the students’ satisfaction with the clinical learning environment. It was also revealed that 1st year students were found to be more satisfied than the students in other years. ConclusionThe supervisory relationship was evaluated by the students as the most influential factor in their satisfaction with the clinical learning environment. Student’s acceptance within the nursing team and a well-documented individual nursing care is also related with students’ satisfaction. The pedagogical atmosphere is considered pivotal, with reference to students’ learning activities and competent development within the clinical setting. Therefore, satisfaction could be used as an important contributing factor towards the development of clinical learning environments in order to satisfy the needs and expectations of students. The value of the development of an organized mentorship system is illustrated in the study." .

In Requirements Engineering Education (REE), it is important to cover three fundamental topics: traditional analysis and modeling skills, interviewing skills for requirements elicitation, and writing skills for specifying requirements. REE papers report about using role playing as a pedagogical tool; however, there is a surprising lack of empirical evidence on its utility. In this paper we investigate whether a higher grade in a role playing project have an effect on students’ score in an individual written exam in a Requirements Engineering course. Data are collected from 412 students between the years of 2007 and 2014 at Lund University and Chalmers | University of Gothenburg.

In this paper, we show, based on the example of medical assistants in Germany, that these skills have to be assessed in an occupation-specific way, and develop an appropriate simulation-based Situational Judgment Test. Competence modeling, the translation into the test format and results of a data collection are discussed in detail for the dimension of communicative strategies. MethodsBased on empirical and theoretical analysis, we derived a normative competence model underlying the development of a video-based situational judgment test. The final assessment contained 2 × 6 prototypical interactional types of situations, presented in short videos. At the end of every scene, questions of multiple choice format or open questions were asked for each of the social competence dimensions (emotion regulation, perspective coordination, communication strategies). In regard to the evaluation, for the dimension of communication strategies, for example, open answers were rated by using a weighted checklist giving a final score for each situation or all over the test. After two pre-evaluations on N = 236 and N = 260 pupils at the end of their apprenticeship towards becoming medical assistants, validity aspects due to e.g. format were analyzed and edited. A final inquiry on N = 405 pupils confirmed the expected reliability and dimensionality aspects. Results and discussionValidity measures could additionally be confirmed by a structural equation model (N = 405, Χ2 = 594.319, df = 518, CFI = .96, RMSEA = .02 and SRMR = .07) showing unexpected but meaningful underlying factorial structures for the dimensions of emotion regulation and communication strategies. Results of the test show that emotional dissonance is present in every situation. Regarding test-scores, high levels are rarely achieved for all dimensions. ConclusionBy using an occupation-specific approach, we show that social competences can be defined and performance-relatedly assessed. However, results show that the competence levels are marginally satisfactory for all dimensions, considering the stressful environment of medical assistants. Hence, contents of this nature should be integrated more concretely in their educational pathway." .

This study investigated whether early family circumstances and parenting predict 7-year-olds’ subjective well-being. MethodsInformation on supportive friendships, liking school and life satisfaction was obtained from 7-year-olds in one Growing Up in Scotland birth cohort in 2012–2013 (N = 2869). Mothers provided information on early childhood factors from 10 to 34 months, parenting (dysfunctional parenting, home learning and protectiveness) from 46 to 70 months, and 7-year-olds’ adjustment. Multivariable path models explored associations between early childhood factors, parenting and 7-year-olds’ subjective well-being. Supplementary analyses compared findings with those for mother-reported adjustment. ResultsIn a model of early childhood factors, maternal distress predicted less supportive friendships and lower life satisfaction (coefficients −0.12), poverty predicted less supportive friendships (−0.09) and remote location predicted all outcomes (−0.20 to −0.27). In a model with parenting added, dysfunctional parenting predicted all outcomes (−10 to −0.16), home learning predicted liking school (0.11) and life satisfaction (0.08), and protectiveness predicted life satisfaction (0.08). Effects of maternal distress were fully mediated, largely via dysfunctional parenting, while home learning mediated negative effects of low maternal education. Direct effects of poverty and remote location remained. Findings for mother-reported child adjustment were broadly similar. ConclusionsUnique prospective data show parenting and early childhood impact 7-year-olds’ subjective well-being. They underline the benefits for children of targeting parental mental health and dysfunctional parenting, and helping parents develop skills to support children at home and school." .

MethodsOnline resources (institutional Web sites, CTSNet, Scopus, NIH RePORTER) were queried to collect training information (timing of medical school/residency/fellowship graduation, DTR, PhD) and academic metrics (publications, citations, research funding) for 694 academic cardiothoracic surgeons practicing at 56 premiere US institutions. ResultsExcluding missing data, 464 (75 %) surgeons took DTR and 156 (25 %) did not; 629 (91 %) were MD only and 65 (9 %) also had a PhD. DTR was associated with higher number of ongoing publications (~5.6/year vs. ~3.8/year), with no difference for accrued number of total citations. History of DTR was more prevalent among surgeons with versus without NIH funding (87 vs. 71 %; p < 0.001), but no difference was seen across academic ranks and among those who were division/department chiefs. No overall increase in publications/citations, academic rank advancement, NIH funding, or leadership roles was found for those with a PhD. ConclusionsAmong cardiothoracic surgeons, devoting time during the training years exclusively to research might be associated with higher career-long academic productivity in terms of annual number new publications and ability to get NIH funding, but without significant impact in terms of academic rank or institutional role advancement. No significant difference was found between those with versus without a PhD in terms of career-long number of publications/citations, academic rank, NIH funding, or leadership role, even though sample size might have been insufficient to identify any such potential difference." .

This distinction of education as “not yet public” can be seen in contrast to John Dewey who explores notions of democracy as a process in education, where education and school is regarded as a mini society. This paper explores several challenges with progressive education and, specifically, of human rights education, through the work of Arendt (1959) and Dewey (1990) on the notions of responsibility and children’s human rights. Where do we as educators draw the distinction between taking responsibility of raising awareness of global injustices and human rights violations with the next generation without falling pray to dissolution that the gap between political imaginary and reality faces us with, or risking violating children’s “safe space” in school that according to Arendt should be a space that is neither private nor public, but a free zone for thinking and learning with others? Do we bring into the classroom discrimination and segregation by drawing on social categorizations with the pretext of questioning the same on the basis of “equal rights”? If ethical and relational dimensions of education are to be taken seriously then human rights education is a risky practice since it involves children’s sense of being and it raises questions that may not be dealt with properly or solvable for the children exposed." .

Knowledge, skills, and understandings of literacy emerge through sociocultural interactions with non-digital tools (e.g., paper-printed books) and digital tools (e.g., touch screen tablets). However, debate is ongoing over the role that digital experiences play in emergent literacy development. Researchers have voiced the need to conceptualise a common framework for literacy development that considers the emergence of digital literacy skills alongside conventional literacy skills and how these skills might interact during development. This is particularly important in light of the increasing use of digital texts used by young children, such as E-books and digital games. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that might guide research and practice by examining the relationships between emergent literacy skills, emergent digital literacy skills, and proficiency in reading and writing." .

The data came from an average of 2700 students during each year of a 3-year study in six schools in provincial Victoria. A previously reported instrument was developed to measure students’ and teachers’ perceptions of the above factors affecting the implementation of Personalised Learning Plans (PLPs). It employed the latest scales to assess a range of PLP indicator variables, with all scales modified for use in an Australian context and with the total number of items kept to a minimum. Only scales that were more sensitive to PLPs were used in order to minimise the length of the instrument. There were three outcome variables: academic efficacy, academic achievement and student well-being. The emergent model demonstrates that addressing personalisation of learning and well-being depends on a combination of factors rather than “just getting one factor right”. This implies that there is a need for a coherent and collaborative approach for addressing the needs of students of low socioeconomic status." .

A Social Media Acceptance Model was developed by adapting factors from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the E-Learning Acceptance Model (ELAM). A total of 300 students (M age = 25.9, SDage = 4.28) participated in an online survey. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed six factors that affect the intention to use social media for learning: self, information and communication technology (ICT) facility, collectivism, communication functionality, effort/influence and performance. However, the effects of ICT facility and collectivism were found to be insignificant. Self had the strongest effect on intention to use social media for learning. The overall model estimation was found to be approximately 71 %. However, results also revealed that although their intention to use social media learning is high, they do not actually use the media for learning. The students are generally receptive to use social media for learning; hence, academics and tertiary institutions should capitalize on the students’ enthusiasm and encourage or implement policies that incorporate social media as part of teaching and learning activities." .

Studies concerning bilingual students language use in science class have mainly been conducted in settings where both the teacher and the students speak the same minority language. In this study data was collected in a class consisting of students aged 13–14. All students had Turkish as their minority language, whereas the teacher’s minority language was Bosnian. The class was observed when they were working with acids and bases. In addition, the students were interviewed in groups. They were asked about how they use their languages during science lessons and then asked to describe and explain scientific phenomena and processes that had been a part of the observed lessons. For the analysis, practical epistemology analysis and the theory of translanguaging were used. The results show how the students’ everyday language repertoire may limit their possibilities to make meaning of science. In particular, the teacher’s practice of facilitating and supporting students’ understanding of science content by relating it to concrete examples took another direction since the everyday words he used were not a part of the students’ language repertoire. The study also shows how the students used their minority language as a resource to translate words from Swedish to Turkish in order to proceed with the science activities. However, translating scientific concepts was problematic and led to the students’ descriptions of the concepts not being in line with how they are viewed in science. Finally, the study also demonstrates how monolingual exams may limit bilingual students’ achievements in science. The study contributes by presenting and discussing circumstances that need to be taken into consideration when planning and conducting science lessons in classes where the teacher and the student do not share the same minority language." .

MethodsData from the first 100 consecutive cases treated by GreenLEP and HoLEP by two surgeons were prospectively collected from dedicated databases and analysed retrospectively. En-bloc GreenLEP and two-lobar HoLEP enucleations were conducted using the GreenLight HPS™ 2090 laser and Lumenis™ holmium laser. Patients’ characteristics, perioperative outcomes and functional outcomes after 1, 3 and 6 months were compared between groups. ResultsTotal energy delivered and operative times were significantly shorter for GreenLEP (58 vs. 110 kJ, p < 0.0001; 60 vs. 90 min, p < 0.0001). Operative time reached a plateau after 30 procedures in each group. Length of catheterization and hospital stay were significantly shorter in the HoLEP group (2 vs. 1 day, p < 0.0001; 2 vs. 1 day, p < 0.0001). Postoperative complications were comparable between GreenLEP and HoLEP (19 vs. 25 %; p = 0.13). There was a greater increase of Q max at 3 months and a greater IPSS decrease at 1 month for GreenLEP, whereas decreases in IPSS and IPSS-Q8 at 6 months were greater for HoLEP. Transient stress urinary incontinence was comparable between both groups (6 vs. 9 % at 3 months; p = 0.42). Pentafecta was achieved in four consecutive patients after the 18th and the 40th procedure in the GreenLEP and HoLEP group, respectively. Learning curves ranged from 14 to 30 cases for GreenLEP and 22 to 40 cases for HoLEP. ConclusionLearning curves of GreenLEP and HoLEP provided roughly similar peri-operative and short-term functional outcomes." .

Therefore, in the process of training medical students to be proficient in medical knowledge and skills, the importance of patient safety cannot be neglected. A new innovation using mobile apps gaming system (PAtient Safety in Surgical EDucation—PASSED) to teach medical students on patient safety was created. Students were taught concepts of patient safety followed by a gaming session using iPad games created by us. This study aims to evaluate the outcome of patient safety perception using the PASSED games created. MethodsAn interactive iPad game focusing on patient safety issues was created by the undergraduate education team in the Department of Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore. The game employed the unique touched-screen feature with clinical scenarios extracted from the hospital sentinel events. Some of the questions were time sensitive, with extra bonus marks awarded if the student provided the correct answer within 10 s. Students could reattempt the questions if the initial answer was wrong. However, this entailed demerit points. Third-year medical students posted to the Department of Surgery experienced this gaming system in a cohort of 55–60 students. Baseline understanding of the students on patient safety was evaluated using Attitudes to Patient Safety Questionnaire III (APSQ-III) prior to the game. A 20 min talk on concept of patient safety using the WHO Patient Safety Guidelines was conducted. Following this, students downloaded the apps from ITune store and played with the game for 20–30 min. The session ended with the students completing the postintervention questionnaire. ResultsA total of 221 3rd year medical students responded to the survey during the PASSED session. Majority of the students felt that the PASSED game had trained them to understand the processes of medical error (p < 0.001), that their understanding on patient safety issues improved (p = 0.007), and the training prepared them to prevent medical errors (p < 0.001). Many students also recognized the importance of error reporting, where they felt comfortable reporting errors committed by themselves (p < 0.001) or by other people (p < 0.001). They also felt comfortable discussing with the supervisor on medical errors (p < 0.001). Students responded that better teamwork will reduce medical errors (p = 0.003), and teaching teamwork skills will reduce medical errors (p = 0.002). After the PASSED session, students felt that patients could play an important role in preventing medical errors (p < 0.001). They felt that patient safety should be emphasized in undergraduate training (p = 0.024). The level of understanding about concepts of patient safety was also found to improve progressively from the 2nd posting to the 5th posting for both the pre-PASSED and post-PASSED intervention. The pre-PASSED scores for Posting 2 (3.59 ± 1.931), Posting 3 (4.11 ± 1.833), Posting 4 (4.84 ± 1.653), and Posting 5 (4.88 ± 1.642) were significantly higher than the post-PASSED scores for Posting 2 (4.46 ± 2.020), Posting 3 (5.17 ± 1.845), Posting 4 (5.88 ± 1.843), and Posting 5 (5.80 ± 1.843), respectively (p < 0.001). ConclusionUsing iPad game (PASSED) to enhance the patient safety teaching has successfully improved the awareness and understanding of patient safety in clinical practice. This training model can be used to teach more senior medical students on the complexity of patient safety issues in medicine." .

This loss contributes to the detriment of civilization, because individuals need to be rooted in their own specific identity in order to actively participate in community life. This article discusses a longitudinal case study of the efforts being made by Australian Jewish schools to maintain Jewish heritage through annual experiential religious education camps, coordinated in a programme called Counterpoint. The researchers’ aim was to analyse how a school youth camp can serve as a site for socialisation and education into a cultural and religious heritage through experiential learning and informal education. During research trips which took place over several years, interviews enabling insights into the process of experiential education were conducted with a total of three different Directors of Informal Jewish Education, two Jewish Studies heads, five participating teachers, seven youth leaders, as well as seven student focus groups. In their analysis of the semi-structured interviews, the authors of this article employed a grounded theory approach using a constant comparative method, which enabled a more nuanced understanding of the main phenomenon investigated. Over the years, they were able to observe two philosophical approaches, one of which focused more on socialisation, with immersion into experience, while the other focused on education, with immersion into Jewish knowledge. Their findings reveal that some educators aim to “transmit” knowledge through “evocation”, with the students involved in active learning; while others focus more on students’ “acquisition” of knowledge through transmission. Experiential learning activities were found to be more meaningful and powerful if they combined both approaches, leading to growth." .

Five structured focus groups were conducted including 20 medical students and 18 physicians. The discussion guide explored factors influencing AI/AN trainees’ academic medicine career interest and recommended approaches to increase their pursuit of academia. Consensual qualitative research was employed to analyze transcripts. Our research revealed six facilitating factors, nine dissuading factors, and five recommendations towards cultivating AI/AN pursuit of academia. Facilitators included the opportunity to teach, serving as a role model/mentor, enhancing the AI/AN medical education pipeline, opportunities to influence institution, collegiality, and financial stability. Dissuading factors included limited information on academic career paths, politics, lack of credit for teaching and community service, isolation, self-doubt, lower salary, lack of positions in rural areas, lack of focus on clinical care for AI/AN communities, and research obligations. Recommendations included heighten career awareness, recognize the challenges in balancing AI/AN and academic cultures, collaborate with IHS on faculty recruitment strategies, identify concordant role models/mentors, and identify loan forgiveness programs. Similar to other diverse medical students’, raising awareness of academic career opportunities especially regarding teaching and community scholarship, access to concordant role models/mentors, and supportive institutional climates can also foster AI/AN medical students’ pursuit of academia. Unique strategies for AI/AN trainees include learning how to balance AI/AN and academic cultures, collaborating with IHS on faculty recruitment strategies, and increasing faculty opportunities in rural areas." .

Therefore, a study was conducted in Israel with 80 university students with SMI to ascertain their difficulties and the relationship between these difficulties and their level of recovery. The two subscales of an instrument measuring students’ difficulties that were ranked the highest were “Learning Skills and Management of Academic Tasks” and “Social Inclusion Difficulties.” Inverse relationships were found between the students’ difficulties and their perceived level of recovery. The findings illuminate that one of the major challenges that students with SMI experience is to meet academic requirements while coping with mental illness. They also indicate that students’ difficulties may not be limited to academic functioning. Therefore, there is a need to broaden the view of students’ difficulties to include social and contextual factors in the university environment." .

Therefore, we investigated the associations of healthy diet in Grade 1 assessed by Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS), and Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index (FCHEI) with academic achievement in Grades 1–3 in children. MethodsThe participants were 161 Finnish children who were 6–8 years old in Grade 1 and attended in a large ongoing physical activity and dietary intervention study. Dietary factors were assessed using 4-day food records, and MDS, BSDS, and FCHEI were calculated. Academic achievement was assessed by reading fluency, reading comprehension, and arithmetic skill tests. The data were analyzed using linear regression analysis and analysis of covariance adjusted for age, sex, parental education, household income, body fat percentage, physical activity, the PANIC Study group, and total energy intake. ResultsMDS was positively associated with reading comprehension in Grade 3 (standardized regression coefficient β = 0.167, P = 0.032). BSDS was positively associated with reading fluency in Grades 2–3 and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 (β = 0.161–0.274, P < 0.05). FCHEI was positively related to reading fluency in Grades 1–2 and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 (β = 0.190–0.344, P < 0.05). Children in the highest third of BSDS and FCHEI had better reading fluency and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3 than children in the lowest third (P < 0.05). None of the diet scores was associated with arithmetic skills. ConclusionsHealthier diet assessed by BSDS or FCHEI in Grade 1 was associated with better reading skills, but not with arithmetic skills, among children in Grades 1–3. Long-term intervention studies are needed to investigate the effects of improvements in diet quality on academic achievement among children.

Starting from the framework of the Job-Demands-Control-Support model, a total of 11 teachers were interviewed. Results of the qualitative analyses indicated that high levels of job demands, autonomy and social support were important for in-service student teachers’ learning in the workplace. Social support and guidance from colleagues in the workplace seemed more relevant for learning than the support and guidance from the supervisors from the teaching program at the university.

From a comparative perspective, this article explores what Swedish and Norwegian preschool teachers emphasise as important to preschool student teachers about preschool as an arena for children’s language learning. The theoretical framework of the study is based on ecological system theories (Bronfenbrenner in The ecology of human development, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1979; Bronfenbrenner in Dev Psychology 22(6):723–742, 1986) and socio-cultural theories concerning language learning (Vygotsky in Thought and language, MIT Press, Cambridge, 1986). The data are produced through interviews with 69 Swedish and 35 Norwegian preschool teachers. The analyses focused on what the preschool teachers stated to be the most important elements to work with concerning children’s language learning, how and why they worked like this, and what rationales may have led to their pedagogy. The two countries seem quite alike in terms of the values embedded in early childhood education and political ideas concerning a rich childhood based on play and democratic ideals. By comparing the two countries, the results reveal differences that can lead to a deeper knowledge of cultural concepts that are often taken for granted, such as pedagogical approaches, and how these create different conditions for children’s preschool language learning." .

There has been limited success in efforts to modernise practice in the teaching of Chinese, with subsequent urgent calls for both a fresh approach to innovation, and for a better understanding of the nature of teacher experience in the professional community. This article reports a project which employed self-study to investigate, through analysis of reflective narratives, two career trajectories associated with Chinese as a foreign language. ResultsThe analysis of the narratives uncover issues of identity and power, in the shaping of the participants’s practice and professional trajectories. The analysis provides illustration of how limitation in professional participation can result in limitation of innovative practice. The investigation identifies the formation of new independent decentralised professional communities for CFL.

Middle Schoolers Out to Save the World, two Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education programs with the common goal of improving students’ attitudes about scientific careers. The authors represent two project teams, each with funding from the National Science Foundation’s ITEST program. Using different approaches and technology, both projects challenged students to use electricity monitoring system data to create action plans for conserving energy in their homes and communities. The impact of each project on students’ career interests was assessed via a multi-method evaluation that included the Career Interest Questionnaire (CIQ), a measure that was validated within the context of ITEST projects and has since become one of the instruments used most commonly across the ITEST community. This article explores the extent to which the CIQ can be used to document the effects of technology-enhanced STEM educational experiences on students’ career attitudes and intentions in different environments. The results indicate that the CIQ, and the Intent subscale in particular, served as significant predictors of students’ self-reported STEM career aspirations across project context. Results from each project also demonstrated content gains by students and demonstrated the impact of project participation and gender on student outcomes. The authors conclude that the CIQ is a useful tool for providing empirical evidence to document the impact of technology-enhanced science education programs, particularly with regard to Intent to purse a STEM career. The need for additional cross-project comparison studies is also discussed." .

In the field of medical education, self-assessment has been most used to evaluate the cognitive knowledge of students. The complexity of training and evaluation in laparoscopic surgery has previously acted as a barrier in determining the benefits self-assessment has to offer in comparison with other fields of medical education. MethodsThirty-five surgical residents who attended the 2-day Laparoscopic Surgical Skills Grade 1 Level 1 curriculum were invited to participate from The Netherlands, India and Romania. The competency assessment tool (CAT) for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was used for self- and expert-assessment and the resulting distributions assessed. ResultsA comparison between the expert- and self-assessed aggregates of scores from the CAT agreed with previous studies. Uniquely to this study, the aggregates of individual sub-categories—‘use of instruments’; ‘tissue handling’; and errors ‘within the component tasks’ and the ‘end product’ from both self- and expert-assessments—were investigated. There was strong positive correlation (r s > 0.5; p < 0.001) between the expert- and self-assessment in all categories with only the ‘tissue handling’ having a weaker correlation (r s = 0.3; p = 0.04). The distribution of the mean of the differences between self-assessment and expert-assessment suggested no significant difference between the scores of experts and the residents in all categories except the ‘end product’ evaluation where the difference was significant (W = 119, p = 0.03). ConclusionSelf-assessment using the CAT form gives results that are consistently not different from expert-assessment when assessing one’s proficiency in surgical skills. Areas where there was less agreement could be explained by variations in the level of training and understanding of the assessment criteria." .

In particular, the relationship between business students’ academic cheating, as a predictor of workplace ethical behavior, and their approaches to learning is explored. The three approaches to learning identified from the students’ approaches to learning literature are deep approach, represented by an intrinsic interest in and a desire to understand the subject, surface approach, characterized by rote learning and memorization without understanding, and strategic approach, associated with competitive students whose motivation is the achievement of good grades by adopting either a surface or deep approach. Consistent with the hypothesized theoretical model, structural equation modeling revealed that the surface approach is associated with higher levels of cheating, while the deep approach is related to lower levels. The strategic approach was also associated with less cheating and had a statistically stronger influence than the deep approach. Further, a significantly positive relationship reported between deep and strategic approaches suggests that cheating is reduced when deep and strategic approaches are paired. These findings suggest that future managers and business executives can be influenced to behave more ethically in the workplace by directing their learning approaches. It is hoped that the evidence presented may encourage those involved in the design of business programs to implement educational strategies which optimize students’ approaches to learning towards deep and strategic characteristics, thereby equipping tomorrow’s managers and business executives with skills to recognize and respond appropriately to workplace ethical dilemmas." .

Nine hundred twenty-five 4th to 8th graders (453 Chinese, 472 Spanish) took a test which is composed of addition and proportion problems in a missing-value format. The findings showed that Chinese students held a different developmental model of the additive and proportional reasoning from Spanish students. Moreover, number structure and nature of quantities had a different impact in each country. These results indicated that students’ additive and proportional reasoning may vary from country to country due to the different cultures and educational environments. Further studies with a larger-scale sample will be needed to confirm such cross-national effects." .

We describe and discuss the development of ExoPranayama, an actuated environment that physically manifests users’ breathing in yoga. Through a series of trials with yoga practitioners and expert teachers, we explore its role in the practice of yoga. Our interview results reveal that biofeedback through the environment supported teaching and improved self-awareness, but it impacted group cohesion. Two practical uses of the technology emerged for supporting breath control in yoga: (1) biofeedback can provide new information about users’ current internal states; (2) machine-driven feedback provides users with a future state or goal and leads to improved cohesiveness." .

MethodsThree groups of a total of 238 students were compared in a multiple choice general anatomy exam during first-year gross anatomy: (1) a group (year 2015, n 1 = 50) that received training in radiologic image interpretation (RA seminar) and additional access to cadaver CT scans (CT + seminar group); (2) a group (2011, n 2 = 90) that was trained in the RA seminar only (RA seminar group); (3) a group (2011, n 3 = 98) without any radiologic image interpretation training (conventional anatomy group). Furthermore, the students’ perception of the new curriculum was assessed qualitatively through a survey. ResultsThe average test score of the CT + seminar group (21.8 ± 5.0) was significantly higher when compared to both the RA seminar group (18.3 ± 5.0) and the conventional anatomy group (17.1 ± 4.7) (p < 0.001). ConclusionsThe incorporation of cadaver CT scans and life-size virtual dissection tables significantly improved the performance of medical students in general gross anatomy. Medical imaging and virtual dissection should therefore be considered to be part of the standard curriculum of gross anatomy. Key Points • Students provided with cadaver CT scans achieved 27 % higher scores in anatomy. • Radiological education integrated into gross anatomy is highly appreciated by medical students. • Simultaneous physical and virtual dissection provide unique conditions to study anatomy." .

However, the challenges of implementing self-assessment and peer-assessment have been investigated rather sporadically. Given that, the purpose of this study was to explore the challenges and probable solutions of implementing self-assessment and peer-assessment by delving into the perspectives of English language teaching (ELT) teachers and ELT students. In this study we used an emic methodology to examine the perspective of 11 ELT teachers and 56 undergraduate and graduate ELT students. We used MAXQDA to analyze the interviews and open-ended questions. The results reveled that on the part of ELT students, self and peer’s subjective judgment, learners’ lack of assessment literacy, and instructional problems were the most important challenges of implementing self-assessment and peer-assessment in writing courses. ELT teachers believed that these assessment types are not feasible in all cultures. They also admitted that ELT teachers’ lack of assessment literacy is a challenge in implementing these assessment types. As for the probable solutions, both ELT teachers and students posited that ELT teachers need to increase their assessment knowledge and to participate in teacher training courses. Whereas ELT teachers believed that learner autonomy could be a solution, ELT students were against it. The article’s conclusion bears some implications for ELT teachers while implementing self-assessment and peer-assessment in writing courses." .

This study aimed to explore the determinants of success or failure for undergraduate student teams and to define a ‘good group’ through considering three aspects of group success: the task, the individuals, and the team. We employed a mixed methodology, combining demographic data with qualitative observations and task and peer evaluation scores. We determined associations between group dynamic and behaviour, demographic composition, member personalities and attitudes towards one another, and task success. We also employed a cluster analysis to create a model outlining the attributes of a good small group learning team in veterinary education. This model highlights that student groups differ in measures of their effectiveness as teams, independent of their task performance. On the basis of this, we suggest that groups who achieve high marks in tasks cannot be assumed to have acquired team working skills, and therefore if these are important as a learning outcome, they must be assessed directly alongside the task output." .

The inclusion of first-year and second-year curricular measures nearly doubled the variance explained in Step 1 scores from the amount explained by the combination of preadmission demographic characteristics and admissions factors. In addition, the relationship between the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and Step 1 scores becomes counterintuitive in models that include curricular measures, where students with the lowest combined admissions metrics (MCAT, grade-point average) score higher, on average, than those with some of the highest admissions metrics. Overreliance on traditional metrics in admissions decisions can exclude students from medical school who have the ability to succeed." .

Understanding the differences in professional practices and related variables is important for the development of the profession. Using a sample of 446 Portuguese school psychologists, this study used cluster analysis to identify distinct profiles of professional activity, based on practitioners’ time distribution among different target audiences (i.e., students, parents, teachers, school board members, school non-professional staff, and other professionals within the school community). Three distinct profiles emerged from the data: a group highly oriented to work with students, a group that distributes time almost equitably between adults and students, and a group that concentrates attention and professional expertise on adults. Practice setting variables, such as school-psychologists-to-student ratio, school-psychologists-to-school ratio, number of referrals per year, and school community level of demand for different activities, were found to be significantly related to cluster membership. No personal- or professional-background-related variables differentiated the three groups. The main implications of these findings are discussed in light of recent literature regarding the models of service delivery for school psychologists." .

Teacher questioning is a pivotal contributing factor that shapes the role teachers play in promoting dialogic interaction in argumentative practice and that different roles serve different functions for promoting students’ conceptual understanding. The multiple-case study was designed as a follow-up study after a 4-year professional development program that emphasized an argument-based inquiry approach. Data sources included 30 lessons focusing on whole class discussion from three early elementary teachers’ classes. Data were analyzed through two approaches: (1) constant comparative method and (2) enumerative approach. This study conceptualized four critical roles of teacher questioning—dispenser, moderator, coach, and participant—in light of the ownership of ideas and activities. The findings revealed two salient changes in teachers’ use of questions and the relationships between teachers’ question-asking and students’ cognitive responses: (1) teachers increasingly used multiple roles in establishing argumentative discourse as they persistently implemented an argument-based inquiry approach, and (2) as teachers used multiple roles in establishing patterns of questioning and framing classroom interactions, higher levels of student cognitive responses were promoted. This study suggests that an essential component of teacher professional development should include the study of the various roles that teachers can play when questioning for establishing dialogic interaction in argumentation and that this development should consist of ongoing training with systematic support." .

However, pre-conventional scribbles on books by very young children have not been explored as artifacts of emergent literacy practices or reader response. Yet, scholarship in the fields of literacy education, art education, early childhood education and theories of place suggest that children can develop expectations for books in the first few years of life and that their earliest drawing experiences show evidence of intentionality. This reader response study draws from video data of three-year-old Elijah and his eighteen-month-old sister, Hannah, to explore the production, of pre-conventional marginalia in early childhood. The findings of this study suggest that toddlers and preschool-aged children can understand books as distinct and pleasurable artifacts in their immediate environments, that the marks they make in their picturebooks are evidence of reader response, that the act of drawing enables them to engage in a fictional landscape, and that pre-conventional marginalia can provide us with insight into very young children’s earliest aesthetic responses to texts." .

Among these are simulated patients (SPs), who, through role-playing, assist students to develop their communication and physical examination skills, in contexts of formative and summative assessments. This paper explores the teaching and learning relationship between medical students and SPs, and considers how this might affect feedback and assessment. 14 SPs were interviewed on the subject of medical students’ professional identity development in 2014. Data were examined using narrative analysis in conjunction with positioning theory to identify the positions that SPs assigned to themselves and to students. Narrative analysis yielded three interpretative positioning themes: Occupational, familial and cultural and discursive and embodied positioning. The interview process revealed that SPs adopt different positions intra-and interpersonally. SPs appear to hold dissonant perceptions of students in terms relating to their emerging professional identities, which may confound assessment and feedback. Training should include reflections on the SP/student relationship to uncover potential biases and positions, giving SPs the opportunity to reflect on and manage their individual and occupational selves." .

Although many initiatives exist to target this timeframe, the modern classroom belies easy scientific investigation. Numerous initiatives often run simultaneously in a given classroom, creating limited capacity for variable control. Consequently, there is a dearth of high-quality and meaningful data in education sciences that exacerbates the general segregation of education research from practice. Many science reform programmes go unmeasured. The limited number that is researched often report strictly qualitative results or stop short of statistically significant quantitative investigation. Lack of high-resolution data restricts the ability to make informed policy changes and precludes attainment of “evidence-based education”. Here, we demonstrate 5-year efficacy of a novel, inquiry-based primary and secondary science reform programme Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out). Five years of data over three cohorts of matched students from US grades 5–8 show maintained gains in science fair and honours biology election, as well as improved performance on Minnesota state standardized science testing. Detailed value-added analyses further reveal InSciEd Out-correlated gains in partnership-focused areas of life sciences, and history and nature of science. These analyses provide evidence that scientifically rigorous evaluation demonstrating relevant programme efficacy is indeed achievable in education science. Our results support the premise that the InSciEd Out programme is a scalable intervention capable of primary and secondary science education reform. The programme substantively builds upon prior efforts in the field. Although InSciEd Out deploys novel approaches and tools, the broad lessons learned from this programme are readily translatable to other contemporary efforts cultivating science literacy for all.\n" .

Not all students, however, are sufficiently comfortable in using wikis; some simply resist using them. Unfortunately, very little research has been devoted to exploring the issue of wiki resistance among higher-education learners. The authors argue that understanding factors contributing to wiki resistance is as important as understanding factors that promote its use, because such understanding supports better comprehension of the limitations of social-media technologies used in instruction. This paper thus presents a qualitative inquiry regarding the issue of resistance to using wikis among full-time undergraduate students. The participants were purposely selected because they evidenced the strongest resistance towards wikis compared to other participants who received wiki-based instruction from the same instructor. In-depth content analyses of 24 students’ written reflections, weekly wiki logs and edit history, three focus-group interviews, and weekly observations of students’ online activities were studied to gain deeper understanding. Two (2) categories of factors emerged from the findings: technical factors (slow Internet connection outside the classroom and user-friendliness aspects of wiki) and individual factors (anxiety in using new technology, mental perceptions, and lack of student commitment towards learning experiences) with the latter representing the strongest resistance factors. Limitations of the study are discussed, and recommendations for helping other instructors in designing successful wiki-supported environment in their own contexts are offered." .

A serious game-based learning environment was developed, integrating invisible laser infrared technology, 1:1 real-scale rifle guns with recoil effects, as well as 3D interactive virtual reality (VR) military training digital information content, to train students in military live firing. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design, students’ performance, in terms of their learning achievement and learning motivation, was examined. One hundred and sixty high school students from Taiwan were divided into four individual groups of 40 students each, with one control group and three experimental groups (EG1, EG2, and EG3). The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. The results of this cost-effective 3D VR showed significantly better learning motivation, learning outcomes, and positive impacts on users’ actual live firing achievement scores." .

This is true today as it was in 1878 when Dr. William Stewart Halsted travelled through Europe and returned to the United States (U.S.) to lay the ground stone for what would be the modern U.S. residency model. MethodsThis article is intended to help understand the evolution and current state of the U.S. residency model and is written through the lens of the first author who has trained in both systems. We hope to outline some key differences that we deem particularly interesting. ResultsConcrete lessons we can learn from the U.S. system are to abolish favoritism, enroll residents in formal training programs with a set start and finish date, consider implementing midlevel practitioners and establishing a steeper hierarchy within the residency itself. ConclusionsThe U.S. model, despite all its own inherent issues, has managed to balance the three ingredients of surgical education: dedication, mentorship, and exposure. Contrarily, in many European countries medical school is followed by years of uncertainty. With demographical and societal changes this deficiency has led to many potential young surgeons turning towards other specialties and industries." .

MethodsThree types of high schools (private, experimental and public) with different politics on on-line aggression were enrolled. All students of the aforementioned schools were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. ResultsAround 62 % of the high school students experienced cyberbullying by electronic means, especially by cell phone, mostly the public school students (p 0.008). The bully was a stranger in more than 40 % of the cases. Over 60 % of the victims had not seeked help but dealt with the attack on their own. Only 20 % of the victims manifested sleep or eating disorders, physical/ psychological symptoms or changes in their social life as a consequence of the cyber-attack. ConclusionsCyberbullying is a usual phenomenon among high school students. The bully is frequently unacquainted to the victim. Most of the victims are not physically or psychologically affected by the cyber-attack and do not share the event with anyone. There was a slight difference in the response of the students to cyberbullying among the different school politics of on-line aggression." .

The results of a study published in 2015 offered some initial data in this regard by identifying a lack of improvement in the critical thinking ability of students enrolled at three of Rwanda’s public universities, despite extensive pedagogical reforms across the sector. However, subsequent analysis of the study data suggests that this lack of improvement is not a general phenomenon, as students graduating from the KIST Faculty of Architecture and Environmental Design appear to exhibit deeper approaches to learning and stronger critical thinking skills than graduates with similar backgrounds from other Faculties involved in the study.

A taxonomy of reading skills was used to contrast online software with offline closed system (compact disc) based programs with respect to number of skills taught, quality of instruction and scaffolding during instruction. Overall, online programs were more comprehensive and provided instruction for more skills than offline software at either the Kindergarten or Grade 1 level. However, offline programs demonstrated some developmentally appropriate selectivity in skills trained. Quality of instruction was variable within and across all programs. Scaffolding of instruction was also variable and surprisingly few programs, either online or offline, provided automatic movement across levels of difficulty. These outcomes have important implications for the selection of instructional materials by parents and educators involved in early literacy instruction and also for future software design." .

This study explores the relationships between parental beliefs about school readiness, family engagement in home learning activities, on children’s attitudes to school as reported by parents, and children’s reading achievement in kindergarten. The analyses draw on data from 3309 children who participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study of Kindergartners. The analyses use structural equation modeling to test the influence of parent and family influences, including sociodemographic variables on children’s attitudes to school and children’s reading achievement in the kindergarten year. Analyses revealed that parents’ readiness beliefs and family activities were significantly related to children’s reading skills. Family activities were related to children’s attitudes about school, but these attitudes were not related to the development of reading skills. The findings suggest that higher engagement in shared parent–child activities may be an important focus in intentional efforts aimed at enhancing early reading achievement. Early childhood educators and other family practitioners can encourage parents to participate in home activities with their children because these activities encourage language interactions which are important to the development of children’s literacy." .

The IRAP, however, allows for a deeper analysis of implicit attitudes with respect to both thin and fat in isolation, and it was found that medical students are, on average, actually both pro-thin and pro-fat, and on average are more pro-thin than pro-fat, as opposed to anti-fat. Additionally, it was found that medical students’ implicit weight bias against fat/obese individuals improved over the first 2 years of medical training, and this improvement was specifically driven by improved implicit attitudes toward overweight and obese, while implicit attitudes toward thin remained constant over that time. The implications of more sensitive implicit bias assessment and specific changes in bias over time are discussed within the context of medical education curriculum development." .

How the differing concerns of patient care and student education are balanced in situ remains largely unknown and undefined. This video ethnographic study explores patient involvement during a largely student-centric activity: ‘feedback sequences’ where students learn clinical and practical skills. Drawing on a data subset from a multi-site study, we used Conversation Analysis to investigate verbal and non-verbal interactional practices to examine patients’ inclusion and exclusion from teaching activities across 25 BTEs in General Practice and General Surgery and Medicine with 50 participants. Through analysis, we identified two representations of the patient: the patient embodied (where patients are actively involved) and the patient as-a-body (when they are used primarily as a prop for learning). Overall, patients were excluded more during physical examination than talk-based activities. Exclusion occurred through physical positioning of doctor–patient–student, and through doctors and students talking about, rather than to, patients using medical jargon and online commentaries. Patients’ exclusion was visibly noticeable through eye gaze: patients’ middle-distance gaze coincided with medical terminology or complex wording. Inclusory activities maintained the patient embodied during teaching activities through doctors’ skilful embedding of teaching within their care: including vocalising clinical reasoning processes through students, providing patients with a ‘warrant to listen’, allocating turns-at-talk for them and eye-contact. This study uniquely demonstrates the visible nature patient exclusion, providing firm evidence of how this affects patient empowerment and engagement within educational activities for tomorrow’s doctors." .

This study provides an important contribution to the literature by comparing two conceptualizations of quality in classrooms serving children from low-income households and those with disabilities. Objectives(1) To characterize and to determine differences with regard to process and structural quality in publicly funded ECE and inclusive ECE classrooms, and (2) to examine whether and to what extent the process quality varied when controlling for structural quality and classroom income/race variables. MethodOne hundred and sixty four classrooms (85 ECE, 79 inclusive) that were enrolled in two large-scale intervention studies examining a book-reading program were included in the present study. The Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta et al. in Classroom assessment scoring system, Paul H. Brookes, Baltimore, 2008) and three detailed questionnaires were used to quantify process and structural quality, respectively. ResultsResults revealed quantitative differences in process quality, specifically in the emotional support dimension of negative climate as well as all dimensions of instructional support, between the two settings. In addition, teachers’ education was a significant predictor of process quality, and publicly funded ECE classrooms scored over two points higher on the instructional support domain of the CLASS when controlling for other structural quality measures and income and race. ConclusionsOur findings have implications for best practice guidelines and policies, particularly for classroom environments serving children with disabilities, which are discussed." .

These learning strategies can be influenced by the learning environment. Problem-based learning (PBL), a student-centered educational method, is believed to stimulate the use of these effective learning strategies. Several aspects of PBL such as discussions of real-life problems, selecting literature by the students themselves, and formulating answers to learning issues encourage students’ use of deep processing and self-regulation. In the present study, third-year PBL law students were compared to third-year law students of a lecture-based program with respect to their learning strategies, which were measured with the Inventory Learning Styles (ILS; Vermunt in British Journal of Educational Psychology, 68, 149–171, 1998). In addition, the relation between time invested in self-study and learning strategies, when taking the instructional method into account, was explored. Results showed that PBL students reported to apply deep processing, self-regulation, and external regulation more frequently than their non-PBL counterparts. PBL seems to contribute to the use of effective learning strategies, but PBL students also relied more often on external sources for their regulation, such as teachers, course material, and assessment." .

It first reminds the centrality of sense-making in learning and instruction from a sociocultural perspective, and proposes a pragmatist approach to examine what sorts of knowledge people use when they face situations that matter. The paper then presents two series of studies of symbolic resources. The first studies, led in informal situations, allow to define the concept of symbolic resources and a model of its uses. The second series is focused on school situations, and examines how school knowledge can be used as symbolic resources, and also, how symbolic resources can support learning in educational settings. This leads into a discussion on the role of institutional and social dynamics in the relations between learning in and out of school, at the heart of sense-making, as well as on the central role of imagination in learning and development. The paper ends by underlying the centrality of sense-making in learning and development, and the need to complement nomothetic studies with a more idiographic understanding of the complex dynamics involved." .

Here, we describe a systematic approach for achieving this task using the third year Core Clerkships as a model. We utilized the process of Backward Design to integrate the EPAs into our existing third year Core Clerkship Curriculum by creating common student learning outcomes and implementing a standardized assessment strategy. Specifically, our manuscript shares the process we used, barriers we faced, methods to evaluate the changes, our ideas to continue to improve this process in the future, and how other institutions can generalize this process. Our redesign efforts revealed that many perceptors were unable to evaluate student performance on key EPA-based outcomes we identified as appropriate to the third year. This finding has implications for how to begin making Entrustment decisions by helping to better establish where key entrustable performances are best observed and assessed." .

Despite being well received by the students, the review did not significantly affect the increase in score between the test and re-test. Thus, contrary to our predictions and student evaluations, the review session did not improve the re-test performance over self-study." .

Thus, the study attempted to determine the place and importance of technological support in the process of attaining the aimed and obtained acquisitions by students. Participants of the study consist of forty-three calculus students who are studying in traditional or CAS-supported teaching environments, and have different thinking types. Pre-and post-assessment tools were used in the data gathering process, and the data were evaluated with descriptive statistics. The results of the study showed that students in the traditional group place more importance on procedural skills, while students in the CAS group attach more importance to conceptual skills in terms of instructional objects. It also determined that acquisitions, which students think developed differ according to learning environment and thinking types. The main implications of the study were discussed in terms of the related literature and teaching practice." .

In quantitative research, there are differences in students’ preferences and actual participation in PPE by gender. This novel study qualitatively explores the effect that gender has on medical students’ experiences of learning physical examination through PPE. We employ an interpretative approach to uncover the PPE experiences of students from a European, graduate-entry medical school. Volunteers participated in either individual or group interviews. The data were transcribed, de-identified and analysed using thematic analysis. There was evidence of gender inequity in PPE, with students describing significant imbalances in participation. Male students adopted roles that generated significant personal discomfort and led to fewer experiences as examiners. Assumptions were made by tutors and students about gender roles: male students’ ready acceptance of exposure to be examined and female students’ need to be protected from particular examinations. In contrast with the first assumption, male students did feel coerced or obliged to be examined. Students described their experiences of taking action to break down the gender barrier. Importantly, students reported that tutors played a role in perpetuating inequities. These findings, whilst relating to one university, have implications for all settings where PPE is used. Educators should be vigilant about gender issues and the effect that they may have on students’ participation in PPE to ensure that students are not disadvantaged in their learning." .

According to our research, among the students who enroll in school, students born in July and August display a relative disadvantage and adaptive difficulties in the construction of self-identity and study ability when compared with those born in September and October. Students born between November and June in the following year have mid-level performance. Moreover, this effect is accumulative. With regard to acquiring educational resources, students born in July and August show the lowest possibility of getting into the key senior middle schools, 16.7–22.8 % lower than the rest of the student population, while the possibility of being admitted to vocational school is the highest, 54.2–60.8 % higher than the others. This disadvantage is more prominent among male students. Our study also shows that the above effect is very strong and cannot be effectively suppressed by the socioeconomic factors. The “July/August pitfall” appears to be insurmountable." .

MethodsWe analyzed data of the School-based Survey on Smoking among Students 2012/2013 from a representative sample of 45,857 secondary school students in Hong Kong (mean age 14.8, SD 1.9). We conducted Chi-square tests and t test to compare current (past 30 days) waterpipe users and nonusers by sociodemographic variables and other covariates. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the factors associated with current waterpipe smoking. ResultsOverall, 1.2 % of students reported current waterpipe smoking, of whom 43 % reported concurrent use of cigarettes. Waterpipe was the most popular alternative tobacco product (non-cigarette) used by students. Current waterpipe smoking was associated with older age, male sex, higher self-perceived family financial status, poor knowledge about the harm of cigarette smoking, positive attitudes toward smoking, current cigarette smoking, other tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. ConclusionsWaterpipe smoking was the most popular alternative tobacco product among Hong Kong adolescents. Despite the low prevalence, it should be routinely monitored. Education programs and cessation interventions need to address waterpipe smoking in addition to cigarette smoking." .

This study built on earlier research to explore rater cognition, capturing factors that contribute to assessor decision making about students’ competency. The aims were to determine the source of variation in the examination process and document the factors impacting on examiner judgment. Examiner judgement was explored from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Twenty-three examiners viewed three video encounters of student performance on an OSCE. Once rated, analysis of variance was performed to determine where the variance was attributed. A semi-structured interview drew out the examiners reasoning behind their ratings. Results highlighted variability of the process of observation, judgement and rating, with each examiner viewing student performance from different lenses. However, at a global level, analysis of variance indicated that the examiner had a minimal impact on the variance, with the majority of variance explained by the student performance on task. One anomaly noted was in the assessment of technical competency, whereby the examiner had a large impact on the rating, linked to assessing according to curriculum content. The thought processes behind judgement were diverse and if the qualitative results had been used in isolation, may have led to the researchers drawing conclusions that the examined performances would have yielded widely different ratings. However, as a cohort, the examiners were able to distinguish good and poor levels of competency with the majority of student competency linked to the varying ability of the student." .

Developing patient safety education for medical students is more and more widely recognized by World Health Organization and countries all over the world. However, in China, patient safety courses aiming at medical students are relatively few, and there are few reports about the effect of patient safety courses. This paper explored the influence of patient safety curriculum on medical students’ attitude to and knowledge of patient safety. The patient safety curriculum was carried out for 2011-grade undergraduates of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The students participated in the class according to free choice. After the curriculum, the information of gender, major, attended course, attitude toward patient safety, and knowledge of laws and regulations of the 2011-grade undergraduates were collected. After rejecting invalid questionnaires, the number of undergraduates that participated in the survey was 112 (61 students did not take part in the curriculum; 51 took part in). Chi-square test was applied to analyze patient safety education’s influence on medical students’ attitude to patient safety and their knowledge mastery situation. The influence of patient safety education on the attitude of medical students to patient safety was not significant, but that on their knowledge of patient safety was remarkable. No matter male or female, as compared with medical students who had not accepted patient safety education, they both had a better acquisition of knowledge after having this education (for male students: 95% CI, 4.556–106.238, P<0.001; for female students: 95% CI, 3.183–33.238, P<0.001). Students majoring in Western Medicine had a relatively better mastery of knowledge of patient safety after receiving patient safety education (95% CI, 6.267–76.271, P<0.001). Short-term patient safety education cannot change medical students’ stereotyped cognition on matters related to patient safety, but it can effectively enhance their knowledge of laws and regulations of patient safety." .

At the beginning, we describe the results of a systematic literature review for determining subject-specific aspects measured in recent lesson studies in mathematics education. The main results are that there is little or no consistency in the conceptualization and nomination of subject-specific aspects. We therefore structured these different aspects along two perspectives, a mathematical perspective on mathematics educational quality of instruction as well as a pedagogical perspective. Furthermore, referring to the usage of these observational instruments in the field, in this paper we inquire into methodological challenges in measuring instructional quality in mathematics classrooms, e.g., the optimal number of raters and lessons to be observed. The results are twofold: on the one hand, there are recent studies that provide a useful answer to these questions. On the other hand, these results appear to be specific to the given data. Therefore, this problem seems to be unsolved so far." .

At one of these LIC sites, the need for an improvement of the local learning experience became evident. This paper explores how to identify and implement a tailored teaching and learning intervention to improve workplace-based learning for LIC students. MethodsA participatory action research approach was used in a co-operative inquiry group (ten participants), consisting of the students, clinician educators and researchers, who met over a period of 5 months. Through a cyclical process of action and reflection this group identified a teaching intervention. ResultsThe results demonstrate the gaps and challenges identified when implementing a LIC model of medical education. A structured learning programme for the final 6 weeks of the students’ placement at the district hospital was designed by the co-operative inquiry group as an agreed intervention. The post-intervention group reflection highlighted a need to create a structured programme in the spirit of local collaboration and learning across disciplines. The results also enhance our understanding of both students and clinician educators’ perceptions of this new model of workplace-based training. ConclusionsThis paper provides practical strategies to enhance teaching and learning in a new educational context. These strategies illuminate three paradigm shifts: (1) from the traditional medical education approach towards a transformative learning approach advocated for the 21st century health professional; (2) from the teaching hospital context to the district hospital context; and (3) from block-based teaching towards a longitudinal integrated learning model. A programme based on balancing structured and tailored learning activities is recommended in order to address the local learning needs of students in the LIC model. We recommend that action learning sets should be developed at these LIC sites, where the relevant aspects of work-place based learning are negotiated." .

As teacher teams often do not meet all criteria included in theoretical team definitions, the construct team entitativity was introduced. Defined as the degree to which a group of individuals possesses the quality of being a team, this makes it possible to extend team learning research from strict teams-in-theory to various types of teams-in-practice, including teacher teams. The team learning beliefs and behaviours model, including team entitativity, was applied to teacher teams, assessing whether it still stands in these non-strict teams. Data were collected from 105 teams and analysed using multilevel analysis. Results showed that team entitativity, psychological safety and group potency were related to the occurrence of team learning. The latter appeared to be significantly related to team effectiveness, and the formation of mutually shared cognition was found to be a mediating variable in this relationship." .

Um in diesem Berufsbild tätig zu werden, besteht für Rettungsassistenten(innen) mit mehr als 5 Jahren Berufserfahrung die Möglichkeit, sich einer kombinierten mündlichen und praktischen Ergänzungsprüfung zum/zur Notfallsanitäter(in) zu unterziehen. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, Erfahrungen aus Vorbereitung, Prüfung und benötigter Ressourcen darzustellen und die strukturellen Anpassungsprozesse der Rettungsschule aufzuzeigen. MethodeDie Teilnehmer durchliefen ein von der Rettungsschule entwickeltes Vorbereitungsprogramm auf Basis der NUN-Algorithmen (Niedersächsische Umsetzung für Notfallsanitäter[innen]). Anschließend wurden die Prüfungsergebnisse des Kalenderjahrs 2015 dokumentiert. Alle Prüflinge erhielten nach Ablauf des Jahres einen Fragebogen mit dem Ziel, die eigene und schulische Prüfungsvorbereitung und den Unterschied der Prüfungsinhalte zur Arbeitsrealität zu bewerten. ErgebnisseEin Drittel der Prüflinge hatte Probleme, den Lernaufwand korrekt einzuschätzen und konnte die Prüfung im ersten Anlauf nicht bestehen. Die schulische Vorbereitung wurde von einem Drittel als nicht ausreichend bewertet. Die Bestehensquote der Wiederholungsprüfung lag bei 86 %. Die Arbeitsrealität der Mitarbeiter im Vergleich zu den NUN-Algorithmen wurde sehr heterogen beurteilt. SchlussfolgerungDie hohe Bestehensquote in der Wiederholungsprüfung zeigt die generelle Eignung der Teilnehmer, obwohl ca. ein Drittel im ersten Prüfungsversuch durch mangelnde Vorbereitung durchgefallen waren. Unterschiede der Lerninhalte zur Arbeitsrealität scheinen hier zusätzliche Erfolgshindernisse darzustellen. Die sehr variable Kompetenz der Rettungsassistenten sollte weiter beobachtet werden um das Weiterbildungs- und Fortbildungsangebot anzupassen." .

Three cohorts of students have been given a written questionnaire with open-ended questions before and after a one-semester course including science (specifically Chemistry and Physics) in a 3.5-year preschool teacher programme in Sweden. The science content in the course is integrated with other subjects and lecturers with different subject backgrounds work together in forming an integrated and meaningful context. A phenomenographic qualitative analysis of responses to the questionnaires before and after the course is presented. The analysis indicated that many students equate science with biology (nature studies), and several did not adjust this view even though chemistry and physics were explicitly taught. Surprisingly few students were negative towards science, none after the course. However, several remain hesitantly positive. Most students described ‘what’ and ‘how’ perspectives of science, but few developed a synthesised view of science activities. However, there was a shift towards a more integrated perspective after the course. Also the quality and eloquence of the students’ responses were noticeably improved in responses given after the course. Prior expectations and implications of the results for preschool teacher education are discussed." .

Therefore, it is important to clarify the magnitude and direction of changes in empathy during medical school. We employed a scoping review to elucidate trends in students’ empathy changes/differences throughout medical school and examine potential bias associated with research design. The literature published in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French from 2009 to 2016 was searched. Two-hundred and nine potentially relevant citations were identified. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes of empathy scores variations were calculated to assess the practical significance of results. Our results demonstrate that scoped studies differed considerably in their design, measures used, sample sizes and results. Most studies (12 out of 20 studies) reported either positive or non-statistically significant changes/differences in empathy regardless of the measure used. The predominant trend in cross-sectional studies (ten out of 13 studies) was of significantly higher empathy scores in later years or of similar empathy scores across years, while most longitudinal studies presented either mixed-results or empathy declines. There was not a generalized international trend in changes in students’ empathy throughout medical school. Although statistically significant changes/differences were detected in 13 out of 20 studies, the calculated effect sizes were small in all but two studies, suggesting little practical significance. At the present moment, the literature does not offer clear conclusions relative to changes in student empathy throughout medical school." .

There is also limited research on measures of coach–teacher alliance, further hindering the field from understanding the active components for successful coaching. The current study examined the factor structure and psychometric characteristics of a measure of coach–teacher alliance as reported by both teachers and coaches and explored the extent to which teachers and coaches reliably rate their alliance. Data come from a sample of 147 teachers who received implementation support from one of four coaches; both the teacher and the coach completed an alliance questionnaire. Separate confirmatory factor analyses for each informant revealed four factors (relationship, process, investment, and perceived benefits) as well as an additional coach-rated factor (perceived teacher barriers). A series of analyses, including cross-rater correlations, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Kuder-Richardson reliability estimates suggested that teachers and coaches provide reliable, though not redundant, information about the alliance. Implications for future research and the utilization of the parallel coach–teacher alliance measures to increase the effectiveness of coaching are discussed." .

In particular, a robust pipeline of investigators from the communities disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic is needed not only for fairness and equity but for insights and innovations to address persistent racial and ethnic disparities in new infections. We created the Summer HIV/AIDS Research Program (SHARP) at the San Francisco Department of Public Health for URM undergraduates as a 12-week program of hands-on research experience, one-on-one mentoring by a senior HIV investigator, didactic seminars for content and research methods, and networking opportunities. The first four cohorts (2012–2015) of SHARP gained research skills, built confidence in their abilities and self-identified as scientists. In addition, the majority of program alumni is employed in research positions and has been admitted to or is pursuing graduate degree programs in fields related to HIV prevention. While we await empirical studies of specific mentoring strategies at early educational stages, programs that engage faculty who are sensitive to the unique challenges facing diverse students and who draw lessons from established mentoring frameworks can help build an inclusive generation of HIV researchers." .

In this stage of the research, the skills needed by the organizations were identified through a document analysis of prospective studies conducted in industrial sectors developed in the last 15 years. In order to verify whether these skills are developed in the management courses, an online survey was conducted among distance learning University students from 2011 to 2014. The research problem considered the analytical dimension of skills development in organizations anchored to the following research questions: What were the skills identified in the prospective studies? What has been the level of skills developed in courses on management in e-learning mode in higher education? What were the relationships between the perceived skills development and various factors such as gender, employed/unemployed, type of organization and job variables?

The thesis was not a formal statement and thus did not allow for a formal proof, but support was given by examples of a number of different learning criteria that can be learned by enumeration. Building on recent formalizations of learning criteria, we are now able to formalize Wiehagen’s Thesis. We prove the thesis for a wide range of learning criteria, including many popular criteria from the literature. We also show the limitations of the thesis by giving four learning criteria for which the thesis does not hold (and, in two cases, was probably not meant to hold). Beyond the original formulation of the thesis, we also prove stronger versions which allow for many corollaries relating to strongly decisive and conservative learning." .

The current situation with emphasis on the formative and summative aspects will be discussed. The reader will get insight into the way progress testing can be used as feedback for students and schools." .

Damit ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Medizinstudierende das Fach Anästhesiologie im Studium als berufliche Perspektive für sich erkennen können, niedriger als in anderen großen Fächern. Nachwuchssorgen sind die logische Folge, obwohl viele gute und wichtige Gründe für die Anästhesie als berufliche Perspektive sprechen. Traditionelle Ansätze bei der Ausbildung von Medizinstudierenden bestehen in der Anästhesie häufig allein aus dem Erlernen verschiedener Strategien im Airwaymanagement oder der kardiopulmonalen Reanimation an Übungsphantomen. Die Anästhesie ist eine komplexe Interaktion aus Anatomie, Physiologie, Pharmakologie, klinischer Beurteilung, Erfahrung, Wissen und manuellem Geschick. Wenn Medizinstudierende sich für eine Famulatur oder das Praktische Jahr in der Anästhesie entscheiden, besteht die Chance dem beruflichen Nachwuchs die umfangreiche Welt der Anästhesie zu zeigen. Junge Talente müssen entdeckt, gefördert und gefordert werden. Wir haben eine Kurzanleitung zur praktischen Anästhesie bei Erwachsenen mit webbasierter Videoillustrierung für Medizinstudierende in einer Famulatur oder dem Praktischem Jahr erstellt. Es werden die Grundzüge der Prämedikation, der Narkoseeinleitung und Narkoseführung sowie der Regionalanästhesie erklärt. Außerdem werden die wichtigsten, für die Anästhesie relevanten Medikamente diskutiert und praktische Fähigkeiten wie das Anlegen einer Venenverweilkanüle, der Maskenbeatmung und die endotracheale Intubation anhand von Kurzfilmen erklärt. Diese Informationen sind mittels Quick-Response(QR)-Code auf einem Smartphone abrufbar. Es wurde nicht auf lokale Eigenheiten und besondere Patientengruppen (z. B. Kinder, Patienten mit speziellen Vorerkrankungen), lokale Leitlinien oder „standard operating procedures“ (SOP) eingegangen. Medizinstudierende können für die Anästhesie begeistert werden, wenn man ihnen nicht nur die fachlichen Regeln und Strategien erklärt, sondern auch klinische Erfolgserlebnisse durch erlerntes und angewandtes Wissen ermöglicht. Eine übersichtliche Darstellung der Anästhesie ermöglicht bereits im Vorfeld einer Famulatur oder des praktischen Jahres eine schnelle und erfolgreiche Orientierung; ob dies anschließend auch eine Rekrutierungswahrscheinlichkeit für die Anästhesie erhöht, ist derzeit nicht bekannt." .

Dass diese Investitionen überwiegend öffentlich finanziert werden müssen, wird nicht bezweifelt. Die Frage ist aber, ob es mit den in der Vergangenheit getätigten Bildungsinvestitionen gelungen ist, soziale Ungleichheiten zu mildern. Vieles deutet darauf hin, dass die deutsche Bildungspolitik insbesondere bei der Verbesserung der sozialen Durchlässigkeit Defizite aufweist. Vor allem im vorschulischen Bereich sollten zusätzliche Finanzmittel eingesetzt werden, aber auch die regionale Verteilung ist zu beachten. Zudem sind Bildungsinvestitionen für die bessere Integration von Flüchtlingen in den Arbeitsmarkt erforderlich." .

Jedoch existiert eine Kontroverse zur Wertigkeit von studentischer simulationsbasierter Lehre in Bezug auf die Transferierbarkeit des Erlernten in die klinische Praxis. Ziel der ArbeitDie vorliegende Studie beabsichtigte, den Einfluss von simulationsbasiertem Training auf Studierende im Rahmen curricularer Pflichtpraktika in Operationssälen zu untersuchen. Material und MethodenEin 3. klinisches Semester wurde zufällig in zwei Gruppen aufgeteilt: Die Gruppe SIM-OP wurde vor, die Gruppe OP-SIM wurde nach dem OP-Praktikum durch simulationsbasiertes Training in anästhesiologischen Basisfertigkeiten geschult. Mit einer Likert-Skala wurden fünf Fertigkeiten zu definierten Messzeitpunkten erhoben und daraus ein Summenscore bestimmt, wobei fünf Punkte die bestmögliche Bewertung und 25 Punkte die schlechteste Bewertung darstellten. Primäre Endpunkte waren die Punktzahl am ersten Tag des OP-Praktikums sowie die Änderung der Punktzahl vom ersten auf den vierten Tag innerhalb des OP-Praktikums. Die Hypothese war, dass die Gruppe SIM-OP eine bessere Punktzahl am Ende des ersten Tages des OP-Praktikums und einen größeren Zuwachs an Punktzahlen vom ersten auf den vierten Tag des OP-Praktikums erreicht als die Gruppe OP-SIM. ErgebnisseEs wurden 143 Studierende in die Studie eingeschlossen. Es zeigte sich kein signifikanter Unterschied zwischen beiden Gruppen, weder am ersten Tag des OP-Praktikums noch in der Änderung der Punktzahl vom ersten auf den vierten Tag des OP-Praktikums. DiskussionDiese Studie konnte mit der angewandten Methodik nicht nachweisen, dass die Fertigkeiten in einem realen medizinischen Umfeld durch ein simulationsbasiertes Training gesteigert werden können. Sekundär gab es Hinweise darauf, dass am Ende des gesamten anästhesiologischen OP-Praktikums die Gruppe bessere Fertigkeiten zeigte, die vor dem OP-Praktikum durch simulationsbasiertes Training geschult wurde." .

Identity is a social phenomenon, constructed through participation in everyday activities and an integral part of every learning interaction. In this paper we report from an Australian ethnographic study into how medical students and patients use narrative to construct their identities. The dialogic narrative analysis employed focused on the production of meaning through the use of language devices in a given context, and the juxtaposition of multiple perspectives. Two stories told by students about their participation in patient care-related activities reveal how identities are constructed in this context through depictions of the relationships between medical students, patients and clinical teachers. These students use the rhetorical functions of stories to characterise doctors and patients in certain ways, and position themselves in relation to them. They defend common practices that circumvent valid consent processes, justified by the imperative to maximise students’ participation in patient care-related activities. In doing so, they identify patients as their adversaries, and doctors as allies. Both students are influenced by others’ expectations but one reveals the active nature of identity work, describing subtle acts of resistance. These stories illustrate how practices for securing students’ access to patients can influence students’ emerging identities, with implications for their future disclosure and consent practices. We argue that more collaborative ways of involving medical students in patient care-related activities will be facilitated if students and clinical teachers develop insight into the relational nature of identity work." .

The importance of mainstream members of society learning to recognize diversity with less prejudice undergirds many of the aims of a recent educational reform, Liberal Studies. This paper evaluates the capacity of Liberal Studies to educate for multicultural understanding of cultural difference. Its primary data source is Liberal Studies textbooks, and it employs a qualitative content analysis to consider how diversity and ethnic, cultural, and religious differences are represented in the texts. The analysis is complemented by an examination of related resources teachers may use in the classroom (and are encouraged to use by the Hong Kong Curriculum Development Council): mainstream news articles and resources from the (government-provided) Web-based Resource Platform for Liberal Studies. The voices and views of some practicing teachers and pre-service teacher education students related to multicultural Liberal Studies resources are also included to provide a balanced picture. Based on this analysis, multicultural education as provided in major resources within the Liberal Studies curriculum appears inadequate. As diversity is reflected upon in resources analyzed here most often as problematic and stereotypical, interventions are needed if Liberal Studies is to enable multicultural appreciation and understanding among students in Hong Kong in the future." .

A mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was constructed using propensity scores. Also investigated were the effects of the level of teacher literacy support on early literacy achievement and the interaction between Istation® use and the level of teacher literacy support. A descriptive discriminant analysis was performed to determine the main effect of Istation®. The level of teacher support and the interaction effect was then tested using a multivariate between-subject analysis. Results indicated that Istation® did have a statistically significant effect on the early literacy skills of the kindergarten students studied and could explain 17.7% of the variance in group differences. Teacher literacy support and the interaction between teacher support and Istation® were not significant. This study considers the relationship between technology and early literacy and concludes that Istation® can serve as a more knowledgeable other as students develop some early literacy skills; however, teachers are still needed to provide complete literacy instruction for young students." .

Therefore, the enhancement of autonomy-supportive teaching is a legitimate focus of efforts to improve student outcomes. In this study, we compared self-reported levels of autonomy-supportive teaching amongst different educational professionals and explored the relationships between four hypothesised antecedents of autonomy support: constraints at work, perceived competence for teaching, perceptions of students’ autonomous motivation towards school and autonomous motivation for teaching. Questionnaire data from 429 teachers and teaching assistants (TAs) working in schools in the United Kingdom (UK) revealed that teachers report significantly more autonomy-supportive teaching than do TAs. Structural equation modelling indicated that the more teachers feel competent, the more their teaching is autonomy-supportive. Amongst a range of other significant findings, teachers, but not TAs, who experience fewer constraints at work are more autonomously motivated towards teaching. The findings suggest that differences in autonomy-supportive teaching may account, at least in part, for the differential impact of teachers and TAs on academic progress as revealed by recent large-scale research in the UK. Furthermore, they identify social-contextual variables that should be considered when attempting to promote autonomy-supportive teaching and educators’ motivation towards teaching." .

A required quantitative business class was taught as a flipped classroom in an attempt to improve student satisfaction in the course and reduce the ‘transactional distance’ (perceived barriers to engaging with the instructor, other students, technology, and course content) and increase satisfaction. Analysis indicated improvements to both transactional distance and student satisfaction in the flipped classroom. Multiple regression analysis quantified the extent of which each transactional distance was a predictor of student satisfaction. The improved satisfaction in the flipped classroom was predicted by the improvement in transactional distances between students, students and the instructor, and students and the instructional technology used in the class. The conclusions from this study suggest that the flipped classroom is a particularly good pedagogical strategy for quantitative classes. It allows the instructor to increase student satisfaction (a win for the students) in a course in which it is usually low without compromising academic standards (a win for the teachers). Finally, increased satisfaction leads to increased retention and hence increased revenues for the institution, which is a win for the administration." .

This study aims to reveal whether the better achievement in clinical training of students selected on the basis of their extracurricular activities could be explained by persistent participation in extracurricular activities during medical school (msECAs). Lottery-admitted and selected student admission groups were compared on their participation in three types of msECAs: (1) research master, (2) important board positions or (3) additional degree programme. Logistic regression was used to measure the effect of admission group on participation in any msECA, adjusted for pre-university GPA. Two-way ANCOVA was used to examine the inter-relationships between admission group, participation in msECAs and clerkship grade, with pre-university GPA as covariate. Significantly more selected students compared to lottery-admitted students participated in any msECA. Participation in msECAs was associated with a higher pre-university GPA for lottery-admitted students only, whereas participation in msECAs was associated with higher clerkship grades for selected students only. These results suggest that persistent participation in extracurricular activities of selected students favours better clinical achievement, supporting the inclusion of ECAs in the selection procedure. More insight in the rationale behind participation in extracurricular activities during medical school may explain differences found between lottery-admitted and selected students." .

This study aimed to narrow this knowledge gap by exploring the design and use of MCSs in schools and by LEAs and the relationships between the design and use of MCSs and student performance. A case study approach was applied, building on interviews with headmasters and other employees in six schools and three LEAs, in addition to plans, reports, student performance measures and other types of public information. The case studies provide insight into the design and use of MCSs on the school and LEA levels and how MCSs might substitute for and complement each other. The findings suggest that learning-focused design and use of MCSs and flexible organization of students and teaching are factors that are positively related to student performance. This study also suggests that clan control based in a learning focus instilled in teachers during their professional education and training, and facilitated by a flexible and transparent school organization, may moderate or substitute for the role of learning-focused MCSs. Finally, it proposes that a learning focus on the LEA level in small and unified LEAs might substitute for a school-level learning focus." .

This new situation foregrounded the questions of what students are learning in the degree programmes of European countries and how to compare their achievements. Therefore, we conceptualised a valid and reliable ‘level’ construct that included a cognitive (‘disciplinary thinking’) and an affective aspect (‘professional attitude’). The main research question for our exploratory study was: ‘What procedure can lead to a valid and reliable cross-national comparison of degree programme levels?’ To achieve this comparison, we designed a Three-Step Procedure, in which level was operationalised (step 1), measured and analysed (step 2), and compared cross-nationally (step 3). The study was conducted in collaboration with four bachelor programmes in Hotel Management from four European countries; a total of 783 participants were involved. Four themes were generated to operationalise the concept of level: professional management, hospitality business research, leading management, and strategic management; their respective learning outcomes were measured with a questionnaire. Principal component analysis identified the conceptualised themes and measured their components with eigenvalues ≥1, which explained 66 % of the variance. The reliability of the components exceeded a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.70. Analysis of the components and of the single samples showed strong validity and reliability for the learning outcomes. Thus, we believe this study has produced a rigorous means to compare degree programme levels across countries." .

We investigate if continuous in-task (IT) or end-task feedback (ET) is more effective in teaching spinal anaesthesia to medical students. End-task feedback was hypothesized to improve both short-term and long-term procedural learning retention as experiential learning promotes active learning after encountering errors during practice. Upon exposure to a 5-min instructional video, students randomized to IT or ET feedbacks were trained using a spinal simulator mannequin. A blinded expert tested the students using a spinal anaesthesia checklist in the short term (immediate) and long-term (average 4 months). Sixty-five students completed the training and testing. There were no differences in demographics of age or gender within IT or ET distributions. Both short-term and long-term learning retention of spinal anaesthesia ET feedback proved to be better (P < 0.01) than IT feedback. The time taken for ET students was shorter at long-term testing. End-task feedback improves both short-term and long-term procedural learning retention." .

In this Reflection, the authors discuss motives for educational inflation and suggest that these are likely innocent, well-intentioned, and subconscious—and include both a propensity to increase expectations of ourselves and others over time, and a reluctance to reduce training content and expectations. They then discuss potential risks of educational inflation, including reduced emphasis on core knowledge and clinical skills, and adverse effects on the emotional, psychological, and financial wellbeing of students. While acknowledging the need to change curricula to improve learning and clinical outcomes, the authors proffer that it is naïve to assume that we can inflate educational expectations at no additional cost. They suggest that before implementing and/or mandating change, we should consider of all the costs that medical schools and students might incur, including opportunity costs and the impact on the emotional and financial wellbeing of students. They propose a cost-effectiveness framework for medical education and advocate prioritization of interventions that improve learning outcomes with no additional costs or are cost-saving without adversely impacting learning outcomes. When there is an additional cost for improved learning outcomes or a decline in learning outcomes as a result of cost saving interventions, they suggest careful consideration and justification of this trade-off. And when there are neither improved learning outcomes nor cost savings they recommend resisting the urge to change." .

The paper is based on discussions within and beyond the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Education Community since 2012 as well as an analysis of curriculum developments in five different countries. Emerging themes have been discussed with reference to important perspectives from curriculum theory including “powerful knowledge” as a key element of entitlement and management of the growth of expertise. Based on this analysis we have identified areas of consensus as well as constraints, risks and issues that are still subject to controversy. There is an emerging consensus of the importance of Computer Science and the nature of its “powerful knowledge”. Furthermore current understanding of the opportunities and benefits for starting to learn Computer Science early in primary schools has identified this early start as an entitlement and equity issue. There is a strong consensus that teacher professional development in Computer Science Education is critical for supporting curriculum change and is currently a major challenge in many countries. Other key issues include understanding how the growth of expertise affects potential structure and sequencing in the curriculum and the balance of content. Further considerations include how new technological opportunities interact with pedagogical approaches and can provide new potential for the growth of expertise." .

Yet in this paper, the difficulties encountered with the original notion of situated learning once it is applied to contemporary Danish nursing education are introduced. One issue that has arisen is the analytical requirement for an educational program to be a homogeneous, singular, and social phenomenon thereby discounting the varied and different sites and materialities found within nursing education. By using the materiality of the hospital bed as an empirical example of the way materiality also shapes practices, an alternative understanding of situated participation can emerge. This approach allows different sites and materialities to be conceptualized as equally genuine parts of the situated leaning framework. I suggest the notion of multi-configured learning, which captures the heterogeneity and materiality encountered during ethnographic fieldwork at a Danish nursing school." .

Moreover, about 30% of the Brazilian deaf community is illiterate in Brazilian Portuguese due to difficulties to offer deaf children an inclusive environment based on bilingual education. Currently, the prevailing teaching practice depends heavily on verbal language and on written material, making the inclusion of the deaf a challenging task. This paper presents the author’s approach for tackling this problem and improving deaf students’ accessibility to written material in order to help them master Brazilian Portuguese as a second language. We describe an ongoing project aimed at developing an automatic Brazilian Portuguese-to-Libras translation system that presents the translated content via an animated virtual human, or avatar. The paper describes the methodology adopted to compile a source language corpus having the deaf student needs in central focus. It also describes the construction of a parallel Brazilian Portuguese/Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) corpus based on motion capture technology. The envisioned translation architecture includes the definition of an Intermediate Language to drive the signing avatar. The results of a preliminary assessment of signs intelligibility highlight the application potential." .

However, such studies have not considered the psychological factors affecting users of the new technology, only external factors, such as the range of affordable robotic platforms and ready-for-lesson materials for a robot-assisted learning environment. It is necessary to extend the use of robots and cloud platforms to support education for sustainable development. To that end, this study first assessed the possibility of using robots in education for sustainable development by providing them to children from low-income families, since they often show abnormal behaviors and have few opportunities to access robots in education. The long-term changes in their behavior resulting from this outreach program were examined. Qualitative as well as quantitative methods were used to evaluate and discuss the changes in self-efficacy and learning attitudes of students during the year. Second, we proposed a technology acceptance model, termed RSAM, for teachers in robot-assisted learning environments with a cloud service platform. Acceptance factors were estimated using a weighted average method based on teacher focus group interviews. The challenges associated with robot-assisted learning considering cloud services are discussed." .

To promote deliberate and meaningful learning self-regulated learning skills are foundational. We explored trainees’ learning activities related to patient encounters to better understand what aspects of self-regulated learning contribute to trainees’ development, and to explore supervisor’s role herein. We conducted a qualitative non-participant observational study in seven general practices. During two days we observed trainee’s patient encounters, daily debriefing sessions and educational meetings between trainee and supervisor and interviewed them separately afterwards. Data collection and analysis were iterative and inspired by a phenomenological approach. To organise data we used networks, time-ordered matrices and codebooks. Self-regulated learning supported trainees to increasingly perform independently. They engaged in self-regulated learning before, during and after encounters. Trainees’ activities depended on the type of medical problem presented and on patient, trainee and supervisor characteristics. Trainees used their sense of confidence to decide if they could manage the encounter alone or if they should consult their supervisor. They deliberately used feedback on their performance and engaged in reflection. Supervisors appeared vital in trainees’ learning by reassuring trainees, discussing experience, knowledge and professional issues, identifying possible unawareness of incompetence, assessing performance and securing patient safety. Self-confidence, reflection and feedback, and support from the supervisor are important aspects of self-regulated learning in practice. The results reflect how self-regulated learning and self-entrustment promote trainees’ increased participation in the workplace. Securing organized moments of interaction with supervisors is beneficial to trainees’ self-regulated learning." .

Three types of participation statuses used in this paper are the contributor, the target and the unaddressed recipient.

Most often, leadership styles are self-taught by observation and practice. In the past, leadership was primarily defined by the tripod: research, patient care, and education. Beside the three traditional, tasks there is a business-oriented trend in health care, demanding an extreme diversity of abilities, e. g., skills in financial management, communication skills, conflict solving skills, networking, and rewarding skills. Integrating all these aspects to define the profile of a future chairperson has not been possible in the field of academic medicine. MethodsA literature search for leadership in academic medicine was performed. In addition, the contributions to the conference “Chair4Medicine” were evaluated. ResultsDespite growing requirements for a leadership position, one essential property stayed the same over the years: a leader has to educate the next generation of surgeons and be a good motivator and inspiring teacher. Concerning education, surgery is facing a dilemma, displayed by a continuing decrease of applicants in surgical disciplines over the last years. Ten to 15 years ago, the number of applications for a surgical residency position was larger than the positions available. Today, this situation is clearly reversed, as indicated by a noticeable deficit in recruits. The decision to become a surgeon has become more and more unpopular. Reasons for this development are manifold, but often-mentioned causes are a lack of work–life balance, and a chaotic and non-inspiring training process combined with non-attractive leadership styles. ConclusionsThere is a need for defining objective criteria to identify a future chair in an academic medical center. If the ongoing trend of decreased applications in general surgery continues, we will face a lack of top-motivated surgeons in the close future. More than ever, leadership styles and centers have to rethink their way of teaching and define a new way of being “attractive” for young surgical residents to guarantee the succession of the next generation. Educational opportunities, a clearly structured curriculum, and a productive environment are assumed crucial prerequisites for the next generation. Objective guidelines and instruments for the improvement of education should be developed and implemented." .

The school has a number of high needs families requiring extensive support from school staff. Pre and post intervention data was collected on the time spent on social problems in the school community. These included managing students with behavioural and emotional issues, providing support and practical assistance to parents with problems and liaising with agencies to access support for students and families. Pre and post intervention Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires were completed by teachers whose students and families were clients of the FSW (n = 8) and compared with non clients (n = 10). Semi-structured interviews were held with FSW clients (n = 6), class teachers (n = 3) the assistant principal, principal and the FSW. Employing a FSW showed a reduction in the amount of time spent on welfare cases for teachers, and therefore a monetary saving for the school. Qualitative data collected from school staff and FSW clients was overwhelmingly positive. Having a FSW based at a primary school provides savings in teacher time, and expenses to the school. Teachers are freed to concentrate on education and the parents valued the relationship provided by the FSW." .

The theory of instrumental genesis (Lonchamp in International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 7(2), 211–237, 2012; Rabardel and Beguin in Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science, 6(5), 429–461, 2005) explains how learners appropriate technological tools and accomplish tasks while interacting with these tools. In this study, we investigate how teachers appropriate a collaborative, dynamic geometry environment, the Virtual Math Teams with GeoGebra (VMTwG), and how their appropriation shapes their geometrical knowledge. The environment contains a chat panel and multiuser version of GeoGebra (a dynamic geometry software) that teachers share. The participants are seven middle and high school mathematics teachers who participated in a 15-week professional development course in which they collaborated synchronously in VMTwG to solve geometrical tasks. We analyzed the work of one team of two high school teachers. Our analysis shows that the teachers appropriated collaboratively technological and mathematical tools, which supported their mathematical problem solving. These tools enabled them to manipulate and explore geometric objects and to notice and discuss relations among them. Our study contributes an analysis of longitudinal data to understand the co-emergence of learners’ collaborative appropriation of digital technologies and their construction of mathematical knowledge. This study suggests further research to understand how to orchestrate learners’ appropriation of collaborative technological tools in which instructors are not contemporaneously present during learners’ problem-solving activity." .

However, in most existing adaptive educational systems, the black-box modeling of learner and instructional models based on the views of a few designers or experts tended to drive the adaptation of learning content. However, different sources of uncertainty could affect these views, including how accurately the proposed adaptive educational methods actually assess student responses and the corresponding uncertainties associated with how students receive and comprehend the resulting instruction. E-learning environments contain high levels of linguistic uncertainties, whereby students can interpret and act on the same terms, words, or methods (e.g., course difficulty, length of study time, or preferred learning style) in various ways according to varying levels of motivation, pre-knowledge, cognition, and future plans. Thus, one adaptive instructional model does not fit the needs of all students. Basing the instruction model on determining learners’ interactions within the learning environment in interpretable and easily read white-box models is crucial for adapting the model to students’ needs and understanding how learning is realized. This paper presents a new zSlices-based type-2 fuzzy-logic-based system that can learn students’ preferred knowledge delivery needs based on their characteristics and current levels of knowledge to generate an adaptive learning environment. We have evaluated the proposed system’s efficiency through various large-scale, real-world experiments involving 1871 students from King Abdulaziz University. These experiments demonstrate the proposed zSlices type-2 fuzzy-logic-based system’s capability for handling linguistic uncertainties to produce better performance, particularly in terms of enhanced student performance and improved success rates compared with interval type-2 fuzzy logic, type-1 fuzzy systems, adaptive, instructor-led systems, and non-adaptive systems." .

Few studies have considered the potential effects of school-related factors, such as school placement stability and school engagement, on youth outcomes. ObjectiveThe current study examined the potential main effects of school placement stability and engagement on academic achievement and mental health. Furthermore, we examined whether school-related factors moderated the association between home placement stability and youth outcomes. MethodsParticipants included 420 youth (age 6–14 at baseline) placed in out-of-home care participating in a national longitudinal study of youth in contact with the child welfare system. Youth, caregivers, and caseworkers provided relevant information at baseline, 18, and 36 months. Hierarchical regression models were constructed to test potential main and moderating effects of school engagement and school placement stability on youth mental health and academic achievement prospectively, while accounting for relevant covariates. ResultsSchool placement stability was an independent predictor of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but was not significantly associated with academic outcomes. Furthermore, there were no main effects of school engagement or home placement stability on youth outcomes and school-related factors did not moderate the relationship between home placement stability and youth outcomes. ConclusionFor children and adolescents who do not have the benefit of a stable, safe, or caring home environment, school stability may be contribute to an environment that can foster healthy development." .

Damit steht mittlerweile die Frage nach geeigneten Lehrmethoden und Lehrmaterial im Vordergrund. Bereits vor 5 Jahren begann in Südtirol eine Unterrichtung bei 20.000 11–13-jährigen Schülern mit dem Selbstinstruktionskit MiniAnne®. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es zu erheben, inwieweit diese Schulkinder 6 Monate nach der MiniAnne®-Schulung in der Lage sind, Reanimation durchzuführen und wo nachgebessert werden sollte. Material und MethodenDie praktischen Fertigkeiten von 111 Schülern nach einem videobasierten Hands-On-Training wurden in einer 5‑minütigen Reanimationssituation anhand von Resusci Anne Skill Reporter erhoben. ErgebnisseÜber 96 % der Schüler führten Laienreanimation durch. Die Herangehensweise an eine leblose Person und die hierbei erforderlichen Maßnahmen wurde von 5,7 % in korrekter Reihenfolge durchgeführt. Die korrekte Drucktiefe wurde von 1,9 % erreicht, die erreichte Drucktiefe korrelierte dabei mit Geschlecht und Gewicht. Nur 3,8 % der Schüler gelang es, die Testpuppe zu beatmen. Die No-Flow Fraction betrug 34,4 %. SchlussfolgerungDie Umsetzung in die Praxis gelingt nur sehr begrenzt. Es wird vorgeschlagen, das Lehrmaterial zu verbessern sowie zu vereinfachen und das praktische Üben auch in höheren Schulklassen zu wiederholen. Dies dient dazu, Routine zu entwickeln und mit dem körperlichen Wachstum der Jugendlichen den Zielvorgaben näher zu kommen. Die konkreten Empfehlungen beziehen sich zwar auf die Unterrichtung mit MiniAnne®, der Transfer der Theorie in die Praxis spielt jedoch bei Laienreanimation immer eine Rolle, sodass die Empfehlungen grundsätzlich unabhängig von der Lehrmethode sind." .

This comparison allows us to detect errors which require specific attention in instruction due to its persistence and to identify errors that disappear as students advance in their study of algebra. The results and conclusions have a pedagogic value to inform instruction and also lead to backed conjectures and research questions to push forward research on student’s translation capacity and students’ knowledge of algebraic symbolism." .

Rapid structural economic changes, the importance of innovation, and a shorter lifecycle of products require education systems to adjust to the needs of economies and individuals. Educational reforms in many countries aim to improve school students’ readiness for their important move to post-school life. Countries organize different pathways for students following secondary school level that are designed to meet both students’ demands and the needs of economies. This article explores Hong Kong students’ aspirations and realities. Although the majority of students plan to complete the final year of high school and 91.5% planned to undertake the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) to be eligible for higher education, in reality a significant number of school leavers do not perform well and should undertake training for employment. In addition, many students who are eligible for tertiary education cannot be admitted to government sponsored universities due to the limited number of places. This article begins with a consideration of students’ aspirations, and then outlines the realities of transition and current issues. It concludes with some suggested policy measures that could improve equity during this school to work transition period." .

It is based on results from one of the first schools in Finland where all the new students were provided with iPads at the start of their studies. Data consists of: (i) 127 short stories written by students about how they would advise a new teacher and a new student to use iPads in teaching and learning, and (ii) four group discussions on the same topics. Qualitative thematic analysis of the data was guided by the TPACK framework. Results suggest that: (i) teachers’ pedagogical approaches changed little in response to the new devices and remained largely teacher-centred, and (ii) students do not have the confidence to radically change learning styles to take advantage of the affordances of the devices. The value that iPads add to teaching and learning is difficult to quantify because of the complex and often conflicting factors involved. Overall, the findings imply that teachers’ TPACK is generally resistant to change and students’ proto-TPACK is insufficiently developed to initiate change. An approach that systematically develops both students’ and teachers’ TPACK is advocated." .

Primary care is an area of practice that offers a promising option for interprofessional student learning. In this study, we investigated what and how students from differing professions learn together. Our findings inform the design of future interprofessional education initiatives. Using activity theory, we conducted an ethnographic investigation of interprofessional education in primary care. During a 5 months period, we observed 14 clinic sessions involving mixed discipline student teams who interviewed people with chronic disease. Teams were comprised of senior medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy and physiotherapy entry level students. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with seven clinical educators. Data were analysed to ascertain the objectives, tools, rules and division of labour. Two integrated activity systems were identified: (1) student teams gathering information to determine patients’ health care needs and (2) patients either as health consumers or student educators. Unwritten rules regarding ‘shared contribution’, ‘patient as key information source’ and ‘time constraints’ were identified. Both the significance of software literacy on team leadership, and a pre-determined structure of enquiry, highlighted the importance of careful consideration of the tools used in interprofessional education, and the way they can influence practice. The systems of practice identified provide evidence of differing priorities and values, and multiple perspectives of how to manage health. The work reinforced the value of the patients’ voice in clinical and education processes." .

The use of an online professional learning community can provide professional development opportunities including courses, activities, and interactions with peers; thus, teachers can get together to share their resources, solve problems, develop working strategies, and improve their performance. In this study, peer coaching consists of four factors: academic support, technical support, emotional support, and reflective support. The authors collected self-reports regarding peer coaching behavior from 376 members of online professional learning communities in China. Data analyses and investigations of logs showed that the teachers had rated themselves as slightly above the average in all the factors of peer coaching. Peer coaching was mainly composed of reflective support and emotional support. Male teachers tended to provide more technical support, and senior teachers tended to provide more academic support and less technical support. The teachers with 6–10 years of teaching experience scored lowest in the construct of technical support. There was no significant difference between primary school and junior high school teachers. The findings of this study suggest that the development of teachers’ pedagogical, content, and technological knowledge (TPACK) may help to improve the effect of peer coaching and conducting training for teachers before the peer coaching process may help." .

MethodsFour steps of the iterative process of Intervention Mapping (IM) to adapt this protocol were carried out: (1) performing a needs assessment and defining a program objective, (2) determining the performance and change objectives, (3) identifying theory-based methods and practical strategies and (4) developing a program plan. Interviews with students using structured questionnaires, in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders, a literature research and, finally, a pilot implementation were carried out. ResultsA sick leave protocol was developed that was feasible and acceptable for all stakeholders. The main barriers for widespread implementation are time constraints in both monitoring and acting upon sick leave by school and youth health care. ConclusionsThe iterative process of IM has shown its merits in the adaptation of the manual ‘A quick return to school is much better’ to a sick leave protocol for vocational school students." .

This complex scenario called superdiversity has been conceptualised to help illuminate significant interactions of variables such as religion, language, gender, age, nationality, labour market and population distribution on a larger scale. The interrelationships of these themes have fundamental implications in a variety of community environments, but especially within our schools. Today, London schools have over 300 languages being spoken by students, all of whom have diverse backgrounds, bringing with them a wealth of experience and, most critically, their own set of religious beliefs. At the same time, Science is a compulsory subject in England’s national curriculum, where it requires teachers to deal with important scientific frameworks about the world; teaching about the origins of the universe, life on Earth, human evolution and other topics, which are often in conflict with students’ religious views. In order to cope with this dynamic and thought-provoking environment, science initial teacher education (SITE)—especially those catering large urban centres—must evolve to equip science teachers with a meaningful understanding of how to handle a superdiverse science classroom, taking the discourse of inclusion beyond its formal boundaries. Thus, this original position paper addresses how the role of SITE may be re-conceptualised and re-framed in light of the immense challenges of superdiversity as well as how science teachers, as enactors of the science curriculum, must adapt to cater to these changes. This is also the first in a series of papers emerging from an empirical research project trying to capture science teacher educators’ own views on religio-scientific issues and their positions on the place of these issues within science teacher education and the science classroom." .

In an effort to assist learners in their scholastic activities, these studies have attempted to understand a learner’s mental states by analyzing participants’ facial images, eye movements, and other physiological indices and data. To add to this growing body of research, we have been developing the intelligent mentoring system (IMS), which performs automatic mentoring by using an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to scaffold learning activities and an ontology to provide a specification of learner’s models. To identify learner’s mental states, the ontology operates on the basis of the theoretical and data-driven knowledge of emotions. In this study, we use statistical models to examine constructs of emotions evaluated in previous psychological studies and then produce a construct of academic boredom. In concrete terms, we develop ontological descriptions of academic boredom that are represented with statistical models. To evaluate the validity and utility of the descriptions, we conduct an experiment to obtain subjective responses regarding learners’ academic emotions in their university course and describe them as instances on the basis of the ontological descriptions." .

It addresses the problem of providing technology-driven pedagogical support to an e-Learner to achieve the desired cognitive state of mastery which is endowed by high levels of both knowledge and confidence. As per best of our knowledge concerned, no prior work has been done in the area of CBeL. The issue is crucial in the present scenario of teaching–learning in the twenty-first century where lifelong learning is gaining increasing importance vis-à-vis traditional classroom teaching–learning. However, self-learning is an indispensable mode of lifelong learning. It is felt that e-learning systems should have the capacity to simulate the behavior a human expert to identify the gap between the learners’ cognitive state and the learning objective with the intension of guiding the self-learner take initiative to bridge the gap with appropriate action and eventually achieve his learning objective. An artificial neural network-based intelligent recognizer has been designed to identify the CBeL state of the learner on the basis of his performance in a CBeL test. This recognizer is the major agent that facilitates the implementation of the proposed CBeL system. Extensive experimentation has been carried out to ensure the performance of the recognizer. Results show ample evidence that the ANN-based intelligent recognizer is able to faithfully simulate the behavior of a human evaluator." .

ObjectiveWe conducted a two-armed experiment to evaluate student satisfaction and content mastery for an introductory pediatric radiology topic, taught by either an interactive digital game or with a traditional didactic lecture. Materials and methodsMedical students participating in a fourth-year radiology elective were invited to participate. Student cohorts were alternatively given a faculty-supervised 1h session playing a simple interactive digital Tic-tac-toe quiz module on pediatric gastrointestinal radiology or a 1h didactic introductory lecture on the same topic. Survey questions assessed the learners’ perceived ability to recall the material as well as their satisfaction with the educational experience. Results of an end-of-rotation exam were reviewed to evaluate a quantitative measure of learning between groups. Survey responses were analyzed with a chi-squared test. Exam results for both groups were analyzed with a paired Student’s t-test. ResultsStudents in the lecture group had higher test scores compared to students in the game group (4.0/5 versus 3.6/5, P = 0.045). Students in the lecture group reported greater understanding and recall of the material than students in the game group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Students in the lecture group perceived the lecture to be more enjoyable and a better use of their time compared to those in the game group (P = 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the lecture and game group in ability to maintain interest (P = 0.187). In comparison to pre-survey results, there was a statistically significant decrease in interest for further digital interactive materials reported by students in the game group (P = 0.146). ConclusionOur experience supported the use of a traditional lecture over a digital game module. While these results might be affected by the specific lecture and digital content in any given comparison, a digital module is not always the superior option." .

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the use of cognitive apprenticeship theory with the primary aim of understanding how and to what extent the theory has been applied to the design, implementation, and analysis of education in the health sciences. The initial search yielded 149 articles, with 45 excluded because they contained the term “cognitive apprenticeship” only in reference list. The remaining 104 articles were categorized using a theory talk coding scheme. An in depth qualitative synthesis and review was conducted for the 26 articles falling into the major theory talk category. Application of cognitive apprenticeship theory tended to focus on the methods dimension (e.g., coaching, mentoring, scaffolding), with some consideration for the content and sociology dimensions. Cognitive apprenticeship was applied in various disciplines (e.g., nursing, medicine, veterinary) and educational settings (e.g., clinical, simulations, online). Health sciences education researchers often used cognitive apprenticeship to inform instructional design and instrument development. Major recommendations from the literature included consideration for contextual influences, providing faculty development, and expanding application of the theory to improve instructional design and student outcomes. This body of research provides critical insight into cognitive apprenticeship theory and extends our understanding of how to develop expert thinking in health sciences students. New research directions should apply the theory into additional aspects of health sciences educational research, such as classroom learning and interprofessional education." .

We rely on a law change that raised compulsory schooling from 5 to 8 years in Turkey to address the endogeneity of education to happiness. Our study shows that, for females, earning at least a middle school diploma increases the likelihood of being happy and the probability of being satisfied with various life domains. Descriptive tests suggest that being hopeful about one’s own future well-being partly explains the relationship between women’s schooling and happiness. For males, although relatively imprecisely estimated, we find evidence that earning at least a middle school degree results in a decline in subjective well-being. Supplemental analysis develops evidence consistent with the view that an imbalance between aspirations and attainments, flowing from extended primary schooling, may be the reason behind this counterintuitive finding among men." .

That is, to provide both mathematics educators and students with several central themes that interconnect the different areas of mathematics and its applications. Such ideas should be able to guide the selection, organization and presentation of curriculum content and subsequently make mathematics more understandable for students. This article aims to offer the English-speaking reader an overview of important stages in the specific development of the understanding of fundamental ideas within the German-speaking community of mathematics education. It embeds this line of research within the subject matter didactics tradition that this volume is dedicated to and it draws comparisons to and discusses relations between “Grundvorstellungen” and fundamental ideas." .

As a result clinical learning is highly demanding for students. Because of large differences between students, supervisors may not know how to support them in their learning process. We explored patterns in undergraduate students’ self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment, to improve tailored supervision, using Q-methodology. Q-methodology uses features of both qualitative and quantitative methods for the systematic investigation of subjective issues by having participants sort statements along a continuum to represent their opinion. We enrolled 74 students between December 2014 and April 2015 and had them characterize their learning behavior by sorting 52 statements about self-regulated learning behavior and explaining their response. The statements used for the sorting were extracted from a previous study. The data was analyzed using by-person factor analysis to identify clusters of individuals with similar sorts of the statements. The resulting factors and qualitative data were used to interpret and describe the patterns that emerged. Five resulting patterns were identified in students’ self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment, which we labelled: Engaged, Critically opportunistic, Uncertain, Restrained and Effortful. The five patterns varied mostly regarding goals, metacognition, communication, effort, and dependence on external regulation for learning. These discrete patterns in students’ self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment are part of a complex interaction between student and learning context. The results suggest that developing self-regulated learning behavior might best be supported regarding individual students’ needs." .

The study was carried out among language art teachers (N = 34) and their students (N = 534) in the last year of primary school (ninth grade) in Estonia. Multilevel modeling was used to test the hypotheses of relationships between students’ metacognitive knowledge and reading comprehension, while controlling for students’ previous reading comprehension (in eighth grade) as well as the relations between teachers’ metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies and students’ metacognitive knowledge and comprehension. The results showed that students’ metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies related to their reading comprehension, concurring with previous findings. The main finding was that teachers’ metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies significantly related to their students’ metacognitive knowledge, but not to reading comprehension. These results indicate that students’ reading comprehension may be supported by improving their metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of teachers’ metacognitive knowledge in students’ metacognitive knowledge." .

We take a sociocultural approach to the analysis of how material and digital learning resources become tools for thinking and reasoning. We combined ethnographic descriptions with analysis of video records of classroom interactions in a high school and examined how a teacher and a group of students engaged in a computer-supported collaborative inquiry. Our results show that students through inquiry are enabled to make sense of concepts and their experiences with resources and also to use science concepts as explanatory tools. However, this is mediated by the teachers’ practices for supporting students, such as providing relevant clues for them to continue their inquiry, eliciting their initial understanding of concepts thereby making them available for further development, pressing for explanations, and reformulating their explanations. The teacher is continuously alternating between withdrawing and making students inquire by themselves and supporting their inquiry. In and through such social interactions, materials and digital tools become tools for thinking. We argue that one of the practical implications of our study is that it is crucial that teachers explicitly draw students into their system of activity throughout the entire learning trajectory and that the teachers and students together make sense of science concepts for explaining energy transformation." .

This paper reports on the development of pre-vocational skills laboratory (PVS-Lab), a Web-based learning environment aiming to support students with ASD towards developing pre-vocational and employment skills. The first section addresses theoretical foundations and the design framework of PVS-Lab, as well as the structure and the functionality of the system. Following a particular intervention is presented including the analysis of the engagement of an autistic student with PVS-Lab and his tutors’ monitoring, based on a psychophysiological signal recording system. The paper concludes with the need to advance future research towards new learning environments that can help (a) students with autism to acquire pre-vocational skills, and (b) tutors to harness the potential of multiple forms of information (PVS-Lab system log files, psychophysiological data, video records and observation notes) towards designing effective individualized interventions." .

The resultant tensions have not been well characterized, yet their existence suggests that different uses may maintain some value for the user that needs to be better understood. We conducted an empirical form of Discourse Analysis to document the multiple ways in which validity is described, understood, and used in the health professions education field. We created and analyzed an archive of texts identified from multiple sources, including formal databases such as PubMED, ERIC and PsycINFO as well as the authors’ personal assessment libraries. An iterative analytic process was used to identify, discuss, and characterize emerging discourses about validity. Three discourses of validity were identified. Validity as a test characteristic is underpinned by the notion that validity is an intrinsic property of a tool and could, therefore, be seen as content and context independent. Validity as an argument-based evidentiary-chain emphasizes the importance of supporting the interpretation of assessment results with ongoing analysis such that validity does not belong to the tool/instrument itself. The emphasis is on process-based validation (emphasizing the journey instead of the goal). Validity as a social imperative foregrounds the consequences of assessment at the individual and societal levels, be they positive or negative. The existence of different discourses may explain—in part—results observed in recent systematic reviews that highlighted discrepancies and tensions between recommendations for practice and the validation practices that are actually adopted and reported. Some of these practices, despite contravening accepted validation ‘guidelines’, may nevertheless respond to different and somewhat unarticulated needs within health professional education." .

Therefore, students’ social skills are assumed to play an important role for school performance. This study set out to investigate the links between students’ peer relations skills and assertion skills and their grades for written performances and oral performances. In the middle of the school year, 94 ninth-grade students of a German secondary school reported on their peer relations skills and assertion skills. Additionally, at this point of measurement, students’ initial school performance in German and mathematics was measured by standardized academic achievement tests. In these two subjects, students’ grades in in-class tests and for oral participation were collected during the following 5 months. These grades were given by the students’ respective subject teachers. Path analysis revealed that students’ peer relations skills were positively associated with their grades in in-class tests, but they were not linked to their grades for oral participation. In contrast, students’ assertion skills were positively related to their grades for oral participation, whereas no correlation was found between students’ assertion skills and their grades in in-class tests. These results are discussed with respect to the role of peer relations skills and assertion skills for students’ academic learning and the fostering of these skills in the classroom." .

The aim of the study was to assess the (a) use, (b) acceptability and (c) impact of booklets for students in primary (10–11 years) and secondary school (12–13 years) alone and in conjunction with funding for targeted mental health support. This was a 2 × 2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial, in which 846 schools in England were randomly allocated to receive/not receive: (1) booklets for students containing information on mental health self-management and help seeking, and (2) funding for mental health support as part of a national mental health initiative. 14,690 students (8139 primary, 6551 secondary) provided self-report on mental health, quality of life (baseline and 1 year follow-up) and help seeking (follow-up). (a) Approximately, 40 % primary school students and 20 % secondary school students reported seeing the booklets. (b) Of these, 87 % of primary school students reported that the booklet was ‘very helpful’ or ‘quite helpful’, compared with 73 % in secondary school. (c) There was no detectable impact of booklets on mental health, quality of life or help seeking, either alone or in conjunction with additional funding through the national mental health initiative. Lack of discernable impact of booklets underscores the need for caution in adopting such an approach. However, it is feasible that the impact was obscured by low uptake or that booklets may be more effective when used in a targeted way." .

Bislang existieren nur einzelne neurologische Podcasts. Sie decken keine relevanten neurologischen Krankheitsbilder oder neuroanatomische Inhalte ab. Ziel der ArbeitZiel des vorgestellten Projekts war es, Medizinstudierenden das Erlernen neurologischer Inhalte zu erleichtern und sie aktiv in die didaktische Arbeit mit einzubeziehen. Material und MethodenDas Projekt wurde 2014 begonnen. Die Podcasts werden von Studierenden selbst geschrieben und produziert. Bislang entstanden zehn Audiopodcasts zu Neuroanatomie und klinischer Neurologie. Sie wurden im Juni 2015 an der Universität Witten/Herdecke veröffentlicht und intern evaluiert. Die Podcasts wurden u. a. bezüglich Hörerlebnis und Verständlichkeit beurteilt, daneben konnten die Befragten die Podcasts einzeln bewerten und sich in Freitextfeldern äußern. ErgebnisseInsgesamt 100 Studierende nahmen an der Befragung teil. Sie hörten die CDs insbesondere zur Prüfungsvorbereitung (47,4 %) sowie aus Interesse am Fach (26,3 %). Die Podcasts wurden überwiegend mit „sehr gut/gut “ beurteilt. 76,8 % gaben an, die Podcasts wieder hören zu wollen, 93 % wollen sie Freunden weiterempfehlen. Als verbesserungswürdig wurden die Länge einzelner Podcasts sowie technische Unreinheiten angegeben. DiskussionDie Neurologie-Podcasts der Universität Witten/Herdecke sind ein erfolgreiches Projekt und werden sehr gut angenommen. Anhand der Evaluation sollen nun Verbesserungsvorschläge eingearbeitet und Themenwünschen nachgekommen werden. Aktuell sind 15 weitere Podcasts in der Endbearbeitung. Mit den nächsten Podcasts ist im Frühjahr 2016 zu rechnen." .

In an effort to increase the amount of writing in the primary grades that leads to later literacy success, it is important that teachers engage in instructional practices that align with how early writing skills develop in young children. To this end, early childhood teachers and teacher educators can benefit from an enhanced understanding of the writing instructional practices teachers have engaged in and the associated challenges they have experienced as they respond to the expectation to increase writing experiences in their classrooms. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine how five K-2 teachers perceived, implemented, and reflected on writing instruction in their classrooms. Using a case study design, researchers examined interview, survey, and observational data, resulting in an in-depth description and analysis of the writing instructional experiences of these five teachers. Qualitative analyses identified two meta-themes related to writing instruction: opportunities and obstacles. Implications for K-2 teacher preparation and professional development are discussed." .

This study examined students’ evaluation of clinical rotations, their self-rated performance, and where they felt the most deficits exist. Medical students answered an online questionnaire surveying the following aspects: an evaluation of their internship; supervision; integration in the team and improvement of field-specific knowledge; the qualities of taking a patient’s medical history by empathy; patient-centeredness; structure; target orientation; and the ability to integrate field-specific knowledge into anamnesis. The data collected indicate that rotations in Austria, especially in Vienna, were evaluated significantly worse than those abroad. Particularly the lack of supervision and integration in the team were criticized. These data stress a dire need for the reform of curricular structures during clinical rotation in the latter years of medical education." .

We are interested in solutions that satisfy consistency. Consider a problem and a recommendation made by the solution for the problem. Suppose some students are removed with their positions in schools. Consider the “reduced” problem consisting of the remaining students and the remaining positions. Consistency states that in the reduced problem, the solution should assign each remaining student to the same school as initially. Neither the immediate acceptance rule (also known as the Boston mechanism) nor the top trading cycles rules is consistent. We show that the Pareto solution is the smallest consistent solution containing the immediate acceptance rule. It is also the smallest consistent solution containing the top trading cycles rule." .

The researcher sought to explore how participants experienced their Western DMT education. Six participants were recruited from four East Asian countries: Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan, and participated in individual interviews. The NVivo10 software program was used as a tool to ensure efficient organization. Peer debriefing and member checking were used in different phases of data analysis to enhance internal validity. Ultimately, data analysis revealed four themes and 15 categories. The four themes that emerged were (a) challenges in DMT training in the U.S.; (b) contrasts between classroom cultures; (c) aspects that helped participants to adjust in class; (d) DMT as a catalyst for personal and professional development and growth. Each theme gave rise to its own unique categories that emerged from the process of data analysis. The findings support previous studies on culturally competent teaching and differences in learning styles. The researcher hopes that this study will contribute to the creation of a meaningful and educational steppingstone between the East and West in the DMT field." .

The needs of refugee children are complex. Many have traumatic experiences and disrupted education, and are then tasked with adapting to a new culture. The literature emphasizes the importance of education in determining the future of young refugees and its potential to transform lives for those who have access to it. This article will focus on the right to education and social inclusion of refugee children in the school system from a human rights perspective. The author proposes that schools play a critical role in helping refugee children find some sense of safety and helping maximize their learning potential. This human rights and social inclusion approach requires active participation from government, school administration, the ESL and mainstream teachers, the social workers, students and their parents, refugee students and their parents, and the community to partner together to create an environment for active learning and socialization for productive citizenry in the USA. The author maintains that social work is in a unique position and suggests strategies that facilitate a broader effort toward social inclusion which is vital to the well-being of refugee children and allows them to become an integral part of society." .

This study presents an innovative project-based cloud learning (PBCL) model which integrates various Google services in order to enhance critical thinking abilities in human–computer interface design. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed SNS collaborative teaching model for HCI design, the one-group pretest–posttest experiment was adopted in a university HCI design course in Taiwan. Participants included 32 technical and vocational university students aged 20–22, all major in information science. The collected data is used to explore the change in students’ critical thinking skills. Additionally, this study also adopts an interview survey to collect qualitative data. There are 11 groups in this course, and the 11 respondents were randomly selected from these groups after the course. The results indicate that the practice of PBCL could help students to develop critical thinking skills rather than disposition. More specifically, the differences of low initial disposition group’s pre-test and post-test of CTD and CTS were significant. The qualitative interview results reveal that experimental subjects hold a positive view on integrating SNS and various Google services to human–computer interface course to enhance project design and critical thinking skills. It implies that the PBCL model is an innovative and practical teaching model to be beneficial to learners with low initial interest. In addition, it helps students deepen impression of learning content and inspire new ideas." .

Morin’s notion of transdisciplinarity spans various disciplines, both within disciplines and beyond individual disciplines. Morin’s transdisciplinary approach is inquiry driven and presents a systemic/humanistic vision and form of awareness that challenges habitually dualistic and simplistic thinking. Morin’s transdisciplinarity is based on a dialogical and translogical principle that extends classical and rigid logic and that helps students to explore and unify concepts of a simultaneous complementary and contradictory nature. Confronting students with different modes of thinking, imagining and feeling can help them to develop greater self-awareness, critical reflection, and creativity; with various frames of reference; and with an openness toward and confidence in engaging in changes needed to address global challenges in a sustainable and responsible way." .

As a result, performance should decrease in resource-sensitive text/picture comprehension tasks as compared to resource-insensitive tasks. Three hundred and thirty-seven fifth graders first completed either easy or difficult text/picture comprehension tasks and then rated their learning outcome. After that, they received bogus feedback that had been congruent or incongruent with their expectations. In addition, half of the participants were given the opportunity for self-affirmation before they completed additional easy or difficult text/picture tasks. As predicted, feedback better than expected or worse than expected impaired performance in the resource-sensitive tasks but only in the self-affirmation condition. The results are discussed with regard to central assumptions of the feedback intervention theory (Kluger and DeNisi, Psychological Bulletin, 119: 254–284, 1996) and practical implications for the provision of feedback." .

This study evaluated the efficacy of a disaster medicine curriculum recently designed for Saudi Arabian medical students. MethodsParticipants were 15 male and 14 female students in their fourth, fifth or sixth year at Jazan University Medical School, Saudi Arabia. The course was held at the Research Center in Emergency and Disaster Medicine and Computer Sciences Applied to the Medical Practice in Novara, Italy. ResultsThe overall mean score on a test given before the course was 41.0 % and it increased to 67.7 % on the post-test (Wilcoxon test for paired samples: z = 4.71, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between the mean scores of males and females, or between students in their fourth, fifth or sixth year of medical school.

The play was written in a way that might increase student understandings of the nature of science, scientific inquiry, the identity of scientists, and the work that scientists do. We collected pre-and post-play questionnaire responses and drawings of scientists from third and fourth grade students who attended the play. We also interviewed five of the ten teachers whose students attended the play. Findings indicated that most of these teachers felt strongly that their students had learned about scientific inquiry, the identity of scientists, and the work that scientists do as a result of attending the play. However, less than half of the student questionnaires and drawings of scientists indicated such growth as a result of the play. That being said, numerous students were able to tell us what they learned from the play and many questionnaire responses and drawings indicated such learning. Implications for partnerships between schools and university faculty from various disciplines in order to develop potentially impactful plays that portray authentic scientific research are discussed." .

MethodsA cross-sectional study included school-age children from two governorates in south of Egypt. A questionnaire was presented to randomly selected students. It consisted of 3 domains: Domain 1 included questions about MNE, domain 2 was about risk factors for MNE, and domain 3 was about management of MNE. ResultsThe study included 4652 students (9 ± 2 years) from 12 primary schools (51 % males and 49 % females). Of 4652 students, 834 (18 %) had NE, with no significant difference between rural and urban areas (17.5 vs. 18.4 %, p = 0.4). Younger age categories showed higher prevalence of MNE than in older children. MNE caused moderate-to-severe bother for 44.5 and 87.8 % of students and parents, respectively. Urinary tract infection, pinworm infestation, constipation, and caffeine over-consumption significantly associated with MNE. Family history of MNE was positive in 84.7 %. Daytime incontinence coexisted in 16 % of cases. Children with ≥4 siblings and birth order ≥3 had more prevalent MNE. Deep sleepers and exposure to problems/violence correlated positively with occurrence of MNE. Father’s level of education and work status, mother education, number of children per room, and socioeconomic status significantly associated with occurrence of MNE. There was no significant correlation between gender and prevalence of MNE. No treatment was used in 53.2 % of cases. ConclusionIn the Egyptian community, pinworm infestation, UTI, constipation, and overconsumption of caffeine-containing beverages are potential reversible risk factors for MNE in school-age children." .

It could be argued that mass adoption without careful attention to purpose and format may well jeopardize portfolios’ viability in health sciences education. This paper explores this proposition by addressing the following three main questions: (1) Why do portfolios meet with such resistance from students and teachers, while educators love them?; (2) Is it ethical to require students to reflect and then grade their reflections?; (3) Does competency-based education empower or hamper the learner during workplace-based learning? Twenty-five years of portfolio reveal a clear story: without mentoring, portfolios have no future and are nothing short of bureaucratic hurdles in our competency-based education programs. Moreover, comprehensive portfolios, which are integrated into the curriculum and much more diverse in content than reflective portfolios, can serve as meaningful patient charts, providing doctor and patient with useful information to discuss well-being and treatment. In this sense, portfolios are also learner charts that comprehensively document progress in a learning trajectory which is lubricated by meaningful dialogue between learner and mentor in a trusting relationship to foster learning. If we are able to make such comprehensive and meaningful use of portfolios, then, yes, portfolios do have a bright future in medical education." .

In particular, the recommender system is extremely useful in the non-formal learning environment in that it can provide differentiated learning courses according to learners’ levels to improve the learning effects, reducing the difficulties, and supporting a trial-and-error approach in choosing courses. This paper proposes a collaborative recommender system, which can improve learning performance by recommending learning courses that are appropriate to users’ learning level. The proposed recommender system, based on collaborative filtering, recommends learning courses through the developing a curriculum, student skill model and Delphi survey analysis in order to take the correlation between the learner’s profiling and the learning skills into account. As a result of the analysis of the effects of the proposed recommender system, its mean value of satisfaction was higher by 0.6 than that of the collaborative filtering recommendation; its standard deviation value appeared to be lower by 0.17, signifying that only a few values did not approximate the mean value; furthermore, the kurtosis value was lower by 0.19, indicating a concentrated data distribution around the mean value. As a result, we were able to provide differentiated learning courses to users who are experiencing difficulties with a trial-and-error approach in choosing the learning courses and to obtain a result with improved satisfaction." .

In order to improve students’ learning, the authors designed and provided flipped learning (FL) and treatment of online academic help-seeking (OAHS) in a computing course to help students develop computing skills for using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. The participants in this study were 126 undergraduates from three classes taking a compulsory course titled “Applied Information Technology: Office Software.” According to the analysis, students who received the treatment of OAHS had significantly better computing skills for using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint than those without. However, the treatment of FL did not result in better development of students’ computing skills. Based on the results obtained, the authors present possible implications for online teachers, educators, and schools, particularly to assist those students who may feel bashful and are not willing to ask questions or seek for help in traditional classrooms. This study designs and provides reference for an integration of FL with OAHS to improve students’ learning outcomes." .

Furthermore, we assessed validity of a proficiency assessment tool for stepwise graduation. Methods Teaching cases included robotic radical prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy. Procedure steps were categorized: basic, intermediate, and advanced. An assessment tool [“proficiency score” (PS)] was developed to evaluate ability to safely and autonomously complete a step. Graduation required a passing PS (PS ≥ 3) on three consecutive attempts. PS and validated global evaluative assessment of robotic skills (GEARS) were evaluated for completed steps. Linear regression was utilized to determine postgraduate year/PS relationship (construct validity). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient measured correlation between PS and GEARS evaluations (concurrent validity). Intraclass correlation (ICC) evaluated PS agreement between evaluator classes. ResultsTwenty-one robotic trainees participated within the pilot program, completing a median of 14 (2–69) cases each. Twenty-three study evaluators scored 14 (1–60) cases. Over 4 months, 229/294 (78 %) cases were designated “teaching” cases. Residents completed 91 % of possible evaluations; faculty completed 78 %. Verbal and quantitative feedback received by trainees increased significantly (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). Average PS increased with PGY (post-graduate year) for basic and intermediate steps (regression slopes: 0.402 (p < 0.0001), 0.323 (p < 0.0001), respectively) (construct validation). Overall, PS correlated highly with GEARS (ρ = 0.81, p < 0.0001) (concurrent validity). ICC was 0.77 (95 % CI 0.61–0.88) for resident evaluations. ConclusionStructured learning can be implemented in an academic robotic program with high levels of trainee and evaluator participation, encouraging both quantitative and verbal feedback. A proficiency assessment tool developed for step-specific proficiency has construct and concurrent validity." .

Touro University Nevada addressed this by developing an interprofessional team-based learning (TBL) program involving students from multiple healthcare programs: osteopathic medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and physician assistant. The TBL format provides a mechanism for accommodating a large participating student cohort while requiring a modest number of facilitators. Using TBL for IPE proved an excellent mechanism for providing students with a deeper understanding of the role of represented healthcare disciplines." .

Traditional NIE allows only one-way interaction and available media are limited. In addition, it has difficulty in capturing the latest “hot” issues or recognizing public opinions. In this paper, we propose a platform called TNIE (Twitter news in education) that utilizes Twitter in NIE. TNIE has many advantages compared to traditional NIE: (1) it classifies the latest news into various topics, (2) the classified news content can be browsed effectively via a hierarchical visualization scheme, and (3) effective discussion or debate groups can be easily formed based on the learners’ news selection. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we implemented a prototype system and performed several experiments. According to the results, our news classification scheme achieved an 87.8 % F-measure on average, which is superior to the 78.94 % of previous studies. We also had volunteers use our prototype system and evaluate its main functions, e.g., news visualization, classification, learner clustering, and collaborative learning. We report some of these evaluation results." .

Our objective was therefore to explore learning in ‘professionally distant’ contexts. Using paramedic education, where portions of training occur in hospital settings despite preparing students for out-of-hospital work, fifty-three informants (11 current students, 13 recent graduates, 16 paramedic program faculty and 13 program coordinators/directors) took part in five semi-structured focus groups. Participants reflected on the value and role of hospital placements in paramedic student development. All sessions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. In this context six educational advantages and two challenges were identified when using professionally distant learning environments. Learning could still be associated with features such as (a) engagement through “authenticity”, (b) technical skill development, (c) interpersonal skill development, (d) psychological resilience, (e) healthcare system knowledge and (f) scaffolding. Variability in learning and misalignment with learning goals were identified as potential threats. Learning environments that are professionally distant from eventual practice settings may prove meaningful by providing learners with foundational and preparatory learning experiences for competencies that may be transferrable. This suggests that where learning occurs may be less important than how the experience contributes to the learner’s development and the meaning or value he/she derives from it." .

However, the effect of self-directed use of tests as study aids by medical students on basic science examination performance has not been studied. In this study, we analyzed performance of first year medical students (n = 107) on both formative and summative examinations. Five formative examinations were administered weekly and the summative examination was administered at the end of a 5-week unit. Examinations consisted of basic science discipline test items. Prior to examinations, students were given unrestricted access to self-tests (STs) (one per formative examination). In average, each ST was used by 60% of students. On four out of five formative examinations, students who used STs performed better than those who did not use STs. There were no significant ST use-dependent performance changes for a control discipline (a discipline for which no STs were available). On the summative examination, students who used all five STs scored significantly higher on the test discipline items (86 ± 8, mean ± SD) than students who did not use STs (76 ± 14). A multiple regression analysis showed that the number of STs used was a significant positive predictor of the summative examination score. This study suggests that the use of STs as study aids improves student performance on basic science examinations in a medical school. Evidence provided by this study and our future studies should help justify the use of STs as an essential component of medical education, especially for the basic sciences." .

Specialized teachers have, in theory, received special training. To compare the experiences of teachers dealing with students with ASD in different classroom environments. A total of 245 teachers filled out four self-report questionnaires measuring perceived stress, social support, coping strategies, and burnout. Specialized teachers perceive their teaching as a challenge, can count on receiving help from colleagues, use more problem-focused coping strategies and social support seeking behavior, and are less emotionally exhausted than teachers in regular classes. This study highlights that teachers in specialized schools and classes have better adjustment, probably due to their training, experience, and tailored classroom conditions." .

Undergraduates enrolled in practicum courses completed questionnaires about their overall practicum experience including: socio-emotional components (their perceived fit with their cooperating teacher and intrapersonal feelings while in the classroom), overall practicum satisfaction, and their sense of teacher efficacy. Results revealed that practicum students generally reported feelings of being energized and relaxed, though some practicum students reported feelings of frustration in their practicum classrooms. Feeling energized and relaxed and students’ perception of fit with their cooperating teacher were positively associated with practicum satisfaction and practicum students’ teacher efficacy. Feelings of frustration were negatively associated with students’ fit with their cooperating teacher, practicum satisfaction, and students’ teacher efficacy. Higher levels of practicum satisfaction predicted higher practicum students’ teacher efficacy. Findings highlight the importance of understanding early practicum experiences and what factors of the practicum experience contribute teacher efficacy. Implications for future research and practice for early childhood teacher preparation programs are discussed." .

This study takes a qualitative approach building on the work of a 13-year-old girl as an exemplary case of the nature of young students’ spontaneous mathematical problem solving with technology. The empirical data comprise digital records of her approaches to two problems from a web-based mathematical competition where she resorted to GeoGebra and an interview where she explains and describes her usual problem solving activity with this tool. Based on a proposed model for describing the processes of mathematical problem solving with technologies (MPST), the main results show that this student’s solving and expressing the solution are held from the early and continuing interplay between mathematical skills and the perception of the affordances of the tool. The analytical model offers a clear picture of the type of actions that lead to the solution of each problem, revealing the student’s ability to deal with mathematics and technology in problem solving. By acknowledging this as a case of a human-with-media in solving mathematical problems, the students’ efficient way of merging technological and mathematical knowledge is portrayed in terms of her techno-mathematical fluency." .

However, precisely because “to construct” is a transitive verb, it occludes the fact that in learning and development, we come to know something new, that is, something unknown before and therefore something that could not be anticipated. The related concepts of surprise, astonishment, and admiration refer to phenomena through which the person acknowledges the encounter with the absolutely new, the alien, the unanticipated; and the person acknowledges having been affected something unknown before, an experience that transcends agency and manifests the passivity that comes with the encounter of the unknown. In this study, teaching for astonishment is presented and discussed as an alternative way of thinking about mathematics learning." .

The analysis relies on a difference-in-differences approach which exploits the discontinuity in program rules to compare eligible individuals to ineligible, likely undocumented immigrants before and after the program went into effect. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we focus on youths that likely met DACA’s schooling requirement when the program was announced. We find that DACA reduced the probability of school enrollment of eligible higher-educated individuals, as well as some evidence that it increased the employment likelihood of men, in particular. Together, these findings suggest that a lack of authorization may lead individuals to enroll in school when working is not a viable option. Thus, once employment restrictions are relaxed and the opportunity costs of higher education rise, eligible individuals may reduce investments in schooling." .

Data are grouped by classes, schools and geographical areas. Different models for each area are fitted, in order to properly address the heteroscedasticity of the phenomenon. The results show that it is possible to estimate statistically significant “school effects”, i.e., the positive/negative association of attending a specific school and the student’s test score, after a case-mix adjustment. Therefore, the paper’s most important message is that school effects are different in terms of magnitude and types in the three geographical macro areas (Northern, Central and Southern Italy) and are dependent on specific students’ and schools’ characteristics." .

This gap in literature leads potentially to an absence of clarity in research, education, and management, regarding responsible management among scholars and practitioners. The aim of this research is to develop a preliminary definition of responsible management, exploring the use of the term in literature and practice. Its objective is to define the main characteristics of responsible management aimed at creating a platform for discussion so as to help organizations clarify their own vision of responsible management. It builds on preliminary findings from literature review that responsible management remains undefined. As business school students are primary stakeholders in management education and are future management leaders, and as there have not been empirical studies to date that examine business school students’ understanding of responsible management, a qualitative study was conducted with European business school students concerning their understanding of the term. A framework summarizing perceptions of responsible management characteristics and broad approach of responsible management definition were created and used to introduce a draft theoretical platform for discussion on this topic." .

We tested to see if undergraduate peer review of radiological reports has validity and describe student impressions of the learning process. Peer review scores for student-generated radiological reports were compared to scores obtained in the summative multiple choice (MCQ) examination for the course. Student satisfaction was measured using a bespoke questionnaire. There was a weak positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.32, p < 0.01) between peer review scores students received and the student scores obtained in the MCQ examination. The difference in peer review scores received by students grouped according to their level of course performance (high vs. low) was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No correlation was found between peer review scores awarded by the students and the scores they obtained in the MCQ examination (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.17, p = 0.14).

The multi-modal nature of the conventional computer games (e.g. audiovisual representation) plus the ability to interact via haptic-enabled inputs provides a more immersive experience. Thus, particular disciplines such as medical education in which frequent hands on rehearsals play a key role in learning core motor skills (e.g. physical palpations) may benefit from this technique. Challenges such as the impracticality of verbalising palpation experience by tutors and ethical considerations may prevent the medical students from correctly learning core palpation skills. This work presents a new data glove, built from off-the-shelf components which captures pressure sensitivity designed to provide feedback for palpation tasks. In this work the data glove is used to control a serious game adapted from the infinite runner genre to improve motor skill acquisition. A comparative evaluation on usability and effectiveness of the method using multimodal visualisations, as part of a larger study to enhance pressure sensitivity, is presented. Thirty participants divided into a game-playing group ($$n=15$$ n=15 ) and a control group ($$n=15$$ n=15 ) were invited to perform a simple palpation task. The game-playing group significantly outperformed the control group in which abstract visualisation of force was provided to the users in a blind-folded transfer test.

The objective of the study was to improve the skills required for early identification, timely referral, and management of musculoskeletal diseases, especially juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in a group of pediatricians and pediatric residents in a remote region of Colombia. Supported by grant programs developed by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR), a combined educational strategy (blended learning) was implemented based on two classroom educational activities and four online modules. The students’ acquired knowledge and perception of the strategy were evaluated. Scores were reported as median values and interquartile ranges (IQR), and the differences between scores were estimated using the Wilcoxon test for equal medians. Forty-one students were enrolled, 37 completed the online modules, and 33 attended the final in-person session. The results of the written tests demonstrated an improved ability to solve clinical problems compared with the results of the tests before the course (the median initial vs. final test scores 3 (IQR = 1) vs. 5 (IQR = 0), p = 0.000).

Als eigenständige rheumatologische Universitätskliniken wurden 7 Standorte bewertet, 9 Universitäten verfügten über eine nicht weisungsfreie W2/W3/C3-Professur mit eigener internistisch-rheumatologisch geführter Abteilung. Betrachtet man die 37 Fakultäten in Deutschland, sind der Anteil an Vorlesungsstunden, der Anteil der Pflichtvorlesungsstunden, die Stundenzahl an praktischen Übungen und die Anzahl der Stunden für den Unterricht am Krankenbett sehr unterschiedlich verteilt und bei den weisungsfreien Universitäten in der Regel höher. Nicht alle medizinischen Fakultäten weisen eine Pflichtlehre auf dem Gebiet der internistischen Rheumatologie auf.

We performed a pilot study to evaluate the “non-technical skills for surgeons” (NOTSS) rating system in a major Japanese cancer center. MethodsUpper gastrointestinal surgeons were selected as trainers or trainees. The trainers attended a master-class on NOTSS, which included simulated demo-videos, to promote consistency across the assessments. The trainers thereafter commenced observing the trainees and whole teams, utilizing the NOTSS and “observational teamwork assessment for surgery” (OTAS) rating systems, before and after their education. ResultsFour trainers and six trainees were involved in this study. Test scores for understanding human factors and the NOTSS system were 5.89 ± 1.69 and 8.00 ± 1.32 before and after the e-learning, respectively (mean ± SD, p = 0.010). The OTAS scores for the whole team improved significantly after the trainees’ education in five out of nine stages (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the NOTSS scores before and after education, with a small improvement in the total scores for the “teamwork and communication” and “leadership” categories. ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that implementing the NOTSS system is feasible in Japan. Education of both surgical trainers and trainees would contribute to better team performance." .

However, the integration of SGBM into medical school curricula is often haphazard and poorly defined; schools often do not know the current status of SGBM content in their curricula, even if they are committed to addressing gaps and improving SGBM delivery. Therefore, complete auditing and accounting of SGBM content in the existing medical school curriculum is necessary to determine the baseline status and prepare for successful integration of SGBM content into that curriculum. MethodsA review of course syllabi and lecture objectives as well as a targeted data analysis of the Curriculum Management and Information Tool (CurrMIT) were completed prior to a real-time curriculum audit. Subsequently, six “student scholars,” three first-year and three second-year medical students, were recruited and trained to audit the first 2 years of the medical school curriculum for SGBM content, thus completing an audit for both of the pre-clinical years simultaneously. A qualitative analysis and a post-audit comparative analysis were completed to assess the level of SGBM instruction at our institution. ResultsThe review of syllabi and the CurrMIT data analysis did not generate a meaningful catalogue of SGBM content in the curriculum; most of the content identified specifically targeted women’s or men’s health topics and not sex- or gender-based differences. The real-time student audit of the existing curriculum at Texas Tech revealed that most of the SGBM material was focused on the physiological/anatomical sex differences or gender differences in disease prevalence, with minimal coverage of sex- or gender-based differences in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and outcomes. ConclusionsThe real-time student scholar audit was effective in identifying SGBM content in the existing medical school curriculum that was not possible with a retrospective review of course syllabi and lecture objectives or curriculum databases such as the CurrMIT. The audit results revealed the need for improved efforts to teach SGBM topics in our school’s pre-clinical curriculum." .

An HPLC–DAD method was applied to determine the content of trans-4-digentiobioside crocetin ester (trans-crocin-4), picrocrocin, and safranal, while the antioxidant activity of methanolic extracts of saffron samples was tested using two in vitro assays, DPPH and ABTS. The samples were also subjected to alkaline hydrolysis before testing. The content of trans-crocin-4 ranged from 1.7 to 7.5/100 g, while picrocrocin content varied from 2.6 to 6.7/100 g. Using DPPH test, all saffron samples showed very low radical scavenging activity, while higher values were observed after hydrolysis. As regards ABTS assay, saffron samples exhibited higher antioxidant activity against radical than the respective hydrolyzed. Interestingly, correlations between DPPH values of hydrolyzed samples and ABTS values of methanolic extracts were obtained. Moreover, a significant correlation (R 2 = 0.5732) between ABTS values and trans-crocin-4 content of saffron samples was observed. The obtained results contribute to the characterization of saffron powder, the most used and economic but also the less studied form of saffron." .

In this model, the lecture and homework components are reversed. The flipped classroom lends itself to more interaction in “class” and theoretically improved clinical decision-making. Data is lacking for this model for students in emergency medicine clerkships. We trialed the flipped classroom in our fourth-year student clerkship. Our aim was to learn student and faculty facilitator perceptions of the experience, as it has not been done previously in this setting. We evaluated this in two ways: (1) participant perception of the experience and (2) facilitator (EM physician educator) perception of student preparation, participation, and knowledge synthesis. MethodsWith permission from its creators, we utilized an online video series derived from the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine. Students were provided the link to these 1 week prior to the classroom experience as the “homework.” We developed patient cases generated from the videos that we discussed during class in small-group format. Afterward, students were surveyed about the experience using four-point Likert items and free-text comments and also were evaluated by the facilitator on a nine-point scale. ResultsForty-six clerkship students participated. Students deemed the online modules useful at 2.9 (95 % CI 2.7–3.2). Further, they reported the in-class discussion to be of high value at 3.9 (95 % CI 3.8–4.0), much preferred the flipped classroom to traditional lecturing at 3.8 (95 % CI 3.6–3.9), and rated the overall experience highly at 3.8 (95 % CI 3.7–3.9). Based on preparation, participation, and knowledge synthesis, the facilitator judged participants favorably at 7.4 (95 % CI 7.0–7.8). Students commented that the interactivity, discussion, and medical decision-making were advantages of this format. ConclusionsStudents found high value in the flipped classroom and prefer it to traditional lecturing, citing interactivity and discussion as the main reasons. The facilitator also viewed that the students were not only well prepared for the flipped classroom but that they also actively participated in and synthesized knowledge adequately during this experience. This study supports the use of the flipped classroom for EM clerkship students as a valuable, preferable teaching technique." .

Preparations for the role-play activity, the dramatisation of the mock trial, and the subsequent discussions were video-recorded. We also collected the written material produced by the pre-service teachers and the reflective journals they produced during their involvement with the activity. This article discusses the contributions of such an experience to future teachers’ knowledge on aspects related to both nature of science and argumentation, as well as to their views on their future actions related to authentic teaching of and about science. The results show that such contributions were meaningful." .

Firstly, an explanation of the main attributes of the concepts examined is provided, with special attention being paid to the multidimensional nature of the variables and the relationships between them. This is followed by an examination of the validation processes of the measuring instruments. The validation process of scales suggested that the quality of service in online media is defined by a construct composed of four dimensions: efficiency; system availability; reliability and privacy; and interaction. The model, validated by means of structural equations, provides empirical evidence of the positive link between the quality dimensions proposed in the model and the constructs of satisfaction and loyalty. Most relevant studies regarding quality in online media have focused in the identification of a set of indicators without taking into account aspects relating to perceived quality. The fusion of the two areas of knowledge (online media and e-service quality) may lead to the creation of a scale that takes advantage of the most beneficial features that provide us with the different areas of study with the aim of obtaining as balanced and convergent a model as possible." .

Hieraus ergibt sich die Frage nach geeigneten Mitteln zu Dokumentation, Qualitätskontrolle und Optimierung von gruppenspezifischen Therapieprozessen und -ergebnissen. Die vorliegende operationalisierte Basisdokumentation für Gruppenpsychotherapien (OBG) stellt eine mögliche Grundlage für Prozess- und Ergebnisforschung dar. Daneben dient die OBG als Instrument für standardisierte klinische Verlaufsdokumentationen und Qualitätssicherung sowie in Kombination mit dem zur Verfügung stehenden Begleitmanual als Hilfsmittel der gruppentherapeutischen Aus- und Weiterbildung. Die Inhalte orientieren sich am aktuell verfügbaren wissenschaftlichen Forschungsstand und wurden, soweit möglich, unabhängig von schulspezifischen Therapiekonzeptionen implementiert. Besondere Berücksichtigung fanden u. a. die „Practice Guidelines for Group Psychotherapy“ der American Group Psychotherapy Association aus 2007. Das System orientiert sich in seiner Gliederung an einem Modell der „Anatomie und Physiologie der Gruppe“ nach Burlingame et al., das Strukturen und Prozesse innerhalb von Gruppen ordnet. Beachtung finden neben inhaltlich-thematischen und methodischen Aspekten einer jeweiligen Sitzung Themen der Gruppendynamik, z. B. Rollenverteilung, Herausbildung von Subgruppen und Normen, Konfliktmanagement, interpersonales Feedback, Selbstöffnung, Kohäsion und weitere sog. therapeutische Faktoren. Derzeit wird die Anwendung des OBG-Systems in unterschiedlichen Settings erprobt. Über die Erfahrungen und mögliche weitere Entwicklungsschritte wird an anderer Stelle berichtet." .

Analysis of 183 teachers’ self-reports on their practices revealed three notable findings. First, the factors at the three levels were all found to be significantly related to the different patterns of enacted curriculum. However, the use of quality textbooks and the alignment of teachers’ views and instructional goals with curriculum goals were found to be the two factors that are most strongly associated with the enactment pattern of high-level problems and high-level teacher questions in instruction. Furthermore, teachers with the enactment pattern of increasing lower cognitive demand of problems into higher ones tended to rate their curriculum knowledge higher than teachers with the enactment pattern of using low-level problems and teacher questions in their teaching. In particular, deviation from and dissatisfaction with their assigned low-quality textbooks were found to be critical factors that are associated with the enactment pattern of increasing lower cognitive demands of problems in instruction." .

Therefore, a reliable and valid measure of strengths for research and practice is needed. The Brief Strengths Scale (BSS) is a newly developed tool for measuring the three-dimensional strengths model (i.e., temperance, intellectual, and interpersonal strength). However, empirical support for the measurement invariance of the BSS has not been obtained. This study examined the three-factor structure of BSS across gender, age, education, and marriage groups in a community sample (n = 375) using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. After removing one item of each subscale from the original version, the revised model provided a good fit to the data at different subgroups. The revised nine-item BSS indicated that measurement invariance across gender and age groups was achieved. In addition, the measurement was more influenced by social-cultural factors than biological factors." .

To address this at the point of selection, “non-cognitive” tests were included in the UK Clinical Aptitude Test, the most widely-used aptitude test in UK medical education (UKCAT: http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/). We examined the predictive validity of these non-cognitive traits with performance during and on exit from medical school. We sampled all students graduating in 2013 from the 30 UKCAT consortium medical schools. Analysis included: candidate demographics, UKCAT non-cognitive scores, medical school performance data—the Educational Performance Measure (EPM) and national exit situational judgement test (SJT) outcomes. We examined the relationships between these variables and SJT and EPM scores. Multilevel modelling was used to assess the relationships adjusting for confounders. The 3343 students who had taken the UKCAT non-cognitive tests and had both EPM and SJT data were entered into the analysis. There were four types of non-cognitive test: (1) libertariancommunitarian, (2) NACE—narcissism, aloofness, confidence and empathy, (3) MEARS—self-esteem, optimism, control, self-discipline, emotional-nondefensiveness (END) and faking, (4) an abridged version of 1 and 2 combined. Multilevel regression showed that, after correcting for demographic factors, END predicted SJT and EPM decile. Aloofness and empathy in NACE were predictive of SJT score. This is the first large-scale study examining the relationship between performance on non-cognitive selection tests and medical school exit assessments. The predictive validity of these tests was limited, and the relationships revealed do not fit neatly with theoretical expectations. This study does not support their use in selection." .

As web text is one of the extensively used elements in online learning, this study aims to derive practical guidelines on this aspect by exploring the experience of learners with dyslexia and learners without dyslexia when using different online reading affordances. The study employed a within-subjects qualitative study and key patterns that emerged from the data collected via observations and interviews were interpreted based on two important aspects of learning experience, which were perceived learning and engagement. The study reveals that (1) the direct application of Printed Text on the web should be carefully considered, (2) existing web accessibility guidelines (limit to guidelines examined in this study) are appropriate and (3) the use of a Screen Reader for online reading should not be made compulsory and be available as an option instead. The comparison between the experience of learners with and without dyslexia in this study has yielded insights into affordances that are perceived positively by both groups of learners. As learners with dyslexia form a significant minority of the online learning population, the inclusive dyslexia-friendly guidelines derived from this study would better inform the future implementation of online reading affordances that acknowledge differences and similarities between online learners." .

Our assumption is that an important task for young children’s education is to create a democratic and critical environment, in which multiplicity of perspectives is celebrated, along with diversity of concepts and practices, with movement between imaginary and real worlds. In light of this, the goal of this article is to defend a perspective for curriculum and for the role of the mathematics educator, promoting the learning of mathematics through problem solving in early childhood years. In order to discuss and illustrate this perspective we describe the pedagogical practices of two teachers who teach 4- and 5-years-olds, who create for their students an environment rich in problem solving and investigations. In both classrooms, all children individually succeeded in sharing their unique solutions and new knowledge constructed as a result of their inquiries. The experience provides evidence that problem solving affords children the opportunity to raise conjectures, to discuss possibilities and to draw conclusions, even if partial ones, that are then vetted by the group as the authors share their solutions. In this way, the work with problem solving nurtures cooperative learning and promotes the exploration of a diversity of ideas." .
