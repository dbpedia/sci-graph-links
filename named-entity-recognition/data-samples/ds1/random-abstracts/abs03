The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of nano-silver(Ag)-functionalized Ti surfaces against epidemic Staphylococcus from the perspective of the regulation of biofilm-related genes and based on a bacteria-cell co-culture study. To achieve this goal, two representative epidemic Staphylococcus strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis, RP62A) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, USA 300), were used, and it was found that an Ag-nanoparticle-modified Ti surface could regulate the expression levels of biofilm-related genes (icaA and icaR for S. epidermidis; fnbA and fnbB for S. aureus) to inhibit bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Moreover, a novel bacteria-fibroblast co-culture study revealed that the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles on such a surface can help mammalian cells to survive, adhere and spread more successfully than Staphylococcus. Therefore, the modified surface was demonstrated to possess a good anti-infective capability against both sessile bacteria and planktonic bacteria through synergy between the effects of Ag nanoparticles and ion release. This work provides new insight into the antimicrobial action and mechanism of Ag-nanoparticle-functionalized Ti surfaces with bacteria-killing and cell-assisting capabilities and paves the way towards better satisfying the clinical needs." .

Elucidation of the latter structural features as well as the number and nature of any end groups present is critical for assessing the amphiphile’s quality and utility. This study introduces a multidimensional method for the analysis of the composition, microstructure, and architecture of amphiphilic copolymer mixtures, encompassing ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) interfaced with ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS). The combination of two orthogonal separation methods (LC and IM) with mass analysis (MS), viz. UPLC-IM-MS, was utilized to characterize a polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide), PS-b-PEO, mixture containing structural isomers and isobars. Reverse-phase LC afforded separation of the copolymer and a byproduct according to their hydrophobic block sizes, IM dispersion provided information on the macromolecular architectures of the separated components (linear or cyclic), and MS analysis using electrospray ionization (ESI) unveiled the hydrophilic block sizes and the overall copolymer composition. LC-IM-MS effects separation by polarity in the LC step and by shape in the IM step prior to mass-sensitive detection. Such 3-dimensional approach is particularly suitable for the molecular characterization of complex amphiphilic copolymer blends and for the differentiation of similar samples from different sources or different batches." .

Here we report a general approach for the synthesis of hollow frameworks of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes derived from metal–organic frameworks, which exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen reduction and evolution than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts.

The mechanical strength and quality of hoof horn is determined by the density and diameter of horn tubules, which were recently associated with the severity of lesions on the hoof wall of sows. Histologic changes that have previously been described in cases of bovine laminitis, have also been observed in the dermis and epidermis of the sows’ claws. Trace elements, particularly zinc, copper and manganese, occupy important roles as enzyme catalysts in the process of keratin synthesis which determines the quality and the integrity of the hoof epidermis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of diet supplementation with chelated zinc, copper and manganese, partially substituting their inorganic form, on sow claw health and hoof horn quality assessed by macroscopic, histologic and morphometric examination. ResultsClinically, the total claw lesion score was significantly lower in claws of sows which received the “organic” diet compared to those of sows on the “inorganic” diet. Histologically, lamellar hyperplasia was the most frequently recorded change in the epidermis of the sows’ claws regardless of the diet’s mineral source. The claws of the sows which received the organic diet were more likely to have none or less histologic changes than at least one or more, respectively, compared to those of the sows on the “inorganic” diet. Morphometrically, the density and vertical and horizontal diameters of the horn tubules was significantly higher and smaller, respectively, in the hoof horn of sows which received the “organic” compared to those which received the “inorganic” source diet. ConclusionsPartial substitution of the inorganic zinc, copper and manganese in sows’ diet with their chelated complexes, provided a comparative advantage against a conventional, inorganic mineral source diet, at least under the conditions examined in the current study, in terms of macroscopic, histologic and morphometric criteria, characterizing the health and horn quality status of sows’ hooves." .

For most of the commonly used cutting force prediction models, they are no longer applicable once the workpiece material is altered. Consequently, a new ball-end milling force prediction method with the consideration of the workpiece material properties is presented in this study for difficult-to-machine materials in high-speed milling. Based on differential and oblique cutting mechanisms, the metal cutting process in this method is taken as the linear superposition of a series of differential oblique cutting processes. With laboring the force-loading status of rake face, the yield strength, the heat conductivity, and the plasticity of the material which are the most important factors to influence cutting force are involved as the input elements. Furthermore, the interaction between material properties and machining conditions is also introduced to broadened the scope of applications of this method. In accordance with specific needs, an inverse method using the average cutting force of a single disk after cutting edge discretization is proposed to obtain the specific coefficients, and the cutter engagement is determined by Z-map method. Finally, the comparison between the simulated result and the experimental result confirms the effectiveness of the presented method for different difficult-to-machine materials in high-speed milling based on slot milling and curved surface milling." .

The two lowest singlet electronic states of three tautomers, namely the enol form (E), a keto form with single proton transferred (SK) and a keto form with double proton transferred (DK), have been optimized. These results indicate that the E tautomer is the system with the lowest energy in the ground S 0 state, while the SK tautomer is the most stable structure in the singlet S 1 state. Moreover, the structural changes of E from S 0 to S 1 result in a strengthened intramolecular hydrogen bond, which contributes to facilitate the following ESIPT reaction. In addition, the absorption and emission spectra of DHBP have also been simulated using TD-DFT. The vertical excitation energy of the E form and vertical emission energy of the SK form are found at 2.86 and 1.74 eV, respectively, in good agreement with the available experimental values of 2.89 and 1.72 eV, which implies that the fluorescence detected by Piechowska et al. may only arise from the SK tautomer. To give a clearer picture of the proton transfer process, the constrained energy profiles (CEPs) for the three DHBP tautomers in the S 0 and S 1 states have been constructed. These calculations of CEPs show that the energy barriers during the PT processes from the E/DK to the SK forms in the S 1 state are much lower than those of the others considered here and support the hypothesis of an ESIPT mechanism of only a singlet proton transfer rather than double proton transfer." .

Herein, a relationship between charge carrier density/charge movement and supercapacitance performance is established. For this purpose we have incorporated the most defect-free pristine graphene into defective/sacrificial graphene oxide. A unique co-solvent-based technique is applied to get a homogeneous suspension of single to bi-layer graphene and graphene oxide. This suspension is then transformed into a 3D composite structure of pristine graphene sheets (GSs) and defective N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO), which is the first stable and homogenous 3D composite between GS and RGO to the best of our knowledge. It is found that incorporation of pristine graphene can drastically decrease defect density and thus decrease relaxation time due to improved associations between electrons in GS and ions in electrolyte. Furthermore, N doping is implemented selectively only on RGO and such doping is shown to improve the charge carrier density of the composite, which eventually improves the energy density. After all, the novel 3D composite structure of N-RGO and GS greatly improves energy and power density even at high current density (20 A/g)." .

Thus, structural stability among the antimicrobial peptides, Vt A1 (3C8P), A2 (1JMN), A3 (1ED0), B (1JMP), and C (1ORL) of Viscus album was computationally analyzed. In specific, the static confirmation of VtA3 showed high number of intramolecular interactions, along with an increase in hydrophobicity than others comparatively. Further, conformational sampling was used to analyze various geometrical parameters such as root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and ovality which also revealed the structural stability of VtA3. Moreover, the statistically validated contours of surface area, lipophilicity, and distance constraints of disulfide bonds also supported the priority of VtA3 with respect to stability. Finally, the functional activity of peptides was accessed by computing their free energy of membrane association and membrane interactions, which defined VtA3 as functionally stable.

However, the spontaneous formation of spatial patterns amidst insulator–metal phase coexistence remains poorly explored on the meso- and nanoscales. Here we present real-space evolution of the insulator–metal transition in a V2O3 thin film imaged at high spatial resolution by cryogenic near-field infrared microscopy. We resolve spontaneously nanotextured coexistence of metal and correlated Mott insulator phases near the insulator–metal transition (∼160–180 K) associated with percolation and an underlying structural phase transition. Augmented with macroscopic temperature-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements of the same film, a quantitative analysis of nano-infrared images acquired across the transition suggests decoupling of electronic and structural transformations. Persistent low-temperature metallicity is accompanied by unconventional critical behaviour, implicating the long-range Coulomb interaction as a driving force through the film’s first-order insulator–metal transition." .

The ratio of average extrusion height H to dimension after extrusion D was used as a microformability evaluation parameter. Results showed that the extrusion stress, friction coefficient, and microhardness of Cu decrease with increasing vibration amplitude, whereas its microformability, surface quality, and deformation temperature increase. The effect of relative grain size on microformability could be divided into three sections under different amplitudes. Microformability decreases with increasing L/D when L/D ≤ 0.15 but gradually increases when L/D > 0.35. When 0.15 < L/D ≤ 0.35, experimental repeatability was the poorest and microformability was the worst among the three sections.

The latter, due to non-periodic boundary conditions, is the more natural approach to simulate small clusters. The effect of cluster size is then explored using the local basis function approach. We find that as the cluster size increases, the electronic structure undergoes a transition from molecular behavior to nanoparticle behavior at a cluster size of 140 atoms (diameter ~1.7 nm). Above this cluster size the step-like electronic structure, evident as several features in the imaginary part of the polarizability of all clusters smaller than Ag147, gives way to a dominant plasmon peak localized at wavelengths 350 nm ≤ λ ≤ 600 nm.

Our results suggest that during the first lithiation process the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles undergo a conversion process and generate a composite structure of 1–3 nm Fe and Zn nanograins within Li2O matrix. During the delithiation process, volume contraction and the conversion of Zn and Fe take place with the disappearance of Li2O, followed by the complete conversion to Fe2O3 and ZnO not the original phase ZnFe2O4. The following cycles are dominated by the full reversible phase conversion between Zn, Fe and ZnO, Fe2O3. The Fe valence evolution during cycles evidenced by electron energy–loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques also exhibit the reversible conversion between Fe and Fe2O3 after the first lithiation, agreeing well with the in situ TEM results.

Two different immobilization strategies have been compared, one using asymmetric spacers (3-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) and 4-(4-maleimidophenyl)butyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SMPB)) and another using a symmetric glutaric dialdehyde linker both accompanied by appropriate silanes.

Both shear and uniaxial strains were applied to the low-temperature triclinic phase of C8-BTBT, and polymorphism was identified in the shear process. The band width enhancement is up to 8% under 2% of compressive strain along the x direction, and 14% under 4% of tensile strain along the y direction.

Headspace analysis of VOCs in urine samples using solid phase micro extraction (SPME) coupled to gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is one of the most used techniques. However, it generally produces a limited profile of VOCs if applied to fresh urine. Sample preparation methods, such as addition of salt, base or acid, have been developed to improve the headspace-SPME-GC-MS analysis of VOCs in urine samples. These methods result in a richer profile of VOCs, however, they may also add potential contaminants to the urine samples, result in increased variability introduced by manually processing the samples and promote degradation of metabolites due to extreme pH levels. Here, we evaluated if freeze-drying can be considered an alternative sample preparation method for headspace-SPME-GC-MS analysis of urine samples. ResultsWe collected urine from three volunteers and compared the performances of freeze-drying, addition of acid (HCl), addition of base (NaOH), addition of salt (NaCl), fresh urine and frozen urine when identifying and quantifying metabolites in 4 ml samples. Freeze-drying and addition of acid produced a significantly higher number of VOCs identified than any other method, with freeze-drying covering a slightly higher number of chemical classes, showing an improved repeatability and reducing siloxane impurities. ConclusionIn this work we compared the performance of sample preparation methods for the SPME-GC-MS analysis of urine samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the potential of freeze-dry as an alternative sample preparation method. Our results indicate that freeze-drying has potential to be used as an alternative method for the SPME-GC-MS analysis of urine samples. Additional studies using internal standard, synthetic urine and calibration curves will allow a more precise quantification of metabolites and additional comparisons between methods.Graphical abstractEnhancing VOC profiling from urine samples." .

Relationship between several metal concentrations (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) in brandies and distillation system (homemade/industrial) on one side and aging mode (oak barrels/oak chips) on the other side were demonstrated. Two homemade brandies showed Cu, Fe, and Zn concentrations higher than industrial distillates and thus were found to be not safe for consumption because of Cu and Zn over the maximum allowed values.

MethodsUltra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was utilized to characterize all-laurate polysorbate 20 (PS20) and its degradants. 18O stable isotope labeling was implemented to produce 18O-labeled degradation products of all-laurate PS20 in H2 18O, with subsequent UPLC-MS analysis for location of the cleavage site on the fatty acid-containing side chain of PS20. ResultsThe analysis reveals that hydrolysis of all-laurate PS20 leads to a breakdown of the ester linkage to liberate free lauric acid, showing a distinct dependence on pH. Using a hydrophilic free radical initiator, 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) to study the oxidative degradation of all-laurate PS20, we demonstrate that free lauric acid and polyoxyethylene (POE) laurate are two major decomposition products. Measurement of 18O incorporation into free lauric acid indicated that hydrolysis primarily led to 18O incorporation into free lauric acid via “acyl-cleavage” of the fatty acid ester bond. In contrast, AAPH-exposure of all-laurate PS20 produced free lauric acid without 18O-incorporation. ConclusionsThe 18O-labeling technique and unique degradant patterns of all-laurate PS20 described here provide a direct approach to differentiate the types of PS degradation." .

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle measurement, surface roughness gage, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were used to characterize and measure the surface morphology, contact angle, surface roughness, and chemical composition of titanium after laser processing. The results indicate that the contact angle of titanium surface is 77.8° immediately after laser processing, which shows hydrophilicity, and the contact angle presents a rising tendency with time in general. At steady state, the maximum contact angles for line pattern, grid pattern, and spot pattern increased to 157.2°, 153°, and 132.5°, respectively. It can be found that the surface wettability has changed from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity and even to superhydrophobicity. The influence of surface morphology on the surface wettability effects immediately after laser treatment and does not change with time, while the effect of surface chemical composition on the surface wettability will continue from the beginning of laser processing to the stabilization of surface chemical composition. Finally, it can be deduced that the accumulation of carbon on the surface is probably the critical factor to improve the surface hydrophobicity. Therefore, it is concluded that laser-induced modification of surface wettability correlates with surface morphology and surface chemical composition." .

Moiré patterns formed by the crystalline mismatch between adjacent nanosheets are the most direct features for vdW superstructures under microscopic imaging. In this article, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of hexagonal Moiré patterns with unusually large micrometer-sized lateral areas (up to ~1 μm2) and periodicities (up to ~50 nm) from restacking of liquid exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) is reported. This observation was attributed to the long range crystallinity and the contaminant-free surfaces of these chemically inert nanosheets. Parallel-line-like Moiré fringes with similarly large periodicities were also observed. The simulations and experiments unambiguously revealed that the hexagonal patterns and the parallel fringes originated from the same rotationally mismatched vdW stacking of BNNSs and can be inter-converted by simply tilting the TEM specimen following designated directions. This finding may pave the way for further structural decoding of other 2D vdW superstructure systems with more complex Moiré images." .

Under these conditions, plastic deformation is accompanied by the formation of fine-scale structures, in which activity along the different slip systems localizes in different areas. The quasiconvex envelope of the energy density, which describes the macroscopic material behavior, is determined in a regime from small up to intermediate strains, and upper and lower bounds are provided for large strains. Finally sufficient conditions are given under which the lamination convex envelope of an extended-valued energy density is an upper bound for its quasiconvex envelope." .

In vitro and in vivo degradation experiments illustrated that the physical hydrogel could retain its integrity as long as several weeks and eventually be degraded by hydrolysis.

In this work, we have prepared two-dimensional hexagonal FeS with high-energy (001) facets (FeS-HE-001) via a solution-phase chemical method. Nanosheets (NSs) with exposed high-energy planes usually possess better reaction activity, so FeS-HE-001 was used as a counter electrode (CE) material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). FeS-HE-001 achieved an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.88% (with the PCE of champion cells being 9.10%), which was almost 1.15 times higher than that of the Pt-based DSSCs (7.73%) measured in parallel. Cyclic voltammetry and Tafel polarization measurements revealed the excellent electrocatalytic activities of FeS-HE-001 towards the I3–/I– redox reaction. This can be attributed to the promotion of photoelectron transfer, which was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning Kelvin probe, and the strong I3– adsorption and reduction activities, which were investigated using first-principles calculations. The presence of high-energy (001) facets in the NSs was an important factor for improving the catalytic reduction of I3–. We believe that our method is a promising way for the design and synthesis of advanced CE materials for energy harvesting. " .

Partial incorporation of chromium ions to the hexagonal ZnO structure, formation of strongly dispersed spinel (ZnCr2O4) and chromium zinc oxide species (ZnO·CrO3) was observed. We have stated that methanol was adsorbed on the surface of ZnO at 100 °C mainly via formation of methoxy species, and the main products of methanol desorption were carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The presence of chromium facilitated direct oxidation of methoxy groups to formate species at low temperatures (~100 °C) and their transformation to hydrogen and carbon dioxide during temperature-programmed desorption. The enhanced transformation of methoxy to formate species was attributed to the labile oxygen in chromium-modified zinc oxides." .

However, its clinical application has been hindered due to extremely low aqueous solubility, chemical stability, and cellular uptake. In this study, we discovered quite a new function of curcumin, i.e. pH-responsive endosomal disrupting activity, derived from curcumin’s self-assembly. We selected anticancer activity as an example of biological activities of curcumin, and investigated the contribution of pH-responsive property to its anticancer activity. As a result, we demonstrated that the pH-responsive property significantly enhances the anticancer activity of curcumin. Furthermore, we demonstrated a utility of the pH-responsive property of curcumin as delivery nanocarriers for doxorubicin toward combination cancer therapy. These results clearly indicate that the smart curcumin assemblies act as promising nanoplatform for development of curcumin-based therapeutics." .

Plant-derived anti-malarials remain a significant source of bioactive molecules in this regard. The multicomponent formulation forms the basis of phytotherapy. Mechanistic reasons for the poly-pharmacological effects of plants constitute increased bioavailability, interference with cellular transport processes, activation of pro-drugs/deactivation of active compounds to inactive metabolites and action of synergistic partners at different points of the same signaling cascade. These effects are known as the multi-target concept. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of natural products-based drug discovery, there is need to rethink the approaches toward understanding their therapeutic effect. This review discusses the multi-target phytotherapeutic concept and its application in biomarker identification using the modified reverse pharmacology - systems biology approach. Considerations include the generation of a product library, high throughput screening (HTS) techniques for efficacy and interaction assessment, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-based anti-malarial profiling and animal pharmacology. This approach is an integrated interdisciplinary implementation of tailored technology platforms coupled to miniaturized biological assays, to track and characterize the multi-target bioactive components of botanicals as well as identify potential biomarkers. While preserving biodiversity, this will serve as a primary step towards the development of standardized phytomedicines, as well as facilitate lead discovery for chemical prioritization and downstream clinical development." .

Currently, thin BP atomic layers are obtained mostly by mechanical exfoliation of bulk BP, which limits applications in thin-film based electronics due to a scaling process. Here we report highly crystalline few-layer black phosphorus thin films produced by liquid exfoliation. We demonstrate that the liquid-exfoliated BP forms a triangular crystalline structure on SiO2/Si (001) and amorphous carbon. The highly crystalline BP layers are faceted with a preferred orientation of the (010) plane on the sharp edge, which is an energetically most favorable facet according to the density functional theory calculations. Our results can be useful in understanding the triangular BP structure for large-area applications in electronic devices using two-dimensional materials. The sensitivity and selectivity of liquid-exfoliated BP to gas vapor demonstrate great potential for practical applications as sensors." .

Strong electronic correlations, such as magnetism and superconductivity, can be produced as the result of enhanced Coulomb interactions between electrons. Two-dimensional materials are powerful candidates to search for the novel phenomena because of the easiness of arranging them and modifying their properties accordingly. In this work, we report magnetic effects in graphene, a prototypical non-magnetic two-dimensional semi-metal, in the proximity with sulfur, a diamagnetic insulator. In contrast to the well-defined metallic behaviour of clean graphene, an energy gap develops at the Fermi energy for the graphene/sulfur compound with decreasing temperature. This is accompanied by a steep increase of the resistance, a sign change of the slope in the magneto-resistance between high and low fields, and magnetic hysteresis. A possible origin of the observed electronic and magnetic responses is discussed in terms of the onset of low-temperature magnetic ordering. These results provide intriguing insights on the search for novel quantum phases in graphene-based compounds." .

Two MCs of DS 1.27 (MC1) and 1.95 (MC2) have been perethylated and permethoxyethylated and submitted to TFA hydrolysis in water/acetone in a heating block at 120 °C. EMC1 has also been hydrolyzed without acetone addition, under microwave irradiation, and after partial mechanical degradation by treatment with a sonotrode. For all hydrolyses, a slow (k-a) and, after about 10% conversion, a faster phase of hydrolysis (k-b) was found. Rate constants k-b were in the range of 2–4 × 10−4 s−1 for all peralkylated celluloses. In contrast to previously studied MC, hydrolysis in water/acetone was faster than in water, indicating the influence of solution state and the macromolecular character. No difference was observed for sonotrode pretreated EMC1, while microwave instead of heating block treatment accelerated hydrolysis by a factor of 30 under the chosen conditions. Selectivity with respect to the substitution patterns, expressed as the standard deviation of the individual rate constants k i (i = position of methyl), was higher in the slow initial phase (23–28%), while ranging between 9 and 18% in the main phase of hydrolysis with lower values for MEMC compared to EMC and, in case of EMC1, for aqueous TFA compared to acetone-containing mixtures. Randomness in hydrolytic cleavage is favored by water as solvent and apparently by microwave heating." .

The findings of this investigation confirmed that MALDI-TOF-MS could be used to identify different bacterial lipids and, in combination with appropriate chemometrics, allowed for the discrimination between these different bacterial species, which was supported by LC-MS. The average correct classification rates for the seven species of bacteria were 62.23 and 77.03 % based on MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS data, respectively.

In the proposed approach, an artificial potential field (APF) has been used to determine the feasible initial paths for moving the nanoparticles. The proposed APF prepares a potential map of the environment using the initial positions of the nanoparticles and positions of the obstacles and surface roughness. The cost function used in this paper includes the area under the critical force-time diagram, surface roughness as well as path smoothness. The performed investigations indicate the importance of each of these parameters in determining the optimal paths for displacing the nanoparticles. Also, the dynamic application of crossover and mutation operators has been used to avoid premature convergence. Using the information of the potential map, two new operators have been introduced to improve the feasible and infeasible paths. Furthermore, a novel co-evolutionary mechanism for solving the multiple nanoparticle path planning problems has been presented. The proposed co-evolutionary mechanism is able to determine the best destination for each particle, optimal sequence of moves for several particles, and also the optimal path for moving each particle.

This phenomenon has many applications such as destructing tumor cancer (one method of thermal therapy) or the application in near-field regime. However, in any application, recognizing the limited area of absorption frequency is very important. The paper investigates the dependence of maximum absorption frequency of gold and silver nanorods on size and aspect ratio (length/radius). The principal role of this property is due to the skin effect and self-magnetism on plasmon oscillation. In the bulk system, the plasmon gas oscillation regions are in order to micrometer in metal. When the size of particles becomes smaller than a micrometer, the influence of particle size on plasmon gas oscillation starts (the plasmon electron gas restricted by size particle), and the self-magnetism of skin effect operated.

However, high stability and non-volatility features currently limit their rapid on-site detection. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is emerging as a powerful technique for the trace-level detection of different molecules. Plasmonic Ag nanowires were produced by a hydrothermal synthesis method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a negatively charged stabilizer. Here, we report a rapid detection method for inorganic explosives based on a simple surface swab with a positively charged diethyldithiocarbamate-modified Ag nanowire membrane coupled with SERS. This membrane, serving as an excellent SERS substrate with high uniformity, stability, and reusability, can capture both typical oxidizers in inorganic explosives and organic nitro-explosives, via electrostatic interaction. The detection level of perchlorates (ClO4 −), chlorates (ClO3 −), nitrates (NO3 −), picric acid, and 2,4-dinitrophenol is as high as 2.0, 1.7, 0.1, 45.8, and 36.6 ng, respectively. In addition, simulated typical inorganic explosives such as black powders, firecrackers, and match heads could also be detected. We believe that this membrane represents an attractive alternative for rapid on-site detection of inorganic explosives with high efficiency. " .

Hydroxide was chosen to mask aluminum for the determination of 0.01—0.1 mol/L of fluoride. The simulation indicated that the permissible aluminum masked at a certain pH value was limited and hardly related to F-concentration and boric acid. It is better to control pH value below 11.5 and the aluminum concentration within 0.025 mol/L to minimize the interference of hydroxide to the fluoride ISE. The decomposition conditions of boron trifluoride by aluminum chloride were investigated. It is found that the F-detection ratio will approach 1.0 if the Al/F molar ratio is 0.3—0.7 and aluminum concentration is no more than 0.02 mol/L when heated at 80 °C for 10 min. In one word, hydroxide is quite fit to mask aluminum for samples which contain high content of fluoride and aluminum and the BF3 content can be successfully determined by this method." .

However, the current synthetic approach for Cu2O NWMCs using graphene oxide as modifier leads to uncontrollable products and low productivity (~30 %), which largely hinder their further industrial application. Herein, we report a modified synthetic approach for controllable and large-scale preparation of Cu2O NWMCs using perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride molecule as modifier. The effects of growth time and initial pH on the morphology of final products have been systemically investigated. Under the optimal reaction condition with initial pH of 5.3 and reaction time of 15 h, the well-defined octahedral Cu2O NWMCs can be obtained with a productivity as high as ~75 %. In addition, this synthetic approach can be easily scaled up from 50 to 500 mL autoclave. The ability of high productivity and reproducibility in synthesis of Cu2O NWMCs enable us to further study their peroxidase-like activity by catalyzing the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine in the presence of H2O2. The Cu2O NWMCs have exhibited a superior catalytic activity with the K cat of 1.14 × 10−2, 10 times higher than that of horseradish peroxidase. Moreover, the Cu2O NWMCs can also retain 69.5 % of their initial activities after 10-batch redox reactions.

A comparison between the calculated and observed Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) suggests that many-electron effects are strongly suppressed in channel 2D MoS2 due to a charge transfer. The extensively adopted energy band calculation scheme fails to reproduce the observed SBHs in 2D MoS2-Sc interface. By contrast, an ab initio quantum transport device simulation better reproduces the observed SBH in 2D MoS2-Sc interface and highlights the importance of a higher level theoretical approach beyond the energy band calculation in the interface study. BL MoS2-metal contacts generally have a reduced SBH than ML MoS2-metal contacts due to the interlayer coupling and thus have a higher electron injection efficiency." .

The calculated results of bond lengths and bond angles of hydrogen bond O–H···N, the infrared vibrational spectra and the hydrogen bonding energies all demonstrated that the intramolecular hydrogen bond is strengthened in the first excited state. It is no denying the fact that our calculated results reproduced the experimental absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra well, which demonstrates that the TDDFT theory we adopted is reasonable and effective. From the analysis of frontier molecular orbitals, it is reasonable to suggest that the intramolecular charge-transfer nature of the excitation prompts the proton transfer giving rise to an ESPT reaction. The constructed potential energy curves of ground state and the first excited state based on keeping the O–H distance fixed from 0.993 to 2.343 Å have been used to illustrate the ESIPT process.

The percentage of NO-releasing iron sulfur nitrosyl complexes in the composites was determined by ESR spectroscopy. An amperometric analysis demonstrated that the polymer composites decompose to yield NO within a few seconds after the dissolution in water without additional thermal and photoactivation. The dependences of the amount of NO and the maximum level of NO release on the duration of the storage of aqueous solutions for all of the synthesized films were determined at pH 7.0.

Copper electrodeposition from diluted solutions was efficiently performed using a membraneless FBE. The average current efficiency (ACE), average energy consumption (AEC), and space–time yield (AY) was optimized taking into account the operational and process variables. It was noted that for all response variables studied, the raise of supporting electrolyte concentration (C s) contributed to improvements in the process. The operational conditions current (I) and bed expansion (E) determined the values of CE, Y, and EC under activated control, but the initial copper concentration (C 0) determined how long the electrodeposition process will work under activated or mass transfer control, thus affecting the average values of CE, Y, and EC.

We present operando mass spectrometry of 18O-labelled Li1.2[Ni0.132+Co0.133+Mn0.544+]O2, which demonstrates that oxygen is extracted from the lattice on charging a Li1.2[Ni0.132+Co0.133+Mn0.544+]O2 cathode, although we detected no O2 evolution. Combined soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that, in addition to oxygen loss, Li+ removal is charge compensated by the formation of localized electron holes on O atoms coordinated by Mn4+ and Li+ ions, which serve to promote the localization, and not the formation, of true O22− (peroxide, O–O ~1.45 Å) species. The quantity of charge compensated by oxygen removal and by the formation of electron holes on the O atoms is estimated, and for the case described here the latter dominates." .

Currently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene-sensing electrodes are scarce. Herein, for the first time, a graphene based on a Ta wire support was prepared using the CVD method to form a highly electroactive biosensing platform. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were utilized to characterize the morphology and investigate the electrochemical properties of the CVD graphene electrodes. The resulting CVD graphene electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and had a prominent response effect on dopamine, uric acid, guanine, and adenine. Standing graphene nanosheets have rich catalytic sites such as the edges, the defect levels of the plane, and porous network structures between the graphene nanosheets. These catalytic sites prompt the adsorption and resolution for the four species and the strong electron transport capability of the CVD graphene, which effectively improved the electrical signals for response to four species. Moreover, the graphene electrode is a promising candidate in electrochemical sensing and other electrochemical device applications." .

Here we show how the photocatalytic activity of thylakoid membranes leads to overall water splitting in a bio-photo-electro-chemical (BPEC) cell via a simple process. Thylakoids extracted from spinach are introduced into a BPEC cell containing buffer solution with ferricyanide. Upon solar-simulated illumination, water oxidation takes place and electrons are shuttled by the ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple from the thylakoids to a transparent electrode serving as the anode, yielding a photocurrent density of 0.5 mA cm−2. Hydrogen evolution occurs at the cathode at a bias as low as 0.8 V. A tandem cell comprising the BPEC cell and a Si photovoltaic module achieves overall water splitting with solar to hydrogen efficiency of 0.3%. These results demonstrate the promise of combining natural photosynthetic membranes and man-made photovoltaic cells in order to convert solar power into hydrogen fuel." .

Our results show that the N- or S-substitution is more favorable to the enhancement of charge transfer between the alkali metal ions and crown ethers than P-substitution; furthermore, the interaction energy of N- or S-substitution is also higher than that of P-substitution. The 12C4O has strongest affinity for Li+ in the three complexes from the perspective of the variation of the species and the number of heteroatom. Thus, take 12C4O for example, it is concluded that the number of N-substitution has slight influence on the interaction energy; however, as the number of P- or S-substitutions increases, the interaction energy values decrease sharply." .

The diethyl phosphite behaviour in the organic coatings depends on the volume concentration of the pigment. A polyaniline base was suspended in diethyl phosphite as a new reactant. The pigment so prepared was used as a corrosion inhibitor in model paints containing a solvent-based epoxy-ester resin as the binder. The organic coatings were applied to steel panels and to glass panels and subjected to mechanical tests, corrosion resistance tests and electrochemical tests. Furthermore, they were exposed to the environments of condensed steam, neutral salt solution mist, and sulphur dioxide-containing mist. The corrosion effects were evaluated and the organic coatings’ overall anticorrosion efficiency was calculated from the results. Ultimately, the optimum pigment volume concentration (PVC) at which the coatings provided the best anticorrosion protection was determined: it was PVC = 10 vol%, whereas the best mechanical resistance was observed at PVC = 5 vol%. The goal of the forthcoming work will be to optimise all the properties into a single pigment volume concentration." .

The main model parameters were the same as in our previous work: we used the same material properties, including the B–H curve of the ferromagnetic pot material, the same arrangement of the coil-pot system, and the same formula for calculating the hysteresis loss. We applied similar inductor current with $$f = 25~\\hbox {kHz}$$ f=25kHz frequency in the finite element analyses, but instead of 2D, we had to use 3D models because of the pot structure.

To clear the effect of chemical additive on FAP self-conditioning, wear ratio, FAP surface topography, friction coefficient, and acoustic emission signal of polishing process were investigated in fixed abrasive polishing of quartz glass with ferric nitrate, ethylenediamine (EDA), and triethanolamine (TEA) slurry, respectively. Results indicate that TEA slurry can provide excellent self-conditioning of FAP in fixed abrasive polishing of quartz glass. MRR and wear ratio maintain high levels during the whole polishing process. Friction coefficient and acoustic emission signal are more stable than that of the other two chemical additives.

The outputs considered compose: atmospheric emissions; direct losses of sewage and industrial effluent to the sea; fluvial losses at source; food and feed exports; and terrestrial denitrification. It is shown that: (1) Inputs of inorganic fertilizer declined significantly over the study period with both atmospheric deposition and food and feed imports significantly increasing. (2) Outputs of total N also significantly declined with all output pathways decreasing except for atmospheric emissions and terrestrial denitrification to N2. (3) The UK was a net source of total nitrogen in 1990 of approximately −1941 ± 224 kilotonnes N/year (−8 tonnes N/km2/year; inter-quartile range of ±0.9 tonnes/km2/year). However, by 2012, this net nitrogen source had decreased to about −1446 ± 195 kilotonnes N/year (−5.9 tonnes N/km2/year). The future total N balance of the UK is being driven by declines in outputs rather than changes in inputs. The largest declines are in the atmospheric emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) and the fluvial flux of N such that by 2020 to the total N budget is predicted to be −1042 (±246) kilotonnes N/year (−4.2 tonnes N/km2/year) and by 2031 the UK would be a net sink of total N." .

The doping of the N atom into graphene was calculated to enhance the adsorption of O2, but to attenuate the adsorption of Li, because of the repulsion between the electron-rich N-doped graphene and the electron-donating Li atom, and the attraction of this N-doped graphene for electronegative O2. Nevertheless, since the adsorption of Li onto N-doped graphene (−1.001 to −0.503 eV) was still stronger than the adsorption of O2 (−0.280 to −0.215 eV), Li should bind N-doped graphene first. Moreover, N-doped graphene was calculated to bind LiO2 (−0.588 eV) more strongly than was pristine graphene (−0.450 eV).

Our studies about the effect of pH on CMK-3 adsorption capacity revealed that the adsorption capacity increased at lower pH due to the protonation of PEA. Three adsorption models, Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin were used to describe the adsorption isotherms. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG 0, ΔH 0, and ΔS were also evaluated, and it was found that the sorption process was spontaneous, endothermic, and physical in nature. The adsorption kinetics was investigated in detail and the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation fitted the experimental data very well. The mechanistic study by Weber-Morris model revealed that the overall adsorption process was simultaneously governed by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion.

Comparing spray-coated films with films that start from a disordered state of Gaussian chains, we observe that the collapsed molecular conformations in the initial stage give rise to (1) a smaller fraction of blocks that straddle domains (bridges), (2) a significant reduction of the molecular extension normal to the internal interfaces, and (3) a slightly larger lamellar domain spacing in the final morphology. The relaxation of molecular conformations towards equilibrium is very protracted for both processes – solvent casting and spray coating.

It was found that the semiconducting behavior remained the same upon friction stir processing operation but reduced donor densities and provided an additional donor level." .

While local treatment would avoid the systemic treatment side-effects, the tympanic membrane (TM) represents an impenetrable barrier unless surgically breached. We hypothesized that the TM might harbor innate biological mechanisms that could mediate trans-TM transport. We used two M13-bacteriophage display biopanning strategies to search for mediators of trans-TM transport. First, aliquots of linear phage library displaying 1010th 12mer peptides were applied on the TM of rats with active bacterial OM. The middle ear (ME) contents were then harvested, amplified and the preparation re-applied for additional rounds. Second, the same naïve library was sequentially screened for phage exhibiting TM binding, internalization and then transit. Results revealed a novel set of peptides that transit across the TM to the ME in a time and temperature dependent manner. The peptides with highest transport capacities shared sequence similarities. Historically, the TM was viewed as an impermeable barrier. However, our studies reveal that it is possible to translocate peptide-linked small particles across the TM. This is the first comprehensive biopanning for the isolation of TM transiting peptidic ligands. The identified mechanism offers a new drug delivery platform into the ME." .

In this regard, the force of adhesion between two surfaces has been simultaneously investigated on the basis of two important approaches. First, the interactions between two surfaces have been evaluated based on the available contact mechanics theories, and depending on the type of biological nanoparticle studied in this research, an appropriate model has been presented. Then, the common adhesion models of Rumpf and Rabinovich have been modified based on the Van der Waals force and with regard to the cylindrical geometry of the nanoparticles. Finally, based on the Schwartz method, by developing the adhesion model based on the two approaches mentioned above, the adhesion force between cylindrical biological nanoparticles and rough surfaces has been extracted for the first time. The dynamic behavior of nanoparticles in 3D manipulation on a rough substrate has been modeled and then simulated and analyzed. The simulation results indicate that, by increasing the asperity radius, the critical force needed to manipulate a nanoparticle increases. Also, in contrast to the sliding mode, the critical force of movement in the rolling mode diminishes with the increase of nanoparticle radius. The experimental results obtained from the topography of glass and silica substrates indicate that the Rumpf model underestimates the adhesion force relative to the Rabinovich model." .

In this work, we conducted a review of previous studies on mass finishing processes to study the effect of various input process parameters involved in mass finishing. Based on the literature study, the effect of component orientation, media shape, and lubricant concentration on the roughness characteristics of the finished component is investigated by experiments followed by numerical modeling analysis. The analysis revealed that the influence of process parameters in mass finishing depends on the type of media used for the finishing process. The effect of lubricant concentration can result in better polishing of the surface using cylindrical media, while the same effect can be achieved by regulating the component orientation in the case of conical media." .

This approach, however, relies on a thorough understanding of how manganese is incorporated into the shell material –a point that remained controversial so far. Here we clarify this issue, using state-of-the-art X-ray absorption and X-ray emission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations. We verify that in the shells of all studied species manganese is incorporated as high-spin Mn2+, i.e. manganese always has the same valence as calcium. More importantly, the unique chemical sensitivity of valence-to-core X-ray emission enables us to show that manganese is always coordinated by a CO3-octahedron. This, firstly, provides firm experimental evidence for manganese being primarily located in the inorganic carbonate. Secondly, it indicates that the structure of the aragonitic host is locally altered such that manganese attains an octahedral, calcitic coordination. This modification at the atomic level enables the bivalve to accommodate many orders of magnitude more manganese in its aragonitic shell than found in any non-biogenic aragonite. This outstanding feature is most likely facilitated through the non-classical crystallization pathway of bivalve shells." .

In this work, we present the development of a protocol for 13C chemical shift calculations of terpenes, a class of natural products that are widely distributed among plant species and are very important due to their biological and pharmacological activities. This protocol consists of GIAO-DFT calculations of chemical shifts and the application of a parameterized scaling factor in order to ensure accurate structural determination of this class of natural products.

The main adhesives used in the industry have been urea–formaldehyde and phenol–formaldehyde. However, as these raw materials are petroleum products and natural gas, their processes are related to global warming and they may not be available in the future. Even formaldehyde affects human health. These issues have promoted the use of natural raw materials from sustainable origin in the manufacture of adhesives, such as lignin, tannins and proteins. This research proposes the use of single cell protein extract from yeast (SCPey) as a raw material to produce novel wood adhesives. The protein contents, amino acidic composition and the molecular weight distribution of protein extracts from Rhodotorula rubra, Pichia pastoris and Sacharomyces cerevisiae were investigated. Adhesive solutions were characterized and tested through a dynamic thermo mechanical analysis (DMA). Lap joints of wood veneers were assembled using adhesive solutions in order to perform mechanical tests and evaluate the adhesive performance. Protein content of R. rubra, P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae were 72.4, 71.0 and 64.6 %, respectively. The amino acidic composition of SCPey samples promotes the content of reactive functional groups with the ones present in wood polymers. Molecular weight distribution of proteins from protein extracts ranged from 8 to 130 kDa. DMA showed that the adhesive solutions of the SCPey have a proper performance enhancing the wood adhesion. The joint strength under dry conditions with adhesives based on SCPey ranged from 2.40 to 2.99 MPa, which is similar to those obtained with UF and based on a protein isolated soy flour adhesive. Hence, the results showed that SCPey is a promising natural raw material to produce alternative wood adhesives with superior performance." .

One such abiotic reaction which has received little study is the reactivity of NO2 − and Fe(II) associated with a major clay mineral, kaolinite. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the reactivity of NO2 − with Fe(II) added to kaolinite under anoxic conditions. Stirred batch reactivity experiments were carried out with 10 g L−1 kaolinite spiked with 25 and 100 µM Fe(II) at pH 6.45 in an anaerobic chamber. Approximately 500 µM NO2 − was added to initiate the reaction with Fe(II)-loaded kaolinite. The rate of nitrite removal from solution was 2.4-fold slower in the high Fe(II) treatment when compared with the low Fe(II) treatment. A large portion of the NO2 − removed from solution was confirmed to be reduced to N2O(g) in the Fe(II)-kaolinite slurries. However, NO2 − reduction was also noticed in the presence of kaolinite-alone and to somewhat lesser extent in the presence of dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB)-treated kaolinite. Chemical extractions coupled with infrared spectroscopy suggest that Fe(III) oxide mineral impurities and structural Fe(III) in kaolinite may participate in NO2 − removal from solution. Furthermore, a magnetite mineral was identified based on X-ray diffraction analysis of untreated kaolinite and DCB-treated kaolinite. Our findings reveal a novel pathway of NO2 − transformation in the environment in the presence of Fe(II) associated (sorbed and impurity) with kaolinite." .

Early identification and prioritization of these natural products with potential for novel mechanism of action, desirable pharmacokinetics and likelihood for development into drugs is advantageous. Chemo-informatic profiling of these natural products were conducted and compared to currently registered anti-malarial drugs (CRAD). MethodsNatural products with in vitro antiplasmodial activities (NAA) were compiled from various sources. These natural products were sub-divided into four groups based on inhibitory concentration (IC50). Key molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties were computed for these compounds and analysis of variance used to assess statistical significance amongst the sets of compounds. Molecular similarity analysis, estimation of drug-likeness, in silico pharmacokinetic profiling, and exploration of structure–activity landscape were also carried out on these sets of compounds. ResultsA total of 1040 natural products were selected and a total of 13 molecular descriptors were analysed. Significant differences were observed among the sub-groups of NAA and CRAD for at least 11 of the molecular descriptors, including number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, molecular weight, polar and hydrophobic surface areas, chiral centres, oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and shape index. The remaining molecular descriptors, including clogP, number of rotatable bonds and number of aromatic rings, did not show any significant difference when comparing the two compound sets. Molecular similarity and chemical space analysis identified natural products that were structurally diverse from CRAD. Prediction of the pharmacokinetic properties and drug-likeness of these natural products identified over 50 % with desirable drug-like properties. Nearly 70 % of all natural products were identified as potentially promiscuous compounds. Structure–activity landscape analysis highlighted compound pairs that form ‘activity cliffs’. In all, prioritization strategies for the NAA were proposed. ConclusionsChemo-informatic profiling of NAA and CRAD have produced a wealth of information that may guide decisions and facilitate anti-malarial drug development from natural products. Articulation of the information provided within an interactive data-mining environment led to a prioritized list of NAA." .

Between group comparisons were done with one-way analysis of variance. ResultsThe metal brackets revealed the lowest percentage of force loss due to friction, followed by the PCA and MCA ceramic bracket groups (67 ± 4, 68 ± 7, and 76 ± 3 %, respectively). There was no significant difference between SS and PCA brackets (p = 0.97), but we did observe significant differences between metal and MCA brackets (p = 0.03) and between PCA and MCA ceramic brackets (p = 0.04). ConclusionPCA ceramic brackets, whose slot surface is covered with an yttria-stabilized zirconia-based coating exhibited frictional properties similar to those of metal brackets. Frictional resistance resulted in an over 60 % loss of the applied force due to the use of elastic ligatures." .

Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics and Dyson norms, we calculate the photoionization signal of cytosine and disentangle the transient contributions originating from the different deactivation pathways of its tautomers. In the simulations, the total signal from the relevant keto and enol tautomers can be decomposed into contributions either from the neutral electronic state populations or from the distinct mechanistic pathways across the multiple potential surfaces.

In this study, ambient particulate matter of different sizes was collected from one site in an integrated iron and steelmaking industrial zone (HG) and one urban background site with no direct industrial emissions (ZWY) during a 1-year sampling campaign in China. The total concentrations of REEs for TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 were 27.248, 14.989, 3.542 ng/m3 in HG and 6.326, 5.274, 1.731 ng/m3, respectively, in ZWY, which revealed the local influence of the steelmaking activities to the air quality. With respect to ZWY, the REEs in HG site are obviously fractionated in the coarser fraction, and LREEs account for more than 80 % of the total REE burden in all of the samples. Additionally, the REEs in HG and ZWY show a homogeneous trend with successively increased LREE/HREE ratios from the coarse particles to the fine particles. In our samples, La, Ce, Nd, and Sm are the most enriched rare earth elements, especially in the HG site. Moreover, ternary diagrams of LaCeSm indicate that the REEs in HG are potentially contributed by steelworks, carrier vehicles, coal combustion, and road dust re-suspension." .

Rapid and sensitive detection methods are required for its control. Recently developed monoclonal antibodies were evaluated for detecting AP phytoplasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during different seasons and in different tissues of apple tree, including dormant bud-wood and roots. ELISA was compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on samples from 156 apple trees of 33 different cultivars. The sensitivity of ELISA was found to be high and AP phytoplasma could be reliably detected in samples of leaves, shoots and roots during the growing season and also in dormant bud-wood and roots. A simple and sensitive laboratory procedure for the detection of AP phytoplasma is proposed, based on ELISA, combined with simplified PCR analyses. The technique was successfully applied in a large-scale laboratory testing and should provide epidemiologists and state extension pathologists with a rapid and selective detection procedure during both growing and dormant seasons." .

All the studied Lewis pairs appeared to be stable on the basis of computed BSSE-corrected interaction energies; however, the free energies of formation computed in solution (ΔG solv) indicate that three Lewis acid–base combinations can be considered frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). Besides, the four features that characterize FLPs are: (1) large distances between the acid and base centers, (2) negligible changes in the geometry of the acid, (3) weak interaction energies, and (4) non-covalent dispersion energy contributing to almost the entire interaction energy. In the present work, we introduce two ad hoc indexes intended to quantify separately the electronic and steric factors, which have a direct effect in the intermolecular association of Lewis acids and Lewis bases and can be used to distinguished FLPs from classical Lewis adducts. Based on the aforementioned ad hoc indexes, the existence of a new kind of complexes that are “intermediate” between classical complexes and FLPs is proposed." .

In this work, the effect of pressure on end corrections in die flow is assessed with a combination of a pressure chamber and an orifice die, and applied to capillary rheometry measurements at different pressure levels. The pressure dependence of the end corrections has been found to show good correlations with an applied modified Power-Law model. By comparing the results to regular end corrections, the error in computing the viscosity has been found to be largely independent of the shear-rate. Neglecting the influence of pressure on end corrections yields 0–12 % too high viscosities, depending on the average die pressure." .

The final produced long nicked double-stranded DNA loses the ability to protect AgNPs from salt-induced aggregation. The stability variation of the colloid system can then be monitored by recording corresponding UV-vis spectrum and initial miRNA level is thus determined.

The emulsions were formulated by mixing soybean oil, surfactants (a mixture of Tween 20 and Tween 80), and distilled water. To determine the most suitable composition for the emulsions, a phase diagram was drawn, representing a mixture of soybean oil, surfactants, and distilled water. From the phase diagram, one-phase formulations were selected and the particle sizes of the formulations were compared. The stability of each formulation was confirmed over 4 weeks at 4 °C, by looking for any change in particle size. The effect of dilution on the pH of emulsion formulations was recorded. A soybean oil concentration of 5 % was sufficient to obtain emulsions. The surfactants used were a mixture of Tween 20 and Tween 80 in a 1:2 ratio, to ensure high ketoprofen solubility. Three formulations, termed E1, E2, and E3, produced emulsions with relatively small particles. The ketoprofen-loaded E1 formulation resulted in the smallest particles. The three formulations were physically stable for 4 weeks with no significant change in particle size. Dilution with distilled water did not alter the pH of the three emulsion formulations, but did change the conductivity. In conclusion, ketoprofen was solubilized by the emulsion formulation, and then remained stable when maintained at 4 °C; additionally, while the pH was unaltered, the conductivity of the formulation was changed by dilution with distilled water." .

The mean grain size of the Al2O3 and SiC nanoparticles (NPs) was set to 50 nm, and the difficult grinding Ni-based alloy was used as the workpiece material in the experiment. Grinding force was measure by using a three-component dynamometer and then used to calculate grinding force ratio (R). Workpiece surface roughness was measured by a roughness tester. Five groups of NPs were mixed with synthetic lipids at a mass fraction of 6 %. The lipids were then used as the grinding fluid for the nanofluid MQL grinding. Results showed that, compared with pure SiC NPs, pure Al2O3 NPs obtained lower R = 0.3, lower specific grinding energy (U = 75.93 J/mm3), and lower surface roughness (Ra = 0.386 μm), indicating better lubrication performance. The mixed NP consisting of Al2O3 and SiC NPs achieved even lower R and surface roughness than pure NPs because of the “physical synergistic effect.” The optimal ratio of the effect of mixed NPs was explored based on this finding. The Al2O3/SiC (2:1) mixed NPs obtained the smallest R = 0.28 and specific grinding energy (U = 60.68 J/mm3), thus indicating the best lubrication performance. Therefore, 2:1 is the optimal ratio for mixed NPs." .

In this study, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) based GAS detection assay in pharyngeal swab specimens was developed. MethodsThe qPCR assay was compared with the gold standard bacterial culture and a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) to evaluate its clinical performance in 687 patients. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 240 cfu/swab. Forty-five different potential cross-reacting organisms did not react with the test. Four different laboratories for the reproducibility studies were in 100 % (60/60) agreement for the contrived GAS positive and negative swab samples. ResultsThe relative sensitivities of the RADT and the qPCR test were 55.9 and 100 %; and the relative specificities were 100 and 96.3 %, respectively. Duration of the total assay for 24 samples including pre-analytical processing and analysis changed between 42 and 55 min depending on the type of qPCR instrument used. A simple DNA extraction method and a low qPCR volume made the developed assay an economical alternative for the GAS detection.

In our previous paper, only regenerative braking was used to charge the battery. However, this is not sufficient for CO2 and NOx emissions reduction, and thus, a more effective energy management system (EMS) should be developed. To maintain the battery state of charge (SOC), a target SOC is also introduced in the charge torque. In addition, a CHARGE driving condition where the charge torque by the ICE is generated is newly proposed. By introducing the CHARGE driving, the ICE driving region on torque-engine speed plane was reduced. As a result, a greater reduction in CO2 and NOx emissions is expected. Based on the EMS proposed in our previous papers, an EMS incorporating the CHARGE driving is developed. Through typical driving cycles, the validity of the proposed EMS algorithm incorporating the CHARGE driving is examined." .

It may also help in the analysis of disease-induced metabolomic changes in human tissues when the postoperational samples are compared to the post-mortem samples from healthy donors. ObjectivesThe goals of this study are to observe and classify the post-mortem changes occurring in the rabbit blood, aqueous and vitreous humors (AH and VH), to identify the potential PMI markers among a wide range of metabolites, and also to determine which biological fluid—blood, AH or VH—is more suitable for the PMI estimation. MethodsThe quantitative metabolomic profiling of samples of the rabbit serum, AH and VH taken at different PMIs has been performed with the combined use of high-frequency NMR and high-resolution LC–MS methods. ResultsThe quantitative levels of 61 metabolites in the rabbit serum, AH and VH at different PMIs have been measured. It has been found that the post-mortem metabolomic changes in AH and VH proceed slower than in blood, and the data scattering is lower. Among the metabolites whose concentrations increase with time, the most significant and linear growth is found for hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol. ConclusionThe obtained results suggest that the ocular fluids AH and VH may have some advantages over blood serum for the search of potential biochemical markers for the PMI estimation. Among the compounds studied in the present work, hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol give the biggest promise as the potential PMI biomarkers." .

Recycled wood is currently used for the production of wood based composites and for combustion. In the future, use of recycled wood will also be important as feedstock for biorefineries for the production of bio-based chemicals and biofuels. The present paper gives preliminary results on the feasibility of A I recycled wood (German classification, natural wood only treated mechanically) in a steam explosion and organosolv pre-treatment process. The presence of inorganic pollutants and non-wooden material in recycled wood material was investigated. The effect of recycled wood heterogeneity (e.g., variable wood species and wide particle size distribution) on performance of wood pretreatment and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis was also evaluated. Microeconomic analysis of lignocellulosic feedstock for a biorefinery using organosolv cooking was calculated with various price scenarios and various proportions of recycled wood instead of fresh beech chips. The results show that the concentration of inorganic pollutants is higher than in fresh wood but below the limit values for polluted wood. Preliminary results on steam explosion and ethanol based organosolv cooking without an acid catalyst showed typical behaviour of softwood for recycled wood of A I quality in respect of hydrolysability, thus being a potential future raw material for sugar production. A I recycled wood can be used in a biorefinery without major problems and can significantly improve the economics of investment in an industrial scale biorefinery." .
