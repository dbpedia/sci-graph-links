Abstract A theory of design layers proposed by Gibbons (An Architectural Approach to Instructional Design. Routledge, New York, 2014) asserts that each layer of an instructional design is related to a body of theory closely associated with the concerns of that particular layer. This study focuses on one layer, the control layer, examining potential candidates for layer-related theory to determine the validity of this claim. In the process of completing this study, the authors came to the realization that what they considered a relatively uncharismatic and uncomplicated layer actually holds the key to a better understanding of interactivity, interface design, and the design of more conversational instructional experiences.
