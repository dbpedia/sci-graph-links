Abstract The paper continues investigations on the development of a computer-aided method for the analysis of images of the facture of pictorial artworks. The feature description of the facture of paintings is extended. An earlier developed method of comparing a facture by features extracted from informative fragments of digitized images of portraits is applied. The features describe the direction of a brushstroke, which characterizes the artistic manner specific for specific details of a painting. A numerical experiment has shown that the value of the quantitative similarity index of paintings of the same artist (F.S. Rokotov) is higher than the value of the quantitative similarity index of the works of different artists. A portrait attributed to Rokotov is compared with his authentic works, as well as with portraits painted by different artists of the XVIIâˆ’XIX centuries. The results of the computer analysis of the facture of paintings do not contradict the results of traditional technico-technological investigations.
