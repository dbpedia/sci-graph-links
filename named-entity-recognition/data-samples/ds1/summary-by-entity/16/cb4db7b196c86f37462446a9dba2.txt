Abstract Rural, high-amenity areas in the USA continue to attract significant numbers of migrants. A common approach to investigating the potential consequences of rural in-migration is to contrast the characteristics, attitudes, and/or actions of migrants and non-migrants (or “newcomers” and “oldtimers”). However, no consensus exists on the distinctions (or the lack thereof) between these two groups in the existing literature, in part because previous research used a variety of methods to classify residence status. Drawing on household survey data from nine communities in north-central Colorado, this study illustrates how different categorizations may yield different conclusions. Categorizing resident groups by the 1970/1980 cutoff or 5-, 10-, or 20-year length of residence substantially altered the differences and similarities between newcomers and oldtimers in selected sociodemographic, perceptual, and behavior indicators. It is recommended that researchers choose the most appropriate classification approach based on specific research questions and objectives as well as important transitions in the migration patterns of their study areas. These findings have direct implications for future research on rural demographic change and socioeconomic restructuring.
