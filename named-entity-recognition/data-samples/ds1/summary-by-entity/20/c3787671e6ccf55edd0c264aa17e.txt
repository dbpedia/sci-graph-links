Abstract An expansion of the eZoomBook (eZB) platform, the ‘myplace4u’ project was designed for place branding and the promotion of literature by linking texts to places—geographical, historical, and touristic places visited physically or imaginatively. The platform allows contributors to collaboratively create and share multi-level books called “eZoomBooks” or digital enriched versions of the original version, organized according to tabs linked to place names in the original. A zooming function enables readers of the eZoomBooks on the platform to navigate freely between the original and enriched versions. Teacher-directed collaboration activities expand the applications of the eZB platform and myplace4u extension.
