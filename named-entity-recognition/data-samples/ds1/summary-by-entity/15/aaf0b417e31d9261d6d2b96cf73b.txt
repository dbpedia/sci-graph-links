Revenue Management (RM) emerged as a specific discipline in the mid-1980s. However, despite the fact that it has been seen as a set of techniques to influence customer demand and exploit the consumer surplus, there has been a tendency for much of the research in the area to lack a consumer focus. What research there is tends to focus on three main areas, namely, the algorithm modelling of consumer behaviour, consumer trust and fairness and consumer-centric marketing. The purpose of this article therefore is to consolidate and synthesise existing consumer focused research in RM in these three key areas.
