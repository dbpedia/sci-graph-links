Abstract Discussions of post-processual archaeology are summarized in order to suggest that historical archaeology is in a particularly good position to answer the post-processual critiques of the “new” archaeology and to create a contextual archaeology that is both historically and anthropologically informed and relevant. The work of four scholars is noted as particularly influential in the development of post-processual approaches.
