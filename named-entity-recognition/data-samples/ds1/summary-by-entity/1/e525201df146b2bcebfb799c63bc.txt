Abstract In the paper the explicit conditions for stability of linear fractional order h-difference systems with the Grünwald–Letnikov-type operator are presented. The state variables of the considered systems are taken from the plane. As the tool the $${\\mathcal {Z}}$$ Z -transform, which can be considered as an effective method for the stability analysis of linear systems, is used. The main result gives the sufficient and necessary condition for the asymptotic stability of the considered system according to the entries of the given matrix associated with the system.
