Abstract The STEM TIPS mobile-ready support platform gives institutions or school districts the ability to provide immediate and customized mentoring to teachers through multiple tiers of web-based support and resources. Using the results of a needs assessment, STEM TIPS was created and launched in partnership with 18 Florida school districts. Further results of a user survey from the pilot year of implementation reveal that this program served teacher needs from the initial assessment and enhanced teacher practice. The platform is now structured to provide instructional and support services for multiple partnering districts and institutions both nationally and internationally. Since this program offers induction support to distant and often isolated teachers in real time, it is a substantive model of a solution to the professional development of significant numbers of new teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in middle and high schools.
