Abstract Cognitive studies suggest that repeated test taking is a better learning method than repeated studying. However, the effect of self-directed use of tests as study aids by medical students on basic science examination performance has not been studied. In this study, we analyzed performance of first year medical students (n = 107) on both formative and summative examinations. Five formative examinations were administered weekly and the summative examination was administered at the end of a 5-week unit. Examinations consisted of basic science discipline test items. Prior to examinations, students were given unrestricted access to self-tests (STs) (one per formative examination). In average, each ST was used by 60% of students. On four out of five formative examinations, students who used STs performed better than those who did not use STs. There were no significant ST use-dependent performance changes for a control discipline (a discipline for which no STs were available). On the summative examination, students who used all five STs scored significantly higher on the test discipline items (86 ± 8, mean ± SD) than students who did not use STs (76 ± 14). A multiple regression analysis showed that the number of STs used was a significant positive predictor of the summative examination score. This study suggests that the use of STs as study aids improves student performance on basic science examinations in a medical school. Evidence provided by this study and our future studies should help justify the use of STs as an essential component of medical education, especially for the basic sciences.
