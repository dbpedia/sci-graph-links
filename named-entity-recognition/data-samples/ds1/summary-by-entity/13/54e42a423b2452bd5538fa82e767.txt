Abstract BackgroundYouth placed in out-of-home care are at significant risk of low academic achievement and poor mental health. Few studies have considered the potential effects of school-related factors, such as school placement stability and school engagement, on youth outcomes. ObjectiveThe current study examined the potential main effects of school placement stability and engagement on academic achievement and mental health. Furthermore, we examined whether school-related factors moderated the association between home placement stability and youth outcomes. MethodsParticipants included 420 youth (age 6–14 at baseline) placed in out-of-home care participating in a national longitudinal study of youth in contact with the child welfare system. Youth, caregivers, and caseworkers provided relevant information at baseline, 18, and 36 months. Hierarchical regression models were constructed to test potential main and moderating effects of school engagement and school placement stability on youth mental health and academic achievement prospectively, while accounting for relevant covariates. ResultsSchool placement stability was an independent predictor of youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but was not significantly associated with academic outcomes. Furthermore, there were no main effects of school engagement or home placement stability on youth outcomes and school-related factors did not moderate the relationship between home placement stability and youth outcomes. ConclusionFor children and adolescents who do not have the benefit of a stable, safe, or caring home environment, school stability may be contribute to an environment that can foster healthy development.
