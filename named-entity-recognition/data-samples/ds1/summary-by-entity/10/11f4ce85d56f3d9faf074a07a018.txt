Abstract In this paper, a class of high-order Hopfield neural networks with neutral distributed delays is considered. Some sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of weighted pseudo-almost automorphic solutions for this class of networks by employing the Banach fixed-point theorem and differential inequality techniques. The results of this paper are completely new. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and results.
