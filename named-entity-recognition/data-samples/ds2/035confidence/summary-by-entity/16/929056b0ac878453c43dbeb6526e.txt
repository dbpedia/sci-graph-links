Abstract This study describes the lived experience of Kevin, a young child with physical disabilities who is placed in an inclusive classroom, a classroom where children with and without disabilities are educated together, with extra support provided for the child with disabilities. Children with disabilities who are placed in inclusive early childhood settings tend to be rejected or neglected more than their typically developing peers and are involved more with the adults in the classroom than with their peers. Kevin’s experiences are framed in the context of the current emphasis on inclusive practices. The study documents that adult assistance and curriculum activities both play an important role in either facilitating or constraining social interaction with peers. When the assigned assistant functions as the child’s playmate and mostly chooses table activities, both of these seem to limit opportunities for social interaction with peers. This study also documents that, without the assistant present, the child makes independent choices such as where and with whom to play. The dramatic play area serves as a conduit for meaningful verbal and nonverbal communication with peers. At the same time, Kevin’s strong desire to play in this area seems to be the impetus for physical development—he walks alone for the very first time. Suggestions are given for teacher facilitation of dramatic play.
