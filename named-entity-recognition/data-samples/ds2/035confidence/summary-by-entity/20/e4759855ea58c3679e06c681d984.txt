Summary The song repertoires of male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) are comprised of distinct song types and many overlapping variations within each type. This study examines the sensitivity of territorial male song sparrows to both multiple song types and variation within types. A playback experiment was conducted using stimulus tapes that had either single songs (but not variations), song variations (but not types) or a single song. Response during playback was similar for all three stimulus groups, but diminished sooner after playback for the single-song tape. Thus our results indicate that male song sparrows are sensitive to song variability both within and among song types.
