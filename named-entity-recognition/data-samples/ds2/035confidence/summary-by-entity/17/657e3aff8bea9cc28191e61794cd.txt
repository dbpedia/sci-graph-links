Summary Two experiments investigated the effects of noise on the processing of global shape and local detail. Both experiments showed that noise improved ordered recall of local features but impaired recall of global shape, although the extent of the effect of noise was influenced by the size of the compound stimuli. Noise did not produce the same effects as those obtained when attention is manipulated by instructions, and it is possible that noise produced a change in the more passive aspect of attention rather than altering the active allocation of attentional resources.
