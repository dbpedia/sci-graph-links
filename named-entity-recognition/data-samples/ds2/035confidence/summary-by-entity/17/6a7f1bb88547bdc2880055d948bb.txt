Abstract This article discusses some design issues in the self-citing rate and the self-cited rate proposed by the Social Sciences Citation Index for journals. Improvements on the above measures lead to two new citation indicatorsâ€”the Openness Index and the Affinity Index. These new indices could be expressed in terms of several components (self, own-field, other-field, overall). Each of these components indicates more specific citation situations of a journal. The application of these new citation indicators is illustrated in the measurement of some journal's characteristics in the field of communication.
