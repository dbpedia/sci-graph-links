Summary This study assesses the effects of the stated purpose of treatment on University students' willingness to be involved in treatment for emotional problems. The study involved 26 male Nigerian undergraduate students evidencing severe examination anxiety. These students were randomly assigned to one of three groups with different treatment goals (a “mind change” group, a “behaviour change” group, and a “No Goal” group). All subjects received the same treatment — a combination of systematic desensitization and a process of gradual habituation. Differences between the groups in willingness to participate in treatment were assessed on the basis of the actual frequency of attendance at scheduled treatment sessions by subjects in each group. The results indicated that the subjects in the “behaviour change” group attended significantly more treatment sessions than the subjects in the other two groups. This finding suggests the need for awareness of the possible effects of the stated or implied treatment goals on the acceptance of psychological treatment among university-level educated clients.
