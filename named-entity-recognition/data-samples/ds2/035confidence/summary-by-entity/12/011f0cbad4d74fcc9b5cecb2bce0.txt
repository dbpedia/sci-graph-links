Abstract Grass-root research activities to clarify fire safety performance of Japanese traditional wooden construction are introduced. The activities aim to resolve conflict between the restoration of historic buildings and the reduction of risk and hazard of urban fires. Among various activities, scope and results of fire resistance tests on traditional soil wall assemblies supported by timber frame are reported in detail. The test results indicate an encouraging prospect for the rational fire safety assessment of historic buildings and further development of fire-safe traditional constructions for the restoration of historic buildings and historic urban districts.
