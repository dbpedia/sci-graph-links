Abstract Within Lubelskie province (SE Poland) are several regions notable for groups of landforms unique in Poland. In this paper, tourists’ assessments of the geomorphological heritage of the region have been analysed. The most interesting sites, from both the scientific and touristic points of view and also proposed for the national list of geomorphosites, were chosen for the study. The evaluation by tourists was carried out by means of an Internet survey with 693 answers collected over 6 weeks. The sites visited most frequently by the respondents are loess gullies and river valleys with small waterfalls. The sites were mostly visited during car trips and as part of walking excursions during a long-term stay. The main motivation for visiting the surveyed sites was the aesthetic value of the landscape. The respondents sought information, mainly on the Web, about nature, culture and tourist attractions. The results of the survey indicate a need for further promotion of the geotouristic values of lesser-known sites in Lubelskie province and this will also enable tourism to be better managed.
