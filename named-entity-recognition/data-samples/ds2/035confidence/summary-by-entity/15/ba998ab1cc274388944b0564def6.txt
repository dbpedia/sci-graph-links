Abstract Despite the progress that has been achieved using modern methods of decision support, competitive intelligence is one of the most economical methods of instrument for executive information system with a relatively high rate of effectiveness. The objectives of this study are (1) to investigate the conception of competitive intelligence and the furtherance of competitive intelligence on the executive information system stage; (2) to form an innovative structural equation modelling for executive information system through the perspectives of competitive intelligence; (3) to examine the influences of competitive intelligence on executive information system and organizational performances. Questionnaire survey methodology was applied to receive data from executives in Taiwan. The process, the product of competitive intelligence, and organizational performances were observed as three considerable axles in this investigation. The results reveal testimony that competitive intelligence is positively related to organizational performances, indicating that competitive intelligence does influence the behavior of decision-making both of enterprise executives and the entire organization. The findings of this study disclose that integrating competitive intelligence activities exert a complete function on executive information system for enterprise executives.
