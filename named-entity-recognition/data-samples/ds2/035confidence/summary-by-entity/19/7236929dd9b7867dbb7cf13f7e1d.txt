Abstract Death and the dying process often present various transitions, which have a significant impact on one’s physical and psychological states of being. Dance/movement therapy, drawing from a strong theoretical base, as well as a rich body of experiential work, offers integrative support to individuals experiencing physical degradation and confronting their mortality. Dance/movement therapists are equipped with specific techniques, deep body knowledge and a philosophical frame to enable them to skillfully work with individuals who feel disconnected from their bodies as a result of the physical degeneration often accompanying one’s transition to death. This research, steeped in the experiences of those confronting death, demonstrates the innate qualities of dance/movement therapy deemed useful to individuals moving into the final stages of life as well as to the entire field of palliative care.
