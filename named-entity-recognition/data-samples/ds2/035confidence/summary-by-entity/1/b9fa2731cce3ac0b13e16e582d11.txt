Abstract A cubature formula with degree of exactness ≦2k−2 has at leastk(k+1)/2 knots. The existence of such minimal formulae is equivalent to the existence of solutions of a system of quadratic equations. Each solution of such a system generates in a uniquely determined way a minimal formula. For the square [−1, 1]2 as domain of integration and for some weight-functions these systems have a simple form, but they seem to be hard to solve. In this note attention is drawn to these systems and to experiences made in order to obtain numerical solutions.
