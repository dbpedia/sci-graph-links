Abstract Mathematical structures such as intervals, vectors and matrices are only insufficiently considered by the usual computer arithmetic. In this paper a general and modular concept for computer arithmetic is proposed which finally covers all spaces occurring in numerical computations (see figure 1). The operations are performed following a uniform construction principle. It induces a set of mapping properties between real and rounded operations which by the way guarantees optimal accuracy.
