Abstract The study investigated the relationship between children’s hair-Al concentrations and children’s behavioral performance in school. Hair-Al levels of 102 children drawn from a general school population were correlated with teachers’ ratings of the children on the Walker Problem Behavior Identification Checklist (WPBIC). Increasing hair-Al values correlated significantly with increased scores on the WPBIC total scale score. A continuing reexamination of Al exposure in the young is needed in order to determine the margin of safety regarding potentially toxic levels of Al.
