Abstract As reported, cancer patients and their significant others need information to promote their understanding of events throughout the illness, and support to mobilize coping strategies when they consider the demands of the situation exceed their personal resources. It has, however, repeatedly been reported that communication barriers exist and that information does not always reach the target. In the present study the provision of information entered the field of education. An education and support program was developed, based on results from a learning-needs assessment. The program has now been evaluated. Cancer patients and their significant others (n=127) participated in group sessions. After completion of the program, open interactive interviews organized around experiences of increased knowledge and understanding, and enhanced coping capacity related to participation in the program were conducted with the participants. The interviews were analyzed using the grounded theory approach. The findings indicate that supportive education, sensitively responsive to expressed needs and learning capability, has the power to promote proper understanding and facilitate coping efforts. Becoming familiar with facts and feeling reinforced confidence in evolving appropriate coping strategies for living with cancer.
