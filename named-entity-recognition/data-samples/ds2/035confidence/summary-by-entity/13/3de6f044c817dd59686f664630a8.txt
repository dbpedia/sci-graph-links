Abstract Should universities concern themselves with social criticism or should their intellectual role be conceived solely in terms of the preservation and extension of knowledge? It is argued that the claim that universities should act as centres of social criticism can be justified on two grounds: the nature of intellectual inquiry and the concept of higher education. Several current sources of opposition to this view are then examined and ways in which they might be resisted are outlined.
