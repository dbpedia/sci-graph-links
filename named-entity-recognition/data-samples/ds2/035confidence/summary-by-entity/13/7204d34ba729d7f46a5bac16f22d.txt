Abstract IntroductionCurrently, no prerequisite teaching qualification is required to serve as faculty for SAGES hands-on courses (SAGES-HOC). The Lapco-Train-the-Trainers (Lapco-TT) is a course for surgical trainers, in which delegates learn a standardized teaching technique for skills acquisition. The aims of this study were to 1) determine if this curriculum could be delivered in a day course to SAGES-HOC faculty and 2) assess the impact of such training on learners’ educational experience taught by this faculty at a subsequent SAGES-HOC. Methods and proceduresSix experts attended a one-day Lapco-TT course. SAGES-HOC participants were split into two groups: Group A taught by Lapco-TT trained, and Group B by “untrained” course faculty. Opinion surveys were completed by both the SAGES-HOC learners and the Lapco-TT trained course faculty. Furthermore, the latter underwent self-, learner-, and observer-based evaluation using a previously validated teaching assessment tool (cSTTAR). Mean scores were reported and analyzed [Mann–Whitney U, t test (p < 0.05)]. ResultsAll 6 Lapco-TT delegates found the course useful (5), and felt that it would influence the way they taught in the OR (4.83), that their course objectives were met (4.83), and that they would recommend the course to their colleagues (4.83). Of the SAGES-HOC participants, compared to Group B (n = 22), Group A learners(n = 10) better understood what they were supposed to learn (5 vs. 4.15 [p = 0.046]) and do (5 vs. 4 [p = 0.046]), felt that the session was well organized (5 vs. 4 [p = 0.046]), that time was used effectively (5 vs. 3.9 [p = 0.046]), and that performance feedback was sufficient (5 vs. 3.9 [p = 0.028]) and effective (5 vs. 3.95 [p = 0.028]). Group A faculty were rated significantly higher by their learners on the cSTTARs than Group B (p < 0.0005). Group A faculty rated themselves significantly lower than both expert observers (p < 0.0005) and compared to the Group B faculty’s self-assessment (p < 0.002). ConclusionsThe Lapco-TT course can be delivered effectively over one day and impacts the educational experience of learners at a SAGES-HOC. This could help establish a standardized method of teaching at SAGES-HOCs and thereby increase their value for learners.
