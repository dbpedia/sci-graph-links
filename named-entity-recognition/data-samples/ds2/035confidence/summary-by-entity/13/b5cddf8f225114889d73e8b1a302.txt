Abstract In order to assess the accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG), in children who have undergone cardiac surgery under simple deep hypothermia, the relation between IQ or schoolwork achievement and the duration of circulatory arrest was investigated in 75 such children. Abnormal preoperative EEG's were found in 16 per cent of the children while abnormal postoperative EEG's were found in 17 per cent. The children were divided into 4 groups, according to pre- and postoperative EEG results. Schoolwork achievement scores ranged between 3.0 and 3.2, the difference among the groups being insignificant. Moreover, no significant shift in IQ was found among the groups. Finally, regarding the number of children who were able to go on to a higher level of education, including high school the college or university, again no significant differences were found among the 4 groups. In a comparison with the number of such children in neighboring Nagasaki prefecture able to continue on to a higher level of education, no significant differences were seen either. The findings and statistics of this investigation therefore indicate that pre- and postoperative EEG's are not always a reliable reference for assessing the prognosis of cerebral activity.
