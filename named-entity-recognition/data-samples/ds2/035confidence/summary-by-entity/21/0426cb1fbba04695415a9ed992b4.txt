Abstract This article analyzes the roles and statuses of women from a comparative perspective. The subject countries cover a broad cross-section of ethnic, economic, and political differences. The authors report data and discuss such issues as the demographic characteristics of women (i. e., age distribution, marital status, and fertility rates), level of education, work force participation, political activity, military service, and access to health care. Social class and ethnic and racial differences among the women in each of the societies are also considered. They offer a short historical review of the major legislative and social changes that have occurred in the status of women in many of the subject societies during the past 50 years. The authors describe the degree of relative social freedom that women enjoy in the different societies and how their statuses differ from those of men.
