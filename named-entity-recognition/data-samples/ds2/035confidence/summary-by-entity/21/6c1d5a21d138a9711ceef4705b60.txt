Abstract In this paper, we present several new constructions for k holey mutually orthogonal Latin squares (HMOLS) of type g n . We concentrate mainly on k=4; here, for all but two values of n, namely 6 and 15, only a finite number of unsolved cases remain. Some new sets of 5 and 6 HMOLS are also given, in particular 5 HMOLS(2 q ) for qâ‰¥63 or q an odd prime power between 6 and 62, plus 6 HMOLS(4 q )for q an odd prime power between 8 and 60.
