The two nitroxide radical sites antiferromagnetically interact with each other, generating a thermally accessible triplet state located 4 cm−1 above the singlet ground state. The present fine-structure and hyperfine spectral simulation for the spin Hamiltonian parameters of the biradical is sensitive to the local molecular structure at the spin-bearing site, illustrating a salient electronic structure of the radical sites with the π-orbitals on the nitrogen (and oxygen) atoms cross-facing each other. The derived structure contrasts with the molecular structure determined by an X-ray crystal analysis for the hydroxylamine precursor of the biradical. The distance between the two midpoints of the nitrogen–oxygen bonds at the radical sites is by 0.234 nm longer than the one (=0.314 nm) of the two hydroxyl groups of the precursor determined by the X-ray analysis. The lack of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen and hydrogen of the hydroxyl groups, caused by the oxidation of the hydroxyamino precursor, gives rise to such a sizable increase in the distance between the radical sites. The HYSCORE experiments gave a direct evidence of the local molecular structure of the radical site of the partially oxidized monoradical. The experimentally derived molecular structures of both the bi-, monoradicals and the precursor are in good agreement with those obtained by density functional theory calculations." .

By combining good spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, the detailed behavior of these reversal regions has been investigated. Many of the regions show a growth and subsequent decay in the affected area, peak intensity, line width, and depth of the central reversal. Lifetimes of the time-varying reversal features range from 10 to more than 60 min, and they are found near the edges of the prominence fine structure. These events are similar to the impulsive events that the authors discussed in an earlier paper, and may share a common cause. The detailed behavior of the Hα line profiles is consistent with these reversal features being true self-reversal of the line, indicating unusually high column masses in these areas. Some models of condensation of coronal material to the prominence state predict temporary regions of high density, perhaps high enough to produce the observed reversal. This implies that reversal features are the result of on-going condensation of coronal material into already formed prominences, a result which impacts models of prominence formation and stability." .

Three possible modes of CO2 insertion into (PSiP)Pd-allyl bond have been calculated, that is, direct 1.2-insertion mode, metallo-ene mode, and SE2 mode. The metallo-ene mode is the most favorable via the six-membered ring transition state. The results of calculations are consistent with the regioselectivity observed experimentally. The steric and electronic effects of different phosphine substituents have been evaluated by ONIOM and energy decomposition analysis (EDA) methods.

All three resulting fluorescent lactoferrins exhibited fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), but they all presented different FRET patterns. Whereas only partial FRET was observed for Lf and LfFe, practically complete FRET was seen for the holo form (LfFe2). For each form of metal-loaded lactoferrin, the AF350–AF430 distance varied depending on the protein conformation, which in turn depended on the level of iron loading. Thus, the FRET patterns of these lactoferrins were found to correlate with their iron loading levels. In order to gain greater insight into the number of fluorophores and the different FRET patterns observed (i.e., their iron levels), a computational analysis was performed. The results highlighted a number of lysines that have the greatest influence on the FRET profile. Moreover, despite the lack of an X-ray structure for any LfFe species, our study also showed that this species presents modified subdomain organization of the N-lobe, which narrows its iron-binding site. Complete domain rearrangement occurs during the LfFe to LfFe2 transition. Finally, as an example of the possible applications of the results of this study, we made use of the FRET fingerprints of these fluorescent lactoferrins to monitor the interaction of lactoferrin with a healthy bacterium, namely Bifidobacterium breve. This latter study demonstrated that lactoferrin supplies iron to this bacterium, and suggested that this process occurs with no protein internalization. Graphical abstractThe FRET patterns of fluorescent apo-, monoferric, and hololactoferrins were found to correlate with their iron loading levels. This finding was used to create a sensor to monitor the process by which human lactoferrin supplies iron to probiotic bifidobacteria." .

The coplanarity of the A-π-A segment and distinct noncoplanarity of the indoline donor part of each dye were confirmed by checking the calculated geometric parameters. The relationships between molecular modifications and the optical properties of the dyes were derived in terms of the partial density of states, absorption spectrum, frontier molecular orbital, and excited-state charge transfer. 3D real-space analysis of the transition density (TD) and charge difference density (CDD) was also performed to further investigate the excited-state features of the molecular systems, as they provide visualized physical pictures of the charge separation and transfer. It was found that modifying the alkyl chain of the bridge unit near the acceptor unit is an efficient way to decrease dye aggregation and improve DSSC efficiency. Inserting a hexylthiophene group next to the donor unit leads to a complicated molecular structure and a decrease in the charge-transfer ability of the system, which has an unfavorable impact on DSSC performance." .

However, the dielectric polarization derived from Gauss’s law used in the Born equation differs from that obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, the adjustment of Born radii is insufficient for fitting the solvation free energy to various solute conformations. In order to mimic the dielectric polarization surrounding a solute in molecular dynamics simulations, the water molecule in the first coordination shell is modeled as a physical dipole in a van der Waals sphere, and the intermediate water is treated as a bulk solvent. The electric dipole of the first-shell water is modeled as positive and negative surface charge layers with fixed charge magnitudes, but with variable separation distance as derived from the distributions of hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water dictated by their orientational distribution functions. An equation that describes the solvation free energy of ions using this solvent scheme with a TIP3P water model is derived, and the values of the solvation free energies of ions estimated from this derived equation are found to be similar to those obtained from the experimental data." .

Five simulation runs (5 ns each) were performed at room temperature to study the consequences of a mixed electrostatic/constrained modeling for the coordination between the metal and the polypeptide chain, using for the ligand residues a set of charges that is modified with respect to the apo form of the protein by the presence of the copper ion. The results show that the different charge values do not lead to relevant effects on the geometry of the active site of the protein, as long as bond distance constraints are used for all the five ligand atoms. The distance constraint on the O atom of Gly45 can be removed without altering the active site geometry. The coordination between Cu and the other axial ligand Met121 is outlined as being flexible.

Reaction profiles for OH-initiated hydrogen abstraction are modeled including the formation of pre-reactive and post-reactive complexes at entrance and exit channels. Our calculations reveal that hydrogen abstraction from the –CH2 group is thermodynamically more facile than that from the –CH3 group. This is further ascertained by the calculated C-H bond dissociation energy of CF3CF2CH2OCH3 molecule. The rate constants of the titled reactions are computed over the temperature range of 250–450 K. The calculated rate constant value at 298 K is found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. The atmospheric life time of HFE-365mcf3 is estimated to be 42 days.

The binding of pyruvic acid and non-native ketoacids in the active site of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase was examined using docking analysis, and our results suggest that enzyme-non-native ketoacid-bound species are feasible. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods were then used to study the geometry of the covalent intermediate formed from the enzyme and the various ketoacids. Finally, quantum mechanical methods were used to study the decarboxylation reaction of 2-keto acids at the mechanistic level. This hierarchical screening ranked the substrates from those that cannot be accommodated by the enzyme (phenyl pyruvate) to those whose conversion rate would most closely approach that of the native substrate (2-ketobutanoic acid and 2-ketovaleric acid). Most notably, our investigation suggests that novel pathways generated using generalized enzyme actions may be screened using the hierarchical approach employed here." .

The results indicate that the N–N bond length of the RDX molecule in solvents differs clearly from that in gas phase. The solvent effect on bond and dihedral angles of RDX molecule is small, however, the RDX molecule still maintains the AEE configuration. Natural population analysis shows that, due to solvation effects, RDX O atoms attract more electrons in solvents than in gas phase, while more positive charge distributes to the molecular skeleton. The calculations of N–NO2 bond BDE and nitro group charge as well as surface electrostatic potential parameters reveal that the solvent effect may be helpful to reduce the sensitivity of RDX, but this effect has an upper limit. Finally, it can be predicted qualitatively that the crystal quality of RDX crystallized from cyclohexanone and dimethyl sulphoxide will be higher than that from acetone and dimethyl formamide.

Here, we considered the vdW forces for the interacting molecules that originate from the interacting π electrons of the two systems. The −0.54 eV adsorption energy reveals that the interaction of benzene with the side wall of the SWCNT is typical of the strong physisorption and comparable with the experimental value for benzene adsorption onto the graphene sheet.

The small molecule ceritinib can overcome drug-resistance mutations that are observed in crizotinib-resistant patients, although the detailed mechanism for this ability of ceritinib remains elusive. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of six systems (including the apo ALK, the wild-type ALK–ceritinib complex, as well as four complexes of ceritinib with the I1171T, L1196M, S1206Y, and G1269A mutants of ALK, respectively) together with the subsequent molecular mechanics–generalized Born/surface area binding free energy calculations were performed to answer this question. Principal component analysis and domain cross-correlation analysis of MD trajectories revealed that ceritinib binding stabilized the conformational dynamics of both the wild-type and the four mutated ALKs as compared to the apo ALK. Moreover, the mutations had subtle effects on the conformation of ALK compared to that of the wild-type ALK. Importantly, binding free energy calculations demonstrated that, compared its effect on the wild-type ALK, ceritinib showed slightly increased potency towards the I1171T, L1196M, S1206Y, and G1269A mutants.

In particular, two types of convex polygons having a unique side length (rhombuses and triangles) are considered in this work. It is shown that the saturation via hydrogen atoms of the apical carbons located on outer borders of the 60-degree angles increases the number of quasi-degenerate orbitals, and hence the maximal multiplicity of the low-lying states of the system.

Molecular dynamics simulations, using quantum mechanically deduced parameters for the nonheme Fe(II) cofactor, were performed and showed a distinct organization of the hydrophilic triad in the free and substrate-ligated wild-type enzyme. It is shown that in the free species, the Fe(II) center is coordinated to three histidines and one glutamate, whereas the substrate-ligated, catalytically competent enzyme–substrate complex has an Fe(II) center with three-histidine coordination, with a small fraction of three-histidine, one-glutamate coordination. The substrate binding modes and channels for the traffic of water and ligands (2,4-pentandionyl anion, methylglyoxal, and acetate) were identified. To characterize the impact of the hydrophobic protein environment around the metal center on catalysis, a set of hydrophobic residues close to the active site were targeted. The variations resulted in an up to tenfold decrease of the O2 reduction rates for the mutants. Molecular dynamics studies revealed an impact of the hydrophobic residues on the substrate stabilization in the active site as well as on the orientations of Glu98 and Arg80, which have previously been shown to be crucial for catalysis. Consequently, the Glu98–His104 interaction in the variants is weaker than in the wild-type complex.

The highest synergistic effect was observed for the monoterpenes, like piperitone, which contained a conjugated ketone and C=C bond in their carbon ring structure. Piperitone also suppressed the emergence of nitrofurantoin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae that were mutagenized by ethyl methanesulfonate. The modes of interaction of carvone, piperitone, and an enzyme inhibitor, benzoate, with nitroreductase were investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for 20 ns. MD simulation supported greater stability of the benzoate and monoterpene–nitroreductase (NR) complexes than of free NR. The results of this investigation are promising for the synthesis of more effective lead compounds to enhance the antibacterial activity of nitro drugs against resistant Enterobacter strains." .

On the computational side, a modular explicit finite element hydrocode based on updated Lagrangian formulation is developed. A non-classical contour integration is employed to calculate the nodal forces in the constant strain axisymmetric triangular elements. Cell and nodal averaging of volumetric strain formulations are implemented on different mesh architectures to reduce the incompressibility constraints and eliminate volumetric locking. On the experimental side, a gas gun is designed and manufactured, and Taylor impact tests of cylinders made of several metallic materials are performed. Computational predictions of the deformed profiles of Taylor cylinders and experimentally determined deformed profiles are compared for verification purposes and to infer conclusions on the effect of yield strength, strain hardening and strain rate on the material response. The article also compares the performance of different plastic flow stress models that are incorporated into the hydrocode with the experimental results and results provided by previously reported simulations and tests." .

Antiradical activity was measured using ABTS and DPPH radicals and ferric ions (FRAP test). The reduction potential of the compounds was also investigated by determination of minimal hydrogen abstraction energy for each of the hydroxyl hydrogens of all compounds using quantum chemistry methods. Quercetin appeared to be a strong antioxidant when the FRAP test was performed and the strongest for ABTS and DPPH tests whereas genkwanin was the weakest antioxidant for three tests (FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH). Flavonols appeared to have much stronger antiradical activity than flavones. An exception was luteolin, which belongs to flavones but exhibited antiradical activity comparable to that of flavonols, probably due to the presence of a hydroxyl group in the B ring at the 3′ position next to another hydroxyl group at position 4′. The study using UB3LYP/6-31G(d,p) model chemistry of density functional theory (DFT) showed the lowest hydrogen abstraction energy (HAE) for the hydroxyl group situated at 3′ or 5′ of myricetin. Based on the experimental results and computational studies, we conclude that the hydroxyl group situated at 4′ in the B ring in flavonoids, and to a lesser at the 3′ and 3 position in flavonols is the most important for antioxidant activity of flavonoids. We observe strong negative Spearman’s rank order correlations between minimal HAE and antiradical activity of flavonoids in all three tests and double-tailed rejection P values are less than 0.001." .

The data suggest that boron softens the lattice, but softening due to substitutions of carbon with boron is much weaker than due to incorporation of boron into interstitial positions. Theoretical results obtained for substitution of carbon are in very good agreement with our experiment.

The results led to the following conclusions. (i) The substitutions are nucleophilic reactions. There are two substitution paths, I and II, which both lead to the germane H2GeFSiH3. The enantiomers of this germane are obtained via these two paths if an H in SiH3X is replaced with a different group or atom. (ii) Both substitution pathways show the same order of barrier heights (SiH3F > SiH3Cl > SiH3Br). The difference between the bond energies of Li–X and Si–X may explain the precedence among the substitution reactions of G with SiH3X. Path I has a lower activation barrier than path II, indicating that path I is more favorable. (iii) Comparison between the relevant insertion and substitution reactions shows that substitutions are more favorable and that the substitution product H2GeFSiH3 predominates over the insertion product.

Various possible reaction pathways are considered. It is shown that six dissociation products P 1 (NH3 + + HCN), P 2 (NH4 + + CN), P 3 (NH3 + + HNC), P 9 (HCNH+ + NH2) P 10 (NCNH3 + + H), and P 12 (HNCNH2 + + H) are both thermodynamically and kinetically feasible.

The heavy atom effect increases the intersystem crossing rate, and the transient triplet absorbance could be measured. Fluorescence emission was not observed. The transient absorption spectra show two peaks in the region of 385–410 nm and 770–830 nm having a red shift with increasing size of N substituent. The singlet and triplet states and their vertical transitions were investigated theoretically by NEVPT2/CASSCF(12,9) and CAM-B3LYP methods for a benchmark molecule N-Phenyl-maleimide, and by CAM-B3LYP for N-Phenyl-TCP. It is shown that the singlet excited S1 state and the pi-pi* triplet state have similar geometries, thus intersystem crossing is most likely for N-Phenyl-TCP. No crossing between the singlet ground state and the singlet excited states could be found on the linear synchronous transit paths of S0-S1-T1-S0 states using CAM-B3LYP method.

Any procedure that aims to determine such a vector potential typically involves a decision on how to fix it. This is referred to by the term gauging. Gauging is an important issue in computational electromagnetism, whenever discrete vector potentials have to be computed. In this paper a new gauging algorithm for discrete vector potentials is introduced that relies on a hierarchical multilevel decomposition. With minimum computational effort it yields vector potentials whose L 2-norm does not severely blow up. Thus the new approach compares favorably to the widely used co-tree gauging." .

The substitution of the carbonyl groups for thiocarbonyl in the hydantoin scaffold was taken into account when analyzing the effect of the hydrogen bonds on imidazolidine derivatives. B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculations and topological integrations derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) were applied with the purpose of examining the N–H⋯O hydrogen bond strengths formed between the amide group of the hydantoine ring and the oxygen atoms of PVP and PEG polymers. The effects caused by the N–H⋯O interaction fit the typical evidence for hydrogen bonds, which includes a variation in the stretch frequencies of the N–H bonds. These frequencies were identified as being vibrational red-shifts because their values decreased. Although the values of such calculated interaction energies are between 12 and 33 kJ mol−1, secondary intermolecular interactions were also identified. One of these secondary interactions is formed through the interaction of the benzyl hydrogen atoms with the oxygen atoms of the PVP and PEG structures. As such, we have analyzed the stretch frequencies on the C–H bonds of the benzyl groups, and blue-shifts were identified on these bonds. In this sense, the intermolecular systems formed by hydantoine derivatives and PVP/PEG monomers were characterized as a mix of red-shifting and blue-shifting hydrogen-bonded complexes." .

Further analysis of the results reveals that the change in the polarizability of a X-H bond upon deuteration decreases as the electronegativity of X increases. Our investigation also reveals that the molecular polarizability isotope effect presents an additive character.

MD analysis of this structure revealed that S633 is highly flexible and accessible to solvent molecules, while S1177 becomes highly flexible when S633 is phosphorylated. The presence of intramolecular interactions between S1177 among the major serine residues underscores its structural importance to the efficient synthesis of nitric oxide in endothelium. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of phosphomimetic (for phosphorylation) and phosphomutant (for dephosphorylation) eNOSs for use as experimental model systems, the structural dynamics and conformational changes in phosphomimetic (S615D, S633D, S1177D) and phosphomutant (S615A, S633A, S1177A) eNOSs were investigated. Phosphomimetic and phosphomutant eNOSs portrayed S633 as a modulator of S1177, whereas such correlations could not be observed in native and phosphorylated eNOSs. Computational analysis of the docked complex revealed that phosphorylated pS1177 and pS615 have high affinity for Akt (one of the key kinases in the eNOS activation pathway), with a significant number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges observed between these residues and Akt . This work therefore provides evidence of the subtle structural changes that occur within the reductase domain which contribute to the stability–flexibility–activity relationship of eNOS. Such subtle changes are of great importance in the context of regulated nitric oxide release by different phosphorylated forms of eNOS and the need to account for the existence of subtle differences between real proteins and experimental model systems." .

In particular, we investigated the interactions of acetylene, ethylene, and styrene with those surfaces. Although we had studied these systems previously, we included van der Waals interactions in all of the cases examined in the present work. These forces, which are noncovalent interactions, can heavily influence different processes in molecular chemistry, such as the adsorption of organic molecules on semiconductor surfaces. This unified approach allowed us to perform a comparative study of the relative reactivities of the various organic molecule/surface systems. The results showed that the degree of covalency of the surface, the lattice size, and the partial charge distribution (caused by differences in electronegativity) are all key elements that determine the reactivity between the molecules and the surfaces tested in this work. The covalent nature of graphane gives rise to energetically favorable intermediate states, while the opposite polarities of the charge distributions of silicane and germanane with the organic molecules favor subsequent steps of the radical-initiated reaction. Finally, the lattice size is a factor that has important consequences due to steric effects present in the systems and the possibility of chain reaction continuation. The results obtained in this work show that careful selection of the substrate is very important. Calculated energy barriers, heats of adsorption, and optimized atomic structures show that the silicane system offers the best reactivity in organic functionalization." .

Here, we studied the interaction of BA with human serum albumin (HSA) by using molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation methods. Molecular docking studies revealed that BA can bind in the large hydrophobic cavity of drug binding site I of sub-domain IIA and IIB, mainly by the hydrophobic interactions and also by hydrogen bond interactions. In which several cyclohexyl groups of BA are interacting with Phe(206), Arg(209), Ala(210), Ala(213), Leu(327), Gly(328), Leu(331), Ala(350), and Lys(351), residues of sub-domain IIA and IIB of HSA by hydrophobic interactions. Also, hydrogen bond interactions were observed between the hydroxyl (OH) group of BA with Phe(206) and Glu(354) of HSA, with hydrogen bond distances of 0.24 nm,0.28 nm respectively. Further, specifically, the molecular dynamics study makes an important contribution in understanding the effect of the binding of BA on conformational changes of HSA and the stability of the protein-drug complex system in aqueous solution. The root mean square deviation values of atoms in the free HSA molecule were calculated from 3000 ps to 5000 ps trajectory and the results were obtained as 0.72 ± 0.036 nm and 0.81 ± 0.032 nm for free HSA and HSA-BA, respectively. The radius of gyration (Rg) values of both unliganded HSA and HSA-BA were stabilized at 2.59 ± 0.03 nm, 2.51 ± 0.01 nm, respectively. Thus, this work may play an important role in the design of new BA inspired drugs with desired HSA binding affinity." .

In the present study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the interaction between GNA and its carbohydrate ligand over a specific time span. By analysis of the secondary structures, it was observed that the GNA conformation maintains rather stable along the trajectories and the high fluctuations were only centered on the carbohydrate recognition domains. Our MD simulations also reproduced most of the hydrogen bonds observed in the x-ray crystal structure. Furthermore, the obtained MD trajectories were used to estimate the binding free energy of the complex using the molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. It was revealed by the inspection of the binding free energy components that the major contributions to the complex stability arose from electrostatic interactions." .

It is shown that methanol is adsorbed much more easily to the cationic Ptn + than to the neutral and anionic Ptn 0/−. By contrast, the intrinsic bond cleavage barriers of both C–H and O–H on the cationic Ptn + are significantly higher than on Ptn 0/− (the only exception is the C–H bond cleavage on Pt+). Promisingly, injecting an electron to the neutral Ptn 0 to give Ptn − can greatly reduce the C–H/O–H bond scission barrier while maintaining appreciable adsorption energy. The charging effect can be nicely interpreted by the nature of the frontier orbitals of Ptn q." .

Complexes of biotin with four SAV protein variants (WT-SAV, 4fW-SAV, 5fW-SAV and 6fW-SAV) were studied. We found that protein stability and folding are predicted to be weakly affected by fluorination. The host protein binding pocket decreases its ability to form numerous hydrogen bonds to biotin in the case of the 4fW-SAV variant. Conversely, the 5fW-SAV mutant is predicted to have an even more stable ligand–host hydrogen bonding network than WT-SAV. Thermodynamic perturbation investigations predict a decrease in biotin binding free energy from 3.0 to 6.5 kcal/mol per tetrameric host, with the 5fW-SAV mutant being least affected.

A set of (12,0)–(8,0) CNT heterojunctions with an increasing number (n = 1–4) of pentagon/heptagon defects were studied systematically in different arrangements, and the results were compared with a set of small defective graphene fragments. In addition, tubular structures with two pairs of defects distributed variedly (along and around the CNT) with increasing distances were considered. Within the defective structures, those containing the well-known Stone–Wales defect proved to be the most stable. However, when more than two pairs of defects coexisted, situations where the defects appeared together seemed to be preferred, in sharp contrast to the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) for fullerenes, although this agrees with some previous works on this topic. The junctions studied here constitute different arrangements that help us to identify which effects (geometry and energy) arise from the particular positions and orientations of the defects in nanotubes. Moreover, a close correlation was found between the energy stability and the geometric deformation, measured with the average pyramidalization angle (POAV) and the average trigonal deformation (D 120).

It stretches from rare gas dimers up to strong hydrogen bonds. Our results indicate that the subsystem-based methods provide an interesting alternative to that based on the Kohn-Sham equations. Local density approximation, which is the simplest approximation for the relevant density functionals and which does not rely on any empirical data, leads to a computational approach comparing favorably with more than twenty methods based on the Kohn-Sham equations including the ones, which use extensively empirical parameterizations.

However, more recent studies evidenced also the ability for this protein to act as a nitric oxide reductase, suggesting an alternative physiological role. To clarify the apparent bifunctional nature of this protein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the protein, in different redox states, together with O2 and NO molecules in aqueous solution. The two small molecules were parameterized using free-energy calculations of the hydration process. With these simulations we were able to identify specific protein paths that allow the diffusion of both these molecules through the protein towards the catalytic centers. Also, we have tried to characterize the preference of ROO towards the presence of O2 and/or NO at the active site. By using free-energy simulations, we did not find any significant preference for ROO to accommodate both O2 and NO.

A considerably lower energy pathway for the decomposition of CX3OH is accessible by homogenous reactions between CX3OH and water.

Such deformation is significant due to minor groove binding and, besides electrostatic interactions, other non-covalent interactions may also play an important role in generating such deformation. TATA-box binding protein (TBP) binds to the minor groove of DNA at the TATA box sequence, producing a large-scale deformation in DNA and initiating transcription. In order to observe the interactions of protein residues with DNA in the minor groove that produce the deformation in the DNA structure, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the TBP–DNA system. The results reveal consistent partial intercalation of two Phe residues, distorting stacking interactions at two dinucleotide step sites. We carried out calculations based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory to understand the source of such stabilization. We observed favorable interaction energies between the Phe residues and the base pairs with which they interact. We suggest that salt-bridge interactions between the phosphate groups and Lys or Arg residues, along with the intercalation of Phe residues between two base pair stacks, stabilize the kinked and opened-up DNA conformation." .

Propionamide and acetamide are docked to the amidase. The reaction models were used to characterize the explicit enzymatic reaction. The calculated free energy barrier at B3LYP/6-31G* level of Model A (Ser194 + propionamide) is 19.72 kcal mol−1 in gas (6.47 kcal mol−1 in solution), and of Model B (Ser194 + Gly193 + propionamide) is 18.71 kcal mol−1 in gas (4.57 kcal mol−1 in solution). The docking results reveal that propionamide binds more strongly than acetamide due to the ethyl moiety of propionamide, which makes the carboxyl oxygen center of the substrate slightly more negative, making formation of the positively charged tetrahedral intermediate slightly easier. The quantum mechanics results demonstrate that Ser194 is essential for the acyl-intermediate, and Gly193 plays a secondary role in stabilizing acyl-intermediate formation as the NH groups of Ser194 and Gly193 form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of propionamide. The new structural and mechanistic insights gained from this computational study should be useful in elucidating the detailed structures and mechanisms of amidase and other homologous members of the amidase signature family." .

In gradual heating simulations, we found that, rather than C–N bond cleavage, intermolecular proton transfer is more likely to be the first reaction in the decomposition process. At high temperature, the first reaction in fast annealing simulation is intermolecular proton transfer leading to CH3NOOH and CH2NO2, whereas the initial chemical event at low temperature tends to be a unimolecular C–N bond cleavage, producing CH3 and NO2 fragments. It is the first time to date that the direct rupture of a C–N bond has been reported as the first reaction in solid phase nitromethane. In addition, the fast annealing simulations on a supercell at different temperatures are conducted to validate the effect of simulation cell size on initial reaction mechanisms.

The linear complex is found to be more stable, in agreement with the small amount of available experimental data. Its stabilization is due to the combined action of two effects-promotion of electrons in the σ-core of the complex in the direction of the Fe atom, and promotion in the π-cloud in the opposite direction. In the perpendicular complex, the last effect is almost absent because of t the antibonding nature of the π-bonds, and this explains its lower stability." .

The broadly used Hartree–Fock (HF) and Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) methods have also been studied for comparison. A statistical analysis comparing with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experimental values shows that overall BEs estimations only deviate a small percentage from the experimental values, yet the absolute deviations are generally too large, with the different methods over/underestimating the reported values. However, taking the contribution of relativistic effects of BEs into account leads to larger differences. Overall, the performance of the explored Minnesota functionals is not satisfactory, with errors of up to 1 eV, except for the M06-L meta-GGA functional. In this case, the mean absolute deviation is below 0.1 eV and thus within XPS chemical resolution. Hence, M06-L poses itself as a rather accurate and computational expense-wise method for estimating BEs of organic molecules.

A three-step procedure was performed to design a specific ligand for HSA. Based on the candidate pocket structure of HSA (warfarin binding site), a peptide library was built. These peptides were then docked into the pocket of HSA using the GOLD program. The GOLDscore values were used to determine the affinity of peptides for HSA. Consequently, the dipeptide Trp–Trp, which shows a high GOLDscore value, was selected and linked to a spacer arm of Lys[CO(CH2)5NH] on the surface of ECH-lysine sepharose 4 gel. For further evaluation, the Autodock Vina program was used to dock the linked compound into the pocket of HSA. The docking simulation was performed to obtain a first guess of the binding structure of the spacer–Trp–Trp–HSA complex and subsequently analyzed by MD simulations to assess the reliability of the docking results. These MD simulations indicated that the ligand–HSA complex remains stable, and water molecules can bridge between the ligand and the protein by hydrogen bonds. Finally, absorption spectroscopic studies were performed to illustrate the appropriateness of the binding affinity of the designed ligand toward HSA.

A better understanding of the epitaxial growth process of SiC by CVD is crucial to improve CVD tools and optimize growth conditions. Through computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, the process may be studied in great detail, giving insight to both flow characteristics, temperature gradients and distributions, and gas mixture composition and species concentrations throughout the whole CVD reactor. In this paper, some of the important parts where improvements are very much needed for accurate CFD simulations of the SiC CVD process to be accomplished are pointed out. First, the thermochemical properties of 30 species that are thought to be part of the gas-phase chemistry in the SiC CVD process are calculated by means of quantum-chemical computations based on ab initio theory and density functional theory. It is shown that completely different results are obtained in the CFD simulations, depending on which data are used for some molecules, and that this may lead to erroneous conclusions of the importance of certain species. Second, three different models for the gas-phase chemistry are compared, using three different hydrocarbon precursors. It is shown that the predicted gas-phase composition varies largely, depending on which model is used. Third, the surface reactions leading to the actual deposition are discussed. We suggest that hydrocarbon molecules in fact have a much higher surface reactivity with the SiC surface than previously accepted values." .

A reactive potential that can simulate chemical reactions (ReaxFF) has been used for RDX, whereas an EAM potential has been used for Cu. Increased temperature at the void locations are observed under shock loading. The atomic motion, temperature, average potential energy per atom (PE), and average kinetic energy per atom (KE) in and around the voids are closely monitored in order to understand the reason for temperature increase.

The dipyrryl ketone is a model for the dipyrrole core of 10-oxobilirubin, a presumed metabolite in alternate pathways of excretion of the yellow pigment of jaundice, bilirubin. In the crystal, 1 adopts a helical conformation, with a molecule of one helicity being hydrogen-bonded to two molecules of the opposite helicity. Thus, 1 self-assembles via hydrogen bonding into supramolecular double-stranded arrays, where molecules of the same helicity comprise one strand and are paired through hydrogen bonding to molecules of opposite helicity in the second strand. In the observed molecular conformation each pyrrole ring and adjacent carbonyl group are rotated into an sc conformation (torsion angle ∼29 °), with each N-H pointing in the same direction as the C*O. Molecular mechanics/dynamics calculations predict the sc,sc conformation, absent hydrogen bonding, to be the most stable, but only by a few tenths of a kj/mol. In CHCl3, 1 is monomeric according to vapor pressure osmometry studies (). 1H NMR NH chemical shifts in CDCl3 suggest a predominantly anti orientation of the C=O and pyrrole NHs, which is opposite to the orientation observed in the crystal." .

Several interesting correlations within the observed properties and also with the reported experimental behaviors of these complexes including their biological activities are presented. The study shows that the stability of the two complexes with bidentate ligands is associated with their high hydrogen bonding stability and existence of stronger non-covalent metal-ligand bonds. The energy decomposition analysis indicated that inter-atomic interactions in the three forms of rapta-C complexes and their stability are governed by the charge transfer term with significant contributions from polarization and electrostatic terms. The higher stability of complex 1 and 2 over 3 comes from the lower exchange repulsion and higher polarization contributions to their stability which agrees perfectly with the experimental observation. Our results provide insight into the nature of intramolecular forces that influence the structural stability of the three complexes." .

Selection of moderately sized QM domains partitioned between $$C_\\alpha $$ and C (from C=O), with incorporation of delocalization of electrons over neighboring domains, results in a marked improvement of the calculated molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). More importantly, we show that the evaluation of the electrostatic potential can be carried out on a dynamic framework by evaluating the free energy difference between a non-polarized MEP and a polarized MEP.

Many of the methods examined here were found to provide unsatisfactory descriptions of the hydrogen-bonding interactions within polypeptide-type structures, as the α-helical canonical secondary structure motif was not reproduced accurately.

Our method is based on the signature molecular descriptor, which has been used previously to predict protein–protein interactions successfully, and to develop quantitative structure–activity relationships for small organic drugs and peptide inhibitors. Here, we show how the signature descriptor can be used in a Support Vector Machine to predict whether or not two β-strands will pack adjacently within a protein. We then show how these predictions can be used to order β-strands within β-sheets. Using the entire PDB database with ten-fold cross-validation, we have achieved 74.0% accuracy in packing prediction and 75.6% accuracy in the prediction of edge strands. For the case of β-strand ordering, we are able to predict the correct ordering accurately for 51.3% of the β-sheets.

Many molecular dynamics (MD) simulation have been performed on the SDS molecule at coarse-grained (CG), united-atom (UA), and all-atom (AA) resolutions. However, these simulations are usually based on general parameters determined from large sets of molecules, and as a result, peculiar molecular specificities are often poorly represented. In addition, the parameters (ideal bond lengths, angles, dihedrals and charge distribution) differ according to the resolution, highlighting a lack of coherence. We therefore propose a new set of parameters for CG, UA, and AA resolutions based on a high quantum mechanics (QM) level optimization of the detergent structure and the charge distribution. For the first time, QM-optimized parameters were directly applied to build the AA, UA, and CG model of the SDS molecule, leading to a more coherent description. As a test case, MD simulations were then performed on SDS preformed micelles as previous experimental and theoretical investigations allow direct comparison with our new sets of parameters. While all three models yield similar macromolecular properties (size, shape, and accessible surface) perfectly matching previous results, the attribution of more coherent parameters to SDS enables the description of the specific interactions inside and outside the micelle. These more consistent parameters can now be used to accurately describe new multi-scale systems involving the SDS molecule." .

The present study is based on a previously derived concept for orbital control of electron transport through aromatic hydrocarbons. The orbital control concept provided crucial basic understanding for the best conductance channels in the aromatic hydrocarbons and was successfully applied in the design of molecular devices. That concept was proven to hold true for small aromatic molecules, large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with different edge structures, and in weak and strong coupling with the electrodes junctions. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nanographenes used in the molecular electronics are often immobilized with different types of defects, which require the application of the orbital control concept on heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In this work, the effect of the heteroatoms in aromatic hydrocarbons on their electron-transport properties and the applicability of the orbital control concept on heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are studied. Effective routes for electron transport are predicted in weak coupling junctions by analyzing the phase and amplitude of the frontier orbitals. The qualitative predictions are made with the nonequilibrium Green’s function method combined with the Hückel approximation. Quantitative, first principle calculations are performed with the nonequilibrium Green’s function method combined with density functional theory. The obtained results are in good agreement with the expectations on the basis of the orbital control concept, which proves its applicability in heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons." .

Three low energy conformers of fluvastatin have been calculated. The vibrational spectroscopic properties calculated for the most stable conformer were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. A series of hydrogen bonded complexes of the most stable conformer of fluvastatin anion with low molecular weight models of the polymers have been fully optimized. In almost all, intermolecular H-bonds are formed between the sulfate groups of ι- or λ-carrageenan and fluvastatin’s hydroxyls, resulting in a red shift of the fluvastatin’s O − H stretching vibrations. Cooperative intramolecular H-bonds within fluvastatin or ι-, λ-carrageenan are also present. The BSSE and ZPE corrected interaction energies were estimated in the range 281–318 kJ mol−1 for ι-carrageenan - fluvastatin and 145–200 kJ mol−1 for λ-carrageenan - fluvastatin complexes. The electron density (ρ bcp) and Laplacian (∇2 ρ bcp) properties at critical points of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated by AIM (atoms in molecules) calculations, have a low and positive character (∇2 ρ bcp > 0), consistent with the electrostatic character of the hydrogen bonds. The structural and energetic data observed, as well as the extent of the red shift of the fluvastatin’s O − H stretching vibrations upon complex formation and the properties of electron density show a stronger binding of fluvastatin to ι- than to λ-carrageenan." .

The products were isolated at high yield and identified on the basis of IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR, UV spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Diester (BEPIQ) can be presented by 16 possible pair of enantiomers. Only one pair of them is the most stable and crystallizes which is shown crystallographic research. Based on quantum-mechanical modeling, with the use of DFT method, which conformers of mono- and diester and why they were formed was explained. It was calculated that 99.93% of the monoester (MEPIQ) is formed at position No. 2 and one pair of the monoester conformers, from six possible, has the largest share (51.63%). These results afforded to limit the number of diester conformers to eight. Unfortunately, the quantum-mechanical calculations performed that their shares are similar. Further quantum-mechanical modeling showed that conformers are able to undergo mutual transformations. As a result only one pair of diester conformers forms crystals. These conformers have substituents in trans position and these substituents are located parallel to imidazoquinazoline ring. This allows for the denser packing of the molecules in the unit cell." .

Strong covalent bonds result in molecular building blocks that can be arranged in layered two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) periodic networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on experimental and theoretical studies of thermoelectrical properties of COFs to date. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann transport equation have been applied in this work to calculate the semiclassical transport coefficients for phthalocyanine (Pc)-based NiPc, NiPc-benzothiadiazole (BTDA), and Pc COFs. Owing to the well-ordered stacking of the phthalocyanine units and linkers in these compounds, charge-carrier transport is facilitated in the stacking direction. In all studied compounds, the highly directional character of π-orbitals provides band-structure engineering and produces a type of low-dimensional hole transport along the stacking direction. All studied compounds are indirect semiconductors. The low-dimensional transport of holes and the localized states in both valence and conduction bands prevent the electron–hole compensation effect in the Seebeck coefficients, correlating with the large Seebeck coefficients of the studied compounds. Insertion of the electron-deficient building block benzothiadiazole in the NiPc-BTDA COF leads to positive Seebeck coefficients along the a-, b-, and c-directions. The relaxation time was estimated in our investigations from DFT band-structure calculations and the experimentally defined mobility, leading to determination of the electrical conductivity and electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity, as well as figure of merit (ZT) estimation. Ni atom provided greater electrical conductivity along the c-direction in comparison with metal-free Pc COF, and NiPc COF showed the highest thermoelectric performance among the studied COFs." .

The effect of changing the N-doping site in defects on the TC of AGNRs was also investigated in detail. The variations with N concentration of the TCs of AGNRs presenting graphitic N (quarternary N), pyridinic N, and pyrrolic N doping configurations were studied. Results of MD simulations showed that, among these three doping configurations, pyridinic N was associated with the highest TC, and pyrrolic N with the lowest TC. The highest TC values were obtained when the N dopant atoms were located at the edges and at defects in the AGNR. The presence of both pyrrolic N and Stone–Wales type 1 (SW-1) defects led to a higher TC than the presence of both pyrrolic N and SW-2 defects. Phonon–defect scattering was found to be influenced by changes in C–C bond orientation. SW-1 defects were found to exert a greater influence on the TC than graphitic N doping. Furthermore, the influence on the TC of the N-doping site location in SW-1 defects was examined. Doping the central sites of SW-1 defects was found to yield higher TC values than doping the edge sites of defects. Graphitic-N doping of the more central sites in a SW-1 defect led to a higher TC than the random graphitic-N doping of sites in a SW-1 defect." .

The ability of the zinc ion to enhance the structural stability of many proteins by electrostatic interactions or by co-ordination with surrounding amino acids makes it the most important metal ion found in biological systems. In this paper, we highlight the importance of non-covalent interaction established between a metal ion and its environment in stabilizing biomolecules. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the stabilization role of the zinc ion in a native and point-mutated zinc-activated site. We have adapted a new quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) strategy to describe a large molecular system; it is referred to as the local self-consistent field/MM method. It involves the use of frozen doubly occupied strictly localized bonding orbitals to link the QM subsystem to the one treated at the MM level. The B3LYP method, combined with LanL2DZ and 6-311G basis sets, was used to describe the QM region that comprised the zinc ion and the lateral chains of the four co-ordinating amino acids. For the surroundings (the backbone), CHARMM27 force field was used to describe MM interactions. The influence of the basis set size on the quality of the structural parameters of the zinc-binding site and the effects of mutation on the structural stabilization energy are analysed and reported." .

Sequential Monte Carlo/quantum mechanical calculations are performed to study the solvent effects on the electronic absorption spectrum of formamide (FMA) in aqueous solution, varying from hydrogen bonds to the outer solvation shells.

The largest calculation involves the ensemble average of 75 statistically uncorrelated quantum mechanical results obtained with the FMA solute surrounded by 150 water solvent molecules. We find that the n → π* transition suffers a blueshift of 1,600 cm−1 upon solvation and the π → π* transition undergoes a redshift of 800 cm−1. On average, 1.5 hydrogen bonds are formed between FMA and water and these contribute with about 20% and about 30% of the total solvation shifts of the n → π* and π → π* transitions, respectively.

Van der Waals forces are included in all calculations through empirical corrections. Energetics studies are first done to determine the structural stability. Then charge density, Löwdin population analysis and electronic states are evaluated. Results show that the CrO3 molecule, with an acceptor electron character, is chemisorbed on the phosphorene surface inducing minimal geometrical distortions, however, after adsorption, a partial charge gradient is produced between the P atoms located at the phosphorene upper and lower planes. Furthermore, variations on the CrO3 concentration causes different interaction strengths. At high concentrations of adsorbed CrO3 molecules, the interaction with the surface becomes stronger due to an increased steric effect between neighboring molecules. Nevertheless, this effect along with the geometrical distortions produced on the phosphorene structure, due to the large number of molecules adsorbed, leads to a decrement on the adsorption energy. It is expected that the reported results may render phosphorene as a promising material for application as a gas sensor." .

Several different effects are evident in this interaction as a consequence of the particular electronic transfer which occurs during the procedure. The addition or insertion of the methylene group results in a process, where the inclusion of CH2 into a fullerene bond produces the formation of several geometric deformations. A simulation of these procedures was carried out, taking advantage of the dynamic semi-classical Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Dynamic aspects were analyzed at different speeds, for the interaction between the CH2 group and the two bonds: CC (6, 6) and CC (6, 5) respectively on the fullerene (C60) rings. All calculations which involved electrons employed DFT as well as exchange and functional correlation. The results indicate a tendency for the CH2 fragment to attack the CC (6, 5) bond." .

We arguethat quantum computing provides clear concepts and simple models for discussing quantum theoretical problems. In this article we describe examples from completely different fields where models of quantum computing and quantum communication shed light on quantum theory. First we address quantum limits of classical low power computation and argue that the terms of quantum information theory allows us to discuss device-independent bounds. We argue that a classical bit behaves to some extent like a quantum bit in the time period where it switches its logical value. This implies that a readout during the switching process generates entropy. A related problem is the distribution of timing information like clock signals in low power devices. For low signal energy, the situation is close to phase-covariant cloning problems in quantum information theory. Second we rephrase a classical statistical method to draw causal conclusions from data of a clinical drug-testing experiment. Since this method, as it is described in the literature, relies on a hidden-variable model of patient’s behaviour it leads to misconclusions if quantum theory infact does play a role in the human mind. The toy model we use to illustrate this is formally a quantum communication protocol in the presence of entanglement. We argue that quantum information theory could put classical statistical reasoning on a safer basis because it does not need hidden-variable models of nature." .

The DFT studies were carried out on the isolated molecules, and in the MD simulations clusters were treated with up to 64 monomers. The effect of polar substituents, such as chlorine and the nitro group, on the central 1,3-phenylene unit of banana-shaped compounds was investigated. In particular, flexibility, polarity, electrostatic potential (ESP) group charge distributions, B-factors, bending angles and molecular lengths were considered. The MD results were analysed by trajectories of significant torsion angles as well as order parameters such as radial atom pair distribution functions g(r), orientational correlation functions g(o), diffusion coefficients (D) and root mean square deviations (RMSD) values. The g(r) and g(o) values show that a certain long range order is generated by the introduction of a NO2 group in the 2-position of the central 1,3-phenylene ring. In contrast, the chlorination at the 4 and 6 positions of the central 1,3-phenylene unit decreases the long range order tendency by its perturbation effect on the conformations in such molecules. Moreover, g(r) and g(o) values, as well as diffusion coefficients, show that in the NO2 substituted compound the formation of microphase areas is preferred. Finally, the aggregation effect in such compounds was studied in a systematic way by a comparison of the conformational properties of the isolated molecules and the monomers in the clusters.

Experimental and theoretical studies of electron densities and the corresponding derived entities such as electrostatic potentials have been the primary means of understanding the chemical nature and electronic properties of crystalline substances. Conventional crystal calculation methods such as the embedded cluster models are capable of performing calculations on small and medium-sized molecules, while periodic ab initio methods can treat crystals with up to 200 atoms per unit cell. A linear scaling method, viz. the molecular tailoring approach, has recently been developed for obtaining ab initio quality one-electron properties. In the present study, the molecular tailoring approach is employed to generate electron density, electrostatic potential and interaction density maps with the ibuprofen crystal as a test case. The interaction density and electrostatic potential maps produced in the present work succinctly bring out the actual crystalline environment around a given reference molecule by including the interactions with atoms in its neighborhood. The results obtained from the molecular tailoring approach may thus be expected to enhance our understanding of the environment in the crystalline material with reasonably small computational effort." .

After the DMRG method was originally developed for 1-D lattice/chain models, some specific extensions toward 2-D lattice (n-leg ladder) models have been proposed. However, high accuracy as obtained in 1-D models is not always guaranteed in their extended versions because the original exquisite advantage of the algorithm is partly lost. Thus, we choose an alternative way. It is a direct 2-D extension of DMRG method which instead demands an enormously large memory space, but the memory explosion is resolved by parallelizing the DMRG code with performance tuning. The parallelized direct extended DMRG shows a good accuracy like 1-D models and an excellent parallel efficiency as the number of states kept increases. This success promises accurate analysis on large 2-D (n-leg ladder) quantum lattice models in the near future when peta-flops parallel supercomputers are available." .

This result is experimentally verified by approximately five thousand NHC transition metal complexes retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). CSD search discloses that NHCs can participate in π-stacking interactions, albeit scarce. Geometry-based HOMA and electronic aromaticity index FLU rather than NICS provide a satisfactory description of the bonding situations in NHC ligands. Singlet state of the normal NHC has electron-deficient aromaticity as compared to those of the abnormal and remote NHCs. Depending on the transition from the singlet to triplet state, NHCs become electron-deficient ligands except for remote NHC. Computational studies regarding electronic nature of free NHC ligands show that the π-electronic population of the formally vacant pπ orbital on the carbene atoms in abnormal and remote NHC is occurred as a result of the aromaticity of NHCs, not as a result of the direct electron donation from LP-orbitals of N atoms to carbene atom according to putative push-pull effect used in understanding the electronic stabilization of normal NHC. Increase in the aromaticity raises σ-donating ability of both imidazol- and pyrazol-based NHC ligands. Free abnormal and remote NHC ligands have higher σ-donation ability than normal NHC ligands. The lack of σ-donating ability of normal NHC is compensated by its relatively high π-accepting ability, whereas π-back donation abilities of abnormal and remote NHCs are prohibited by their almost fully occupied π-orbitals. Aromaticities of the triplet NHC ligands are higher than that of the lowest-lying triplet state of benzene. Increase in the aromaticity of NHC ligands decreases van der Waals shortening in TM-NHC bonds mainly due to diminishing dative character of these bonds.

We find that (1) the convex sides of the interior carbons of the nonplanar models are more reactive than the concave sides, and (2) the magnitudes of the lowest $$ \\overline{\\mathrm{I}}\\left( \\mathbf{r} \\right) $$ surface minima (the $$ {{\\overline{\\mathrm{I}}}_{{\\mathrm{S}\\text{,}\\min }}} $$) correlate well with the interaction energies for hydrogenation at these sites. These $$ {{\\overline{\\mathrm{I}}}_{{\\mathrm{S}\\text{,}\\min }}} $$ values decrease in magnitude as the nonplanarity of the site increases, consistent with earlier studies. A practical benefit of the use of $$ \\overline{\\mathrm{I}}\\left( \\mathbf{r} \\right) $$ is that a single calculation suffices to characterize the numerous sites on a large molecular system, such as graphene and defect-containing graphene models.

Conformational changes are computed by incremental energy minimisation. We use an efficient finite element method for finding equilibria of complexes composed of inter-linked chains; this method is based on recent advances in the description of one-dimensional elasticity. Protein backbone elasticity, van der Waals repulsions, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are taken into account, together with user-defined geometric distance constraints that may be imposed for purposes of simulating various binding processes based on chemical knowledge. These computational methods have been integrated into a system, Proteinmorphosis, which includes interactive visualisation. The conformational change of calmodulin upon peptide binding is examined as a first experiment. Allostery in hemoglobin, which consists of a cooperative oxygen binding mechanism, is a second, more sophisticated, numerical experiment. Different modelling strategies are designed to understand the allostery. The results for both molecules are consistent with existing hypotheses, and reproduce the known atomic positions after binding to within the experimental error. The modelling system is part of an on-going program to model structural biology, from protein structure to cell and tissue properties." .

It is shown that even if the intermolecular dispersion energy is the largest component of the total interaction energy, some other contributions play a non negligible role. In particular the electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction and the charge transfer from the nucleobase to the PCB are responsible for the relative orientation of the monomers in the complexes. In addition, the charge transfer tends to flatten the PCB, which could therefore intercalate more easily between DNA base pairs.

This choice is in principle arbitrary, but technically convenient. Point charges can be understood as the first term of multipole expansions, which converge with an increasing number of terms towards the accurate representation of the molecular potential given by the electron density distribution. The use of multipole expansions can therefore improve the force field accuracy. Technically, the implementation of atomic multipoles is more involved than the use of point charges. Important points to consider are the orientation of the multipole moments during the trajectory, conformational dependence of the atomic moments and stability of the simulations which are discussed here." .

A theoretical concern is that carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum may increase bacteremia. Method: In 60 rats peritonitis was induced by cecostomy. Animals were randomly allocated to pneumoperitoneum (PP) and control groups. Blood cultures and intraabdominal swabs were assessed. A peritonitis severity score (PSS) was computed based on histology from peritoneal biopsy. Results: One hour after cecostomy neither in abdominal swabs nor in blood samples bacteria were reproduced in PP and control groups. Three hours after cecostomy the frequency of positive blood cultures was 80% and 20% in PP and control groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). Six hours after cecostomy the frequency of positive blood cultures was 100% in each group (p > 0.05). One hour after cecostomy the mean peritoneal severity score was significantly higher in the PP group than in the control group, but there was not any significant difference between groups 3 and 6 h after cecostomy. The mean peritoneal severity scores were found to be significantly increased with time when the PP groups compared with each other. Conclusion: In rats, pneumoperitoneum can't cause a more severe peritonitis but it does induce an increase in the rate of bacteremia within the early 6-h period of peritonitis." .

This transformation involves rearrangements of some hydrogen atoms and ring contraction/ring expansion process, yielding as a final product the isomer P3. The energies of activation for the P1→P3 intraconversion show that this reaction is competitive to the other, previously investigated isomerization of P1 into dicyclopenta[de,kl]anthracene (P2).

Local binding energies for molecules directly on the void surface decreased greatly compared to those in defect-free lattice, and then gradually increased until the distance away from the void surface was around 10 Å. Analysis of 1 ns MD simulations revealed that the larger the void size, the easier is void collapse. Mean square displacements (MSDs) showed that HMX molecules that had collapsed into void present liquid structure characteristics. Four unique low-energy conformers were found for HMX molecules in void: two whose conformational geometries corresponded closely to those found in HMX polymorphs and two, additional, lower energy conformers that were not seen in the crystalline phases.

They provide means to extract information about the repartition of the electronic density among molecules or solids. The values of atomic multipoles in a molecule can shed light on its electrostatic properties and may help to predict how different molecules could interact or to rationalize chemical reactivity for instance. Not being physical observables to which a quantum mechanical operator can be associated, atomic charges and higher order atomic multipoles cannot be defined unambiguously in a molecule, and therefore, several population schemes (PS) have been devised in the last decades. In the context of density functional theory (DFT), PS based on the electron density seem to be best grounded. In particular, some groups have proposed various iterative schemes the outcomes of which are very encouraging. Modern implementations of DFT that are for example based on density fitting techniques permit the investigation of molecular systems comprising of hundreds of atoms. However, population analyses following iterative schemes may become very CPU time consuming for such large systems. In this article, we investigate if the computationally less expensive analyses of the variationally fitted electronic densities can be safely carried out instead of the Kohn-Sham density. It is shown that as long as flexible auxiliary function sets including f and g functions are used, the multipoles extracted from the fitted densities are extremely close to those obtained from the KS density. We further assess if the multipoles obtained through the Hirshfeld’s approach, in its standard or iterative form, can be a useful approach to calculate interaction energies in non-covalent complexes. Relative energies computed with the AMOEBA polarizable forced field combined to iterative Hirshfeld multipoles are encouraging." .

The fundamentals of halogen bonding have been studied extensively with high-accuracy computational methods. Due to its non-covalency, the use of triple-zeta (or larger) basis sets is often recommended when studying halogen bonding. However, in the large systems often encountered in supramolecular chemistry and biosciences, large basis sets can make the calculations far too slow. Therefore, small basis sets, which would combine high computational speed and high accuracy, are in great demand. This study focuses on comparing how well density functional theory (DFT) methods employing small, double-zeta basis sets can estimate halogen-bond strengths. Several methods with triple-zeta basis sets are included for comparison. Altogether, 46 DFT methods were tested using two data sets of 18 and 33 halogen-bonded complexes for which the complexation energies have been previously calculated with the high-accuracy CCSD(T)/CBS method. The DGDZVP basis set performed far better than other double-zeta basis sets, and it even outperformed the triple-zeta basis sets. Due to its small size, it is well-suited to studying halogen bonding in large systems." .

The gradient was defined by the ratio of a constant (E a) and the z-directional length (L z) of the simulation box. E a varies from 0.0 to 0.9 V nm−1. As the gradient increases, the probabilities of finding two water molecules in an α-plane zone and three in a midplane region increase. To accommodate more water molecules, the axial array of channel water molecules becomes more compact. Meanwhile, the H-bonded network between the channel water is greatly intensified when E a increases from 0.3 to 0.9 V nm−1. Nevertheless, the proportion of strong H-bonds does not increase significantly following the formation of a more compact axial array of water molecules. When E a reaches 0.9 V nm−1, the water molecule in an α-plane zone may be dragged by its neighboring water molecules into the midplane region, resulting in a significant deviation from the channel axis. With the augment of the gradient, the dipoles of channel water are gradually oriented along the tube axis in the sequence from gap 1 to 7, namely along the direction of the electric field. Nevertheless, even when E a reaches 0.9 V nm−1, the dipole orientation of the channel water is not complete, and dipole flips still occur in gap 7. Under a GE field, the rightward and leftward hopping rates of channel water are no longer equal to each other, i.e., channel water performs an asymmetric transportation.

Here, the structural and electronic properties of the Schiff base formed by tacrine and saccharin (TacSac) were explored using density functional theory with the B3LYP, M06-2X, M06L, and ωB97XD functionals in combination with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. The time-dependent formalism was used at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level to obtain electronic transitions. The calculations were repeated in an implicit solvent model mimicking water, using the polarizable continuum model in conjunction with a solvation model based on a density approach.

The properties used were derived from semiempirical molecular orbital calculations and can be related to the physics of intermolecular interactions. In each case, the superimposition of the compounds was within 0.6 Å of the experimental overlay. The superimposition cases presented differing levels of involvement of electrostatic interactions, and in only one case did shape similarity provide the best overlay. Two test compounds were applied to an example exploring non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and only one of these compounds overlaid in the same manner as their crystal structure complexes. This served to highlight the need for molecules to occupy the same region of space when employing this technique. Nevertheless, the method can be used to generate pharmacophores and ultimately could be used to interrogate databases for molecules that match the key surface properties, thus allowing scaffold hopping.

Despite the wealth of structural information about proteinase K provided by static X-ray structures, a full understanding of the enzymatic mechanism requires further insight into the dynamic properties of this enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations and essential dynamics (ED) analysis were performed to investigate the molecular motions in proteinase K. The results indicate that the internal core of proteinase K is relatively rigid, whereas the surface-exposed loops, most notably the substrate-binding regions, exhibit considerable conformational fluctuations. Further ED analysis reveals that the large concerted motions in the substrate-binding regions cause opening/closing of the substrate-binding pockets, thus supporting the proposed induced-fit mechanism of substrate binding. The distinct electrostatic/hydrogen-bonding interactions between Asp39 and His69 and between His69 and Ser224 within the catalytic triad lead to different thermal motions and orientations of these three catalytic residues, which can be related to their different functional roles in the catalytic process. Statistical analyses of the geometrical/functional properties as well as evolutionary conservation of the glycines in proteinase K-like proteins reveal that glycines may play an important role in determining the folding architecture and structural flexibility of this class of enzymes.

The results show that 9-ODA is less likely to react with water due to the high barrier heights (~36.5 kcal · mol−1) and very low reaction rates. However, it can easily react with triplet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals because of low or negative energy barriers. Thus, the atmospheric free radicals may disturb the chemical communication between the queen and their daughters in a colony.

Both levels of theory showed that the axial conformation stability, compared to its corresponding equatorial conformation, decreases from compounds 1 → 3 and 4 → 6. Based on the results obtained from the NBO analysis, there are significant anomeric effects for compounds 1-6. The anomeric effect associated with the electron delocalization is in favor of the axial conformation and increases from compounds 1 → 3 and 4 → 6. On the other hand, dipole moment differences between the axial and equatorial conformations [Δ(μ eq - μ ax)] decrease from compounds 1 → 3. Although Δ(μ eq-μ ax) parameter decreases from compound 1 to compound 3, the dipole moment values of the axial conformations are smaller than those of their corresponding equatorial conformations. Therefore, the anomeric effect associated with the electron delocalizations (for halogen-C-Se segments) and the electrostatic model associated with the dipole-dipole interactions fail to account for the increase of the equatorial conformations stability on going from compound 1 to compound 3. Since there is no dipole moment for the axial and equatorial conformations of compounds 4-6, consequently, the conformational preferences in compounds 1-6 is in general dictated by the steric hindrance factor associated with the 1,3-syn-axial repulsions. Importantly, the CBS-4 results show that the entropy difference (∆S) between the equatorial axial conformations increases from compounds 1 → 3 and 4 → 6. This fact can be explained by the anomeric effect associated with the electron delocalization which affects the C2-Se bond orders and increase the rigidity of the corresponding rings. The Gibbs free energy difference values between the axial and equatorial conformations (i.e. ΔG ax-ax and ΔG eq-eq) of compounds 1 and 4, 2 and 5 and also 3 and 6 have been calculated.

The DFT calculations suggest that the simplified (Co+Cbl) as well as the complete (Co+Cbi) complexes can adapt to the square pyramidal or octahedral coordination geometry owing to the unconventional H-bonding between the Co+ ion and its axial ligands. These Co+–H bonds contain appreciable amounts of electrostatic, charge transfer, long-range correlation, and dispersion components. The computed reduction potentials of the Co2+/Co+ couple imply that the Co+–H(H2O) interaction causes a greater anodic shift [5–98 mV vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) in chloroform solvent] than the analogous Co+–H(imidazole) interaction (1 mV vs. NHE) in the reduction potential of the Co2+/Co+ couple. This may explain why a β-axial H2O ligand has specifically been found in the active sites of certain methyltransferases. The QM/MM analysis of methionine synthase bound Co+Cbx (Protein Data Bank ID 1BMT, resolution 3.0 Å) indicates that the enzyme-bound Co+Cbx can also form a Co+–H bond, but can only exist in square pyramidal form because of the steric constraints imposed by the cellular environment. The present calculations thus support a recently proposed alternate mechanism for the enzyme-bound Co2+/Co+ reduction that involves the conversion of square pyramidal Co2+Cbx into square pyramidal Co+Cbx (Kumar and Kozlowski in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50:8702–8705, 2011)." .

All the CHPs take the “horse-saddle” conformations at the interface and the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the side chains influences the backbones’ structural deformations. The orientations and distributions of the CHPs at the interface and the differences of interaction energies (ΔΔE) between the CHPs and the two liquid phases have been determined. RDF analysis shows that the H-bonds were formed between the OC atoms of the CHPs’ backbones and Hw atoms of water molecules. N atoms of the CHPs’ backbones formed the H-bonds or van der Waals interactions with the water solvent. It was found that there is a parallel relationship between ΔΔE and the lateral diffusion coefficients (D xy ) of the CHPs at the interface. The movements of water molecules close to the interface are confined to some extent, indicating that the dynamics of the CHPs and interfacial water molecules are strongly coupled.

It means that the observations in different reference frames are coherent and thus the observed motions can be regarded as objectively equivalent. On the other hand, concerning the material constitution, the principle of material objectivity (also often referred as principle of material frame-indifference, or simply the principle of objectivity) requires that constitutive equations of a material body must be independent of the observer (reference frame). Both objectivity and principle of objectivity have been widely used in modern continuum mechanics studies. However, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which is a prevalent numerical method in nanoscience, consideration is rarely given to the concept of objectivity or principle of objectivity since most of the MD simulations have been performed in inertial systems, where Galilean-invariance is assumed. This research aims to investigate the conditions for Euclidean objectivity in non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD), where reference frames are non-inertial and multi-physics effects are present in the atomistic material system. By supplementing fictitious acceleration to the governing equation and requiring the principle of objectivity on the constitutive equation, this research arrives at a special solution for NEMD that is Euclidean-invariant. Several sets of simulations demonstrate that equivalent motions can be achieved in NEMD. This study may provide new directions for future MD applications." .

Fundamental frequency of resonators significantly affects their functionality and performance; therefore, an accurate prediction of SWCNTs’ natural frequency is vital for designing and developing such devices. In reality, CNTs are not straight and perfect; indeed, they have some degree of vacancy defect and waviness, which occurs during growth and manipulation processes. This research investigates for the first time the combination effects of both initial curvature and vacancy defects on vibrational behaviour of SWCNTs in order to make the simulation closer to the “real world”. In this study, an efficient method based on the molecular dynamics model and the finite element method is used to simulate wavy SWCNTs with vacancy defects. Zigzag carbon nanotube with chirality indices (5, 0) is considered. Accuracy of our modelling method is verified by comparing our results with the results obtained from previous studies in simulating ideal SWCNT natural frequency. The effects of vacancy, vacancy location, curvature and aspect ratio on natural vibration of the defected wavy SWCNTs have been investigated, and a parameter of critical waviness ratio has been defined for the first time to emphasize the combination effect of vacancies and waviness on the natural frequency of SWCNTs. Our results show that critical waviness is sensitive to the aspect ratio and indicate that by increasing the length of SWCNTs, the critical waviness ratio increases." .

Binding energies are found to be well reproduced for complexes that are bound predominantly by dispersion, whereas significant and consistent overestimation is observed for hydrogen bonded complexes. Overall, the mean average error is around 2 kcal mol−1, for all basis sets considered. The effect of changing the proportion of exact and Slater exchange in the functional is shown to alter the balance of description of hydrogen bonded and dispersion bound complexes, but does not improve the overall performance. However, a simple multiplicative scaling of binding energies is possible, and reduces the mean average error to less than 1 kcal mol−1. The performance of the BHandH functional for geometry optimization was also studied, and in almost all cases the difference from ab initio geometries is small, with root mean square deviations of between 0.05 and 0.20 Å. Harmonic frequency calculation allow us to check whether optimized geometries are true minima at this level, and to estimate the zero point vibrational energy change on binding." .

The second structure shows a lower stability per hydrogen bond. The spontaneities of the reactions to form the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes are greatly influenced by the X group of the linear acid.

For example, in silico targeting of ATP-competitive inhibitors of CDKs is of special interest. A series of 3,5-diaminoindazoles was studied using molecular docking and comparative field analyses. We used post-docking short time molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to account for receptor flexibility. The three types of structures, i.e., the highest energy, lowest energy and the structure most resembling the X-ray structure (three complexes) were identified for all ligands. QM/MM energy calculations were performed using a DFT b3lyp/6–31 g* and MM OPLS-2005 force field. Conceptual DFT properties such as the interaction energy of ligand to protein, global hardness (η), HOMO density, electrostatic potential, and electron density were calculated and related to inhibitory activity.

Peptide aldehydes can inhibit the 20S proteasome activity by covalently binding to the active site of the β subunits. In this work, covalent docking in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to explore the binding mode of MG132. Two conformations with the lowest docking energy were selected as the representative binding modes. One of the conformations was confirmed as a more reasonable binding mode by molecular dynamics simulations. The binding mode analysis revealed that a space demanding aromatic group with a short linker at the P4 site of the peptide aldehyde inhibitor would form favorable hydrophobic contacts with the neighboring subunit. A bulky substituent at the P2 position would also increase the binding stability by reducing water accessibility of the covalent bond. This study contributed to our understanding of the mechanism and structure-activity relationship of the peptide aldehyde inhibitors and may provide useful information for rational drug design." .

The structures of the scFv:METH and the scFv:AMP complexes are analyzed by examining the time-dependence of their RMSDs, by analyzing the distance between some key atoms of the selected residues, and by comparing the averaged structures with their corresponding crystallographic structures. It is observed that binding an AMP to the scFv does not cause significant changes to the binding pocket of the scFv:ligand complex. The binding free energy of scFv:AMP without introducing an extra water into the binding pocket is much stronger than scFv:METH. This is against the first of the two scenarios postulated in the experimental work of Celikel et al. (Protein Science 18, 2336 (2009)). However, adding a water to the AMP (at the position of the methyl group of METH), the binding free energy of the scFv:AMP-H2O complex, is found to be significantly weaker than scFv:METH. This is consistent with the second of the two scenarios given by Celikel et al. Decomposition of the binding energy into ligand-residue pair interactions shows that two residues (Tyr175 and Tyr177) have nearly-zero interactions with AMP in the scFv:AMP-H2O complex, whereas their interactions with METH in the scFv:METH complex are as large as -0.8 and -0.74 kcal mol-1.

Emphasis was placed on the analysis of the role played by water in the MOx syn–anti equilibrium and the electronic absorption spectrum. Results for the structure of the MOx–water solution, free energy of solvation and polarization effects are also reported. Our main conclusion was that in gas-phase and in low-polarity solvents, the MOx exists dominantly in syn-form and in aqueous solution in anti-form. This conclusion was supported by Gibbs free energy calculations in gas phase and in-water by quantum mechanical calculations with polarizable continuum model and thermodynamic perturbation theory in Monte Carlo simulations using a polarized MOx model. The consideration of the in-water polarization of the MOx is very important to correctly describe the solute–solvent electrostatic interaction. Our best estimate for the shift of the π–π* transition energy of MOx, when it changes from gas-phase to water solvent, shows a red-shift of −2,520 ± 90 cm−1, which is only 110 cm−1 (0.014 eV) below the experimental extrapolation of −2,410 ± 90 cm−1. This red-shift of around −2,500 cm−1 can be divided in two distinct and opposite contributions. One contribution is related to the syn → anti conformational change leading to a blue-shift of ~1,700 cm−1. Other contribution is the solvent effect on the electronic structure of the MOx leading to a red-shift of around −4,200 cm−1. Additionally, this red-shift caused by the solvent effect on the electronic structure can by composed by approximately 60 % due to the electrostatic bulk effect, 10 % due to the explicit inclusion of the hydrogen-bonded water molecules and 30 % due to the explicit inclusion of the nearest water molecules." .

If one omits the terminal methylene fragments at C10 and C11, the atoms comprising the acetanilide fragment and the substituted carbon of the cyclopropane ring lie in a nearly perfect plane. Molecular mechanics as well as semiempirical (AM1) calculations were carried out in order to determine the structure of the energy-minimized configurations in the two computational environments. The molecular conformations thus obtained are close to that experimentally observed from the X-ray diffraction experiment. In both theoretical models, the lowest energy conformation is that in which the plane of the phenyl ring bisects the cyclopropane C-C-C angle as was experimentally observed. Finally, the shape of the conformational barrier as a function of the orientation of the plane of the phenyl ring was computed, giving a maximum barrier to rotation of 2.2 kcal/mol. Similar calculations were carried out for two other aryl cyclopropanes, whose rings (naphthalene and anthracene) cannot adopt the bisecting position.

Potential use of CPD-DHP photoswitch in memory devices requires a very slow thermal return in the dark in the absence of any side reaction. Herein, thermal return of CPDs to DHPs, and an unwanted sigmatropic shift in DHP is studied through density functional theory calculations at (U)B3LYP/6-31+G(d). The thermal return occurs through symmetry forbidden conrotatory electrocyclic reaction. Dimethyl amino CPD-DHP photoswitch pair has the highest activation barrier for electrocyclization and sigmatropic shifts. The lowest activation barrier for symmetry forbidden electrocyclization is observed for GeBr3 functionalized CPD. An unprecedented decomposition pathway involving elimination of the internal substituents is predicted for Cl, Br and SMe functionalized DHPs. This study shows great promise in understanding the Woodward Hoffmann forbidden processes and, in reducing the synthetic efforts toward robust photochromes for memory applications." .

Here, we employed ab initio calculation to understand the underlying mechanism of [C1mim][DMP] in eliminating the azeotropic point of acetone and methanol. Structure, energy and interaction in binary-, ternary- and quaternary-clusters composed of methanol, acetone, [C1mim]+ or/and [DMP]‾ were calculated. The σ-hole, AIM and NBO analyses were performed to understand intermolecular interaction with electron density, electron occupancy, charge transfer and molecular orbital interaction. Hydrogen bond interaction plays a key role in azeotropic point elimination; due to the much stronger hydrogen bond interaction between methanol and [C1mim][DMP] than that between acetone and [C1mim][DMP], [C1mim][DMP] prefers to interact with methanol rather than acetone, and the original interaction between methanol and acetone is separated by [C1mim][DMP]. The hydrogen bond is from the orbital interaction between O lone-pair-electron orbitals of the hydrogen bond acceptor and σ * (C-H) or σ * (O–H) anti-bonding orbitals of the hydrogen bond donor, where remarkable electron or charge transfer occurs. These theoretical calculation results are in agreement with the experimental observation that [C1mim][DMP] eliminates the azeotropic point of methanol and acetone.

In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations of adhesion problems in micro gear train are proposed. The perfect MEMS gear train model is very complicated by considering the computing time. A simplified model to simulate surface sliding between metals by molecular dynamics (MD) is proposed because the surface property is a dominant factor for the performance of gear systems. Based on analysis of sliding friction and the transmitting characteristics of micro gear train, a model is established by utilizing the Morse potential function. The Verlet algorithm is employed to solve atom trajectories. The simulation results show that adhesion tends to occur between two micro gears after certain cycles and such adhesion accounts for the friction force and the temperature increase. The simulation results are in consistence with the experimental results in the literature. The model is meaningful to prolong the lifetime of micro gear train by selecting proper parameters." .

Only 1369 cm-1 vibrational band of pyrrole shows a significant change in its peak position in going from neat pyrrole to the complexes. The 1369 cm-1 band shows (∼6 cm-1) blue shift upon dilution and the corresponding linewidth shows the maximum shift at C = 0.5 mole fraction of pyrrole upon dilution which clearly indicates that the concentration fluctuation model plays major role. Quantum chemical calculation using density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio (MP2 and HF) methods were performed employing high level basis set, 6-311++G(d,p) to obtain the ground state geometry of neat pyrrole and its complexes with DCM in gas phase.

The use of quantum chemistry to evaluate kinetic feasibility is an attractive approach to identify enzymes for the proposed transformation. However, the sheer number of novel transformations that can be generated makes this impractical as a screening approach. Therefore, it is essential to develop structure/activity relationships based on quantities that are more efficient to calculate. In this work, we propose a structure/activity relationship based on the free energy of binding or reaction of non-native substrates to evaluate the catalysis relative to that of native substrates. While Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationships such as that proposed here have found broad application in heterogeneous catalysis, their extension to enzymatic catalysis is limited. We report here on density functional theory (DFT) studies for C–C bond formation and C–C bond cleavage associated with the decarboxylation of six 2-keto acids by a thiamine-containing enzyme (EC 1.2.7.1) and demonstrate a linear relationship between the free energy of reaction and the activation barrier. We then applied this relationship to predict the activation barriers of 17 chemically similar novel reactions. These calculations reveal that there is a clear correlation between the free energy of formation of the transition state and the free energy of the reaction, suggesting that this method can be further extended to predict the kinetics of novel reactions through our computational framework for discovery of novel biochemical transformations.

The indeterminacies observed in the CNDO localization for unsaturated systems and for molecules with two or three lone pairs on the same atom, are removed by localizing up to an INDO level.

It has been identified as a key target for many clinical drugs. In the present study, we construct the structure of human 2α12β2γ2 GABAAR using a homology modeling method. The structures of ten benzodiazepine type drugs and two non-benzodiazepine type drugs were then docked into the potential benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAAR. By analyzing the docking results, the critical residues His102 (α1), Phe77 (γ2) and Phe100 (α1) were identified in the binding site. To gain insight into the binding affinity, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for all the receptor–ligand complexes. We also examined single mutant GABAAR (His102A) in complexes with the three drugs (flurazepam, eszopiclone and zolpidem) to elucidate receptor–ligand interactions. For each receptor–ligand complex (with flurazepam, eszopiclone and zolpidem), we calculated the average distance between the Cα of the mutant residue His102A (α1) to the center of mass of the ligands. The results reveal that the distance between the Cα of the mutant residue His102A (α1) to the center of flurazepam is larger than that between His102 (α1) to flurazepam in the WT type complex. Molecular mechanic-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA)-based binding free energy calculations were performed. The binding free energy was decomposed into ligand-residue pairs to create a ligand-residue interaction spectrum. The predicted binding free energies correlated well (R 2 = 0.87) with the experimental binding free energies. Overall, the major interaction comes from a few groups around His102 (α1), Phe77 (γ2) and Phe100 (α1). These groups of interaction consist of at least of 12 residues in total with a binding energy of more than 1 kcal mol−1.

This drawback forces the modeling of protein-ligand systems to adopt discrete amino acid rotamers and ligand conformers, as well as continuum solvent treatment of the environment; however, such compromises produce large numbers of false positives in sequence selection. In this report, cephalosporin acylase, which catalyzes the hydrolytic reaction of cephalosporin C to 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, was used to investigate the dynamic features of active-site-transition-state complex structures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to potentially eliminate false positives. The molecular docking between cephalosporin C and wild type acylase N176 and its eight mutants showed that the rate-limiting step in the hydrolytic reaction of cephalosporin C is the acylation process. MD simulations of the active-site-transition-state complex structures of the acylation processes for N176 and its eight mutants showed that the geometrical constraints between catalytic residues and small molecule transition states are always well maintained during the 20 ns simulation for mutants with higher activities, and more hydrogen bonds between binding residues and functional groups of the ligand side chain in the active pocket are formed for mutants with higher activities. The conformations of the ligand transition states were changed greatly after the simulation. This indicates that the hydrogen bond network between the ligand and protein could be improved to enhance the activity of cephalosporin C acylase in subsequent design." .

The constitutive activation induced by mutation of key GPCR residues is associated closely with various diseases. However, the structural basis underlying such activation and its role in drug binding has remained unclear. Herein, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to study the effects of a D130N mutation on the structure of β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and its binding of the agonist salbutamol. The results indicate that the mutation caused significant changes in some key helices. In particular, the mutation leads to the departure of transmembrane 3 (TM3) from transmembrane 6 (TM6) and marked changes in the NPxxY region as well as the complete disruption of a key ionic lock, all of which contribute to the observed constitutive activation. In addition, the D130N mutation weakens some important H-bonds, leading to structural changes in these regions. Binding free energy calculations indicate that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions are the main driving forces in binding salbutamol; however, binding strength in the mutant β2AR is significantly enhanced mainly through modifying electrostatic interactions. Further analysis revealed that the increase in binding energy upon mutation stems mainly from the H-bonds formed between the hydroxyl group of salbutamol and the serine residues of TM5. This observation suggests that modifications of the H-bond groups of this drug could significantly influence drug efficacy in the treatment of diseases associated with this mutation.

Phase separation of C–C, B–C and Si–O was achieved for three compositions, and silicon-centered mixed-bond tetrahedrons were reproduced successfully. As the boron content increases, the boron atoms tend to form B–C and B–Si bonds in the voids, which stretches the free carbon network in some instances, causing a increase in C–C distance. Young’s modulus remains stable at high temperature for the high-carbon case, which indicates that the free carbon network plays a critical role in the structural and thermal stability of SiBCO.

The procedure combines a generation algorithm to produce representative uncorrelated atomistic microstructures and an original relaxation method to minimize repulsive non-bonded interactions. Using this methodology, a set of 14 unfolded proteins, including seven natively unfolded proteins as well as seven “classical” proteins experimentally described in denaturation conditions, has been investigated. Comparisons between the calculated and available experimental values of several properties, at hydrodynamic and atomic level, used to describe the unfolded state, such as the radius of gyration, the maximum length, the hydrodynamic radius, the diffusion coefficient, the sedimentation coefficient, and the NMR chemical shifts, reflect a very good agreement. Furthermore, our results indicate that the relationship between the radius of gyration and the hydrodynamic radius deviates from the Zimm’s theory of polymer dynamics for random coils, as was recently observed using single-molecule fluorescent methods. Simulations reveal that the interactions between atoms separated by three chemical bonds (1–4 interactions) play a crucial role in the generation process, suggesting that the unfolded state is essentially governed by bonding and short-range non-bonding interactions." .

Several mutants of PCI have been obtained in order to study the physico-chemical properties related to the inhibition. Point mutations were performed in the C-tail of PCI given its fundamental role in the inhibition. The inhibition constant and the dissociation free energy of the complexes PCI-CPA was experimentally obtained for each mutant. The mutants were divided in two sets, those where the mutation was intrinsically affecting the conformation of the PCI C-tail, and those where the mutation affected the interaction between PCI and CPA. The crystallographic structure of PCI, as found in its complex with bovine carboxypeptidase A, was used to model the structure of these mutants. Two theoretical approaches were performed to explain both sets of experimental results: 1) study of the structural features of wt PCI and mutant forms by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and 2) modelling of the interaction of the C-tail of PCI with CPA. The first approach provides an explanation of the observed behaviour of the mutants of PCI, if the hypothesis is made of a direct relationship between the entropy of inhibition and the mobility of the C-tail of PCI. For the second set of mutants, the experimentally measured dissociation energies for the complexes PCI- CPA can be related to the theoretically estimated exposure to the solvent of the side chain of the mutated residue in the complex. In the case of the double mutation G35P+P36G, the importance of the main chain hydrogen bond between Gly 35 and Ala26, anchoring the C-tail to the core of PCI, as predicted by the MD simulations, was also supported by the experimental result. The agreement between the theoretical approaches and the experimental results shows the appropriateness of our hypotheses and also the relevance of such a combined effort of experimental and computational molecular biology in protein engineering." .

Indeed, it generally necessitates computationally costly simulations of more than several hundreds of picoseconds. To achieve such studies, efficient density functional theory (DFT) formalisms, based on various levels of approximate computational schemes, have been developed, and provide a good alternative to commonly used DFT implementations. We report benchmark results on the conformational change FES of alanine dipeptide obtained with auxiliary density functional theory (ADFT) and second- and third-order density functional tight-binding (DFTB) methods coupled to metadynamics simulations. The influence of an explicit water solvent is also studied with DFTB, which was made possible by its lower computational cost compared to ADFT. Simulations lengths of 2.1 and 15 ns were achieved with ADFT and DFTB, respectively, in a reasonably short computational time. ADFT leads to a free energy difference (ΔF eq-ax) of ∼ −3 kcal mol−1 between the two low energy conformers, C7eq and C7ax, which is lower by only 1.5 kcal mol−1 than the ΔF eq-ax computed with DFTB. The two minima in ADFT FES are separated by an energy barrier of 9 kcal mol−1, which is higher than the DFTB barriers by 2–4 kcal mol−1. Despite these small quantitative differences, the DFTB method reveals FES shapes, confor-mation geometries and energies of the stationary points in good agreement with these found with ADFT. This validates the promising applicability of DFTB to FES of reactions occurring in larger-size systems placed in complex environments." .

The results showed that the sensitivity of an air-sealed capacitive pressure sensor with a flexible diaphragm could be enhanced by adopting an additional air chamber. In this process, the variation in the ambient temperature was also considered. Experimental validation was conducted by fabricating a sensor to consider the previous result. The results of the experimental validation of the air-sealed capacitive pressure sensor with natural rubber latex (NRL) diaphragm showed that the sensitivity increased more than 15-fold by adopting the additional air chamber compared to the NRL sensor without the air chamber. Consequently, the NRL sensor with the additional air chamber measured a pressure sensitivity of 8986 ppm/kPa and a pressure responsivity of 1.391 MHz/kPa in the applied pressure range of 1–10 kPa.

In this paper we report a simple computational methodology for obtaining new ideas for functional groups that may act as effective inhibitors. We relate this study to serine proteases. We have analyzed all of the factors that operate in the enzyme-substrate interactions and govern the free energy for the transformation of the Michaelis complex (MC) to the anionic covalent tetrahedral complex (TC). The free energy of this transformation ( ΔΔG MC-TC ) is the quantitative criterion that differentiates between the catalytic and inhibitory processes in proteases. The catalytic TC is shifted upwards (ΔΔG MC-TC > 0) relative to the MC in the free energy profile of the reaction, whereas the inhibitory tetrahedral species is shifted downward (ΔΔG MC-TC < 0). Therefore, the more stable the TC, the more effective it should be as an inhibitor. We conclude that the dominant contribution to the superstabilization of an anionic TC for transition state analog inhibitors originates from the formation of a σ-covalent bond between the reactive centers of the enzyme and its inhibitor. This energetic effect is a quantitative value obtained in ab initio calculations and provides an estimate as to whether a functional group is feasible as potent inhibitor or not. To support our methodology, we describe several examples where good agreement is shown between modeled ab initio quantum chemical calculations and experimental results extracted from the literature." .

However, there is yet a poor understanding of the fundamental mechanisms for bond formation between them and carbon structures. It has been found experimentally that the presence of functional groups such as φ-NH2 and φ-OH assists on the chemical absorption of PMo12, but there is not enough information on the actual mechanism of the process. In order to gather further knowledge on these issues, we have performed quantum mechanical calculations, based on the density functional theory of atomic arrangements using graphene as carbon structure model, different functional groups, and PMo12. Our aim was to look for the nature of bonding among them, and to dig into the charge properties to relate them with the experimental observation. From the computations performed with PMo12 polyanion near to a graphene sheet, with and without the presence of functional groups, we conclude that there is a non-covalent/electrostatic bonding, made of weak $$\\pi$$ π –$$\\pi$$ π stacking interactions between PMo12 and graphene. Calculations show that φ-NH2 and φ-OH functional groups are able to form covalent bonds with PMo12 in top and side fashion arrangements, being the latter the most stable. This is a powerful argument to explain the empirical observation on these groups, enhancing the PMo12 adsorption over carbon structures. We also found that the presence of the functional groups together with PMo12 creates electronic states that may act as alternative pathways that ions can track within electrochemical cells. Our results offer first-principle information relevant to the understanding of these composite materials, and the methodology could be directly applied to other Keggin structures or different functional groups, attached to graphene, to find potential advantages for energy storage devices." .

In particular, it has now become feasible to use multiple initial molecular configurations to generate an ensemble of replicate production-run simulations that allows for more complete characterization of rare events such as ligand-receptor unbinding. However, there are currently no explicit guidelines for selecting an ensemble of initial configurations for replicate simulations. Here, we use clustering analysis and steered molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the configurational changes accessible in molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules do not necessarily correlate with observed rare-event properties. This informs selection of a representative set of initial configurations. We also employ statistical analysis to identify the minimum number of replicate simulations required to sufficiently sample a given biomolecular property distribution. Together, these results suggest a general procedure for generating an ensemble of replicate simulations that will maximize accurate characterization of rare-event property distributions in biomolecules." .

Hydrogen incorporation was achieved via diffusive addition. In preparing samples that may simulate the distributions of atoms in the amorphous materials, simulated annealing calculations were carried out from given starting conditions using short and long time steps. The different time-steps led to samples having distinctly different topological disorder. The radial distribution functions (partial and total) of the resulting samples were calculated and compared with measured distributions; the agreement is very good. These comparisons allowed some tentative conclusions to be made as regards the kind of disorder prevailing in the real samples. In addition, we studied the effect of the topological disorder on the electronic densities of states of the samples; the passivating effect of hydrogen can be observed." .

Despite the high divergence between AAT enzymes, two important and conserved motifs are shared: the catalytic HxxxD motif, and the DFGWG motif. The latter is proposed to play a structural role; however, its function remains unclear. The DFGWG motif is located in loop 21 and stabilized by a hydrogen bond between residues Y52 and D381. Also, this motif is distant from the HxxxD motif, and most probably without a direct role in the substrate interaction. To evaluate the role of the DFGWG motif, in silico analysis was performed in the VpAAT1 protein. Three mutants (Y52F, D381A and D381E) were evaluated. Major changes (size and shape) in the solvent channels were found, although no differences were revealed in the entire 3D structure. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies described unfavorable energies for interaction of the mutant proteins with different substrates, as well as unfavored ligand orientations in the solvent channel. Additionally, we examined the contribution of different energetic parameters to the total free energy of protein–ligand complexes by the MM-GBSA method. The complexes differed mainly in their van der Waals contributions and have unfavorable electrostatic interactions. VpAAT1, Y52F and D381A mutants showed a dramatic reduction in the binding capacity to several substrates, which is related to differences in electrostatic potential on the protein surfaces, suggesting that D381 from the DFGWG motif and residue Y52 play a crucial role in maintenance of the adequate solvent channel structure required for catalysis.

The effects of conformation and aqueous solvation on several molecular properties typically used as descriptors in structure-activity relationship studies, such as Mulliken charges and the HOMO-LUMO gap, were considered. In the case of the charges on the O(3) and N(4) atoms, the effects of conformation were shown to be larger than those due to structural changes, while the charge on O(16) was greatly affected by structural and very little by conformational changes. Based on the computed values for this charge in analogs with different binding affinities, we suggest that the electrostatic features of the 5-methoxy moiety do not modulate binding affinity. Taken together, our results suggest that conformational and solvation effects should be considered in order to obtain realistic structure-activity relationships of the melatonin system." .

It is responsible for molecular recognition between the viral particle and the host cell, as well as fusion of the viral envelope to the endosome bilayer. Because it is essential for influenza viral infection and replication, it has become a target for the design of anti-influenza drugs. Previous studies have identified two small molecule HA ligands (CL-385319 and 1L) that inhibit infection with pseudovirus H5N1 with different potency. In order to compare their different inhibitory activities and shed light on drug design targeting the HA protein, we conducted a variety of theoretical calculations, including docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, as well as quantum calculations to investigate interactions between these two ligands and the HA protein. We found that molecule 1L has stronger π–π interactions with the side chains of residues F1102 and M241 compared with molecule CL-385319. We propose that these stronger π–π interactions are responsible for the higher inhibitory activity of molecule 1L. Our calculations will aid drug design studies targeting the HA protein.

The mechanism of orotidine 5-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) has been modeled using hybrid Density Functional Theory (B3LYP functional). The main goal of the present study was to investigate if much larger quantum chemical models of the active site than previously used could shed new light on the mechanism. The models used include the five conserved amino acids expected to be the most important ones for catalysis. One result of this model is that a mechanism involving a direct cleavage of the C–C bond followed by a protonation of C6 by Lys93 appears unlikely, with a barrier for decarboxylation 20 kcal mol–1 too high. Additional effects like electrostatic stress and ground-state destabilization have been estimated to have only a minor influence on the reaction barrier. The conclusion from the calculations is that the negative charge developing on the substrate during decarboxylation must be stabilized by a protonation of the carbonyl O2 of the substrate. For this mechanism, the addition of the catalytic amino acids decreases the reaction barrier by 25 kcal mol–1, but full agreement with experimental results has still not been reached. Further modifications of this mechanism are discussed.

Docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation is used to investigate the binding mode between BMS-488043 and gp120.

Comparing the obtained results with the available reported experimental data, indicate the authenticity of the applied simulation approach.

Finally, 15 reaction paths and five transition states were obtained. All possible decomposition species and transition states, including intermediates and products, were identified, and their corresponding enthalpy and Gibbs free energy values were obtained. The results revealed that (1) the maximum activation energy required is 187.8 kJ mol–1, and the enthalpy change (ΔH) and Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG) of the net reaction are −525.1 kJ mol–1 and −935.6 kJ mol–1, respectively; (2) GZT can release large amounts of energy, the main contribution being from the disintegration of the 5,5'-azotetrazolate anion (ZT2−) skeleton (ΔH = −598.3 kJ mol–1); and (3) the final products contained major amounts of N2 gas, but remaining gas molecules such as HCN and NH3 were obtained, which are in agreement with experimental results.

Epoxides with various substituents were studied to explore steric and electronic effects on the reaction mechanism. Computational results show that the cycloaddition proceeds according to a much easier mechanism in the presence of Mg(TPP) and TBAI than the mechanism that takes place when Mg(TPP) is used as the catalyst. A preference for the epoxide ring-opening to occur at the methine (Cα) or methylene (Cβ) carbon was noted. The ring-closing step leading to the formation of a five-membered carbonate is predicted to determine the reaction rate. For alkyl-substituted epoxides, the β pathway is favorable since steric factors are dominant; for epoxides with a strongly electron-donating group and styrene oxide, the reaction is mainly controlled by electronic factors and proceeds along the α pathway. When the epoxide has a strongly electron-withdrawing group (CF3), both steric and electronic effects play important roles.

The ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out at temperature of 1500 K in order to investigate the mechanism of vitrinite pyrolysis. Initially, a minimum energy conformational structure model was constrained by a combination of elemental and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) literature data. The model analysis shows the chemical and physical parameters of vitrinite pyrolysis are broadly consistent with the experimental data. Based on the molecular model, ReaxFF MD simulations further provide information of unimolecule such as bond length, and chemical shift, and hence the total population and energy of main products. Molecules bond and pyrolysis fragments, based on active bond analyzed, revealed pyrolysis products of single vitrinite molecule with aliphatic C-C bond, especially ring and chain aliphatic as liquefaction activity.

Relative binding free energies calculated using the MM-PBSA method show that protonation of Asp25 results in the strongest binding of BEA369 to HIV-1 protease. Inhibitor–residue interactions computed by the theory of free energy decomposition also indicate that protonation of Asp25 has the most favorable effect on binding of BEA369. In addition, hydrogen-bond analysis based on the trajectories of the MD simulations shows that protonation of Asp25 strongly influences the water-mediated link of a conserved water molecule, Wat301. We expect that the results of this study will contribute significantly to binding calculations for BEA369, and to the design of high affinity inhibitors." .

This type of molecular dynamics may lead to a proper description of the atomistic scale in multi-scale analysis of engineering problems. However, the proposed Lagrangian is stated without derivation and lacks invariance under modular transformations. Recently, this type of dynamics was re-interpreted into a continuum-related Parrinello-Rahman molecular dynamics. The continuum-related formulation is derived in a consistent physical manner and becomes equal to the original formulation by employing two propositions. The propositions are stated without validation and the treatment shows no numerical example demonstrating the performance of the proposed formulation. Based on this recent continuum-related derivation, this paper investigates the validity of the two propositions in a numerical example, namely a phase transition in a nickel single crystal. Furthermore, the invariance of the continuum-related Lagrangian is investigated. This implies that the obtained dynamics is invariant to the chosen unit cell, which corroborates with results in solid state physics and which is a mandatory requirement for the suitability for multi-scale analysis." .

Shell thickness and the degree of disorder appear to play an important role in such behavior at the graphene interface/oxide. We performed molecular dynamics and DFT calculations to understand the nature of bonding at the nanohybrid interface and the degree of disorder caused by the bonding of the oxide on the graphene surface. Growing of shell thickness with increasing number of TiO$$_2$$ 2 nanoparticles was simulated using a reactive force field, and an optimum configuration was found. Shell size plays a dominant role in the rising of enhanced electronic states around the Fermi level, increasing chemical capacity. Interestingly, at the optimum shell thickness, stability of the MWCNT is not compromised and the value of the density of states at the Fermi level is the largest. This provides the structural features to improve the design of core@shell materials for Li-ion batteries. It may be of particular relevance to synthesize composites based on MWCNT to improve performance of several materials for Li-ion storage, since the same trend can be expected to other systems." .

The fleet scenario was defined by Aerospatiale and Snecma for a current technology Mach-2 aircraft; the models were limited to simplified homogeneous phase reactions. The results indicated a global ozone decrease of about 1.5% in steady-state conditions. Now the 2D model has been upgraded and includes the classical heterogeneous reactions with Polar Strato- spheric Clouds (PSC) and aerosol. It also takes into account the natural or anthopogenic evolution of the background atmosphere. The scenario has been optimized to meet more realistic conditions. Thus, new results are presented. The main conclusion concerning the calculated impact of a realistic fleet for the next 20–50 years is still weaker than in the previous work: the decrease for the total ozone would always be lower than 0.3%. These results are commented, with the help of a parametric study, pointing out the importance of the background atmosphere and especially the total chlorine loading and the aerosol surface area." .

PRDM9 is the major determinant of the meiotic recombination hotspot and the enrichment of H3K4me3 at the hotspot defines the initiation site of meiotic recombination. In PRDM9, two conserved tyrosine residues Tyr357 and Tyr276 surrounding the amino group of the substrate lysine may influence the methylation activity through hydrogen bond interactions with AdoMet or the substrate lysine. In this study, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy simulations were performed to reveal the methylation processes catalyzed by wild type PRDM9, its Y357F, and Y276F mutants, respectively. The different roles of Tyr357 and Tyr276 in the methylation activity of PRDM9 were also investigated and compared. The calculated free energy barriers of the methyl transfers suggest that the Y276F mutation decreases the catalytic activity of the methyl transfer, while the Y357F mutation does not change the catalytic activity of the methyl transfer. The reactant complex conformations generated in the QM/MM MD simulations show that the reactive configuration can be formed in the Y357F mutant but not in the Y276F mutant." .

Choosing as reference systems one of the fastest motors known to date and two variants thereof, we consider six new motors obtained by introducing electron-donating methoxy and dimethylamino or electron-withdrawing nitro and cyano substituents in conjugation with the central olefinic bond connecting the two (stator and rotator) motor halves. Performing density functional theory calculations, we then show that electron-donating (but not electron-withdrawing) groups at the stator are able to reduce the already small barriers of the reference motors by up to 18 kJ mol−1. This result outlines a possible strategy for improving the rotational frequencies of motors of this kind. Furthermore, exploring the origin of the catalytic effect, it is found that electron-donating groups exert a favorable steric influence on the thermal isomerizations, which is not manifested by electron-withdrawing groups. This finding suggests a new mechanism for controlling the critical steric interactions of these motors.

The fractal-like equation could predict accurately the experimental data at low temperature 34 °C for free/immobilized cellulase and high temperature 53 °C for immobilized cellulase, but the prediction at 53 °C for free cellulase was not accurate enough due to its lower stability than immobilized cellulase.

In this article, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report the formation of trans-polyacetylene on single-walled carbon-doped boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) through their adsorption of a series of C2H2 molecules. The results show that, rather than through [2 + 2] cycloaddition, an individualmolecule would preferentially attach to a carbon-doped BNNT via “carbon attack” (i.e., a carbon in the C2H2 attacks a site on the BNNT). The adsorption energy gradually decreases with increasing tube diameter. The free radical of the carbon-doped BNNT is almost completely transferred to the carbon atom at the end of the adsorbed C2H2 molecule. When another C2H2 molecule approaches the carbon-doped BNNT, it is most energetically favorable for this C2H2 molecule to be adsorbed at the end of the previously adsorbed C2H2 molecule, and so on with extra C2H2 molecules, leading to the formation of polyacetylene on the nanotube. The spin of the whole system is always localized at the tip of the polyacetylene formed, which initiates the adsorption of the incoming species. The present results imply that carbon-doped BNNT is an effective “metal-free” initiator for the formation of polyacetylene." .

Our results indicate that the nitrogen doping (TTH) at the 6,8,15,17 positions improves its stability in air and the ability of electron injection and in the meantime slightly changes the molecular stacking due to the C-H···N interaction. For both TTBH and TTH, large hole transport mobility (μ h ) and electron transport mobility (μ e ), which are on the same order of magnitude, are given rise by their dense displaced π-stacking in crystal. Comparatively, the phenyl substitution (Ph-TTBH) at the 6,8,15,17 positions adopts a non-planar conformation, adverse to close packing and therefore leads to smaller electron/hole transport mobility (μ) than those of TTBH and TTH. The calculations suggest TTBH and TTH are promising candidates for excellent ambipolar OFET materials. Graphical AbstractIn comparison with parent tetrabenzoheptacenes compound, the C-H···N hydrogen bonds interaction caused by nitrogen doping gives rise to different relative in-plane displacement of the dimer with shortest centroid distance in crystal structure. Such distinguish leads to the significantly different frontier molecular orbital interaction of monomers in the dimer, which explains the different nature of the charge transfer" .

The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency was analyzed within the 6 known standard models. The activation energies estimated from the temperature dependence of the35Cl NQR frequency assuming the Bayer model were 1.07, 2.35 and 2.76 kJ/mol for HCTZ, ATZ and CTZ respectively, which confirms that HCTZ is less rigid than CTZ and ATZ is much more rigid than HCTZ, and suggests that the mechanism of relaxation is based on small amplitude librations. The characteristic temperatures estimated from the Bayer model, with that for CTZ (332.5 K) being much higher than for HCTZ (132.1 K), mean that the intermolecular interactions in CTZ are much stronger than in HCTZ, as suggested by the melting point of CTZ being higher than that for HCTZ. For ATZ the characteristic temperature (288 K) takes an intermediate value, which suggests that the intermolecular interactions in this compound are stronger than in HCTZ and weaker than in CTZ. A significant narrowing of the resonance35Cl NQR line observed for all these compounds at room temperature, relative to that at the liquid nitrogen temperature, suggests an averaging of dipolar interactions as a result of fast rotation of nonquadrupole nuclei in the vicinity of the quadrupole nuclei, when 2πνQτc ≫ 1 (a rotation of the −NH2 group in the direct neighborhood of the chlorine nuclei) or a change in the gradient orientation with its value preserved (which is equivalent to rotation of the quadrupole nucleus Cl). The influence of the rotations of the −NH2 and −CH2SCH2CH=CH2 groups (ATZ) or −CHCl2 group (TCTZ) on the35Cl NQR frequency was modelled by the B3LYP/6-31G* method. The frequencies of the libration vibrations calculated from the temperature dependence of the NQR resonance frequency were compared with experimental ones and those implied by the density functional theory, infrared and Raman spectra. For HCTZ the anomalies in the temperature dependence of the35Cl NQR frequency, the lack of hysteresis and small but notable changes in the slope and the jump in the frequency observed at 253 K which does not exceed 0.05 MHz suggest a second-order phase transition at 253 K." .

To explore the mechanism of HIV-1 neutralization by VRC01 and thus obtain valuable information for vaccine design, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations for apo-VRC01, apo-gp120, and the gp120–VRC01 complex. For gp120, residue energy decomposition analysis showed that the hotspot residues Asn280, Lys282, Asp368, Ile371, and Asp457 are located in three primary loops, including the CD4-binding loop, loop D, and loop V5. For VRC01, the hotspot residues Trp47, Trp50, Asn58, Arg61, Gln64, Trp100, and Tyr91 mainly come from CDR2 of the heavy chain. By decomposing the binding free energy into different components, intermolecular van der Waals interactions and nonpolar solvation were found to dominate the binding process. Principal component analysis of loops D and V5, which are related to neutralization resistance, indicated that these two areas have a larger conformational space in apo-gp120 compared to bound gp120. A comparison of three representative structures from the cluster analysis of loops D and V5 indicated that changes primarily occur at the tip of loop V5, and are caused by fluctuations in the terminal Glu1 residue of the antibody. This information can be used to guide the design of vaccines and small molecule inhibitors." .

Some C 2-symmetric inhibitors have been designed for the C 2-symmetric binding pocket of HIV-1PR. The crystallographic structures reveal that the binding modes are not C 2-symmetric for C 2- symmetric inhibitors binding to PR. In this work, four molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the binding modes between four C 2-symmetric inhibitors (6 AD, 6AG, 6FD and 6FG) and PR, as well as the stabilities of these inhibitors in the binding pocket. Analysis of the hydrophobic surface of the binding pocket shows that it is necessary to add a polar group to the P1 (benzyl) and P2 (phenyl) groups of the inhibitor 6AD. Analysis of the hydrogen bonds formed between inhibitors and residues (Asp25/Asp25′, Ile50/Ile50′) indicates that the steric structures of the inhibitors are not suitable for the binding pocket. The two increased polar groups of trifluoromethyl and formamido meet the needs of the binding pocket for polar molecules. The inhibitor with both these groups (6FG) has stronger stability than the other three inhibitors, which have only one (6AG and 6FD) or none (6AD) of these groups. The ranking of binding free energies calculated by molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) method agrees well with the experimental data. It is expected that this study will provide theoretical guidance for the design of anti-AIDS drugs targeting HIV-1PR.

Through its transitions, we learn about the physical and chemical environments it finds itself in. Its formation requires the help of sub-micron size dust grains, particles in interstellar space that once originated in the ejecta of late type stars, or in novae and supernovae. Until a decade and a half ago, little was known how this molecule is formed in interstellar space.

The calculations predict bidentate nitrate ligand in the case of 1 and 2, leading to distorted tetrahedral geometry around the silver ion with longer Ag–O distances in case of 2 compared to 1, while 3 has a unidentate nitrate ligand leading to a distorted trigonal planar geometry. The packing of two [Ag(Etnic)2NO3] complex units; 4 does not affect the molecular geometry around Ag(I) ion compared to 1. In the case of 5, the two asymmetric units of the formula [Ag(Etnic)2NO3] differ in the bonding mode of the nitrate group, where the geometry around the silver ion is distorted tetrahedral in one unit and trigonal planar in the other. The calculations predicted almost no change in the charge densities at the different atomic sites except at the sites involved in the C–H⋯O interactions as well as at the coordinated nitrogen of the pyridine ring.

Glycerol as a source of substrate appears to have great potential, due to its large supply because of the increase in biodiesel production. This paper will discuss the multiplicity of steady states for the production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol by Clostridium butyricum, employing a model that takes into account inhibition by fermentation products. The theoretical study of bifurcation enabled us to make a qualitative adjustment to the various experimental steady states, using the theoretical steady states obtained from the AUTO2007 program. The theoretical model parameters were varied to fit qualitatively the values of the experimental steady states. In addition, this work is a qualitative study, using experimental steady states that can be used as an initial study for more advanced work on optimizing the production of 1,3-propanediol." .

The geometries of the metabolites and the values of their antioxidant parameters (proton affinity, bond dissociation enthalpy, adiabatic ionization potential, spin density, and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df,2p) level of theory. The results obtained reveal similarities between these structures: a pentatomic, nonaromatic ring is present in the oxidized forms, while an unbranched aliphatic chain (as found in saturated fatty acids) is present in both the oxidized and the reduced forms. Analysis of the spin density and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy revealed that the SH groups exhibited the greatest electron-donating activities. The values obtained for the proton affinity, bond dissociation enthalpy and adiabatic ionization potential indicate that the preferred antioxidant mechanisms for α-lipoic acid and its metabolites are sequential proton loss electron transfer in polar media and hydrogen atom transfer in vacuum." .

Our finite temperature quantum MD simulations for solid C60 are in excellent agreement with NMR, photoemission and neutron scattering data. The C60 isomer containing two pairs of adjacent five-fold rings has a binding energy only 1.6 eV smaller than that of perfect C60, but the transformation between these two structures is hindered by a 5.4 eV barrier. It thus requires high temperatures and long annealing times. High temperatures are also needed for the transformation of the lowest energy C20 isomer, a dodecahedron, to a corannulene structure, which can be thought of as a fragment of C60. The corannulene structure is a natural precursor for the formation of C60. Simulations of reactions show that C2 can insert into C58, perfect C60, and defect C60 fullerenes without an activation barrier, while C3 attaches only to their surfaces. Evaporative fragmentation of carbon clusters during annealing is unlikely, but atom and fragment exchange during collision favor \"locally\" most stable structures, such as C60. These results may explain the large increase in the abundance of C60 and C70 when carbon clusters are annealed at high density. We have also carried out calculations for paradigmatic microtubules, both reflection-symmetric and chiral. We find that the optimized geometries of the tubules are close to the ideal ones. It is possible to fabricate tubules with direct band gaps away from the Γ point by exploiting the similarities between the projected band structure of graphite and that of the tubule. The semiconducting tubules can be doped n- and p-type by substitutional N and B, respectively." .

The interactions of hZαADAR1 and Z-DNAs in different sequence contexts can affect many important biological functions including gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. Therefore it is of great necessity to fully understand their recognition mechanisms. However, most existing studies are aimed at the standard CG-repeat Z-DNA rather than the non-CG-repeats, and whether the molecular basis of hZαADAR1 binding to various Z-DNAs are identical or not is still unclear on the atomic level. Here, based on the recently determined crystal structures of three representative non-CG-repeat Z-DNAs (d(CACGTG)2, d(CGTACG)2 and d(CGGCCG)2) in complex with hZαADAR1, 40 ns molecular dynamics simulation together with binding free energy calculation were performed for each system. For comparison, the standard CG-repeat Z-DNA (d(CGCGCG)2) complexed with hZαADAR1 was also simulated. The consistent results demonstrate that nonpolar interaction is the driving force during the protein-DNA binding process, and that polar interaction mainly from helix α3 also provides important contributions. Five common hot-spot residues were identified, namely Lys169, Lys170, Asn173, Arg174 and Tyr177. Hydrogen bond analysis coupled with surface charge distribution further reveal the interfacial information between hZαADAR1 and Z-DNA in detail. All of the analysis illustrate that four complexes share the common key features and the similar binding modes irrespective of Z-DNA sequences, suggesting that Z-DNA recognition by hZαADAR1 is conformation-specific rather than sequence-specific. Additionally, by analyzing the conformational changes of hZαADAR1, we found that the binding of Z-DNA could effectively stabilize hZαADAR1 protein. Our study can provide some valuable information for better understanding the binding mechanism between hZαADAR1 or even other Z-DNA-binding protein and Z-DNA." .

The parameterization is based on the O2-column along the line of sight to the Sun and the local temperature. Line-by-line calculations have served as a benchmark for testing this method and several other, commonly used, parameterizations. The comparisons suggest that differences between the line-by-line calculations and currently accepted parameterizations can be reduced significantly by using the new method, particularly at large solar zenith angles. The production rate of O-atoms computed with this method shows less than 6% deviation compared to the line-by-line calculations at any altitude, all solar zenith angles and in all seasons. The largest errors are found toward the shorter wavelengths in the Schumann-Runge region at low altitudes. Transmittance is approximated to better than 4% at any altitude and/or solar zenith angle. The total O-production rate above 20 km is approximated to better than 2%. The new parameterization is easily implemented in existing photochemical models and in many cases it may simply replace the existing algorithm. The computational effort exceeds that of other parameterizations but in view of the total computation time needed for the actual calculation of the parameterized Schumann-Runge bands this should not lead to significant performance degeneration. The first 14 coefficients of the parameterization are included in this study. Both the complete sets of coefficients and a simple algorithm can be obtained by contacting the authors. A photochemical model study shows the largest effect of the parameterization method is on odd hydrogen concentrations. Subsequent interaction with an odd oxygen family causes differences in the ozone concentrations between the different parameterizations of more than 10% at selected altitudes. Although it is already established that deficiencies in the treatment of Schumann-Runge band absorption are unlikely to explain the current underestimation of ozone concentration at the stratopause in a variety of photochemical models, this study does show that the choice of parameterization has a large impact on the accuracy of the results at large solar zenith angles and in different seasons." .

To elucidate the effects of hydrodynamic interactions (HI), we compare results for hydrodynamic and random solvents. When HI are taken into account, we find that the chain diffusivity decreases initially and then increases gradually with the increasing strength of the Coulomb interaction. By contrast, when HI are switched off, the electrostatic-dependent diffusivity shows three distinct regions, and a plateau of approximately constant diffusivity manifests between two decreasing regions. The findings reveal that the dynamics of polyelectrolytes in dilute solution depend on the coupling effects of hydrodynamic and Coulomb interactions, and that these dynamics can be understood by considering the conformational changes of chains, the counterion condensation, and the dynamics of counterions." .

Single crystals of EHD were obtained using ethyl ether as solvent and a slow evaporation technique. Its crystallographic structure, derived from X-ray diffraction experiments, includes a disordered water molecule on the EHD supramolecular structure. This water molecule participates in four O–H···O hydrogen bonds, which are arranged as a centrosymmetric H-bond array with the water at the center. Electronic and structural properties of the isolated EHD molecule and of the EHD molecule in the presence of one water molecule were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory. These calculations show that the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of EHD decreases upon the introduction of the water molecule, suggesting that EHD becomes a stronger electron acceptor. These results indicate that the water molecule helps to stabilize the crystal structure in this system containing unequal numbers of acceptor and donor atoms. The supramolecular synthon involving the disordered water molecule and the supramolecular features presented here provide new possibilities in the design of functional materials and should also help us to gain a deeper understanding of the processes by which molecules recognize biological targets." .

A detailed understanding of Anopheles gambiae GST (Aggst1-2) requires an accurate structure, which has not yet been determined. A high quality model structure of Aggst1-2 was constructed using homology modeling and the ligand–protein complex was obtained by the docking method. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out to study conformational changes and to calculate binding free energy. The results of MD simulation indicate that Aggst1-2 undergoes small conformational changes after ligands dock to the protein, which facilitate the catalytic reaction. An essential hydrogen bond was found between the sulfur atom of glutathione (GSH) and the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group in Ser9, which was in good agreement with experimental data. A π–π interaction between Phe204 and CDNB ligand was also found. This interaction seems to be important in stabilization of the ligand. Further study of binding free energy decomposition revealed a van der Waals interaction between two ligands that may play a key role in nucleophilic addition reaction.

This inhibitor consists of four aromatic/conjugated fragments: a benzimidazole, a methylbenzene, a carboxythiourea, and a benzene-linker dioxane, and these fragments are all linked together by conjugated bonds. The calculations use the SIBFA polarizable molecular mechanics procedure. Prior to docking simulations, it is essential to ensure that variations in the ligand conformational energy upon rotations around its six main-chain torsional bonds are correctly represented (as compared to high-level ab initio quantum chemistry, QC). This is done in two successive calibration stages and one validation stage. In the latter, the minima identified following independent stepwise variations of each of the six main-chain torsion angles are used as starting points for energy minimization of all the torsion angles simultaneously. Single-point QC calculations of the minimized structures are then done to compare their relative energies ΔE conf to the SIBFA ones. We compare three different methods of deriving the multipoles and polarizabilities of the central, most critical moiety of the inhibitor: carboxythiourea (CTU). The representation that gives the best agreement with QC is the one that includes the effects of the mutual polarization energy E pol between the amide and thioamide moieties. This again highlights the critical role of this contribution. The implications and perspectives of these findings are discussed." .

This is a concise version of the complex chemical reactions of muscle activation and deactivation in sarcoplasm. The second model is similar to the first, but calcium-troponin reactions are simplified into two nonlinear rates functions.

The results are compared with those from Hartree-Fock and MP2 correlation energy calculations. Whereas the geometries of the structures are well described at all approximation levels, there are considerable discrepancies of the stability orders. Contrary to the Hartree-Fock calculations, the correlation energy methods provide the more compact structures with intramolecular hydrogen bonds distinctly favoured over extended conformations when comparing the energy differences. However, due to considerable compensation of correlation energy and entropy contributions, the stability order at the Gibbs free energy level closely corresponds to that at the Hartree-Fock level." .

The attention is focused on four octadentate N-carbamoylmethyl-substituted tetraazamacrocycles of various ring sizes ranging from 8 to 14 atoms associated with the PbII cation. The theoretical study illustrates the geometrical constraints imposed by the ring structure which limits the spatial development of the lone pair but without fully preventing it. For a given coordination number, the lone pair activity is strongly correlated to the geometry of the ligand and in particular to the size of the cage that the ligand forms around the PbII cation. Some limitations of the theoretical tools used are also evidenced, among them the necessity to sample around a critical point instead of just analyzing its nature. In the case of the laplacian of the electron density, a visualization method is introduced to moderate the results based only on the nature of a critical point. These limitations should also be related to the difficulty to extend the lone pair concept for the heaviest atoms of the classification." .

Simulation results show that: with increasing number of surfactant molecules, the average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds per surfactant molecule in the monolayer decreases, but the structures forming the intramolecular hydrogen bonds still play a dominant role; the hydrophobic part of the alkyl tail chain, especially the decyl substituent on the third carbon atom in the benzene ring, becomes straighter, and more ordered towards the external interface at higher surfactant coverage; two-dimensional radial distribution functions can describe the characteristic of surfactant aggregate structures and highlight the decane phase effect on the orientation of the hydrophobic part of the surfactant; the surfactant molecules readily form long-range hydrogen bonded structures.

Operating principle of these sensors is based on measuring the electrical impedance of piezoelectric layer attached to the base cantilever. While most of studies in this area have focused on sensitivity improvement by minimizing the dimensions of the base cantilever, in this paper, effect of modifying the cross-section shape of the cantilever on enhancing the detection sensitivity of these sensors has been studied. To this end, a new PEMC sensor with I-shaped cross-section was proposed. Performance of this sensor in detecting the tiny masses added on the cantilever tip and also detecting the liquid level changes has been explored by theoretical modelling, finite element simulations and via experiments. The achieved results were compared with the detection sensitivities of the sensor with the same dimensions but rectangular-shaped cross section. Theoretical and simulation results were in good agreement with experimental outcomes. By changing the cross section of the base cantilever from rectangular-shaped to I-shaped, mass detection and liquid level detection sensitivities achieved via experiments, increased up to 2.04 and 3.75 times, respectively." .

The refined pharmacophore model was able to discriminate the non-zinc binding inhibitors of MMP-8 with respect to other inhibitors. Hence this study proposes a combined structure- and ligand-based pharmacophore model that is suitable for retrieving the novel inhibitors of MMP-8.

All the molecular structures, vibrational properties, and the intrinsic reaction coordinates were determined with B3LYP/6-311G(d,p). The non-dynamic electronic correlations were examined with the CASSCF dominant configurations. The energies and the potential energy profiles were refined with accurate model chemistry G3(MP2). Rate constants were determined using the CVT method over the temperature range 200–2000 K. It was found that in addition to the side chain H-abstraction, the ring H-abstraction reactions are also possible. The side chain H-abstraction rate constant is in very good agreement with the available experiments and has a non-Arrhenius characteristic. Nevertheless, all the ring H-abstractions follow the Arrhenius behavior well. The over-all reaction was found to have a complex reaction mechanism in which the side chain H-abstraction is dominant below 700 K while the ring H-abstractions are competitive above 800 K. The approximate apparent activation energies E app are 15.5 and 66.4 kJ mol-1 at 300–700 K and 800–2000 K, respectively.

Pyrimidine is an interesting π-electron heterocyclic aromatic system which acts as the building block of many nucleic acid bases. The hydrogen bonds associated with the 2, 4, and 6-substituted pyrimidine and its hydrogen sulfate anion are considered for this current work. The experimental and computational evidence for the strength of these intra and intermolecular hydrogen are determined using vibrational spectra and quantum chemical calculations. Thus the effect of hydrogen bonding on the title compound is studied using its geometrical parameters, interaction energies, and vibrational spectra. Aromaticity and charge transfer studies have been performed to ascertain the aromatic behavior of the molecule. The PES scan studies have been done by varying the bond length to ascertain the protonation process of the compound. The IR spectral red shift (∼100 cm−1), blue shift (∼97 cm−1) and broadening of the polar stretching peaks shows the inter and intramolecular hydrogen bonding strength. Bond length alternation of proton donors along with the enormous interaction energies (∼0.5–150 kJ mol-1) between the lone pair and proton donors provides clear evidence for this hydrogen bonding. The charge transfer due to the methyl substitutions which enhances the possibility of hydrogen bonding has been discussed.

The major enhancement to the IZMIRAN model developed in this study is the use of a new loss rate of O+(4S) ions as a result of new high-temperature flowing afterglow measurements of the rate coefficients K1 and K2 for the reactions of O+(4S) with N2 and O2. The deviations from the Boltzmann distribution for the first five vibrational levels of O2(v) were calculated, and the present study suggests that these deviations are not significant. It was found that the difference between the non-Boltzmann and Boltzmann distribution assumptions of O2(v) and the difference between ion and neutral temperature can lead to an increase of up to about 3% or a decrease of up to about 4% of the calculated NmF2 as a result of a respective increase or a decrease in K2. The IZMIRAN model reproduces major features of the data. We found that the inclusion of vibrationally excited N2(v > 0) and O2(v > 0) in the calculations improves the agreement between the calculated NmF2 and the data on 6, 9, and 10 April. However, both the daytime and nighttime densities are reproduced by the IZMIRAN model without the vibrationally excited nitrogen and oxygen on 8 and 11 April better than the IZMIRAN model with N2(v > 0) and O2(v > 0). This could be due to possible uncertainties in model neutral temperature and densities, EUV fluxes, rate coefficients, and the flow of ionization between the ionosphere and plasmasphere, and possible horizontal divergence of the flux of ionization above the station. Our calculations show that the increase in the O+ + N2 rate factor due to N2(v > 0) produces a 5–36% decrease in the calculated daytime peak density. The increase in the O+ + O2 loss rate due to vibrationally excited O2 produces 8–46% reductions in NmF2. The effects of vibrationally excited O2 and N2 on N e and T e are most pronounced during the daytime." .

As electron-hole interactions are important aspects in the regard of such property, a computationally inexpensive method to predict the coupling between these quasi-particles is highly desired. In this work, we propose a hybrid methodology of combining Uncoupled Monte Carlo Simulations (UMC) and Density functional Theory (DFT) methodologies to obtain a good compromise between computational feasibility and accuracy. As a first step in considering a Pentacene crystal, we describe its unit cell: the Pentacene Dimer. Because many conformations can be encountered for the dimer and considering the complexity of the system, we make use of UMC in order to find the most probable structures and relative orientations for the Pentacene-Pentacene complex. Following, we carry out electronic structure calculations in the scope of DFT with the goal of describing the electron-hole coupling on the most probable configurations obtained by UMC. The comparison of our results with previously reported data on the literature suggests that the methodology is well suited for describing transfer integrals of organic semiconductors. The observed accuracy together with the smaller computational cost required by our approach allows us to conclude that such methodology might be an important tool towards the description of systems with higher complexity." .

Acetophenone (AP) is a major residue in PE and is considered one of the causes of insulation deterioration. However, the physicochemical explanation of the influence of AP is still unknown. Therefore, in the present study, the behavior of AP molecules in amorphous PE was investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum chemical calculation. First, the basic properties of the AP molecule were evaluated from the viewpoint of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), molecular orbitals, and energy levels. Subsequently, an amorphous PE system containing AP molecules was studied using MD simulations. The results clearly indicate that AP does not greatly change the density and radius of gyration of amorphous PE. Quantum computations were performed using a part of the structure obtained from the MD simulations, suggesting that AP acts as a trap site in amorphous PE. It was also revealed that under the external electric field, the total density of state (DOS) changes with a dependence on the applied direction.

A key aspect concerning their biomedical applications is how they interact with proteins from molecular levels, which is still poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the structural and thermodynamic basis of the interactions between two pharmacologically relevant fullerene derivatives and human serum albumin (HSA) using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations. Our results demonstrate that fullerenes steadily bind with HSA at the interfacial cavity formed by subdomains IIA and IIIA. In agreement with available experimental data, our simulations show that the global structure of HSA becomes more compact in the presence of fullerene, while local structural dynamics of the binding cavity behaves diversely depending on the chemical properties of bound fullerenes. Binding free energy calculations confirmed that the interactions between fullerenes and HSA are dominantly stabilized by van der Waals forces and they further allowed the identification of key residues involved in fullerene binding.

(2) Instead of the heat of transition, the difference in the heats of fusion may generally be used (heat-of-fusion rule). (3) If a modification is less dense, it is less stable at absolute zero.

We also show that, in a framework of structure-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (SB-QSAR) methodology, the QM/MM–PB/SA-derived energy terms could be used as a good descriptor to characterize the interaction profile of OppA with peptides and correlate pretty well with the experimentally measured affinities of the binding." .

DFD possesses no dipole moment in the ground electronic state S 0 but has an experimental dipole of 1.5 ± 0.2 debye (D) in its first singlet excited state S 1. These observations have been ascribed to the shift in electron population between orbitals (Frenking et al. in J Comp Chem 28:117–126, 2007). An alternative real-space explanation is presented, which shows that the vanishing dipole moment in S 0 results from a balance between a charge transfer contribution due to the flow of charge between atoms and an atomic polarization term due to the non-sphericity of atoms in molecules. This balance is altered in S 1. This orbital-free description is shown to be consistent with an incipient dissociation of DFD to :CF2 and N2 upon excitation. The Laplacian of the electron density and the molecular electrostatic potential exhibit significant reorganization on excitation, mirroring one another, with consequential changes in chemical reactivity. Conforming to Hund’s rule, the lowest excited state is a triplet state (T 1), and the next level, the one examined in this work, is the first singlet excited state (S 1) with vertical excitation energies of 2.81 and 3.99 eV, respectively. The calculated dipole moment magnitudes (in D) are 0.05 (S 0), 0.973 (T 1), and 0.969 (S 1) all pointing their negative end toward the nitrogens. The maximal average lifetime of S 1 (in absence of non-radiative de-excitation) is ca. 30 ps, sufficient for its slowest vibrational normal mode to complete 400 oscillations. From a comparison of Hartree–Fock, MP2, QCISD, CCSD, and TD-DFT/B3LYP calculations with experiment (all using an aug-cc-pVTZ basis set), for both the ground and excited states of DFD, the method of choice appears to be QCISD, the one used in this work." .

Both receptors have five distinctive NH and OH hydrogen donor atoms. All receptor–anion complexes are characterized by five intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The binding free energies are strongly influenced by a dielectric medium, and the solvation effect alters the trend of anion binding to the receptor. The calculated order of anion binding affinity for the receptor in chloroform, H2PO4− > AcO− > F− > Cl− > HSO4− > NO3−, is in excellent accord with experimental findings. The overall order of binding affinity is attributed to the basicity of the anion, the effect of solvation, and the number of proton acceptors available. Calculations of the NMR and UV-vis spectra strongly support the experimental characterization of the receptor–anion complexes. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of selected receptor–anion complexes were also carried out.

Different connector effects are taken into account by choosing IRMOF-1(Be) (IRMOF-1 with Zn replaced by Be), and two high explosive molecules: 1,3,5-trinitro-s-triazine (RDX) and triacetone triperoxide (TATP). The key interaction features (structural, electronic and energetic) of selected contaminants were analyzed by means of density functional calculations. The interaction of RDX and TATP with different IRMOF-1(Be) fragments is studied. The results show that physisorption is favored and occurs due to hydrogen bonding, which involves the C-H groups of both molecules and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of IRMOF-1(Be). Additional stabilization of RDX and TATP arises from weak electrostatic interactions. Interaction with IRMOF-1(Be) fragments leads to polarization of the target molecules. Of the molecular configurations we have studied, the Be-O-C cluster connected with six benzene linkers (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, BDC), possesses the highest binding energy for the studied explosives (-16.4 kcal mol-1 for RDX and -12.9 kcal mol-1 for TATP). The main difference was discovered to be in the preferable adsorption site for adsorbates (RDX above the small and TATP placed above the big cage). Based on these results, IRMOF-1 can be suggested as an effective material for storage and also for separation of similar explosives. Hydration destabilizes most of the studied adsorption systems by 1-3 kcal mol-1 but it leads to the same trend in the binding strength as found for the non-hydrated complexes.

In this article, by using density functional theory (DFT) methods, we have studied the effects of the chemical functionalization of graphenes via aryne cycloaddition on its properties. We found that the adsorption of an isolated aryne group on the graphene sheet is very weak with the adsorption energy of −0.204 eV, even though two new single C-C interactions are formed between the aryne group and the graphene. However, the interaction of graphene with the aryne group can be greatly strengthened by (i) substituting the H-atoms in aryne group with F-, Cl-, -NO2 (electron-withdrawing capability), or CH3-group (electron-donating capability), and (ii) increasing the coverage of the adsorbed aryne groups on the graphene sheet. As expected, the strongest bonding is found on the graphene edges, in which the adsorbed aryne groups prefer to be far away from each other. Interestingly, chemical functionalization with aryne groups leads to an opening of the band gap of graphene, which is dependent on the coverage of the adsorbed aryne groups.

Recent applications have used cluster models much larger than before which have given new modeling insights. One important and rather surprising feature is the fast convergence with cluster size of the energetics of the reactions. Even for reactions with significant charge separation it has in some cases been possible to obtain full convergence in the sense that dielectric cavity effects from outside the cluster do not contribute to any significant extent. Direct comparisons between quantum mechanics (QM)-only and QM/molecular mechanics (MM) calculations for quite large clusters in a case where the results differ significantly have shown that care has to be taken when using the QM/MM approach where there is strong charge polarization. Insights from the methods used, generally hybrid density functional methods, have also led to possibilities to give reasonable error limits for the results. Examples are finally given from the most extensive study using the cluster model, the one of oxygen formation at the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II." .

The approach was very successful. Nowadays, quantum mechanical ab initio electronic structure calculations are possible and from their results PESs can be constructed.

In the investigated temperature range, the fluorescence spectra of both toluene and naphthalene show a significant red-shift, whereas the fluorescence lifetime decreases with increasing temperature, more pronounced for toluene than for naphthalene. Increasing the total pressure of either N2 or CO2 from atmospheric to 10 bar leads to an increase by about 20 % (naphthalene at 373 K) and a decrease by 60 % (toluene at 575 K) in fluorescence lifetimes, respectively.

In this review, we briefly discuss several relevant issues: the need to develop a “multi-scale” generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) for the analysis of chemical events in large trans-membrane proteins, approaches to validate such a protocol, and the importance of improving the flexibility of QM/MM Hamiltonian. Several recent studies of model and realistic protein systems are also discussed to help put the discussions into context. Collectively, these studies suggest that the QM/MM-GSBP framework based on an approximate density functional theory (SCC-DFTB) as QM holds the promise to strike the proper balance between computational efficiency, accuracy and generality.

To do this, pharmacophore models presenting different sets of the hotspots of cellular receptor CD4 for its interaction with gp120 were generated. These models were used as the templates for identification of CD4-mimetic candidates by the pepMMsMIMIC screening platform. Complexes of these candidates with gp120 were built by high-throughput ligand docking and their stability was estimated by molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations. As a result, five top hits that exhibited strong attachment to the two well-conserved hotspots of the gp120 CD4-binding site were selected for the final analysis. In analogy to CD4, the identified compounds make hydrogen bonds with Asp-368gp120 and multiple van der Waals contacts with the gp120 residues that bind to Phe-43CD4, resulting in destruction of the critical interactions of gp120 with Phe-43CD4 and Arg-59CD4. The complexes of the CD4-mimetic candidates with gp120 show relative conformational stability within the molecular dynamics simulations and expose the high percentage occupancies of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, in line with the data on the binding free energy calculations. In light of these findings, the identified compounds are considered as good scaffolds for the development of new functional antagonists of viral entry with broad HIV-1 neutralization." .

The first one is based on an abstract formulation of two sorts of molecular reactions: enforcing and forbidden. The enforcing reactions are reactions that may happen, and are allowed to happen, in a given molecular system, while the forbidden reactions are detrimental for the system (e.g., leading to “incorrect” computations) and thus must be avoided. Hence computations in such a forbidding-enforcing system are driven by enforcing conditions (describing the enforcing reactions), but they are restrained by forbidding conditions (describing the forbidden reactions). The second model, called molecular landscapes, is geared towards the display of solutions. It consists of organisms (computing agents) functioning in a common environment which plays the role of a common communication medium for the organisms. When a molecular landscapes system works on a specific computational problem, each organism is working on this problem. But as soon as an organismM will get its solution to the problem, it modifies the environment, which from this moment on supports only the organisms that get the same solution asM. This is done through a selection mechanism that relies on selective competition which “kills” the losers. Since this selection mechanism interacts with the solution mechanism from the moment that computations are initiated, it can drastically increase the density of good solutions (molecules). In this way the molecular landscapes system achieves the goal of displaying solutions." .

The binding energy between the macrocycles increases from the center to the periphery of the complex and can be >60 kcal mol−1 for macrocycles containing 14 and 19 repeating units. It has been demonstrated that additional electrostatic interactions originating from the asymmetric electron density distribution observed when comparing the concave and convex macrocycle sides are responsible for the high binding energies in these Russian doll complexes. Oxidation or reduction of the Russian doll complexes creates polarons that are delocalized across the complexes. In the case of polaron cations, most of the polarons are localized at the macrocycle with the smallest ionization potential; for polaron anions, the negative charge is localized across the outer rings of the complex. Because anion polarons are more delocalized than cation polarons, the relaxation energies of the polaron anions were found to be smaller than those of the polaron cations.

Although DHFRL1 have high sequence homology with human DHFR, dihydrofolate (DHF) exhibits a lowered binding affinity to DHFRL1 and the corresponding molecular mechanism is still unknown. To address this question, we studied the binding of DHF to DHFRL1 and DHFR by using molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, to investigate the role the 24th residue of DHFR/DHFRL1 plays in DHF binding, R24W DHFRL1 mutant was also studied. The van der Waals interaction are more crucial for the total DHF binding energies, while the difference between the DHF binding energies of human DHFR and DHFRL1 can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction and the polar desolvation free energy. More specifically, lower DHF affinity to DHFRL1 can be mainly attributed to the reduction of net electrostatic interactions of residues Arg32 and Gln35 of DHFRL1 with DHF as being affected by Arg24. The side chain of Arg24 in DHFRL1 can extend deeply into the binding sites of DHF and NADPH, and disturb the DHF binding by steric effect, which rarely happens in human DHFR and R24W DHFRL1 mutant. Additionally, the conformation of loop I in DHFRL1 was also studied in this work. Interestingly, the loop conformation resemble to normal closed state of Escherichia coli DHFR other than the closed state of human DHFR.

In the simulations, shocks were propagated along the [010], [001], [210], [100], [111], and [102] orientations of crystal RDX at initial particle velocity Up in the range of 1∼4 km/s. For shocks at Up ≤ 2 km/s, local stacking fault and molecular conformational change can only cause marginal temperature and pressure increase without molecular decomposition. As shocks increase to Up ≥ 2.5 km/s, rupture of N-NO2 bond accompanied by partial HONO elimination dominates the main chemical reactions at the initial stage. The ordering of the follow-up consumption of NO2 and ring-breaking rate is directly consistent with that of increasing rate in temperature and pressure. The (210) and (100) planes are more sensitive to shocks in temperature and pressure profiles than the (111) plane, which agrees well with experimental observations and theoretical results in the literature.

A novel and relatively simple methodology has been developed and applied to purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) complexed with a fluorescent ligand — formycin A (FA). FRET occurs between an excited Tyr residue (D*) and FA (A). This study aims to interpret experimental data that, among others, suggests the absence of FRET for the PNPF159A mutant in complex with FA, based on novel theoretical methodology. MD simulations for the protein molecule containing D*, and complexed with A, are carried out. Interactions of D* with its molecular environment are accounted by including changes of the ESP charges in S1, compared to S0, and computed at the SCF-CI level. FRET probability W F depends on the inverse six-power of the D*-A distance, R da . The orientational factor 0 < k2 < 4 between D* and A is computed and included in the analysis. Finally W F is time-averaged over the MD trajectories resulting in its mean value. The red-shift of the tyrosinate anion emission and thus lack of spectral overlap integral and thermal energy dissipation are the reasons for the FRET absence in the studied mutants at pH 7 and above. The presence of the tyrosinate anion results in a competitive energy dissipation channel and red-shifted emission, thus in consequence in the absence of FRET. These studies also indicate an important role of the phenyl ring of Phe159 for FRET in the wild-type PNP, which does not exist in the Ala159 mutant, and for the effective association of PNP with FA. In a more general context, our observations point out very interesting and biologically important properties of the tyrosine residue in its excited state, which may undergo spontaneous deprotonation in the biomolecular systems, resulting further in unexpected physical and/or biological phenomena. Until now, this observation has not been widely discussed in the literature." .

In doing so, a wide repertoire of methods is currently being explored for conducting interaction design research through a material lens. These methods range from material studies and studies in material cultures to methods borrowed from craft, designerly approaches to interaction design, sketching in hardware approaches, and so on. While we acknowledge these important attempts to approach the material dimensions of interaction design, it should also be noted that there is a lack of more systematic studies of methods that are, can be, or have been applied within HCI and interaction design to specifically explore interaction design through a material lens. So, there is a need for a methodology that acts as a guideline to material-centered interaction design research. In this paper, we address this need. More specifically, this paper contributes to this current state by presenting a methodology for methodological explorations in material-centered interaction design research. The development of this proposed methodology takes a point of departure in the methods available and applied so far. With grounding in design theory, this paper organizes these methods into a four-dimensional structure to guide deliberate choices of methods in different phases of interaction design research projects—that is, it serves as a framework for research design. The organizing structure for the proposed methodology follows the simple dialectic tradition in design to work back and forth between details and wholeness, materials and textures. In this paper, we describe the four dimensions of our framework and how these can be useful to guide research design aimed at advancing our understanding of the material dimensions of HCI. We illustrate how the proposed structure can be practically useful—both in advancing our studies of interaction design through a material lens and show how it brings us back to the roots of our profession—that is, back to a focus on the materials, the fundamental components of any computational composition." .

In this work, these three zymogen forms (subtypes A1, A2 and B) are investigated by means of 15-ns molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis to shed light on their dynamic/conformational behaviors that may be relevant to those experimental observations. The simulations revealed that proCPA (both A1 and A2) shows different conformational behavior from proCPB: the former undergoes a major conformational change (opening and closing), and the latter exhibits only a minor conformational change (remaining closed throughout the simulation). Differences center on the interface between the globular moiety of the pro-segment and the catalytic domain. Analysis of the trajectories demonstrates the importance of hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges in stabilizing the zymogen structures and shows different hydrogen-bond patterns between proCPA and proCPB: the former shows fewer strong H-bonds formed between the globular domain and the catalytic domain.

In this way the existence of an intermediate orthorhombic paraelectric phase, characterized by the rotation of the TaO6 octahedra, is demonstrated without using any explicit experimental data as input. The local polarization dynamics does not provide any indication of a relaxation process near the ferroelectric transition. Finally, dielectric and piezoelectric coefficients along crystallographic directions are investigated." .

Catalysis of proton abstraction from nonacidic carbon atoms adjacent to a carbonyl or carboxylate group is a fundamental reaction in enzymology that has been extensively studied during the last few decades. Enzymes catalyzing these reactions, which normally involve labile enolic intermediates, need to overcome large pK a differences between the reacting groups as well as high intrinsic free-energy barriers. Here, we present an overview of results from recent computer simulation studies of keto-enol isomerization reactions catalyzed by the enzymes glyoxalase I, triosephopsphate isomerase and ketosteroid isomerase. For all three enzymes it is found that electrostatic stabilization of the transient enolate intermediates, either by charge–charge interactions or by hydrogen bonding, accounts for the main part of the activation free-energy barrier reduction. Another catalytic effect observed in all cases is the reduction of the reorganization energy by the enzyme active site. Some other factors that have been proposed to be important for these reactions are also discussed and evaluated." .

Twenty simulation systems were designed to evaluate the interactions of drug mixtures with a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid bilayer membrane, in the presence of water molecules. In the course of simulations, various properties of the systems were investigated, including drug location, diffusion and mass distribution in the membrane; drug orientation; the lipid chain disorder as a result of drug penetration into the DMPC membrane; the number of hydrogen bonds; and drug surface area. According to the results obtained, combined drugs penetrate deeper into the DMPC lipid bilayer membrane, and the lipid chains remain ordered. Also, the combined PEGylated drugs, at a combination ratio of 1:1:1, enhance drug penetration into the DMPC membrane, reduce drug agglomeration, orient the drug in a proper angle for easy penetration into the membrane, and decrease undesirable lipotoxicity due to distorted membrane self-assembly and thickness.

However would this kind of nanocompounds be able to encapsulate dianions and dications? This would be very interesting from an experimental point of view, since it would allow the isolation of such divalent ions. Moreover, the resulting endohedral complexes would serve as building blocks for new cluster-assembled materials, with enhanced stability arising from the electrostatic interaction between the incarcerated ions. In this work we have studied the structure and stability of (X@(CdS) i ) ±2 with X = Be, Mg, Ca, O, S, Se and i=9, 12, 15, 16 on the basis of Density Functional Theory and Quantum Molecular Dynamics simulations. Most of the nanoclusters are found to trap both chalcogen and alkaline earth atoms. Furthermore, the chalcogen doped clusters are calculated to be both thermodynamically and thermally stable. However, only a few of alkaline earth metal doped structures are predicted to be thermally stable. Therefore, the charge of the dopant atom appears to be crucial in the endohedral doping. Additionally, the absorption spectra of the title compounds have been simulated by means of Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations.

For this purpose we used quantum chemical (the AM1 semi-empirical method) and chemometric methods.

The chemometric methods used were Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method. The chemometric analysis showed that an electronic property (energy of LUMO), a hydrophobic property (log P), a steric property (volume of the substituent at the C4 position) and a topological property (Lovasz–Pelikan index) were the most important variables for the separation between the psychoactive and psychoinactive compounds.

For decades multipole moments were only used in the context of the rigid body approximation but recently it has become possible to combine multipolar electrostatics with molecular flexibility. The program DL_MULTI, which is derived from DL_POLY_2, includes efficient multipolar Ewald functionality up to the hexadecapole moment but the code is restricted to rigid bodies. The incorporation of flexibility into DL_MULTI would cause too large an impact on its architecture whereas the package DL_POLY_4 offers a more attractive and sustainable route to handle multipolar electrostatics. This package inherently handles molecular flexibility, which warrants sufficiently transferable atoms or atoms that are “knowledgeable” about their chemical environment (as made possible by quantum chemical topology and machine learning). DL_MULTI uses the spherical multipole formalism, which is mathematically more involved than the Cartesian one but which is more compact. DL_POLY_4 uses the computationally efficient method of smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) summation, which has also been parallellized by others. Therefore, combining the strengths of DL_POLY_4 and DL_MULTI poses the challenge of merging SPME with multipolar electrostatics by spherical multipole. In an effort to recast as clearly as possible the principles behind DL_MULTI, its key equations have been reformulated by the more streamlined route involving the algebra of complex numbers, and some of these equations’ peculiarities clarified. This article explores theoretically the repercussions of the merging of SPME with spherical multipole electrostatics (as implemented in DL_MULTI). Difficulties in design and implementation of possible future code are discussed." .

In this work, the physicochemical properties of six thiophene-based corrosion inhibitors (2-acetylthiophene (AT), 2-formylthiophene (FT), thiophene (Th), 2-methyl-3-thiophenthiol (MTT), 2-pentylthiophene (PT), and 2-thenylthiol (TT)) were systematically studied by performing ab initio calculations at the MP2(full)/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory. Adsorption of the inhibitors on an iron surface was also modeled by investigating the interactions of these molecules with a tetrahedral Fe4 cluster using the B3LYP method and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set or the LanL2DZ basis set. The calculated results indicate that the nature of the substituent group present has a significant impact on the geometric and electronic structures of the thiophene-based molecules. The presence of an electron-donating group causes the electron density in the thiophene ring to increase, while the presence of an electron-withdrawing group has the opposite effect. Accordingly, the examined molecules were ranked in order of corrosion inhibition efficiency as follows: FT ≈ AT < Th < PT < TT < MTT. The calculated binding energies demonstrated that the π−1Fe and π−3Fe interaction configurations dominated over the S−1Fe configuration for all the compounds. Natural bond orbital analysis revealed that all of the thiophene-based compounds donate electrons from the π and σ orbitals of high-electron-density regions such as C2−S1−C5 and C3−C4 or from two lone pairs on S1 to the Fe4 cluster. Although electron donation from the thiophene-based compounds is always the dominant electron transfer process during adsorption, the backdonation of electrons from the 3d orbital of iron to σ*-antibonding orbitals of the thiophene compounds is also observed, especially in the case of π−3Fe parallel adsorption.

The influence of the theoretical level and basis set on the accuracy in calculating both proton and carbon NMR spectra of a large number of heterocyclic molecules is assessed using a linear regression method, thus omitting the need for a reference (as﻿ a potential source of error). The best theoretical levels employed herein (GIAO-PBE0/6-31G(d)//ωB97xD/6-31G(d) or GIAO-ωB97xD/6-31G(d)//ωB97xD/6-31G(d)) approach the accuracy of the most elaborate benchmark-quality calculations. One interesting observation is an unexplained distortion of the derived chemical shifts when an internal reference is used: It leads to larger relative shifts and deviations when the “quality” (size) of the basis set employed is increased. This effect can be corrected by using simple linear regression, but a lack of a systematic correlation between the quality of the basis set and the accuracy of the calculated shifts can still be observed; in fact, very good results can be achieved with modest basis sets.

However, its application on distributed computing grids is limited by the heterogeneity of this environment. In this study, we propose a REMD implementation referred to as greedy REMD (gREMD) suitable for computations on heterogeneous grids. To decentralize replica management, gREMD utilizes a precomputed schedule of exchange attempts between temperatures. Our comparison of gREMD against standard REMD suggests four main conclusions. First, gREMD accelerates grid REMD simulations by as much as 40 %. Second, gREMD increases CPU utilization rates in grid REMD by up to 60 %. Third, we argue that gREMD is expected to maintain approximately constant CPU utilization rates and simulation wall-clock times with the increase in the number of replicas. Finally, we show that gREMD correctly implements the REMD algorithm and reproduces the conformational ensemble of a short peptide sampled in our previous standard REMD simulations. We believe that gREMD can find its place in large-scale REMD simulations on heterogeneous computing grids. Graphical AbstractStandard replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) typically requires all replicas to complete prior to initiation of the replica exchange protocol. Greedy REMD decentralizes this process and therefore only requires a replica and its predetermined exchange partner to have finished simulations prior to initiating replica exchange. Because greedy REMD reduces the idle time associated with replica exchange tasks, it becomes particularly well suited for performing REMD on heterogeneous distributed computing environments." .

The calculations use our existing type 3 copper force field for the peroxido-bridged [Cu2O2]2+ unit which is here translated from MMFF into the AMBER format together with a new charge scheme. The protein secondary and tertiary structures are not significantly altered by removing the ‘caddie’ protein, ORF378, which must be bound to tyrosinase before crystals will grow. A comprehensive principal component analysis of the Cartesian coordinates from the final 8 ns shows that the protein backbone is relatively rigid. However, the significant butterfly fold of the [Cu2O2]2+ moiety observed in the X-ray structure, presumably due to the caddie protein tyrosine at the active site, is absent in the simulations. LFMD gives a clear and persistent distinction between equatorial and axial Cu–N distances, with the latter about 0.2 Å longer and remaining syn to each other. However, the two coordination spheres display important differences. LFMD simulations of the symmetric model complex [μ-η2:μ2-O2{Cu(Meim)3}2]2+ (Meim is 5-methyl-1H-imidazole) provide a mechanism for syn–anti interchange of axial ligands which suggests, in combination with the old experimental X-ray data, the new LFMD simulations and traditional coordination chemistry arguments, that His54 on CuA is ‘insipiently axial’ and that a combination of a butterfly distortion of the [Cu2O2]2+ group and a rotation of the CuA(His)3 moiety converts the vacant, initially axial, binding site on CuA into a much more favourable equatorial site." .

In this work, bovine serum albumin (BSA) became a subject as a model protein for analyzing the inhibitory mechanism of flavonoids, known as natural BSA glycation inhibitors in the early stage of glycation. MethodsFirstly, for theoretical study, the three-dimensional model of BSA structure was generated by homology modeling and refined through molecular dynamic simulation. Secondly, several validation methods (statistical assessment methods and also neural network methods) by simultaneous docking study were employed for insurance about accuracy of our simulation. Then docking studies were performed for visualizing the relation between flavonoids’ binding sites and BSA glycation sites besides, the correlation analyzes between calculated binding energy and reported experimental inhibitory IC50 values of the flavonoids set, was considered to explore their molecular inhibitory mechanism. ResultsThe quality assessment methods and simultaneous docking studies on interaction of quercetin (as the most studied flavonoids) with BSA and Human serum albumin (HAS), confirm the accuracy of simulation and the second stage of docking results which were in close agreement with experimental observations, suggest that the potential residues in flavonoids binding sites (which were place neighbor of tryptophan 212 within 5Ǻ) cannot be considered as one of glycation sites. ConclusionsBased on the results, flavonoids don’t participate in inhibitory interference mechanism, and also, the differentiation between complexes of flavonoids with BSA and HSA could destroy the speculation of using them as an exchangeable model protein in study of serum albumin and flavonoids interactions." .

The proton transfer mechanism after a vertical ionisation is followed in detail. Structural and energetic calculations are performed near the Hartree-Fock self consistent field (HF-SCF) limit; all open shell calculations are spin restricted (RHF). The calculations reconcile experimental results from thermochemical and photoionisation measurements: discrepancies in the energetics are shown to be due to the probing of different regions of the potential energy surface (PES). For the dynamics calculations, it is impractical to determine a large region of the multidimensional PES and then integrate Newton's equations. The calculations therefore incorporate a quantum mechanical determination of the electronic energy of the system after each time increment while nuclear degrees of freedom are handled classically. In this way, the classical reaction path across the Born-Oppenheimer surface is obtained." .

Metadynamics is a recently introduced free energy modelling technique that enhances sampling of configurational (e.g. conformational) space within a molecular dynamics simulation. This enhancement is achieved by the addition of a history-dependent bias potential, which drives the system from previously visited regions. Discontinuous metadynamics in the space of essential dynamics eigenvectors (collective motions) has been proposed and tested in conformational change modelling. Here, we present an implementation of two continuous formulations of metadynamics in the essential subspace. The method was performed in a modified version of the molecular dynamics package GROMACS. These implementations were tested on conformational changes in cyclohexane, alanine dipeptide (terminally blocked alanine, Ace-Ala-Nme) and SH3 domain. The results illustrate that metadynamics in the space of essential coordinates can accurately model free energy surfaces associated with conformational changes.

In the simulation, the substrate is modelled as a 3-layer graphene slab, and the transfer layer as layered circle graphene sheets. The top graphene sheet is force to move in a constant velocity. After the sliding motion, the dynamics of the transfer layers showed different dependences on the sliding velocity and the size of the graphene sheet. Only when the sliding motion is low enough and the size is large enough, is the thermal escape motion found. When the sliding speed is too high, the lower layers cannot follow the top sheet. When the graphene sheet is too small, the lower layered structure is broken due to an internal motion. The latter motion is not found during the study using the previous coarse-grained simulation. The size of the layers experimentally observed is the same as this simulation, and when the sliding motion is low enough, a low friction is observed. Thus, a low friction is indicated as a result of the thermal escape motion." .

This study helps to gain better insight into the molecular modeling of PDMS and PTFE, in particular how different approaches affect calculations of surface energy. Current experimental and theoretical data were used to further understand the surface properties of PDMS and PTFE as well as to validate and verify results obtained from the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations (including periodic boundary conditions) and MD simulations. Detailed analysis of the structure and electronic properties (by calculation of the projected density of states) of the bulk and surface models of PDMS and PTFE was performed. The sensitivity of the surface energy calculation of these two polymers to the chemistry and model preparation was indicated. The balance between the molecular density, weight (which also reflects bond orientation in the surface region), bond flexibility, and intramolecular interactions including bond stretching was revealed to govern the results obtained. In modeling, the structural organization of polymer near a given surface (types and number of end groups and broken bonds due to application of different cut offs of the periodic structure) also significantly affects the final results. Besides the structural differences, certain simulation parameters, such the DFT functionals and simulation boxes utilized, play an important role in determining surface energy. The models used here were shown to be sufficient due to their good agreement with experimental and other theoretical data related to surface properties and surface energies." .

In this article we review the experimental and theoretical developments on acetanilide paying particular attention to issues that are still pending.

It was found that NH3 can be preferentially adsorbed on top of the boron atom, with adsorption energy of −12.0 kcal mol−1. The trend of adsorption-energy change can be correlated with the trend of relative electron-withdrawing or -donating capability of the functional groups. The adsorption energies are calculated to be in the range of −1.8 to −14.2 kcal mol−1, and their relative magnitude order is found as follows: H2N(CH2CH3) > H2N(CH3) > NH3 > H2N(CH2COOH) > H2N(CH2CN) > H2N(COOH). Overall, the functionalization of BC2N nanotube with the amino groups results in little change in its electronic properties. The preservation of electronic properties of BC2N coupled with the enhancement of solubility renders their chemical modification with either NH3 or amino functional groups to be a way for the purification of BC2N nanotubes." .

In addition, their potential antioxidant activities were probed through the computation of the (i) bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs), which are related to the hydrogen-atom transfer mechanism (HAT), and (ii) ionization potentials (IPs), which are related to the single-electron transfer mechanism (SET). The BDEs were determined in water to be 83.23 kcal/mol for kaempferol 3-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnoside and 77.49 kcal/mol for quercetin 3-O-α-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1 → 3)-α-L-rhamnoside. The corresponding IPs were obtained for both compounds as 133.38 and 130.99 kcal/mol, respectively. The BDEs and IPs are comparable to those probed for their parental molecules kaempferol and quercetin; this is in marked contrast to previous studies where glycosylation at the 3-position increases the corresponding BDEs, and, hence, decreases subsequent antioxidant activity.

The scheme is thus seamless for calculation of MD atoms. When determining the electronic states of the TB subsystem, instead of the four basic atomic orbitals, hybrid orbitals are employed as bases in TB method and also as representing the action of MD atoms on TB atoms.

Five-membered heteroaromatic rings containing a single group 16 heteroatom were taken into account as the substituents (i.e., furan-2-yl, thiophen-2-yl, selenophen-2-yl, tellurophen-2-yl, and the experimentally as yet unknown polonophen-2-yl). For the resulting ten formaldehyde and thioformaldehyde derivatives, the geometry, energetics, frontier molecular orbitals, dipole moment and polarizability of their molecules were examined in order to establish the effect of ring heteroatom on these properties. Furthermore, these properties were also determined for the molecules in three solvents of low polarity (benzene, chloroform, and dichloromethane) in order to expand our study to include solvent effects. The dipole moment and polarizability of the investigated molecules show regular variations when the ring heteroatom descends through group 16 and the solvent polarity grows. The heteroatom and/or solvent effects on the part of the studied properties are, however, more complex. An attempt is made to rationalize the observed variations in the molecular properties.

Calculations provide evidence for the presence of dipole–dipole C=O⋯C=O intermolecular interactions and support the idea that the molecules distort from their ideal geometries, improving packing in both crystals. The search for minima in the lattice energy of both crystals amongst the more common space groups with Z’ = 1, using a simulated annealing crystal structure prediction procedure followed by lattice energy minimization showed that the observed structure of 3,4,5,6-THP anhydride (Z’ = 2) is the thermodynamically most stable, and allowed us to justify why 3,4,5,6-THP anhydride crystallizes in such a complex structure with 16 molecules in the unit cell. The computational model was successful in predicting the second observed form at 173 K for cis-1,2,3,6-THP anhydride as a polymorph, and could predict several hypothetical structures with Z’ = 1 that appear competitive with the observed structures.

It has been reported that this dynamic process is pH-dependent, that is, hEGFR can be activated by EGF at high pH to form an extended dimer but remains as an inactive monomer at low pH. In this paper, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from the tethered conformation of sECD:EGF complex, at pH 5.0 and 8.5, respectively. Simulation results indicate that sECD:EGF shows different dynamic properties between the two pHs, and the complex may have a higher tendency of activation at pH 8.5. Twenty residues, including 13 histidines, in sECD:EGF have different protonation states between the two pHs (calculated by the H++ server). The charge distribution at pH 8.5 is more favorable for forming an extended conformation toward the active state of sECD than that at pH 5.0. Our study may shed light on the mechanism of pH dependence of hEGFR activation. Graphical abstractpH dependence of ligand-induced human epidermal growth factor receptor activation" .

Over 100 mutations have been identified and found to be in the homodimeric structure of SOD1. The enzyme has to be maintained in its dimeric state for the structural stability and enzymatic activity. From our investigation, we found that the mutations apart from the dimer interface residues are found to affect the dimer stability of protein and hence enhancing the aggregation and misfolding tendency of mutated protein. The homodimeric state of SOD1 is found to be held together by the non-covalent interactions. The molecular dynamics simulation has been used to study the hydrogen bond interactions between the dimer interface residues of the monomers in native and mutated forms of SOD1 in apo- and holo-states. The results obtained by this analysis reveal the fact that the loss of hydrogen bond interactions between the monomers of the dimer is responsible for the reduced stability of the apo- and holo-mutant forms of SOD1. The conformers with dimer interface residues in native and mutated protein obtained by the molecular dynamics simulation is subjected to quantum mechanical study using M052X/6-31G(d) level of theory. The charge transfer between N–H···O interactions in the dimer interface residues were studied. The weak interaction between the monomers of the dimer accounts for the reduced dimerization and enhanced deformation energy in the mutated SOD1 protein." .

In this study we explore the applicability of these descriptors to the analysis of selectivity fields. To this end, we have examined a series of 88 compounds with inhibitory activities against thrombin, trypsin and factor Xa, and the HyPhar results have been compared with 3D-QSAR models reported in the literature. The quantitative models obtained by combining the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the octanol/water partition coefficient yield results that compare well with the predictive potential of standard CoMFA and CoMSIA techniques. The results also highlight the potential of HyPhar descriptors to discriminate the selectivity of the compounds against thrombin, trypsin, and factor Xa. Moreover, the graphical representation of the hydrophobic maps provides a direct linkage with the pattern of interactions found in crystallographic structures. Overall, the results support the usefulness of the QM/MST-based hydrophobic descriptors as a complementary approach for disclosing structure-activity relationships in drug design and for gaining insight into the molecular determinants of ligand selectivity. Graphical AbstractQuantum Mechanical continuum solvation calculations performed with the IEF/PCM-MST method are used to derived atomic hydrophobic descriptors, which are then used to discriminate the selectivity of ligands against thrombin, trypsin and factor Xa. The descriptors provide complementary view to standard 3D-QSAR analysis, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of ligand recognition." .

An effective action, akin to the Gribov–Zwanziger action of the Landau gauge, is obtained which implements the aforementioned restriction. Although originally non-local, this action can be cast in local form by introducing auxiliary fields. As in the case of the Landau gauge, dimension two condensates are generated at the quantum level, giving rise to a refinement of the action which is employed to obtain the tree-level gluon propagator in linear covariant gauges. A comparison of our results with those available from numerical lattice simulations is also provided." .

The first part of this work focuses on gas phase binding energies between beryllium(II) and 2-cyano butadiene (2-CN BD), 3-cyano propene (3-CN P), and simpler models with two separate fragments; acrylonitrile and ethylene. Interactions between beryllium(II) and cyano nitrogen and terminal olefin in the models have been examined in terms of geometrical changes, distribution of charge over the entire π-system, and rehybridization of vinyl carbon orbitals. NMR shieldings and vibrational frequencies probed charge centers and strength of interactions. The six-membered cyclic complexes have planar structures with the rehybridized carbon slightly out of plane (16° in 2-CN BD). G3 results show that in 2-CN BD complex participation of vinyl carbon further stabilizes the cyclic adduct by 16.3 kcal mol−1, whereas, in simpler models, interaction between beryllium(II) and acetonitrile is favorable by 46.4 kcal mol−1 compared with that of ethylene. The terminal vinyl carbon in 2-CN BD rehybridizes to sp 3 with an increase of 7 % of s character to allow interaction with beryllium(II). G4 calculations show that the Be(II) and 2-CN BD complex is more strongly bound than those with Mg(II) and Ca(II) by 98.5 and 139.2 kcal mol−1 −1, respectively. QST2 method shows that the cyclic and acyclic forms of Be(II)-2-CN BD complexes are separated by 12.3 kcal mol−1 barrier height. Overlap population analysis reveals that Ca(II) can be discriminated based on its tendency to form ionic interaction with the receptor models." .

And a two-dimensional (2D) analytical subthreshold current model is presented. The front and the back channel subthreshold currents are effectively derived using the inversion layer current density model which takes the Gaussian doping into account. The accuracy of the model has been verified by 2D numerical device simulations using Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) from Synopsys.

To deal with the exchange-correlation energy the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is invoked. The electron-ion interaction is treated with the pseudopotential method. The GGA with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) functionals together with van der Waals interactions are considered to deal with the composed systems. To investigate the functionalization two main configurations have been explored; in one case the molecule interacts with the boron atom and in the other with the nitrogen atom. Results of the adsorption energies indicate chemisorption in both cases. The total density of states (DOS) displays an energy gap in both cases. The projected DOS indicate that the B-p and N-p orbitals are those that make the most important contribution in the valence band and the H-s and C-p orbitals provide an important contribution in the conduction band to the DOS. Provided that the interactions of the acetylene with the 2D layer modify the structural and electronic properties of the hBN the possibility of structural functionalization using organic molecules may be concluded." .
