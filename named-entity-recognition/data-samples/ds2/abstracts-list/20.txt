Monolingual speakers of English and French and balanced English–French bilinguals tapped along with the beat they perceived in sentences spoken in a stress-timed language, English, and a syllable-timed language, French. All groups of participants tapped more regularly to English than to French utterances. Tapping performance was also influenced by the participants’ native language: English-speaking participants and bilinguals tapped more regularly and at higher metrical levels than did French-speaking participants, suggesting that long-term linguistic experience with a stress-timed language can differentiate speakers’ entrainment to speech rhythm." .

Although the attitudes in literacy education have shifted somewhat toward life-wise instruction for three decades (Oxenham et al. 2002), it seems that the unique potentials of English language classes for enhancing learners’ life qualities have mostly been ignored in English literacy education. In the present study, the authors used an explanatory mixed methods research design to examine Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers’ life-wise language teaching beliefs. The first phase involved the collection of quantitative data via the administration of the Life-Responsive Language Teaching Beliefs Questionnaire to Iranian EFL teachers (N = 192). Analysis of the questionnaire results revealed that among the four underlying factors of life-responsive language teaching (i.e. Life-wise Empowerment, Adaptability Enhancement, Pro-social Development and Life-over-language Preference) teachers tended to underscore the pro-social development of language learners above others. Follow-up face-to-face interviews were carried out with a subsample (N = 7) selected from Phase 1 participants. These interviews were used to identify the types of linguistic-bound or life-responsive teaching practices that L2 teachers experienced. Having added more plausibility to the quantitative results from phase 1, the follow-up qualitative phase uncovered few disparities among L2 teachers regarding the aspects of linguistic-bound or life-responsive language teaching. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed." .

We describe new techniques for large-scale construction of a Chinese–English verb lexicon and we evaluate the coverage and effectiveness of the resulting lexicon. Leveraging off an existing Chinese conceptual database called How Net and a large, semantically rich English verb database, we use thematic-role information to create links between Chinese concepts and English classes. We apply the metrics of recall and precision to evaluate the coverage and effectiveness of the linguistic resources. The results of this work indicate that: (a) we are able to obtain reliable Chinese–English entries both with and without pre-existing semantic links between the two languages; (b) if we have pre-existing semantic links, we are able to produce a more robust lexical resource by merging these with our semantically rich English database; (c) in our comparisons with manual lexicon creation, our automatic techniques were shown to achieve 62% precision, compared to a much lower precision of 10% for arbitrary assignment of semantic links." .

Because of Greek's direct letter-to-sound correspondence, which is unlike the indirect representation of English, the possibility was raised of a greater influence of the phonological code in Greek word recognition. Because Greek is an inflected language, whereas English is a word order language, it was also possible that syntax might influence word recognition patterns in the two languages differentially. These cross-linguistic research questions were investigated within the context of a letter cancellation paradigm. The results provide evidence that readers are sensitive to both the orthographic and the linguistic idiosyncrasies of their language. The results are discussed in terms of the orthographic depth hypothesis and the competition model." .

Three of these are European, and ten African. Of the three European languages, two are connected with the colonial history of Namibia. Namibia was colonized by the Germans from 1884 to 1914 and German is still an important business language in Namibia and the language one hears most frequently among shop-keepers in Windhoek. The South African colonization, which was supposed to be a Trusteeship, lasted until 1990. In this period Afrikaans (a variety of Dutch) became the main official language and the language of instruction from grade 4 upwards. This article deals with the period after Independence and focuses especially on the Namibian languages of African origin. The role of English, a European language without a colonial history in Namibia, and now the official language, is also discussed. How much is the furthering of this language to the detriment of the Namibian languages? The article contains a description of the Namibian languages, the language policy and the status of the languages in Namibian schools. The article builds on a larger consultancy report written by the author." .

Drawing on critical language policy and linguistic anthropology, it unravels how participants in a Nepalese Facebook group construct and reproduce language ideologies that both challenge and impose homogeneity and uniformity. The study shows that Facebook language policing does not always embrace superdiverse conditions such as linguistic heterogeneity and fluidity, but reproduces language ideologies that consistently impose homogeneity. The analysis further shows that monolingual ideologies are reproduced through the iconization of Nepali as the national language and English as the language of technology and the global linguistic marketplace. Such iconization further erases the discourses that support the revitalization and use of minority languages in Facebook and other spaces. The study implies that the ideological contestation in Facebook language policing reflects public debate about politics, ethnicity, and nationalism in the offline context of Nepal." .

This policy over-looks the 13 per cent of the Australian population who already speak a language other than English at home (and a greater number who are second generation immigrants), and ignores the view that it is necessary to foster domestic multiculturalism in order to have fruitful links with other cultures abroad. During the 1980s there have been moves to reinforce the cultural identity of Australians of non-English speaking background, but these have sometimes been half-hearted and do not fully recognise that cultural core values, including language, have to achieve a certain critical mass in order to be sustainable. Without this recognition, semi-assimilation will continue to waste the potential cultural and economic contributions of many citizens, and to lead to frustration and eventual violence. The recent National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia addresses this concern." .

In this article we take the case of Sweden as an illustrative example of the wider disciplinary issues involved in changing the teaching language in this way. By 2008 the use of English in Swedish higher education had risen to such an extent that it had to be regulated at the governmental level and through university language policies. Such policies have attempted to provide generalised pragmatic guidelines for language use across educational programmes. In this paper we argue that such general policies fail to take into consideration fundamental disciplinary differences and their potential impact on language use. We present a theoretical argument about the knowledge structures of disciplines, relating these to the disciplinary literacy goals of educational programmes. We then illustrate our argument using data from an extensive survey carried out at a major Swedish university. We conclude that the disciplinary variation in the use of English can be seen as a product of different knowledge-making practices and educational goals. This conclusion problematises “one-size-fits-all” language policies which only deal with general features of language use and do not allow for discipline-specific adjustments." .

They imply that texts by one author show more similarities in language use than texts between authors. Sociolects, on the other hand, are group-dependent similarities in language use. They imply that texts by a group of authors, for instance in terms of gender or time period, share more similarities within a group than between groups. Although idiolects and sociolects are commonly used terms in the humanities, they have not been investigated a great deal from corpus and computational linguistic points of view. To test several idiolect and sociolect hypotheses a factorial combination was used of time period (Modernism, Realism), gender of author (male, female) and author (Eliot, Dickens, Woolf, Joyce) totaling 16 corresponding literary texts. In a series of corpus linguistic studies using Boolean and vector models, no conclusive evidence was found for the selected idiolect and sociolect hypotheses. In final analyses testing the semantics within each literary text, this lack of evidence was explained by the low homogeneity within a literary text." .

These relationships are: that writing is related to language through the medium of speech, that speech is based on writing, that spoken and written forms of a language are decodable one to the other, that spoken and written language are related only through the single language they represent but cannot be translated one to the other without recourse to the grammar of that language, and that speech and orthography represent distinct languages. The conclusion reached is that the grammars underlying speech and writing are distinct –that they employ different conceptions of morphology and syntax – and thus may be said to represent different languages." .

It is also a region of great historical importance, being a) adjacent to the likely homeland from which Bantu-speaking people migrated across most of sub-Saharan Africa 3000-5000 years ago and b) the location of Calabar, one of the largest centres during the Atlantic slave trade. Over 1000 DNA samples from 24 clans representing speakers of the six most prominent languages in the region were collected and typed for Y-chromosome (SNPs and microsatellites) and mtDNA markers (Hypervariable Segment 1) in order to examine whether there has been substantial gene flow between groups speaking different languages in the region. In addition the Cross River region was analysed in the context of a larger geographical scale by comparison to bordering Igbo speaking groups as well as neighbouring Cameroon populations and more distant Ghanaian communities. ResultsThe Cross River region was shown to be extremely homogenous for both Y-chromosome and mtDNA markers with language spoken having no noticeable effect on the genetic structure of the region, consistent with estimates of inter-language gene flow of 10% per generation based on sociological data. However the groups in the region could clearly be differentiated from others in Cameroon and Ghana (and to a lesser extent Igbo populations). Significant correlations between genetic distance and both geographic and linguistic distance were observed at this larger scale. ConclusionsPrevious studies have found significant correlations between genetic variation and language in Africa over large geographic distances, often across language families. However the broad sampling strategies of these datasets have limited their utility for understanding the relationship within language families. This is the first study to show that at very fine geographic/linguistic scales language differences can be maintained in the presence of substantial gene flow over an extended period of time and demonstrates the value of dense sampling strategies and having DNA of known and detailed provenance, a practice that is generally rare when investigating sub-Saharan African demographic processes using genetic data." .

However, Tanzania has two official languages: English, introduced in colonial times, and Kiswahili, the actual lingua franca spoken by 99 per cent of the population. Kiswahili websites and internet content are gradually increasing, and equipment is becoming more affordable. The research reported on here shows that especially academic staff with good knowledge in information and communication technology (ICT) are using Kiswahili more than others. This gives hope for the future. The language of instruction in Tanzania’s higher education is however English only, resulting in students having to attend lectures and produce their coursework in a language they are not proficient in. Investigating whether University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) staff and students regard themselves as participants and contributors in a knowledge society, the author’s findings suggest two simultaneous processes: (1) There are still remnants from the colonial system in terms of education and language; (2) At the same time ICT-competent staff and students already do participate in the ICT era in Kiswahili and tend to use Kiswahili in their work and studies. A high number of respondents say they use Kiswahili in most of their ICT communication. There is reason to ask: is the notion of English being the only ICT language possibly decreasing? This article builds on fieldwork conducted at UDSM in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011, in connection with the research project “ICT and Language in Tanzanian Higher Education”." .

We explore the possibilities offered by linear grammar, a form of language that lacks syntax and morphology altogether, and that structures its utterances through a direct mapping between semantics and phonology. A language with a linear grammar would have no syntactic categories or syntactic phrases, and therefore no syntactic recursion. It would also have no functional categories such as tense, agreement, and case inflection, and no derivational morphology. Such a language would still be capable of conveying certain semantic relations through word order—for instance by stipulating that agents should precede patients. However, many other semantic relations would have to be based on pragmatics and discourse context. We find evidence of linear grammar in a wide range of linguistic phenomena: pidgins, stages of late second language acquisition, home signs, village sign languages, language comprehension (even in fully syntactic languages), aphasia, and specific language impairment. We also find a full-blown language, Riau Indonesian, whose grammar is arguably close to a pure linear grammar. In addition, when subjects are asked to convey information through nonlinguistic gesture, their gestures make use of semantically based principles of linear ordering. Finally, some pockets of English grammar, notably compounds, can be characterized in terms of linear grammar. We conclude that linear grammar is a plausible evolutionary precursor of modern fully syntactic grammar, one that is still active in the human mind." .

Although Catalonia and the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) were each influenced by differing historical, geographic, political, socioeconomic, and linguistic factors — their own indigenous languages and cultures were victimized by the policies of the central government for the four decades ending with the death of Franco in 1975. Catalonia and the BAC have had to learn how to crawl (to use a child development analogy) after having been gagged and swaddled by a national policy that totally repressed their languages and cultures in an unremitting policy of assimilation. It was through the education system that the Franco government tried to stop the use of Catalan (and Euskara) so it is not surprising that schools are again viewed as a major means of language revival (McNair, 1980). The impressionable years of early childhood are viewed as critical in this effort in both regions. This paper provides an overview of current “normalization” policies and legislation guiding these recuperation efforts, and then describes current educational practices in each region, focusing on innovative early childhood programs. Attention is given to both the resistance and accomplishments of these normalization efforts." .

Although we can never know about the historical accidents that may have prevented texts from coming down to us, the relative proportions of extant epics, romances, and fabliaux in Occitan may not give an entirely misleading impression of their popularity. In this paper, I attempt to account firstly for the paucity of fabliaux in Old Occitan and secondly for their unusual features when compared with those in Old French. I further consider whether we can even regard the Castia Gilos and the Novas del Papagai as Occitan fabliaux. The question itself may be gallocentric and posed by scholars approaching Occitan from the north. These two texts designate themselves as novas, but the term seems to have too wide an application to be of much use. If not exactly fabliaux, then they at least fill a similar slot in the Occitan Gattungssystem to that occupied by the fabliaux in Old French. They are humorous, didactic, and largely meaningless (except for the basic joke) outside of their own linguistic and cultural intertext." .

First, we replicated the recent findings of Soto-Faraco et al. (2007) with Spanish and English bilingual and monolingual observers using different languages and a different experimental paradigm (identification). We found that prior linguistic experience affected response bias but not sensitivity (Experiment 1). In two additional experiments, we investigated the visual cues that observers use to complete the languageidentification task. The results of Experiment 2 indicate that some lexical information is available in the visual signal but that it is limited. Acoustic analyses confirmed that our Spanish and English stimuli differed acoustically with respect to linguistic rhythmic categories. In Experiment 3, we tested whether this rhythmic difference could be used by observers to identify the language when the visual stimuli is temporally reversed, thereby eliminating lexical information but retaining rhythmic differences. The participants performed above chance even in the backward condition, suggesting that the rhythmic differences between the two languages may aid language identification in visual-only speech signals. The results of Experiments 3A and 3B also confirm previous findings that increased stimulus length facilitates language identification. Taken together, the results of these three experiments replicate earlier findings and also show that prior linguistic experience, lexical information, rhythmic structure, and utterance length influence visual-only language identification." .

Language and the human brain have evolved in parallel and by interacting with each other. In this study, we propose a model of language evolution based on biological evolution and learning. In our model, the linguistic space is expressed in the polar coordinate system in which each possible language is expressed as a point. We conduct evolutionary experiments based on this model, and visualize the results in linguistic space. The distribution trajectory of innate linguistic abilities shows the diversification and complexity of language growth. In the extended experiment, in which the angular coordinates represent the additional effect of the cost of plasticity, we observe a general tendency that the cost of plasticity evolves to become smaller. However, it never evolves to be zero, which might suggest that some cost of plasticity producing the Baldwin effect is adaptive in language evolution." .

This paper examines a song spontaneously created and sung by a 44-month-old child. The song, an element of bath-time play, weaves a chapter in her ongoing self-narrative, disclosing not only her sense of herself as a developing person, but also revealing her struggle with this development. Examination of the relation of the structure and functions of the song demonstrates that it is a variation of egocentric speech clearly connected to her thinking and not merely a tuneful accompaniment to her imaginative play. Early childhood educators and care-givers often witness similar episodes of language use among children engrossed in play in school settings. Observation of the form and content of such language use can provide the early childhood teacher or caregiver with information about a child's language development, sense of self, and readiness for formal and informal literacy experiences, which presume a developing facility and competence in thinking through language." .

Overall, the rates of speaking only English for a number of contemporary groups suggest that Anglicization is occurring at roughly the same pace for Asians as it did for Europeans, but is slower among the descendants of Spanish speakers.

Participants were 97 Spanish-speaking children in grade 4 and grade 7. Morphological awareness in Spanish and in English was evaluated with two measures of derivational morphology. The results showed that Spanish morphological awareness contributed unique variance to Spanish word reading after controlling for other reading related variables. English morphological awareness also explained unique variance in English word reading. Cross-linguistic transfer of morphological awareness was observed from Spanish to English, but not from English to Spanish. These results suggest that morphological awareness is important for word reading in Spanish, a shallow orthography with a complex morphological system.

Unlike most other minorities in Europe, the Finland-Swedes can be defined neither by a common origin – because parts of their ancestors came as immigrants from different European countries during the 19th century – nor by territory (they do not dispose of a specific territory). According to Finnish legislation, Finland is a bilingual nation with two national languages, and the question of language is a matter of personal choice. There are parallel educational institutions in both Finnish and Swedish and both languages are compulsory subjects at school. Presently, the situation of the Swedish language in Finland seems to be good and there is no lack of pupils in Swedish schools. Nevertheless, the question of language use or of (linguistic) identity is a complex one – especially in respect of pupils with a mixed linguistic background. A study conducted on that subject, including pupils from Finnish as well as from Swedish schools, led to interesting results, particularly with regard to a special kind of bilingualism at Swedish schools. The study also reveals that school language is of utmost importance with regard to the forming of language identity and the use of language." .

Scarlet and summer tanagers (Piranga olivacea and P. rubra) are the most sympatric among the four species and have the largest differences in song characteristics. However, songs of scarlet tanagers do not differ significantly between sympatry and allopatry. Songs of summer tanagers more resemble those of scarlet tanagers in allopatry, but this geographical variation has been explained by variation in habitat characteristics. Both species countersing in sympatry, and react aggressively to each other's songs in sympatry as well as in allopatry, probably due to similarities in the song. The limited data from the narrow sympatric zone between western and hepatic tanagers (P. ludoviciana and P. flava) indicate that their songs differ to a great extent. Therefore, the results do not support the hypothesis of character convergence. Character displacement might explain partially interspecific differences in song features between scarlet and summer tanagers but cannot be tested further." .

A second, longer song type, characterized by many pure-toned syllables, increased in the presence of females and was probably sexual in function.

In particular, the article seeks to shed light on the question what may prompt national governments in modernity and late modernity to establish and fund such bodies to regulate and promote languages which already are used in all spheres of society, already enjoy status as national languages, de facto if not also de jure, and already have standardized written forms with no rival varieties. In a period characterised by national sentiment and nation building, it is likely that the three pillars of language policy (management, beliefs, practices) are in harmony. As long as governments consider the processes of norm selection, form codification, elaboration of function, and acceptance by the community, to be sufficiently implemented, they have no need to establish official language management agencies. At a later stage, however, governments may react to an evolving language situation, notably perceived threats of foreign influence through globalisation and migration, as well as perceived threats as to changing linguistic practices, not least in the lexical domain, by using their legislative and institutional powers in new ways in order to consolidate the foundations of language management by, among other things, founding language ‘academies’ or ‘councils’. My claim is supported by evidence from the Northern European (‘Nordic’) countries where such ‘councils’ were established in the post World War II period. The Icelandic ‘council’, and the language ideologies of Iceland, are discussed in particular." .

The aim of this study was to explore what identity shifts occur when science students from Bahraini national schools transition to an international university. The role of two aspects of learner identity—that is, English proficiency and science background knowledge, was examined in this study. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with students and with university lecturers. The analysis suggested three conceptual themes of (1) reliance on science knowledge, (2) the auxiliary role of professional language and (3) adequacy of student learning strategies, demonstrating what subjective meanings the participants ascribe to the interplay between science knowledge and linguistic ability. The findings suggest that despite the lack of adequate linguistic attributes, the students are still able to successfully learn science in the context of language change. It is also implied that through strategically utilising their academic background in science, students preserve their identity as successful learners from school through to university. We conclude that agency plays a separate role in transition and is not a sole function of identity. We also contest the idea of language as a necessary attribute of one’s identity as it was perceived by our participants to be an advantage and an auxiliary tool rather than a requirement." .

While Finnish is a language with an extremely rich morphology, English morphology is relatively poor. Consequently, the role of morphology in storing and processing words would be expected to be greater in Finnish than in English. With a series of visual lexical decision experiments in both languages, we find that the opposite is the case for derivational morphology: for English, parsing of morphological constituents is often required, whereas for Finnish, full-form storage and access seems to be the rule. We try to explain this counterintuitive finding by making an appeal to the lexical-statistical properties of both languages." .

Students’ responses to the materials in English and in two varieties of Afrikaans and isiXhosa (as mediated in writing vs orally) are determined, and used as basis to problematize decisions on language variety and mode in language diversification initiatives in Higher Education in South Africa. The findings of the paper are juxtaposed against particular group interests in the educational use of a language as well as differences in the affordances and impact of different modes of language use. The paper suggests that beyond the euphoria of using languages other than English in South African Higher Education, several issues (such as entrenched language practices, beliefs and language management orientations) require attention if the goals of transformation in this sector are to be attained." .

Forty subjects were exposed to the same referential situations but to different linguistic structures, each encoding a particular referential property that was, relevant. Miniature artificial languages were used. The referential properties examined were prototypical transitivity as defined by Slobin (1980) and plurality. The results showed that prototypical transitivity was extracted more readily than plurality, even though the subjects were more familiar with the latter property. The discussion emphasized how language serves to promote, the extraction and encoding of linguistically relevant properties that underlie referential situations." .

The article systems in these two languages display striking parallels, diverging in similar ways from that of English adult language. Our analysis involves a parametric difference between English and St’át’imcets. While in English adult language, article distinctions rely on the state of the common ground between speaker and hearer, in St’át’imcets they rely on speaker beliefs. Despite the similarities between the patterns of article use in St’át’imcets and child English, we propose that English-acquiring children set the parameter correctly for the English value very early, but that they initially lack a pragmatic concept requiring them to distinguish systematically between their own beliefs and the belief state of their interlocutor. This neutralizes the distinction between the two parameter values, causing the article system of English-speaking children to optionally resemble that of St’át’imcets adults. In terms of language acquisition theory, our study supports a revised version of the Strong Continuity Hypothesis, according to which children obey all principles of Universal Grammar and set parameters as soon as the relevant input is available. Any structures deviating from target language structures result from an immature pragmatic system." .

Each male sang up to 14 different types. In testing the Beau Geste hypothesis the following predictions were made: (1) Territorial males tend to change song type when moving from one song post to another. (2) The tendency to change song type when moving from one song post to another increases with the distance between the song posts. (3) Territory holders prefer inconspicuous song posts that reduce the chances of being instantly detected by possible intruders and prospectors. However, none of these predictions were confirmed by the data analyses. The singing behaviour of the Coal Tit does therefore not support the Beau Geste hypothesis." .

Phonological similarity was manipulated within a language by varying neighborhood density, and across languages by varying extent of cross-linguistic overlap between native and non-native languages. In Experiment 1, speed and accuracy of bilinguals’ picture naming were susceptible to phonological neighborhood density in both the first and the second language. In Experiment 2, eye-movement patterns indicated that the time-course of language activation varied across phonological neighborhood densities and across native/non-native language status. In Experiment 3, speed and accuracy of bilingual performance in an auditory lexical decision task were influenced by degree of cross-linguistic phonological overlap. Together, the three experiments confirm that bilinguals are sensitive to phonological similarity within and across languages and suggest that this sensitivity is asymmetrical across native and non-native languages and varies along the timecourse of word processing." .

I define peripherism as the ideology or view of those groups that have historically been linguistically subalternized or disenfranchised but that have now, due to the market forces of globalization, gained access to linguistic capital. Rather than a tool of linguicism, which it was during British colonialism, English in India today is an agent of decolonization that enables the urban poor to access the global economy. The peripherist ideology disagrees with sociolinguists who think that English endangers local languages and perpetuates inequality. It sees this as Orientalism disguised as liberal sociolinguistics that, in fact, reproduces the inequitable distribution of linguistic capital and fails to acknowledge the tenacity of indigenous cultures in being able to maintain their longevity. The data, from a dual medium school, is used to explore unique literacy practices that lay the foundations of workplace literacy based on culturally contextualized texts and pedagogies." .

Serins have a repertoire of about 50 complex syllables that are sung at a very fast rate and in a very stereotyped order, forming discrete songs. Songs are high pitched for the serin’s body size. Song organisation is circular, with a limited number of starting points. Songs can stop at any point in their cycling. Within songs there are trilled sections and fast, non-repeated sections that account for the greatest part of songs. These two modes of singing also differ in average inter-element intervals and probably in their respiratory kinematics. Bird repertoire size was measured and the difficulties of measuring it in this species are discussed. Repertoires are individually specific and have a variable amount of syllable sharing with other birds. We found evidence for geographical variation in the composition of repertoires. Considering our current knowledge of song in carduelines, the stereotyped and circular nature of serin song appear to be unique within this group of birds." .

Establishing that a signal is aggressive or threatening requires demonstrating that it is more commonly used in agonistic contexts, that it predicts subsequent aggressive behaviors by the sender, and that receivers respond differently to this signal. Like many birds, song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) produce a low-amplitude “soft song” vocalization that has been hypothesized to be an aggressive signal. Soft song meets the first two criteria, but previous research has failed to demonstrate that soft song provokes aggression or that receivers even perceive soft song differently from normal loud song. We used a playback experiment with taxidermic mount presentation to test whether territorial male song sparrows respond differently to loud and soft song playbacks. Subjects reacted more strongly to the soft song playback by approaching the mount more closely, increasing wing wave displays, and increasing the proportion of their own songs that were soft songs, with further trends toward increasing the number of flights and attacks. These results confirm that soft song is a conventional signal of aggression in song sparrows and that increased receiver retaliation maintains its reliability." .

For Duoduo, today’s culture is loaded with overdeveloped theories, and the creativity of poets is seriously undermined by “the invasion of knowledge”. So Duoduo employs meta-poems to express this understanding of language, knowledge, and poetry. His meta-poem often comprises not only an aesthetically constituted poem but also reflections on poetry, especially on its genesis and development in history and personal writing, as well as on how to read and interpret it. Duoduo also employs self-contradictory language to destroy the referentiality and logic of ordinary language. The language of Duoduo’s poems often incorporates great tension and drastic contradictions, which are reinforced by prosodic movements, hence it incorporates the quality of “gesture”. Duoduo’s challenge to normal modes of expressing meaning and representing experience, his pursuit of a new poetic world and linguistic paradigm are now more and more welcome by Chinese readers and younger poets." .

The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism." .

The goal of both approaches is to account for the diversity of human languages, but in practice both have a rather different take on the subject. One major difference between these approaches is the relation between language-specific and cross-linguistic analyses. This paper argues that it is crucial to strictly distinguish between the two. However, this plea is at odds with the generative/structural perspective, which attempts to deal with both kinds of analyses at the same time. In contrast, it is of central importance from a typological/cross-linguistic perspective to keep the comparison constant across the wide variation as attested among human languages, thereby often ignoring many language-specific details (for the course of the comparison). The final section of this paper summarizes some major results of recent cross-linguistic comparisons of the person/number categories in the world’s languages." .

Scala is an expressive language that provides a flexible syntax, type-level computation using implicits, and other features that facilitate the development of embedded DSLs. However, many of these features work well only for shallow embeddings, i.e. DSLs which are implemented as plain libraries. Shallow embeddings automatically profit from features of the host language through linguistic reuse: any DSL expression is just as a regular Scala expression. But in many cases, directly executing DSL programs within the host language is not enough and deep embeddings are needed, which reify DSL programs into a data structure representation that can be analyzed, optimized, or further translated. For deep embeddings, linguistic reuse is no longer automatic. Scala-Virtualized defines many of the language’s built-in constructs as method calls, which enables DSLs to redefine the built-in semantics using familiar language mechanisms like overloading and overriding. This in turn enables an easier progression from shallow to deep embeddings, as core language constructs such as conditionals or pattern matching can be redefined to build a reified representation of the operation itself. While this facility brings shallow, syntactic, reuse to deep embeddings, we also present examples of what we call deep linguistic reuse: combining shallow and deep components in a single DSL in such a way that certain features are fully implemented in the shallow embedding part and do not need to be reified at the deep embedding level." .

The pLucid language (1982) was used to describe dataflow networks. Indexical Lucid (1987) was introduced for intensional programming, in which the semantics of a variable was understood as a function from a universe of possible worlds to ordinary values. With TransLucid, and the use of contexts as firstclass values, programming can be understood in a Cartesian framework." .

However, because French is rarely the mother tongue of those drafting that case law, the texts produced are often stilted and awkward. In addition, those drafting such case law are constrained in their use of language and style of writing (owing to pressures of technology and in order to reinforce the rule of law). These factors have led to the development of a ‘Court French’ which necessarily shapes the case law produced and has implications for its development, particularly insofar as it inevitably leads to a type of precedent in that case law. That case law also undergoes many permutations of translation into and out of up to 23 different languages. The resultant texts that make up the case law are hybrid in nature—consisting of a blend of cultural and linguistic patterns, constrained by a rigid formulistic drafting style and put through many permutations of translation. The present paper investigates the production of the Court’s multilingual case law and considers whether the hybrid nature of that case law can actually aid the presentation (and thus the development) of a ‘uniform’ EU case law." .

Baudriu of Bougueil, who wrote an impressive corpus of Latin poems, was an expert in the language, style, verse, motifs and genres of the classical and later antique pagan and Christian poetry, and treated theological as well as profane and explicitly ancient topics. About 1107, when he was urged to become bishop and to abandon, his personal independence and quiet monastic life, he gave voice to his disgust of the new ecclesiastical burden by a long poem in elegiac distichs. This paper tries to show the ancient genres Baudri has used and transformed and even inverted in order to describe his special situation. Therefore, in imitating the ancient genres, far from showing only his literary colture, he was rather using ther in a very specific and personal way. This use of literary traditions can best be analyzed, in terms of intertetextuality." .

Two areas notably lacking are the paucity of megastudies in Chinese and the relatively infrequent use of the lexical decision paradigm to investigate single-character recognition. The Chinese Lexicon Project, described in this article, is a database of lexical decision latencies for 2,500 Chinese single characters in simplified script, collected from a sample of native mainland Chinese (Mandarin) speakers (N = 35). This resource will provide a valuable adjunct to influential mega-databases, such as the English, French, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. Using two separate analyses, some advantages associated with megastudies are exemplified. These include the selection of the strongest measure to represent Chinese character frequency (Cai & Brysbaert’s (PLoS ONE 5(6): e10729, 2010) subtitle contextual diversity frequency count), and the conducting of virtual studies to replicate and clarify existing findings. The unique morpho-syllabic nature of the Chinese writing system makes it a valuable case study for functional language contrasts. Moreover, this is the first publicly available large-scale repository of behavioral responses pertaining to Chinese language processing (the behavioral dataset is attached to this article, as a supplemental file available for download). For these reasons, the data should be of substantial interest to psychologists, linguists, and other researchers." .

The results show that English is the dominant language both for linking pages and for all pages. In a typical country approximately half the pages were in English and half in one or more national languages. Normalised interlinking patterns showed three trends: 1) international interlinking throughout Europe in English, and additionally in Swedish in Scandinavia; 2) linking between countries sharing a common language, and 3) countries extensively hosting international links in their own major languages. This provides evidence for the multilingual character of academic use of the Web in Western Europe, at least outside the UK and Eire. Evidence was found that Greece was significantly linguistically isolated from the rest of the EU but that outsiders Norway and Switzerland were not." .

Given the widely acknowledged status of English as the world language, English has also become the most widely used language when it comes to professional counselling in intercultural contexts. Due to the growing demand of counselling processes in English, a certain command of the English language has also become indispensible for consultants. It has to be noted, however, that it’s rarely English native speakers who prompt a “multilingual” group to speak English. In most working contexts it is speakers, for “none of whom is the mother tongue” (House 1999: 74), who agree to use English as common code of understanding, i.e. English as a lingua franca (ELF). Current researches strongly question the status of native English norms as the only point of reference for ‘correct’ usage of English (cf. e.g. Seidlhofer et al. 2006). Based on empirical data, this contribution chooses an interdisciplinary approach at the interface between linguistics and other social sciences to examine some implications of the use of ELF in professional counselling processes with a strong focus on supervision. It is meant to show that consulting processes in English, among non-native speakers, can be carried out successfully despite clear linguistic deviations from native speaker norms." .

The focus is on how multilingualism is perceived and valued, and how these three languages are linked to particular linguistic markets. The parental ideology that underpins the family language policy, the invisible language planning, is the central focus of analysis. The results suggest that family language policies are strongly influenced by socio-political and economical factors. In addition, the study confirms that the parents’ educational background, their immigration experiences and their cultural disposition, in this case pervaded by Confucian thinking, contribute significantly to parental expectations and aspirations and thus to the family language policies." .

The recent case of Garcia v. Spun Steak(1993, 1994) is illustrative of the challenge managers can face in dealing with cultural and linguistic diversity in the workplace. Over time, there have been conflicting messages in employment discrimination law as to the propriety of employer-imposed restrictions on the use of languages other than English in the workplace. However, the basic question involves the balancing of both the employer’s right to manage the business and the right to self-expression in the language of one’s choice in the workplace. Recommendations are made as to how each party’s rights can be balanced under the law. What will be seen is that in the nuevo mundoof work found at the edge of the twenty-first century, the interests of both employers and employees may be best served by policies favoring language promotion over language restrictions." .

Semistructured data is becoming more and more prevalent, e.g., in structured documents such as HTML and when performing simple integration of data from multiple sources. Traditional data models and query languages are inappropriate, since semistructured data often is irregular: some data is missing, similar concepts are represented using different types, heterogeneous sets are present, or object structure is not fully known. Lorel is a user-friendly language in the SQL/OQL style for querying such data effectively. For wide applicability, the simple object model underlying Lorel can be viewed as an extension of the ODMG data model and the Lorel language as an extension of OQL. The main novelties of the Lorel language are: (i) the extensive use of coercion to relieve the user from the strict typing of OQL, which is inappropriate for semistructured data; and (ii) powerful path expressions, which permit a flexible form of declarative navigational access and are particularly suitable when the details of the structure are not known to the user. Lorel also includes a declarative update language. Lorel is implemented as the query language of the Lore prototype database management system at Stanford. Information about Lore can be found at http://www-db.stanford.edu/lore. In addition to presenting the Lorel language in full, this paper briefly describes the Lore system and query processor. We also briefly discuss a second implementation of Lorel on top of a conventional object-oriented database management system, the O2 system." .

Most studies on how passerine birds perform such adjustments have been carried out in oscines, a group well known for the importance of learning in the development of their songs. On the other hand, suboscines, in which learning appears to have little influence on the development of their songs, have been largely neglected. We evaluated song adjustment to noise in the vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus), a suboscine bird. We conducted song recordings and noise measurements at several territories within Mexico City during the length of the dawn chorus. Males living in noisier places sang long songs, while those males inhabiting quieter places sang both short and long songs. We also found evidence of individual song plasticity, as males sang less versatile songs (i.e., songs with more introductory elements) later in the morning when noise levels were higher. This individual shift in song seems to be more associated to time of the day rather than to the observed rise in noise. However, we cannot discard an effect of noise, which should be evaluated with an experiment. We discuss our results in the context of other studies with oscine passerines and other taxa and consider implications for signaling in intra- and intersexual contexts." .

The analysis of the birds' singing performed several months later revealed a kind of song memorization and production which, hitherto, had not been studied in song birds and is called ‘package formation.’ Each package was a temporally consistent group of acquired song types which could be traced back to a coherent succession of, usually, three to five (max. seven) model song types. Model song types which a bird failed to acquire were located outside those sequences of model song types that had been acquired and later formed the packages. In contrast to the order of the tutored strings, packages were sung in a variable order. In parallel, neither the frequency of occurrence of the packages nor the performance length was related to the size of the package. We infer from these results that package formation reflects basic properties of the nightingales' song-type memories, which — through segmentation of serially presented learning stimuli — may facilitate the acquisition of large signal repertoires." .

In particular I focus on how narrative genres organise time in relation to value, drawing on functional linguistic models of temporality and evaluation. From a linguistic perspective, the various narrative genres negotiate different kinds of solidarity with listeners, and so the limits of narrative materialise various possibilities for communing in a culture, alongside the potentialities for construing community through related and other genres of discourse—since in general, the limits/possibilities of our language (and attendant modalities of communication) are the limits/possibilities of our social world." .

This language is interpreted in terms of semantical games of imperfect information. In this language, one can define two negations: (i) strong or dual negation, and (ii) weak or contradictory negation. The latter negation, unlike the former, can occur only sentence-initially. Then I argue that, to a certain extent, the two negations match the distinction existing in natural languages between sentential and constituent negation. As a corollary, I derive the fact that there are no mechanical rules for forming the contradictory negation of an English sentence." .

From the famous victory at Ponte Nuovo, the steady process of gallicisation consolidated France's control over the island by extending its influence to include the languages in use on Corsica. This paper seeks to examine what is meant by gallicisation and how these processes were undertaken by France. By outlining the various stages of gallicisation, it is the intention of this article to demonstrate that the linguistic policies imposed by Paris aimed initially to dislodge Tuscan Italian, and not Corsican, as popular misconception sometimes holds. From a diglossia, Corsica experienced a triglossia as France sought to neuter the perceived linguistic threat from France's Mediterranean neighbour. Subsequently, this policy was redirected against the Corsican language during the earlier part of the 20th century until the Second World War." .

We analyzed songs from 22 recording sessions whick took place from January to April, 1980 on Silver Bank, Dominican Republic. The sequence of patterns (which we call “themes”) in these songs is remarkably regular. In this sample, there were 427 transitions from one theme to another. Only 20 of these did not follow the expected sequence. We present evidence that some themes are sung out of their usual order far more often than others. We also show that when themes are sung out of sequence, the whale is at the surface, blowing. This finding provides a link between the song structure and humpback behavior. Because aspects of the song structure can be linked to breathing, we hypothesize that a function of the songs is to show how long a whale can hold its breath, and that the duration of a song may be an indication of stamina and physical condition." .

The first is concerned with the determinants that govern the learning of foreign languages. One of these is the “difficulty” of the foreign language, represented by the distance between the native and the foreign language. The second case deals with the formation and breaking-up of nations. Here, it is suggested that genetic distances between regions with diversified populations (such as between the Basque country and the rest of Spain) need to be “compensated” by more generous transfer systems if the nation wants to avoid secession-prone behavior. The last case looks at a very popular cultural event, the Eurovision Song Contest, in which nations are represented by singers who are ranked by an international jury that consists of citizens chosen in each participating country. It is shown that what is often considered as logrolling in voting behavior is rather generated by voting for culturally and linguistically close neighbors." .

The shift in popularity, from European to Asian languages, not only reflects the societal demand for the institutional rearrangement of academic staff but also stirs teachers of European languages to appeal for the continued study of their language. The present discussion paper, drawing from secondary statistics and scholarly knowledge, first reviews a series of Japan’s foreign language education policies from the 1990s to 2012 that have been affecting the organizational structure of foreign language education in Japanese higher education. The study then addresses an array of issues that emerge with the changing needs of the times: the waning popularity of European languages, the Japanese government’s policy shift to English and Chinese, English language professionals’ detached attitudes toward other language education, and the dominance of university language teachers with little to no language teaching training. By addressing these pending yet gravely overlooked issues that merit due attention from language teaching professionals beyond Japan, the present study hopes to provide insight into the traditionally one-sided, English-centric discussion on foreign language education in Japanese higher education in a matter that is informative for international scholarship." .

There were no differences between blocked and mixed conditions; cognates were responded to with equal facility in all conditions, and there was an interaction of Cognates and Noncognates by Weak and Strong Language. These results were interpreted as supporting a direct graphemic lexical access model." .

On the basis of a longitudinal study involving English and German as first languages, we will show what asynchronies can teach us about the relative complexity of a child’s two input languages.

The linguistic research focuses on consistency both of an individual subject's discourse, and of the overall research findings (rather than the presence of inconsistency in those findings) to reinforce Irigaray's argument that there is a relationship between sexual difference and sexed language use. Previously in her work, Irigaray's philosophical and linguistic research were held more distinct. Être deux speculates on the extent to which a discursive analysis of the texts of Merleau-Ponty, Sartre and Lévinas might support the concept of a masculine relationship to language. While it is certainly the case that some degree of what Irigaray deems masculinity can be located in their texts, this analysis occurs through an unnecessary de-emphasis of the discursive complexity of these texts, a complexity Irigaray has been at pains to demonstrate in the methodological orientation of her earlier work on the history of philosophy." .

Patterns of errors and even specificphonemes and graphemes that are problematic are shown to resembleclosely the patterns found in English and other European languages.

What aspects of CRT would assist in theorizing the relationship between language and race for teachers of English to speakers of other languages? In looking to CRT to inform and expand critical approaches to English language teaching, I hope to more closely tie English language learning to issues of race as a way to better understand the intersectionality of these identity factors in the educational context of language teaching and learning. Such inquiry could work to broaden teachers’ knowledge of the ways that linguistic and racial membership inform student learning, and raise awareness about the range of perspectives and cultural interpretations that linguistic minorities may hold." .

As Japan became engaged in war, the government declared English an enemy language and suppressed its use and teaching. Japan's mobilization of the entire colony for the war effort, which by 1945 stopped all education in Korea, also ended opportunities for English language education." .

Multilingual language policies,which recognize ethnic and linguistic pluralism as resources for nation-building, are increasingly in evidence. These policies, many of which envision implementation through bilingual intercultural education, open up new worlds of possibility for oppressed indigenous and immigrant languages and their speakers,transforming former homogenizing and assimilationist policy discourses into discourses about diversity and emancipation. This article uses the metaphor of ecology oflanguage to explore the ideologies underlying multilingual language policies, and the continua of biliteracy framework as ecological heuristic for situating the challenges faced in implementing them. Specifically, the paper considers community and classroom challenges inherent in implementing these new ideologies,as they are evident in two nations which introduced transformative policies in the early 1990s: post-apartheid South Africa's newConstitution of 1993 and Bolivia's National Education Reform of 1994. It concludes with implications for multilingual language policies in the United States and elsewhere." .

Estimates suggest that about 90 % of children who speak over 60 indigenous languages do not have access to education in their mother tongues. Linguists estimate that exclusive teaching of Urdu and English subjects the indigenous languages to physical endangerment as well as negative perceived vitality. This study investigated the language management techniques, practices and discourses of the school authorities about indigenous languages and linguistic diversity, and its effects on perceptions of the students. The study used the theoretical framework of governmentality as introduced by Foucault in The foucault effect: studies in governmentality with two lectures by and an interview with Michael Foucault, Harvester Wheatsheaf, London, (1991), which not only focuses on the direct acts of the governing of the state apparatuses, but also addresses the indirect acts of governance that shape individual behaviors. Deploying a mixed methodology that used students of high secondary level, teachers and school principals as sampling in 11 low-fee English-medium private schools in Quetta, Pakistan, the findings suggest that school authorities exercise stringent techniques such as notices, wall paintings, penalties and occasional punishment to suppress the use of languages other than Urdu or English. Mostly, the students also show compliance to the top-down policies. Most of participants perceive indigenous languages as worthless because of their lesser role in professional development and social mobility. The study concludes that the governance methods displace the indigenous languages both physically as well as perceptually. The prevailing orientations look upon languages as commodities, profoundly downgrading the cultural, literary, aesthetic and sociolinguistic dynamics of the indigenous languages." .

In most species of song birds, males develop song repertoires of several different songs. Among this variety, different songs may be used differently in communication and, thus, may have different functions. Here we studied vocal responses to playback of structurally different songs in male territorial nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos). Nightingales have enormous vocal repertoires of about 200 song types. Among these songs, one category, whistle songs, sticks out syntactically and acoustically. Here we tested whether or not male nightingales match whistle songs with whistle songs and, if so, whether they also match the pitch of the broadcast whistles. Furthermore, we also tested if nightingales treat whistle songs as a separate category of songs. We conducted interactive playback experiments on nocturnal song in which each male received three playback treatments that differed in the number of whistle songs broadcast. Males responded differently during playbacks by singing significantly more whistle songs when the playback tapes contained many whistle songs than when they contained no whistle songs. Males also frequently matched the pitch of the broadcast whistle songs. In contrast to responses during playback, after the playback terminated males sang more whistle songs when no whistle songs were broadcast than when many whistle songs were broadcast. These findings suggest that whistle songs have a specific signal value and that nightingales treat them as a special song category.

The restraints on this type of research (lack of funding being the primary one) will continue to impede further development. Two major areas of considerable importance in the field are transfer and implementation studies, subjects not normally seen as researchper se, but particularly useful in the Latin American context because adaptation and adoption of innovations is a typical and logical process in educational improvement. Educational technology in Latin America should be asking new and different questions. It should not be asking how to use specific objectives to improve teaching but should ask what is the role of specific objectives in the development of cognitive structures in the students. It should not be asking how to use television to massify education but rather which are the critical aspects of educational television and how may they be integrated into systematic programs of educational development. It should not be asking how to apply instructional design procedures to teach specific subjects but asking what is the basic nature of student learning and how can that be facilitated through careful design of the conditions of learning. Educational technology should be making more efforts to respond to the specific necessities of the societies in which it is supposed to be functioning, making its efforts more relevant and pertinent, adjusting itself to political variables, social systems, linguistic interests of participating groups (cultures and sub-cultures), and to the demands for more democratic educational processes. From the Latin American perspective it is important to increase the willingness to intensify the participation of the recipients of the diverse innovations. This means valuing the ideas, beliefs, interests, and role of the participants, giving them greater levels of participation in those critical decisions which concern them, and responding to their cognitive styles and their interests." .

Firstly, it is one of only a few modal markers throughout Japanese language history that have both deontic and epistemic meaning, which is very common in English and other Indo-European languages. Secondly, it is said to be extremely polysemous. There might be no other modal suffix in the history of the Japanese language that has been associated with such a range and variety of meanings. There are also concrete examples of beshi that are given divergent interpretations in grammatical analysis and Modern Japanese translations. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a principled explanation both for the different \"meanings\" of beshi and for divergent interpretations that are due to indeterminacy. It is argued that Old Japanese beshi from a synchronic point of view basically has only a deontic and an epistemic sense, and other \"meanings\" can be explained either in terms of vagueness or in terms of implicature in specific contexts. Conditions are explained under which indeterminacy between the deontic and the epistemic sense arises and compared with the conditions for indeterminacy and deontic-epistemic polysemy to those observed in the history of modals in English and German. Furthermore an account of the diachronic layering behind the synchronic meaning range of beshi in Old Japanese is given. It is claimed that the development of themeanings of beshi does not strictly adhere to the \"deontic-to-epistemic\" pattern frequently found on Indo-European languages." .

Ælfric's prefaces often express his concern that writing in English does not ensure that his readers will properly interpret his texts. In order to give readers the tools they need to analyze English texts, Ælfric writes the Grammar, a work that not only teaches Latin grammar, but also applies grammar to the English language. By making explicit the concept that English is a language, a collection of signs, Ælfric teaches his readers that reading English texts requires analytical skills. Ælfric then shows his readers how the tools of the Latin grammarians can be used to understand English as well. In essence, Ælfric takes the medieval commonplace that the study of grammar is necessary for the understanding of Latin texts and expands it, showing how grammar is necessary for the understanding of English language texts as well." .

However, to make the meaning of the terms clear, a translation into the native language is always useful. Correct translation of terminology is even more crucial for emergency managers and decision makers who can be confronted with a confusing and inconsistently applied mix of terminology. Thus, it is imperative to have a translation that appropriately converts the meaning of a term, while being grammatically and lexicologically correct, before the need for use. If terms are not consistently defined across all languages following industry standards and norms, what one person believes to be a dog, to another is a cat. However, definitions and translations of English scientific and technical terms are not always available, and language is constantly evolving. We live and work in an international world where English is the common language of multi-cultural exchange. As a result, while finding the correct translation can be difficult because we are too used to the English language terms, translated equivalents that are available may not have been through the peer review process. We have explored this issue by discussing grammatically and lexicologically correct French, German, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Japanese versions for terms involved in communicating effusive eruption intensity." .

The government has proposed English proficiency scores that Japanese teachers of English should attain, but has not yet specified clearly what English language use should be like in the classroom. Case descriptionThis case study describes the theoretical aspect of the development of a benchmark assessment for use in English language classrooms with Japanese teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL). The study first defines teacher language proficiency, the use of the foreign language in the classroom, with particular attention to teacher language awareness (Andrews, 2007) as a bridging mechanism between pedagogical content knowledge and the foreign language proficiency of Japanese teachers of EFL. This definition of teacher language proficiency is further elaborated in terms of the legitimate use of benchmark assessments in English language classrooms in Japan with a thorough literature review of L2 benchmark assessments in other parts of the world. Discussion and EvaluationThe present case study examines the ideal assessor conditions after thorough review on assessor bias from the language testing/assessment research, while the development of assessment benchmarks for use in Japan is discussed based on a high-stakes benchmark assessment for teachers of EFL in Hong Kong. The proposed benchmarks acknowledge the complexity of classroom English use, thus employing four different scale types to accommodate the multifaceted characteristics of teacher language proficiency. ConclusionsThe current case study concludes with the exploration of tasks remaining for the future development of our benchmark assessments for use in ongoing professional development." .

Although media literacy has been revealed to have several positive effects for language learning, research regarding its use for effective L2 oral communicative competence has been lacking particularly in Southeast Asia. Through a conversation analytic approach, this inquiry explores the nature of how media literacy could be fostered by teaching based on news broadcasts for L2 learners’ enhanced communicative competence. Data were collected through an online networking environment and analyzed based upon the emergent patterns to ascertain learners’ oral communicative competence in their target language. The results demonstrate that the development of media literacy facilitates learners’ L2 oral communicative competence from the practical and genuine linguistic input. Learners’ linguistic and operational competencies are also strengthened as Canale (1983) as well as Canale and Swain (1980) categorize as essential tools for effective communicative competence. The authentic language exposure that comes with the development of media literacy also assists learners in developing their L2 more efficiently through the gradual authentic scaffolding to leverage their L2 output for effective second language acquisition (SLA)." .

The first section of the paper focuses on the recent changes in government language policy (return to Arabic–French bilingualism in schools) and reactions to them following the recommendations made by the National Commission for the Reform of the Educational System in March 2001. The second part gives a historical background to post-independent language-in-education planning. The third section looks at the unplanned developments resulting from the hegemonic nature of linguistic arabisation. The fourth section explores secondary school students’ attitudinal reactions towards Algeria’s linguistic pluralism. Finally, the paper argues that the Algerian leadership’s refusal to recognise linguistic pluralism considered beneficial by the majority of the population represents one of the major obstacles to the nation-building process." .

The logic and grammar of the language used to form relationships may offer some insight into how relationships breakdown and can be restored in psychotherapy. Language and thought are inseparable in the Whorf and Sapir hypothesis. This paper illustrates how other-centeredness, indirection, indecision, and apology are embedded in Japanese grammar and become the foundation for Japanese relationships. Two other central ideas of Japanese culture,Amae (interdependency) andOmote/Ura (public and private selves), are also presented with implications for presenting complaints, therapeutic relationships, and treatment techniques." .

Examples from the post-colonial and post-communist worlds and the European Union reveal increasing corporate involvement in education, and World Bank policies that favour European languages. Studies of global English range from those that uncritically endorse global English to those which see it as reflecting a post-imperial but essentially capitalist agenda. Many of the contem-porary trends are captured in two competing language policy paradigms that situate English in broader economic, political and cultural facets of globalisation, the Diffusion of English paradigm, and the Ecology of Languages paradigm. A number of studies of various dimensions of linguistic and professional imperialism in the teaching of English to Asians reveal the persistence of western agendas in education. There is also increasing documentation of resistance to this, both at the level of awareness of the need to anchor English more firmly in local cultural systems, and at classroom level. Language pedagogy needs to ensure that English is not learned subtractively. Only in this way can globalisation be made more accountable and locally relevant." .

Although language policy had been a source of controversy at various times during the 1860s and 1870s, it was not until Hennessy’s term that conflict over the roles of English and Chinese in Hong Kong’s education system came fully into the open. One consequence of this sudden upsurge of interest in language policy was that the colonial and metropolitan authorities were finally forced to confront the issues and problems associated with two decades of government-sponsored English-language education. The debates and decisions about language policy during this period provide revealing evidence of the British government’s position on the learning and use of English in colonial education and society." .

The Aging Males' Symptoms scale (AMS) became the most commonly used scale to measure HRQoL and symptoms in aging males in many countries worldwide. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of the instrument particularly concerning versions of the scale in different languages in the light of the quality of the translation process. AMS versions availableMost of the translations were performed following international methodological recommendations for linguistic & cultural adaptation of HRQoL instruments. Mainly the English version was used as source language for the translation into Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Swedish, and Japanese (attached as additional PDF-files). Preliminary versions that were derived only from forward translations are of secondary quality and available in Finnish, Flemish, and Russian. It is recommended to complete the translation process for the latter languages before using them in international studies. Translations in processThe AMS scale is in the process of consensus finding of two existing French versions, and the versions in the Korean, Thai, and Indonesian languages have not yet been completed in the translation process. ConclusionThe AMS scale is obviously a valuable tool for assessing health related quality of life in aging men, because it is used worldwide. It is a standardized scale according to psychometric norms. Most of the currently available language versions were translated following international standards for linguistic and cultural translation of quality of life scales. Assistance is offered to help interested parties in the translation process." .

This paper aims at contributing to this debate by offering a novel syntactic analysis of Japanese clausal comparatives. The main proposal is that despite their appearance, Japanese clausal comparatives involve a nominal structure whose nominal head is deleted by a syntactic deletion operation, and therefore are underlyingly phrasal comparatives. It is demonstrated that this analysis explains peculiar syntactic and semantic properties of Japanese (seemingly) clausal comparatives, some of which have been unidentified in the previous literature. The proposed account also allows us to dispense with the previously proposed semantic variation specific to degree constructions, and entertain a more conservative view of crosslinguistic variation where the differences between Japanese-type and English-type comparative constructions are solely attributed to their morphosyntactic properties." .

In this essay, it is argued that a right to use one's own language can be justified by appeal to the practical role of language in human life. The ability to communicate effectively is essential for human autonomy and well-being; thus there is no need to argue that linguistic groups, as groups, are entitled to special treatment, or that language rights are ‘group rights’. Because learning a new language is invariably a costly matter, by recognizing some languages as official languages the state (re)distributes burdens and benefits among its citizens. The task of language rights is to guarantee that these burdens are not distributed in a too unequal way." .

This article introduces a tool for the automated analysis of simplified and traditional Chinese texts, called the Chinese Readability Index Explorer (CRIE). Composed of four subsystems and incorporating 82 multilevel linguistic features, CRIE is able to conduct the major tasks of segmentation, syntactic parsing, and feature extraction. Furthermore, the integration of linguistic features with machine learning models enables CRIE to provide leveling and diagnostic information for texts in language arts, texts for learning Chinese as a foreign language, and texts with domain knowledge. The usage and validation of the functions provided by CRIE are also introduced." .

English has developed into a global lingua franca in business, culture, education and diplomacy. English “demand” includes institutional demands and individual demands for language to achieve better employment and enjoy English-language goods. Supply can be seen in these English-language goods, the use of English in institutional settings, the robustness of this language, and an increasing supply of English speakers through learning English as a second language. But within the dynamics of this development lie the seeds of a disadvantage for native English speakers. As the educated world learns English, personal advantage may shift away from the native English speaker toward those speaking English plus other languages. Given lower levels of foreign language-learning in the Anglophone world and increasing numbers of multilingual non-native English speakers, native English speakers may see their advantage disappear. Integrating international business and trade theory with sociolinguistics and language economics this paper argues that native English speakers will face a disadvantage in twenty firsts century due to their English dependency and Confucius Institutes may help young native English speakers overcome this emerging disadvantage." .

The glocalisation of English and the dynamics of increased contact between people from different cultural backgrounds, or transcultural mobility, call for new notions of ‘competence’ to be applied to successful intercultural communication. In this paper, I focus on the notion of metacultural competence, from the perspective of Cultural Linguistics, and explain how such competence can be developed as part of learning English as an International Language (EIL). Cultural Linguistics is a discipline with multidisciplinary origins exploring the relationship between language, culture, and conceptualisation. The analytical tools of Cultural Linguistics are conceptual structures such as cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors, collectively referred to as cultural conceptualisations. The paper provides examples of cultural conceptualisations from Chinese English and Hong Kong English. It also explores different aspects of metacultural competence. Metacultural competence enables interlocutors to consciously engage in successfully communicating and negotiating their cultural conceptualisations during intercultural communication. I argue that EIL curricula should provide opportunities for learners to develop this competence and expose them to the conceptual variation that characterises the English language in today’s globalised world. Exposure to a variety of cultural conceptualisations in learning an L2 is likely to expand a learner’s conceptual horizon, where one can become familiar with, and even have the option of internalising, new systems of conceptualising experience." .

It first describes a methodology for the generation of parallel corpora of error data, then uses these data to examine three general hypotheses about the relationship between language structure and the speech production system. All of the following hypotheses were supported by the data. Languages are equally complex. No overall differences were found in the numbers of errors made by speakers of the five languages in the study. Languages are processed in similar ways. English-based generalizations about language production were tested to see to what extent they would hold true across languages. It was found that, to a large degree, languages follow similar patterns. However, the relative numbers of phonological anticipations and perseverations in other languages did not follow the English pattern. Languages differ in that speech errors tend to cluster around loci of complexity within each language. Languages such as Turkish and Spanish, which have more inflectional morphology, exhibit more errors involving inflected forms, while languages such as Japanese, with rich systems of closed-class forms, tend to have more errors involving closed-class items." .

North University (NU) has hosted international students in its Chinese language and culture programs for decades. However, between 2008 and 2010, a new Master’s degree program for international students was established. This attracted 75 graduate students from different disciplinary backgrounds, from 21 developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. English is the common language to both students and faculty, but a foreign language to all. This program marks a significant shift for China’s higher education as it reaches out to the world.

English as an international language is widely used in the Israeli society, so immigrants whose mother tongue is English are a very interesting case because they might experience much less social pressure to improve their Hebrew skills than other immigrant groups who speak other languages. The study reveals that, although most first-generation immigrants participated in state-sponsored Hebrew classes and reported relatively moderate levels of language proficiency, it has not become their primary language. Hebrew proficiency proved conditional on age at arrival and rise sharply with tenure in the country and exposure to Hebrew (at origin or at destination). Hebrew proficiency is higher for migrants with more extensive contacts with Israelis and with higher education. Positive synergism emerged between language acquisition and reasons for migrating and attachment to the country." .

Following the post-WWII period, as most Western States restructured from welfarism to neoliberalism, there was a shift away from minority (language) rights towards economic development. In Canada, where State policy maintains a French–English “linguistic duality”, francophone regions outside Quebec became sites of discursive struggle, following the collapse of the old economy, between (1) a focus on the collective reproduction of “community” (maintaining language, culture and identity), and (2) the State’s focus on facilitating individual economic reproduction. What emerges is an attempt by the State, and certain community actors to save the traditional francophone minority collectivity by focusing on the “community economic development” of rural bastions, rather than the economic integration of individual francophones living in diverse, urban areas." .

In this country, the territoriality principle and political subsidiarity have supported a discourse on multilingualism for the purpose of ‘mutual understanding’. However, a conflict has recently upset the cohabitation of four national languages in Switzerland, resulting partly from conflicting responses to the spread of English in Swiss society. This paper discusses the struggle around the weighting of national languages versus English in educational language policy. The dominant discourse on multilingualism has been confronted with a globalising ideology, where competence in English is seen as a commodity to be acquired early. An economically powerful canton, Zurich, introduced English as a first additional language in primary school in 1998, triggering what has come to be known as Sprachenstreit, or ‘language strife’. An apparent compromise may not be stable as language issues have now been subjected to a referendum. The implications of the Swiss case are discussed in the light of European language policy." .

First, it provides a general framework of analysis. Second, it argues that Francophonie (the French-speaking countries and communities of the world collectively) constitutes geopolitical spaces sharing linguistic, cultural, economic and institutional constructions but that it is culturally and linguistically varied. This sociopolitical context gives rise to particular ideologies of language and to the consequent need for second/foreign language didactics. The examples of France and Québec are used to show how contexts influence these didactics. Third, from the locus of professional associations, the paper shows empirically how geographic didactic clusters are both culturolinguistically colored and continentally influenced. It concludes that dealing with diversity (didactic diversity or linguistic and cultural diversity) is not an easy task: Both second/foreign language didactics and the constituent communities of Francophonie are searching for ways of being together in a postmodern world." .

As a result of the multiple transitions the country is currently undergoing, English has increased dramatically in status in the last decade, essentially displacing French as the international language of choice. At the descriptive level, this article charts the spread of English into Cambodia, along side French efforts to contest this spread in favor of French. At the theoretical level, this article extrapolates from the case study to make a comment in the on going debate among scholars about English language spread. The Cambodian case contributes to this debate in several ways, notably in affirming or challenging the multinational attachments of English, the communicative inequality that English use may create, the economic exploitation that may result from the establishment of English in developing countries, and the resistance to English that may emerge in settings into which the language is spreading." .

Linguistic barriers in science affect not only researchers’ career paths but institutional productivity and efficiency as well. To address these barriers, we designed and piloted a specialized course, Scientific English. The pedagogical approach is based on English for specific purposes methodology in which curriculum and content are driven by the types of daily language used and interactions which occur in the participants’ occupation, in this case, cancer research. The 11-week program was organized into three sections: presentation skill, meeting and discussion skills, and writing skills. Effectiveness of the course was measured by the number of participants able to produce the presentations and written products with a score of at least 75 of 100 possible points. From January to December 2008, participant scores averaged 90.4 for presentation and 86.8 for written products. The authors provide insights and recommendations on the development and delivery of the program." .

The result of the study shows that the kinship system was created based on blood, marga (family name) and the relationship in the society. The terms of address of Batak Toba-Samosir were used by Batak people when they speak among themselves using Batak language or Indonesian. Sometimes they also use the terms of address when they speak to other ethnics. Semantically, some of the terms of address can be analyzed but some do not. In short, they create them arbitrary. Besides, other ethnics sometimes use the terms of address inappropriately because they make an analogy to Indonesian language, and consequently it breaks the communication." .

This was particularly aimed at a modernisation project in order for the legacy of the Joseon dynasty, which had ruled Korea for five centuries to the end of the nineteenth century, to transform itself into a ‘modernized’ nation state. The ways in which Hangul, the Korean alphabet, was socially produced as the legitimate national writing system from one vernacular variety under the colonial regime are examined. The article contends that while the production of the national writing system functioned as a means for anti-colonial movements, it also naturalized differential socioeconomic resource distribution among Joseon people according to literacy skills in Joseon’s transformation into the modern Korean nation state. The article discusses the limitations of mobilizing linguistic nationalism as a means of political emancipation." .

They include the selection of generic he or gender-neutral pronouns anaphoric to indefinite pronouns (e.g., everybody, someone) and occupational terms (e.g., doctor, lawyer, cleaner). A number of generic nouns and sex-unspecified nouns with or without morphologically marked gender were also examined (e.g., chairman vs chairperson, fireman vs fire fighter). The findings reveal that linguistic sexism is still prevalent in Hong Kong. However, the strong feminist movement in Western countries and in the education field has had an impact among young people, some of whom have shown concern to avoid gender-biased language. Although consistent gender differences were not found in the present study, some significant differences between men and women were revealed; a relatively higher proportion of women opted for the coordinate pronoun he/she and gender-neutral occupational terms, whereas more men opted for generic they." .

In particular, we considerset-driven andrearrangement-independent learners, i.e., learning devices whose output exclusively depends on the range and on the range and length of their input, respectively. The impact of set-drivenness and rearrangement-independence on the behavior of learners to their learning power is studied in dependence on thehypothesis space the learners may use. We distinguish betweenexact learnability ($$\\mathcal{L}$$ has to be inferred with respect to$$\\mathcal{L}$$),class-preserving learning ($$\\mathcal{L}$$ has to be inferred with respect to some suitably chosen enumeration of all the languages from$$\\mathcal{L}$$), andclass-comprising inference ($$\\mathcal{L}$$ has to be learned with respect to some suitably chosen enumeration of uniformly recursive languages containing at least all the languages from$$\\mathcal{L}$$). Furthermore, we consider the influence of set-drivenness and rearrangement-independence for learning devices that realize thesubset principle to different extents. Thereby we distinguish betweenstrong-monotonic, monotonic, andWeakmonotonic orconservative learning. The results obtained are threefold. First, rearrangement-independent learning does not constitute a restriction except in the case of monotonic learning. Next, we prove that for all but two of the learning models considered set-drivenness is a severe restriction. However, class-comprising set-drivenconservative learning is exactly as powerful as unrestricted class-comprisingconservative learning. Finally, the power of class-comprising set-driven learning in the limit is characterized by equating the collection of learnable indexed families with the collection of class-comprisingly conservatively inferable indexed families. These results considerably extend previous work done in the field (see, e.g., [20] and [5])." .

The use of English interferes with the final process of acquisition of the students’ native languages such as German and Italian and may slow down and perhaps even hinder the attainment of the highest level of competence in either the native language or English itself. The consequences of this kind of cross-linguistic contact, which pertain on the long run to the language profile of countries such as Germany and Italy, are discussed with respect to the development of the individual’s language competence and to the potential conflicts provided by available grammatical means of different languages in the operation of “thinking for speaking”. On the basis of a thorough study of the multilingual environment of a Turkish university, and of a recent survey of the Master degree’s courses taught in English in Italy, a set of directives for an efficient language policy in the internationalized university is proposed. These directives involve the gradual and optional introduction of English as a medium of teaching according to the nature of the scientific field of study of different subjects, and the engagement of both scientific societies and universities in a monitoring action of the multilingual behavior of students and teachers." .

Dutch-English bilinguals performed a language-specific or a generalized lexical decision task including words that are spelled and/or pronounced the same in English and in Dutch and that matched one-language control words from both languages. In Experiments 1 and 3, “false friends” with different meanings in the two languages (e.g.,spot) were presented, whereas in Experiments 2 and 4 cognates with the same meanings across languages (e.g.,film) were presented. The language-specific Experiments 1 and 2 replicated and qualified an earlier study (Dijkstra, Grainger, & Van Heuven, 1999). In the generalized Experiment 3, participants reacted equally quickly on Dutch-English homographs and Dutch control words, indicating that their response was based primarily on the fastest available orthographic code (i.e., Dutch). In Experiment 4, cognates were recognized faster than English and Dutch controls, suggesting coactivation of the cognates’ semantics. The nonword results indicate that the bilingual rejection procedure can, to some extent, be language specific. All results are discussed within the BIA+ (bilingual interactive activation) model for bilingual word recognition." .

The syntactic complexity of a regular language is the cardinality of its syntactic semigroup. The syntactic complexity of a subclass of regular languages is the worst-case syntactic complexity taken as a function of the state complexity n of languages in that class. We prove that n n−1, n n−1 + n − 1, and n n−2 + (n − 2)2 n−2 + 1 are tight upper bounds on the syntactic complexities of right ideals and prefix-closed languages, left ideals and suffix-closed languages, and two-sided ideals and factor-closed languages, respectively. Moreover, we show that the transition semigroups meeting the upper bounds for all three types of ideals are unique, and the numbers of generators (4, 5, and 6, respectively) cannot be reduced." .

In this respect, language ideology plays a central role in the success of language revitalization movements. In an effort to understand how new language ideologies are advanced in language revitalization movements at the micro level, research was conducted on the circulation of language ideology in three new Irish-language communities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. I use these three communities as specific examples of a general policy problem in revitalizing lesser-used languages: how does one establish new norms for the use of a threatened language in a given site or domain and how does one defend these new norms against the counter-ideology of an encroaching or dominant language?" .

Currently, linguists work in many of these minority language groups in order to create vital written languages and produce various literature titles that include the Scriptures. Development of a writing system requires indigenous language assistants who are adept in drawing meaning from unfamiliar cultural paradigms and accurately articulating them. Empirical studies in cognitive style conducted among the minority language groups of Irian Jaya, Indonesia show a correlation between field independence (a dimension of cognitive style) and the ability to grasp abstract linguistic concepts. The ‘Brantley/Larsen Test’ was developed to identify language assistants, also known as change agents, in a culturally appropriate manner for Irian Jaya. Furthermore, this study suggests that the church would benefit from community lay counselors who manifest field independence, which indicates comprehension of abstract and complex linguistic notions found in Scriptures." .

The languages studied were Russian (L1) and Hebrew (L2) among bilingual children aged 4–5 years in Israel. According to this model, the children’s first language of educational instruction (up to age three) is the language to which they are exposed at home. Their second language—the dominant language of the country that is spoken by the majority of the population—is acquired sequentially, after relative maturity in the first language. Fifty-one Russian/Hebrew-speaking bilinguals (around age four) were selected from bilingual (Russian/Hebrew) preschools, which used the First Language First approach, and monolingual (Hebrew) preschools. The research was designed as a longitudinal study, as the children’s vocabulary was measured at two time-points—near the beginning and the end of the academic year. The children’s vocabulary was measured in both languages by examining its depth dimensions (paradigmatic semantic relations and syntagmatic semantic relations). The results demonstrated that the later immersion in L2 and continuing development of L1 within the First Language First model does not results in retardation in development of bilingual children in L2 in comparison to their bilingual peers from the monolingual (Hebrew) preschools. In addition, this model of early bilingual development enhances the linguistic interdependence of depth of vocabulary knowledge, and, therefore, supports balanced bilingual development." .

Bahasa Indonesia was declared the state language in the 1945 constitution, and reformed spelling was agreed in 1972. It is the sole medium of instruction, except in the first three grades of elementary school in nine regions, where vernaculars may be used transitionally. Thereafter vernaculars are taught as school subjects. Bilingualism, and even multilingualism in Indonesian and one or more vernaculars and/or foreign languages is increasing, and despite the use of Indonesian for official documentary purposes at all levels it does not appear that vernaculars are dying out, although their spheres of use are restricted. Bahasa Indonesia fulfils the four functions: cognitive, instrumental, integrative and cultural, while vernaculars are only integrative and cultural. The curriculum of Indonesian, established centrally, is pragmatic or communicative. It is expressed in a standard syllabus for course books. This approach equally applies to foreign languages, which are introduced at secondary level, although here receptive reading is given more weight than productive skills. A full description of the syllabus organization of the various languages is given. Nonformal language learning also takes place, in the national basic education and literacy programme, which teaches Bahasa Indonesia, and in vocational courses in foreign languages for commerce." .

In addition, it explored the cross-language transfer of sub-syllabic units between Korean and English by taking into account their lexical abilities with respect to the two languages. The participants were assessed in Korean and English based on their sound oddity and similarity judgments with respect to sub-syllabic units in spoken pseudo-syllables containing semivowels (e.g., /j/ and /w/) as well as on a lexical ability test. The results indicate that EFL and ESL children preferred body structure and rime structure, respectively, regardless of the language. These results provide support for the bilingual interactive activation model; that is, bilingual lexicon may be represented in language non-selective access. Further, the differences in semivowel placement between Korean and English may be a possible resource for language-specific sub-syllabic awareness." .

Students from language-minority homes likewise must learn to produce such writing, despite their relatively limited experience with the English language, reflected in the availability of smaller mental lexicons and more restricted syntactic constructions. Yet some features of bilingual children’s cognition, such as precocious development of theory of mind and strong metalinguistic awareness, might support the crafting of arguments in writing, where the explicit consideration of multiple points of view can serve to strengthen one’s case for a claim. In this study we examine the incidence of social perspective-taking acts in the argumentative essays of language-minority and English-only students in Grades 4–6 and find that language-minority students match or surpass the English-only students on two critical measures of perspective taking (perspective acknowledgment and perspective articulation). We also explore possible links between students’ use of perspective taking in their argumentative essays and a validated formal measure of the same skill, uncovering different relationships between them in the two language groups. Links to previously attested bilingual advantages and to the development of argumentation are discussed." .

Right or wrong?) and answer a corresponding question (e.g.,Are you a child? Yes or no?) in English, French, Japanese, and Korean. While people verify affirmative statements and answer affirmative questions similarly across the four languages, they answer negative questions differently across the four languages. In English, answering negative questions works in a way opposite to verification (e.g.,Are you not a child? Yes; You are not a child. Wrong). In French,si is used in the place of theyes response in English. In Japanese and Korean, answering negative questions works in a way similar to verification (e.g.,Are you not a child? No; You are not a child. Wrong). The effects of these linguistic characteristics are examined. Findings are: (1) All children across the four languages appear to start answering negative questions using the English system; (2) English-speaking children find verifying negative statements more difficult than answering the corresponding questions but Japanese-speaking children find it less difficult; and (3) while English-speaking and Korean-speaking children find true negative statements more difficult to verify than false negative statements, Japanese-speaking children find them less difficult. Language-universal and language-specific processes in verification and answering are discussed." .

Reading skills were related to within-language oral proficiency and across languages with similar and different orthographies.

This hypothesis claims that the similarities and differences between first and additional languages and scripts help or hinder the acquisition of literacy in the novel language. In this study we examined the impact of Arabic language and literacy as opposed to Hebrew language and literacy on the acquisition of English basic literacy skills amongst elementary school Arabic L1 speaking versus Hebrew L1 speaking children. All these children are considered emergent bi-, tri- or multi-lingual and literate. A total of 75 fifth grade children participated in the study: 30 Arabic L1 speaking children and 45 Hebrew L1 speaking children. Tests in decoding and spelling various English target conventions were conducted. Arabic L1 speaking children showed an advantage in both decoding and spelling for the short vowel /æ/, the digraph <th>, in decoding of short vowels and in spelling of vowel digraphs thus supporting the linguistic and orthographic proximity hypothesis. There were no significant differences between the two groups on decoding and spelling the silent <e>, which provided a challenge for all participants. As predicted, the phoneme /p/ posed a challenge for spelling for Arabic L1 speaking children. These data provide support for a metaphoric treasure chest consisting of various languages and literacies that children bring into the classroom and which should be considered by teachers. The contents of this treasure chest which are linguistically or orthographically similar to English facilitate its literacy acquisition." .

I argued against this view in favor of the alternative that the intuitions are empirical theory-laden central-processor responses to linguistic phenomena. The concern about these linguistic intuitions arises from their apparent role as evidence for a grammar. Mark Textor, “Devitt on the Epistemic Authority of Linguistic Intuitions” (2009), argues that I have picked the wrong intuitions: I should have picked non-judgmental linguistic “seemings”. These reside between metalinguistic judgments and linguistic performances and have an epistemic authority that the orthodox view may well be able to explain. Textor seems to think that the metalinguistic intuitions are not evidence at all. I argue that he is wrong about that. More importantly, I argue that there are no “in-between” linguistic seemings with epistemic authority." .

His philosophy of language had four primary manifestations: (1) It differentiated between “names pointing at entities and real events” and “names describing summum bonum and perfection”; (2) In discussing the metaphysical issue of “the Dao,” it was the first to introduce a syntax analysis of linguistics, clearly differentiating between the different roles of predicate verbs “zhi wei” and “wei zhi” in Classical Chinese; (3) In criticizing Confucian thought during the Song and Ming dynasties, it adopted specific philological skills such as the analysis of phraseology, the meaning of sentences and the thread of words in texts; and (4) It re-interpreted the meaning of Confucian classics by studying characters and language, adopting a positivist and philological manner to seek metaphysical sense in philosophy. In this way, his philosophy was different from the scholars of the School of Principles during the Song and Ming dynasties and from the goal of Western linguistic philosophy in the 20th century, which refuted metaphysics. Accordingly, it helped to develop 18th century Chinese philosophy as it turned towards linguistic philology." .

This paper presents the Kurdish BLARK and shows that from Natural language processing and computational linguistics perspectives the revised BLARK provides a more applicable view of languages with similar characteristics to Kurdish." .

Their revitalisation is partly due to their being taught in schools. Multilingualism has special characteristics for speakers of minority languages and it poses unique challenges for learning minority languages. This article looks at the cases of Basque and Frisian, comparing and contrasting their similarities and differences. The educational system in the Basque Autonomous Community underwent an important transformation, starting in 1979 from a situation where less than 5 per cent of all teachers were capable of teaching through Basque. Today this figure has changed to more than 80 per cent. An innovative approach was chosen for teaching the minority language, Basque, alongside the dominant language, Spanish, and the international language, English. The outcome is a substantial increase in the proficiency in the minority language among the younger age groups. The decline of the minority language has thus been successfully reversed and one of the major challenges now is to uphold a sustainable educational system. By contrast, the Frisian language has fared less well in the Netherlands, where developments over the last 30 years have been much slower and the results more modest. Here policy-making for education and for language is caught in a continuous debate between a weak provincial level and a powerful central state level. Overall, multilingualism as a resource for individuals is valued for “bigger” languages such as English, French and German, but not for a “small” language such as Frisian. Nevertheless, a few trilingual experiments have been carried out in some schools in Friesland in teaching Frisian, Dutch and English. These experiments may also be instructive for other cases of minority languages of a “moderate strength”. In the cases of both Basque and Frisian multilingualism is generally perceived as an important resource." .

In this paper, we present an innovative approach for developing and validating such language translators based on two languages: With the first, we specify a language translation using a syntax-to-syntax mapping; and with the second, we define the semantics of both of the source and target languages. After showing how such specifications can be combined to validate and generate language translators automatically, we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on a particular modelling language translation." .

Populations from the Indonesian archipelago played an especially important role because linguistic evidence suggests that the Malagasy language branches from the Southeast Barito language family of southern Borneo, Indonesia, with the closest language spoken today by the Ma’anyan. To test for a genetic link between Malagasy and these linguistically related Indonesian populations, we studied the Ma’anyan and other Indonesian ethnic groups (including the sea nomad Bajo) that, from their historical and linguistic contexts, may be modern descendants of the populations that helped enact the settlement of Madagascar. ResultA combination of phylogeographic analysis of genetic distances, haplotype comparisons and inference of parental populations by linear optimization, using both maternal and paternal DNA lineages, suggests that Malagasy derive from multiple regional sources in Indonesia, with a focus on eastern Borneo, southern Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda islands. ConclusionSettlement may have been mediated by ancient sea nomad movements because the linguistically closest population, Ma’anyan, has only subtle genetic connections to Malagasy, whereas genetic links with other sea nomads are more strongly supported. Our data hint at a more complex scenario for the Indonesian settlement of Madagascar than has previously been recognized." .

Arguments in support of the interdependence and interaction of linguistic and cognitive factors during the acquisition period are presented." .

RLS theories and efforts are byproducts of European indigenous minority problems, and the ideological bias of Fishman’s model of RLS privileges intergenerational transmission in the context of stable diglossia. This article examines the ideological underpinnings and utility of this framework as an appropriate model for stabilizing and revitalizing indigenous languages. I question the assumptions and theoretical perspectives underlying terms such as RLS and reconceptualize what it might mean for a language to be maintained and survive without intergenerational mother tongue transmission. As an increasing number of communities around the world face the impending loss of their languages, it is imperative to clarify these issues not just for theory’s sake, but in the interest of providing sound advice." .

It is founded on the belief that a school curriculum which promotes the ideals of freedom, justice, equality, equity and human dignity is most likely to result in high academic achievement and quality education. In Botswana, English is the official language and medium of instruction and Setswana is the national lingua franca which is used for formal occasions in the villages and other informal settings. Any other languages spoken by unrecognised tribes are banned from use in schools or the media, including minority languages taught before independence in 1966, This paper describes the Shiyeyi Language Project, initiated by the Wayeyi tribe, which advocates for a multicultural model of education where children learn in their mother tongue and about their local culture at an early stage, then add the national language, and eventually an international language as medium of instruction. The project operates within an unfriendly political and legal context, but has achieved some results. Continued efforts, especially as supported by similar language projects, have the potential to change the situation in Botswana." .

Two Facebook groups were introduced in different English-as-L2 classes that were part of an international collaborative project comprising secondary schools in Colombia, Finland, Sweden and Taiwan. The study is theoretically grounded in sociocultural perspectives on learning, and the methods involve logging the students’ linguistic interactions in the social media groups. The analysis of the empirical material explored how the students framed the activities by different types of keying in their choice of linguistic repertoires. The findings show that the social media context offered a casual space for communication in which the students, by attentively attuning to the local coordinated framing, used diverse linguistic repertoires to play with the language. In instances of upkeyed framings, the language play was not only used with pragmatic intentions, but also as a means for various socializing purposes. In conclusion, it is suggested that language play on social media can be seen as a valuable activity in developing sociopragmatic competence to prepare students for L2 use outside of school." .

The immersion students, who had shown equivalence with the control students on most written language measures in first grade, maintained their equivalence in fourth grade. Furthermore, they demonstrated slight superiority over the English program students in reading non-words. Their first-grade advantage in linguistic analysis ability may have helped their written English skills to develop comparably to those of the control subjects despite much less exposure to, and instruction in, written English. It is suggested that although no other advantage was seen at this time from their early heightened linguistic analysis ability, the French immersion subjects may surpass the English program students once they can join their linguistic analysis skill to greater expereince with written English." .

This study examines the sensitivity of territorial male song sparrows to both multiple song types and variation within types. A playback experiment was conducted using stimulus tapes that had either single songs (but not variations), song variations (but not types) or a single song. Response during playback was similar for all three stimulus groups, but diminished sooner after playback for the single-song tape. Thus our results indicate that male song sparrows are sensitive to song variability both within and among song types." .

As such, it provides a useful means to privately express inner thoughts or to reflect on daily experiences, helping in either case to put them in perspective. Taking conventional diary keeping as our starting point, we have designed and built a digital diary, named Affective Diary, with which users can scribble their notes, but that also allows for bodily memorabilia to be recorded from body sensors and mobile media to be collected from users’ mobile phones. A premise that underlies the presented work is one that views our bodily experiences as integral to how we come to interpret and thus make sense of the world. We present our investigations into this design space in three related lines of inquiry: (1) a theoretical grounding for affect and bodily experiences; (2) a user-centred design process, arriving at the Affective Diary system; and (3) an exploratory end-user study of the Affective Diary with 4 users during several weeks of use. Through these three inquiries, our overall aim has been to explore the potential of a system that interleaves the physical and cultural features of our embodied experiences and to further examine what media-specific qualities such a design might incorporate. Concerning the media-specific qualities, the key appears to be to find a suitable balance where a system does not dictate what should be interpreted and, at the same time, lends itself to enabling the user to participate in the interpretive act. In the exploratory end-user study users, for the most part, were able to identify with the body memorabilia and together with the mobile data, it enabled them to remember and reflect on their past. Two of our subjects went even further and found patterns in their own bodily reactions that caused them to learn something about themselves and even attempt to alter their own behaviours." .

A substantial debate on the language policies governing the three principal languages has continued for more than two decades among policy-makers and educators. The political transition in 1997 has greatly affected Hong Kong society, including language education. Since then, the HKSAR government has made a series of language policy reforms trying to create a reasonable balance among the three languages in Hong Kong. The policies of ‘biliteracy and trilingualism’ and ‘mother-tongue teaching’ are two of the most significant in terms of controversy and impact. They are now guiding the curriculum design in Hong Kong language education. The goal of the former policy is to train Hong Kong people to be truly biliterate (written English and Chinese) and trilingual (spoken English, Cantonese and Putonghua). However, Hong Kong primary schools presently do not have an agreed method for the implementation of trilingual education. After a comprehensive historical review of the development of language education in Hong Kong schools, this study aims to find out how the ‘biliterate’ and ‘trilingual’ language policy is currently implemented in Hong Kong primary schools. 155 Hong Kong primary schools participated in a questionnaire survey on how trilingual education is implemented in the schools. The findings suggest that the implementation of trilingual education varied significantly from school to school, and the effectiveness of the trilingual education models varied as well. It is hoped that the findings will help us to gain a better understanding of trilingual education in Hong Kong, and the study could lead to some insightful and theoretical contributions to multilingual education in general." .

This brief review of research on bilingual education and its relationship to a variety of language teaching settings has shown that the immersion experiment has produced several constructive side effects. First, it has caused the re-examination of first language teaching in regular English classrooms and it is now sparking a move toward increased contact between educators of French as a first language and French as a second language. Second, it has heightened parental interest and led to the increased involvement of parents in their children's education. Canadian Parents for French, a national association formed in 1977, grew directly out of the excitement and interest created by bilingual education programs in Canada. Along with increased parental involvement has come the realization that the school — whether it is francophone or anglophone — cannot be expected to go it alone, that support for French must be generated in the media and in the community. Two recent conferences have resulted in part from this realization:Apprenons en français/Learning in French held at Glendon College in June, 1978, and the OISE Conference on French Language Instruction, the proceedings of which make up this issue ofInterchange. These were landmark events, since never before in Ontario had educators and parents involved in French as a first language and French as a second language come together to share their problems, ideas and hopes. Such meetings could and should represent the beginning of a continuing dialogue." .

They do not belong to classical or patristic Latin: rather, persona grata originates in the language of late medieval ecclesiastical diplomacy. After sporadic use from the 15th century to the end of the 18th, it and similar forms of words became very important in negotiations between the Protestant monarchies of Germany and the Holy See in and around the 1820s. Persona grata was then transferred to the language of international diplomacy, where it has flourished since the 1850s; the negative persona non grata, which is now more common than the positive phrase, appears to have developed in English-language contexts in the nineteenth century." .

This technique is commonly referred to as Statement Analysis (SA). There are varying degrees of empirical support for different SA techniques and for specific linguistic markers; what is less known in the literature is the degree to which verbal indicators of veracity and lying vary across languages. We examined this research question. Participants from three language groups – English, Spanish, and Chinese – witnessed a video portraying an actual crime and then wrote false and true statements about what they had witnessed in their respective languages. The statements were coded using various linguistic features of SA. The selected linguistic features discriminated between true and false witness statements and the effect sizes were relatively large. Importantly, language did not moderate the relationship between veracity and the coded features, indicating cross-language similarity in the efficacy of SA features to differentiate truths from lies." .

It challenges the notion that France is a linguistically homogenous nation where a standardised French language is universally practiced and, rather, seeks to reframe linguistic diversity and heterogeneity as fundamental and legitimate constitutive features of French society. In exploring diversity from this critical perspective, the paper looks to the ways in which a number of artists and language activists are deliberately and consciously transgressing normative notions of French to affirm the legitimacy of their alterity and difference. The paper does not make an argument against the legitimacy or social value of standard French, but rather argues in favour of a more critical and inclusive approach to cultural and linguistic difference in France." .

Based on the author’s experience teaching residents for one month at a community hospital in Japan and a review of the non-English speaking background (NESB) educational literature, pedagogical principles and lessons for successful international NESB instruction are outlined. These methods include understanding the dissimilar linguistic, cultural, and academic backgrounds of the learners, emphasizing pace and clarity of speech, presenting a conceptual framework instead of detailed discourse on subjects, and regular visual reinforcement of spoken words. The limitations introduced by the language barrier and the use of interpreters are briefly discussed. As society and institutions of higher learning become more global and multicultural, clinician–educators may benefit from teaching in other countries in order to enhance their teaching skills with NESB learners, both abroad and in their own institutions." .

Previous research has suggested that this adaptation phenomenon is language specific and takes place at the phonological level. Moreover, it has been proposed that adaptation should only be observed for languages that are rhythmically similar. This assumption was explored by studying adaptation to different time-compressed languages in Spanish speakers. In Experiment 1, the performances of Spanish-speaking subjects who adapted to Spanish, Italian, French, English, and Japanese were compared. In Experiment 2, subjects from the same population were tested with Greek sentences compressed to two different rates. The results showed adaptation for Spanish, Italian, and Greek and no adaptation for English and Japanese, with French being an intermediate case. To account for the data, we propose that variables other than just the rhythmic properties of the languages, such as the vowel system and/or the lexical stress pattern, must be considered. The Greek data also support the view that phonological, rather than lexical, information is a determining factor in adaptation to compressed speech." .

The semantics was specified for an abstract language. The language was obtained by selecting from the languages L2 and L2B [2, 3] constructs that are most characteristic and most fully reflect the structure of these languages. The semantics is defined by associating with language constructs lambda terms and taking into account the possibility of applying this definition to the simulation of program operation and to the study of algorithm properties in the language of lambda calculus. The method of program operation simulation is the same as in [8]." .

The non-parametric kinetics (NPK) method, suggested by Serra, Nomen and Sempere offers two major advantages: the possibility of separation of two or more steps of a complex decomposition reaction; and the possibility of discrimination between the conversion, with regard to the temperature functions of a rate equation. Comparative data of FD, BS and modified version of NPK method are presented for decomposition of three compounds used as polyisocyanate stabilizer." .

While Spanish is the official language in Nicaragua, many indigenous languages, such as Miskito and Sumo-Mayangna, are also spoken – especially in the Atlantic coastal region. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport recognises the need for a flexible curriculum that reflects individual local and regional linguistic and socio-cultural characteristics, through the use of mother tongue and second language learning. The contextualisation model applied in the Atlantic coastal region of Nicaragua is therefore based on the use of a languages strategy in preparing textbooks and basic technical materials with an IBE approach, as part of the process of improving the quality of education. Thus intercultural communication is enhanced, and the need to strengthen the systematic teaching of languages, differentiating between mother tongue, second language and foreign language, is recognised. As well as explaining the contextualisation process in detail, this article discusses the conceptual differences between intercultural bilingual education (IBE) and bilingual intercultural education (BIE). The paper concludes with several recommendations for the further development of BIE in Latin America." .

We examined English and Spanish speakers’ descriptions of intentional and accidental events, and their memory for the agents of these events. English and Spanish speakers described intentional events similarly, using mostly agentive language (e.g., “She broke the vase”). However, when it came to accidental events English speakers used more agentive language than did Spanish speakers. Results from a non-linguistic memory task mirrored the patterns in language. English and Spanish speakers remembered the agents of intentional events equally well. However, English speakers remembered the agents of accidental events better than did Spanish speakers. Together these findings demonstrate that there are cross-linguistic differences in event descriptions that have important consequences for eye-witness memory." .

Early imports were followed by hybridization with the Bos javanicus subspecies of cattle. Here, we used genomic data to partition the ancestry components of PO cattle and map loci implicated in birth weight. ResultsWe found that B. javanicus contributes about 6-7 % to the average breed composition of PO cattle. Only two nearly fixed B. javanicus haplotypes were identified, suggesting that most of the B. javanicus variants are segregating under drift or by the action of balancing selection. The zebu component of the PO genome was estimated to derive from at least two distinct ancestral pools. Additionally, well-known loci underlying body size in other beef cattle breeds, such as the PLAG1 region on chromosome 14, were found to also affect birth weight in PO cattle. ConclusionsThis study is the first attempt to characterize PO at the genome level, and contributes evidence of successful, stabilized B. indicus x B. javanicus hybridization. Additionally, previously described loci implicated in body size in worldwide beef cattle breeds also affect birth weight in PO cattle." .

However, how Chinese language teachers perceive their choice of codes for teaching and communicating with international Chinese language learners remains an under-researched area. To investigate Chinese language teachers' language beliefs toward code choice in teaching Chinese as a foreign language, 24 Chinese language teachers from four universities in Beijing were invited to participate in this study. Findings indicated that although Chinese language teachers endeavored to abide by a Chinese-only principle, English was regularly and strategically employed as an international lingua franca (English as a lingua franca, ELF) for explanatory, managerial and interactive functions. The study concluded by proposing an \"ELF pedagogy\" for Chinese language teachers to consider in increasingly multilingual classrooms." .

From a critical sociolinguistic perspective, this paper analyzes the debate on the “Establishment of a European linguistic community based on the application of Anglo-French bilingualism” that took place in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 1953. This paper examines the emerging ideologies on Europe in the postwar period and their interrelation with state ideologies through the lens of language ideologies. I show the operationalization of languages as an instrument for reconciliation, for establishing a European (linguistic) community, and for positioning it in the postwar context. I highlight the terrains on which the opposition and alternative(s) to this conception were constructed. Finally, I discuss to what extent this language ideological debate has inflected the development of the Council of Europe’s current discourse on plurilingualism." .

In this study, a survey was conducted with 158 EFL learners in a university in the southern Lao PDR to explore factors that negatively impacted on their motivation to learn English. The results of factor analysis revealed that they reported five dimensions of demotivation in EFL learning, namely, difficulty to achieve linguistic accuracy, negative attitudes toward English, curriculum issues, lack of supports and resources, and foreign language anxiety. The findings of this study offered the directions to cultivate the motivation of EFL learning among the EFL learners in the Lao PDR. In addition, the findings also pointed to the possibility of viewing motivation and demotivation as the two ends of a continuum of L2 motivation; rather than describing these two notions using noncongruent frameworks as currently practiced by both L2 motivation and demotivation researchers." .

This often occurs through a process of language shift, where individuals switch from speaking one language to a different, more dominant, language. To prevent the loss of language, it is necessary to determine whether language loss is inevitable or if languages can coexist. We address this question by constructing a nonlinear system of reaction–diffusion equations to model the spread of two competing languages, u and v, which vary temporally and spatially. Language u is assumed to confer a relative status advantage to its speakers, thus individuals may convert from language v to language u. The four constant system equilibria are found. Instability and stability conditions are found for each equilibrium. We conclude that the coexistence of both languages u and v is globally stable, subject to certain constraints on the growth rate of each language and the initial values of both u and v." .

One suggests that since metalinguistic awareness is related to primary language acquisition (comprehension and production), general cognitive processes perform a limited role in metalinguistic awareness. The other suggests that since metalinguistic awareness is more closely related to secondary language acquisition (reading and writing), a greater role is assumed by general cognitive processes. There have been some indirect attempts to study the role of language and cognition with respect to second language grammaticality judgments. There is growing evidence that metalinguistic awareness is a reliable indicator of developing second language competence. Furthermore, it has been shown that language aptitude is significantly related to metalinguistic awareness. The present study was designed to investigate the statistical relationship between second language grammaticality judgments and selected cognitive and linguistic variables. The variables studied were second language proficiency, second language classroom achievement, first language reading competence, language aptitude, nonverbal intelligence, field dependence-independence, and a written grammaticality judgment test tapping the ability to recognize, and correct, deviance. Subjects were college students in advanced English-as-a-second-language classes. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the relative contribution of linguistic and cognitive variables to the individual variation demonstrated by the learners in their ability to detect deviance in English. The results showed that second language proficiency, second language achievement in the classroom, and language aptitude were significant predictors of the subjects' ability to make grammaticality judgments. First language reading competence was significantly related to subjects' ability to correct deviance. These observations are discussed in the light of: (1) the relationship among cognition, language, and metalinguistic awareness, and (2) the role of metalinguistic awareness in second language acquisition and second language learning." .

Nurit's linguistic development is compared to that of another Spanish-, Portuguese-, and Hebrew-speaking child—Noam (the author's son). Noam and Nurit's linguistic development is contrasted to that of Berman's (1977) English- and Hebrew-speaking daughter (Shelli). The simultaneous acquisition of similar (closely related languages) such as Spanish and Portuguese versus that of nonrelated languages such as English and Hebrew yields different results: Children acquiring similar languages seem to prefer maintenance as a strategy for the construction of their early lexicon, while children exposed to nonrelated languages appear to prefer reduction to a large extent (Faingold, 1990). The Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking children's high accuracy stems from a wider choice of target words, where the diachronic development of two closely related languages provides a simplified model lexicon to the child." .

It is argued that behavioral measures must be regarded as primary and linguistic measures as secondary, the latter being only a component of the former. An evaluation of the evidence leads to the following conclusions: (a) No unequivocal answer can be given to the question of whether some languages are intrinsically more difficult to learn than others; (b) second-language learning is more difficult than first-language learning, to the extent that native-speaker competence is a very difficult goal to achieve by adult second-language learners; and (c) interlingual distance is a determinant of difficulty but simple, linear relations between them or between linguistic and behavioral measures of difficulty can hardly be expected." .

This study explored whether learning French as a foreign language influences knowledge of English morphosyntax in learners of L2 French with L1 English (n=21) and learners of L3 French with L2 English (n=9). Comparing these two groups allowed us to identify whether and to what extent backwards cross linguistic influence (CLI) are different depending on whether French is L2 or L3, and whether English is L1 or L2. Accuracy on tenseaspects of English morphosyntax was measured through two tasks (Grammaticality Judgement and Proofreading). Results indicated no inhibitive influence from L2 French to L1 English, with potential enhancement of explicit knowledge when compared to a control group of English-speaking participants with no French. In contrast, influence leading to inaccuracy was observed from L3 French to L2 English in that the L3 French learners made more errors in past simple and present perfect in the GJT. Results are discussed in the context of better understanding the nature of developing grammatical systems, together with implications for future work." .

Repertoires were compared on the basis of shared song types and distances were measured between nocturnal song posts of first-order and higher-order neighbours. Our results showed that male nightingales shared fewer song types with very close and more distant neighbours than with neighbours at intermediate distances. This distribution is explained by the interaction betwee repelling and attracting components, which depends on the distance between song posts." .

In the present study, Japanese (first language; L1)–English (second language; L2) bilinguals rated 193 Japanese–English word pairs, including cognates and noncognates, in terms of phonological and semantic similarity. We show that the degree of cross-linguistic overlap varies, such that words can be more or less “cognate,” in terms of their phonological and semantic overlap. Bilinguals also translated these words in both directions (L1–L2 and L2–L1), providing a measure of translation equivalency. Notably, we reveal for the first time that Japanese–English cognates are “special,” in the sense that they are usually translated using one English term (e.g., コール /kooru/ is always translated as “call”), but the English word is translated into a greater variety of Japanese words. This difference in translation equivalency likely extends to other nonetymologically related, different-script languages in which cognates are all loanwords (e.g., Korean–English). Norming data were also collected for L1 age of acquisition, L1 concreteness, and L2 familiarity, because such information had been unavailable for the item set. Additional information on L1/L2 word frequency, L1/L2 number of senses, and L1/L2 word length and number of syllables is also provided. Finally, correlations and characteristics of the cognate and noncognate items are detailed, so as to provide a complete overview of the lexical and semantic characteristics of the stimuli. This creates a comprehensive bilingual data set for these different-script languages and should be of use in bilingual word recognition and spoken language research." .

In particular we highlight two concepts that are key to our work: language-as-resource and language-as-political. To do so, we draw on classroom data from students of Mexican origin in Tucson, USA, and students from Latin America in Barcelona, Spain. The language policies in our contexts share a message of privileging the language of instruction (English or Catalan) over other languages. Our analysis of the two sets of data points to differences in the mathematical participation of students on the basis of which language they use. We develop the argument that, even if languages other than Catalan and English are accepted and certain pedagogies may be close to a language-as-resource approach, the use of the students’ languages is politically mediated in such a way that its pedagogical value (as a medium of communication and learning) is not always taken into account in the bilingual mathematics classroom." .

Regardless of their target languages, children acquiring any language are found to start producing fewer overt subjects than adult speakers. But their production of overt subjects increases with age and quickly reaches the adult rate. Since even children acquiring null-subject languages produce overt subjects at the early stages of acquisition less often than adults, there seem to be some nonsyntactic factors which are at least partly responsible across languages for the initial nonproduction of overt subjects. Moreover, the actual subject-drop rate in a language cannot be predicted on the basis of how the language identifies null subjects. For example, we cannot predict that a \"rich-agreement\" language drops subjects more often than a \"discourse-oriented\" language or the other way around. Children instead seem to show sensitivity to actual frequencies of subject drop in their target languages. Korean data also confirm the universal tendency of more frequent subject than object drop. The subject/object drop pattern in child Korean and a cross-linguistic comparison among seven languages support performance-limitation accounts of the subject drop phenomenon in early English. The findings are most consistent with Valian's observation that early grammars show a high degree of sensitivity to characteristics of and frequency distributions in input." .

Here, we compared how monolingual speakers of Argentine Spanish recognize basic emotions from pseudo-utterances (“nonsense speech”) produced in their native language and in three foreign languages (English, German, Arabic). Results indicated that vocal expressions of basic emotions could be decoded in each language condition at accuracy levels exceeding chance, although Spanish listeners performed significantly better overall in their native language (“in-group advantage”). Our findings argue that the ability to understand vocally-expressed emotions in speech is partly independent of linguistic ability and involves universal principles, although this ability is also shaped by linguistic and cultural variables." .

Overturning more than two centuries of United States American Indian policy, NALA established the federal role in preserving and protecting Native American languages. Indigenous languages in the United States are currently experiencing unprecedented language shift and NALA is a primary federal resource for Native American language programs. This research examines the local and national contexts and interests in which NALA developed from a grass-roots Native American language movement in the 1980s. The story of NALA stands as a powerful example of traditonally disenfranchised peoples transforming power relationships and creating language policy to support their language educaton practices and goals." .

METHODSA retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of all hospitalized patients admitted to the general medicine service at a large academic center. For patients self-reported as LEP, use of interpreters during each episode of hospitalization was categorized as: 1) interpreter used by non-MD (i.e., nurse); 2) interpreter used by a non-Hospitalist MD; 3) interpreter used by Hospitalist; and 4) no interpreter used during hospitalization. We examined the association of English proficiency and interpreter use on outcomes utilizing Poisson and logistic regression models. RESULTSOf 4,224 patients, 564 (13 %) were LEP. Of these LEP patients, 65.8 % never had a documented interpreter visit, 16.8 % utilized an interpreter with a non-MD, 12.6 % utilized an interpreter with a non-Hospitalist MD and 4.8 % utilized an interpreter with a hospitalist present. In adjusted models, compared to English speakers, LEP patients with no interpreters had significantly shorter LOS. There were no differences in readmission rates and ED utilization between LEP and English-speaking patients. Compared to LEP patients with no interpreter use, those who had a physician use an interpreter had odds for a longer LOS, but there was no difference in odds of readmission or ED utilization. CONCLUSIONAcademic hospital clinician use of interpreters remains highly variable and physicians may selectively be using interpreters for the sickest patients." .

The development of phonological awareness was compared across Turkish and English-speaking kindergarten and first-grade children (n = 138). The Turkish-speakers were more proficient in both handling of the syllables and deleting final phonemes of words. These patterns were related to the characteristics of the respective spoken languages (such as the saliency of the syllable, familiarity of the nonword patterns, importance of onset or final phoneme deletion, importance of vowel harmony) and the development of phonological awareness was discussed as a function of the characteristics of spoken language, orthography and literacy instruction." .

This context provides an opportunity to analyze the universality of linguistic features identified in CMC in English. The corpus consists of 54 naturalistic dyadic conversations between Basque secondary school students, using the medium of instant messaging. Thirty-four of those students then took part in six focus group discussions so as to obtain information about their perception of the linguistic features used in instant messaging. The results indicate that the linguistic features used in CMC are in general terms similar in English and Basque with some exceptions which are related to the specific linguistic features of the Basque language." .

However, there are some who insist on Latin's superiority: Du Bellay answers them, but also exaggerates their position in order to stage a defense that has legal and military overtones. He does so in order to bring French into a dialogical relationship with Latin, as well as with other European literary languages. Although some critics have pointed out that this procedure is but one of several put forth by Du Bellay, this reading of the Deffence shows that the author valorizes it over the others by engaging in it: Du Bellay incorporates into the Deffence a number of antecedent texts in order to respond to the conditions he faces. He situates France and the French language in relation to antiquity; the relation is sketched out as a spatial one, the space being that in which the shape of modernity is emerging." .

The English and parallel Korean versions of 50 expository and 50 narrative texts from Newsweek, Popular Science and Vogue magazines were converted into Pathfinder network graphs for analysis, based on key concepts and their relative proximity relationships in the texts. Results indicate that the novel text structures obtained by this approach reveal unique, useful, and interesting linguistic differences for the English and Korean texts, confirming prior linguistic literature (Sohn 2001). Particularly, the analyses show that the expository text structures are somewhat similar between these two languages while the narrative text structures are quite different. These findings demonstrate the utility of the GIKS for representing the nature of texts as manifested in different languages. If further confirmed in other languages, this computer-based approach could offer a new way for students and instructors to interact with lesson texts by providing a visual representation of text structure, regardless of language." .

This was a qualitative study of two Taiwanese EFL undergraduate students in Taiwan, which synthesized the data from (1) three semi-structured interviews, (2) field notes, (3) an opinion survey, and (4) the participants’ reflections on journal articles. The two participants intellectually appreciated the idea of World Englishes but realized it was difficult to have a real sense of owning English. The data showed that the two participants had formed images of English native speakers and differently relied on their own values in order to identify their perceptions and feelings as English speakers within the EFL discourse. One aspired to become, or indeed saw herself as, an English-speaking American, whereas the other emphasized her Taiwanese EFL background. The findings implied that the two participants perceived non-native English speakers’ initial marginality, and thus the value of taking on a more privileged identity, to be followed by either social solitude, or empowerment within a Taiwanese context that did not necessarily embrace learners’ new English-influenced identity. EFL learners’ real understanding of the legitimacy of L1s and native culture, and their genuine and empowering awareness of the rich proliferation of World Englishes, should insofar as possible be placed at the center of foreign language education." .

Parallel to this development has been the need to internationalize individual campuses, an important aspect of which is to have a common language (or languages) used for communication. The language policies in Asian universities have been complicated by the growing presence of international students who may only understand one of the languages used as the medium of instruction, typically English. Drawing on Tinto’s integration (Leaving college: Rethinking the causes and cures of student attrition, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1987) and Spolsky’s language policy (Language management, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2009) frameworks, this exploratory, perceptual study solicits the views from 38 international students on the implementation of a bilingual education policy, especially with respect to whether the policy facilitated these sojourners’ academic and social integration at a Taiwanese university that is actively advocating internationalization. The findings suggest that Mandarin Chinese continues to be the mainstream medium of instruction and social activities, while English is used rather sparingly and on an as-needed basis. The recognition of the growing economic power of China and importance of Chinese as well as the scholarships provided may have overridden these sojourners’ integration concerns and challenges arising from the underuse of English as a lingua franca." .

He not only devoted many of his essays to linguistic questions, but raised linguistic issues in essays ostensibly devoted to other topics. Such was his passion for words that he placed language at the heart of the many subjects that interested him: religion, philosophy, history, culture, identity, love, imagination, dreams… Even thinking itself he considered to be language-driven. Is this view of the role of language really sustainable? Or did Unamuno’s creative view of language run away with him? This essay gives a succinct account of the intimate connection which Unamuno established between language and various subjects, including the emotions, and then goes on to offer a critique of Unamuno’s linguistic theory, ending with a brief explanation of Unamuno’s idiosyncratic stance." .

In the first experiment, participants told stories about their best friend and romantic partner. Variations in linguistic abstraction and gender-linked adjectives for describing their close others were examined. Participants used significantly more abstract language to describe men compared to women, possibly reflecting a gender stereotype associated with the dispositionality factor of linguistic abstraction. In a second experiment, a new group of participants judged the gender of the protagonists from the stories generated in Experiment 1, after the explicit linguistic gender cues were removed. Consistent with the dispositionality factor, linguistic abstraction moderated the effects of the gender stereotypicality of the context (masculine, feminine, or neutral) on participants’ gender judgments. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for the communication of gender stereotypes and the effects of linguistic abstraction in more naturalistic language." .

In Swedish, Norwegian, and Faroese, adjectival modification causes, for instance, a doubling of the definite article. In languages like English, Dutch, and German, however, the definite article does not double. In addition to these two patterns, two other patterns can be distinguished (instantiated by Icelandic and Danish respectively). Despite this wide range of variation, I claim that that the syntactic derivation of definite DPs with an adjective is uniform across all Germanic languages. I argue that the presence of an adjective triggers movement of D over the adjective in order to meet the licensing requirement of the adjective. I argue that the cross-linguistic variation should be attributed to two non-syntactic factors. The first factor is whether the definite article is an affix or a free morpheme. The second one is the ordering of operations in a post-syntactic morphological component of the grammar. As far as the latter factor is concerned, I propose that two operations in this component, Chain Reduction and Local Dislocation, are not inherently ordered with respect to each other. Instead, languages display parametric variation with regard to which of these two operations is applied first. In combination with differences with respect to the first factor mentioned above, this accounts for the attested variation in definiteness marking. It also offers interesting new insights into the cross-linguistic distribution of possessor doubling." .

Three experiments examined whether reading a language with grammatical gender would increase sexist attitudes. Suburban, New York high school students (N = 74, 85, 66) were randomly assigned to complete a survey of sexist attitudes in either English or a language with grammatical gender (French or Spanish). Students in the English condition expressed less sexist attitudes than students in the French or Spanish conditions, and the language used affected females more than males. When the experiment was replicated on bilingual students, similar results were found. Males also expressed more sexist attitudes than females. This study suggests that languages with grammatical gender promote sexist attitudes and have particular impact on females." .

Later it was transferred to Helsinki, the new capital of Finland. The turn of the century saw the emergence of new university level institutions in Helsinki and Turku. The explosion of the Finnish university system took place after the Second World War. Now there are 20 university level institutes. Consequently the access to university studies and other services has improved greatly. The university centre of Vaasa belongs to the new wave of universities founded from 1960 on. In the city there are now 4 units, one Finnish speaking, two Swedish speaking and one bilingual. This reflects the language structure of the area. All of the universities have had their individual development features. The Finnish speaking University of Vaasa is the biggest one. The main impact of the Vaasa universities is the participation in the rising of the level of education in Finland and its effect on economy and other development. The research institute of Vaasa University has served the surrounding areas and nation through applied research projects. The continuing education centre has served the area’s firms with many kinds of tailored courses for the management. In the humanistics influence has been through specialised language courses and multilingual immersion. A ‘newspaper university’ is one of the new forms of impact. The city has an Academic axis going through the innermost part of the city. It is divided clearly into two Finnish and one Swedish speaking area." .

Acoustic communication was studied in the trilling field cricket, Gryllus rubens.A “trilled” calling song consists of a continuous train of sound pulses, each of which was repeated at a stereotyped rate. Singing males were recorded at different temperatures. The pulse period of the calling song decreased with increasing temperature; there was less effect of temperature on pulse duration. Female phonotaxis was studied on a noncompensating, spherical treadmill. In two-stimulus (choice) playback experiments, females preferred the conspecific “trilled” song over the “chirped” calling song of a sympatric species, Gryllus fultoni.This preference persisted even when the song of G. fultoniwas 6 dB louder. Females also discriminated between synthetic trills having different pulse periods; females chose trills with the conspecific pulse period over trills having lower and higher pulse periods." .

English, but not Korean, obligatorily distinguishes support from nonsupport via basic spatial terms. Despite this linguistic difference, previous research suggests that English and Korean speakers show comparable nonlinguistic sensitivity to the support/nonsupport distinction. Here, using a paradigm previously found to elicit cross-language differences in color discrimination, we provide evidence for a difference in sensitivity to support/nonsupport between native English speakers and native Korean speakers who were late English learners and tested in a context that privileged Korean. Whereas the former group showed categorical perception (CP) when discriminating spatial scenes capturing the support/nonsupport distinction, the latter did not. An additional group of native Korean speakers—relatively early English learners tested in an English-salient context—patterned with the native English speakers in showing CP for support/nonsupport. These findings suggest that obligatory marking of support/nonsupport in one’s native language can affect nonlinguistic sensitivity to this distinction, contra earlier findings, but that such sensitivity may also depend on aspects of language background and the immediate linguistic context." .

Using an adapted sociometric methodology to combine systemic functional linguistics and sign linguistics, a survey identifies the elements of context that have an effect upon the level of linguistic formality employed by British Sign Language users. The responses of 51 participants are analysed in order to ascertain (i) the level of linguistic formality that would be employed in certain communicative scenarios, and (ii) the contextual features of these scenarios that have an influence on linguistic formality. The results obtained from this study posit that there is an overall agreement shared between British Sign Language users when choosing levels of linguistic formality based on broad contextual description alone. The people involved in the communication and their interpersonal relationships tend to be the biggest influence on the level of formality employed, whereas the topic of the interaction appears to show no significant influence upon linguistic formality on its own. This work contributes further evidence to the importance of studying language within communicative contexts and the importance of formality as an influential factor in linguistic production. It is hoped that this will encourage future studies to derive linguistic data of British Sign Language users, or indeed users of other sign languages, to corroborate these findings." .

ObjectiveBased on the previous studies that addressed the importance of students’ social skills for school success, I examined the social development of the language minority immigrant students from kindergarten to fifth grade and investigated the longitudinal effect of their social skills on their academic performance in comparison with the English-speaking mainstream students. MethodsUsing a nationally representative database, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study—Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999, the language minority student group, which was divided based on their LEP status at kindergarten, was examined and compared with the mainstream student group with respect to their development patterns and levels of social skills from kindergarten to fifth grade. In addition, the longitudinal effect of students’ social skills on their reading and math performance was estimated and tested using the two-level hierarchical growth model. ResultsLanguage minority immigrant students from families living in poverty displayed extremely unstable development in all aspects of social skills, and the positive effect of improved social skills was the largest for the group of students who displayed the most unstable social development, which were the language minority immigrant students who did not show LEP at kindergarten and who were living in poverty. ConclusionThis result suggests the needs of students living in poverty, especially language minority students, for relevant supports and intervention." .

MethodsInitially an expert committee was appointed to carry out the task of linguistic validation. This committee included the principal investigator, project coordinator and the associate project manager of the OSDS and a language consultant for each of the South Asian languages. The process of translation and validation was conducted in the following order; a) production of two independent forward translations, b) comparison and reconciliation of the translations, c) backward translation of the first reconciled version, d) comparison of the original version of SIS/SES and the backward version leading to the production of the second reconciled version and e) pilot testing and finalization. ResultsSeveral linguistic and conceptual issues arose during the process of translating the instrument. Problems were also encountered with cultural differences in acceptability of certain concepts, and with semantic difficulties in finding an appropriate translation. In addition, the researchers had to find culturally acceptable equivalents for some terms and idiomatic phrases. The problems encountered in pilot testing, during cognitive debriefing and clinicians’ review, were categorized as cultural or conceptual/semantic. Cultural issues describe the acceptability of using certain terms and phrases in a particular socio-cultural milieu. The conceptual and semantic difficulties reflect the inability to deliver the idea/meaning of a source statement in the target language. The current paper describes a selection of these issues. ConclusionsWe applied a rigorous translation method to ensure conceptual equivalence and acceptability of SIS/SES in the five different South Asian languages prior to its utilization in the OSDS. However, to complete the cultural adaptation process, future psychometric validation of the translated versions is required among the different language speakers." .

It reviews results of research on (1) the reasons, beliefs and attitudes underlying immigrant minority language parents’ and students’ choice for CLIL programmes; (2) these students’ proficiency in the languages of instruction and their academic achievement; and (3) the effects of first language typology on their second and third language proficiency. The author explores conditions and reasons for the effectiveness of CLIL pedagogy, as well as the comparative suitability of CLIL programmes for immigrant minority language students. The review shows that CLIL programmes provide a means to acquire important linguistic, economic and symbolic capital in order to effect upward social mobility. Findings demonstrate that immigrant minority language students enrolled in CLIL programmes are able to develop equal or superior levels of proficiency in both languages of instruction compared to majority language students; with previous development of first language literacy positively impacting academic language development. CLIL programmes are found to offer immigrant minority language students educational opportunities and effective pedagogical support which existing mainstream monolingual and minority bilingual education programmes may not always be able to provide. In light of these findings, the author discusses shortcomings in current educational policy. The article concludes with recommendations for further research." .

Drawing upon official documents, newspaper archives, publications, and an interview with an education official, it identifies five contributing factors and six problems in relation to policy formulation. The paper argues that the policy, jointly shaped by social, economic, educational, linguistic, and political forces, was the outcome of top-down, assumption-based, and hasty policymaking. The Chinese case exemplifies the impact of the global spread of English on foreign language policy in non-English speaking countries." .

Compound bilinguals are those who acquired their languages in a joint context and therefore are presumed to store linguistic information interdependently. Coordinates include those who acquired their languages in separate contexts and therefore are presumed to maintain independent linguistic stores. To study the usefulness of this distinction, Spanish-English and English-Spanish, compound, and coordinate bilinguals were asked to give intra-and interlingual free and restricted word associations to equivalent English and Spanish stimuli for which the responses of monolingual speakers were not equivalent. As predicted, compound bilinguals gave significantly more equivalent responses and responded significantly faster than did coordinates. However, since these differences were only modest in size, they cannot be interpreted as supporting the usefulness of the compound-coordinate distinction. None of the predictions regarding the effect of proficiency on performance were supported. Differences as a function of native language, type of association task, and association conditions were obtained and are discussed." .

The recent case of Garcia v. Spun Steak (1993, 1994) is illustrative of the challenge managers can face in dealing with cultural and linguistic diversity in the workplace. Over time, there have been conflicting messages in employment discrimination law as to the propriety of employer-imposed restrictions on the use of languages other than English in the workplace. However, the basic question involves the balancing of both the employer's right to manage the business and the right to self-expression in the language of one's choice in the workplace. Recommendations are made as to how each party's rights can be balanced under the law. What will be seen is that in the nuevo mundo of work found at the edge of the twenty-first century, the interests of both employers and employees may be best served by policies favoring language promotion over language restrictions." .

Approaches adapted from studies of multilingualism in linguistics are applied in this analysis to patterns of mixed-language speech in The Chronicle of Pierre de Langtoft, The Canterbury Tales and Piers Plowman. Cases of multilingual communication in each text demonstrate that social motivations characterize why speakers strategically select or integrate languages. In interactions between interlocutors whose identities and status differ, mixed-language speech serves to construct authority and restrict membership across social and literate groups." .

The former proves economical in situations where translation among multiple languages is involved, and can be used as a knowledge-representation scheme. But given a particular interlingua, its adoption depends on its ability (a) to capture the knowledge in texts precisely and accurately and (b) to handle cross-language divergences. This paper studies the language divergence between English and Hindi and its implication to machine translation between these languages using the Universal Networking Language (UNL). UNL has been introduced by the United Nations University, Tokyo, to facilitate the transfer and exchange of information over the internet. The representation works at the level of single sentences and defines a semantic net-like structure in which nodes are word concepts and arcs are semantic relations between these concepts. The language divergences between Hindi, an Indo-European language, and English can be considered as representing the divergences between the SOV and SVO classes of languages. The work presented here is the only one to our knowledge that describes language divergence phenomena in the framework of computational linguistics through a South Asian language." .

The study involved Japanese manufacturing companies with subsidiaries in China and investigated the language use of Japanese expatriates and Chinese office workers as well as the views of participants (including managers in Japan) about competencies deemed important for overseas work. Interview data revealed that the major languages used were Japanese and to a lesser extent Mandarin.

Twenty-two English-speakers and 31 Japanese-speakers studying Chinese at a Taiwanese University read 130 Chinese characters that varied along the dimensions of regularity, consistency, number of strokes and familiarity (frequency with which they appeared in instructional texts). The results suggest that lexical and sub-lexical features, such as regularity and consistency, play an important role in reading Chinese among Chinese language learners. Furthermore, differences between the Japanese- and English-speaking participants suggest that the first language (L1) phonology and writing system may influence Chinese character learning. In addition, the language proficiency of Chinese language learners also influences sensitivity to sublexical features in naming Chinese characters. Finally, Chinese language learners with both L1s follow the same trajectory for developing orthography-to-phonology knowledge reported for native Chinese-speaking children." .

This variability is realized with spatial semantic elements mapped across languages in very different ways onto lexical/syntactic structures. For example, satellite-framed languages (e.g., English) express Manner in the verb and Path in satellites, while verb-framed languages (e.g., French) lexicalize Path in the verb, leaving Manner implicit or peripheral. Some languages are harder to classify into these categories, rather presenting equipollently framed systems, such as Chinese (serial-verb constructions) or Greek (parallel verb- and satellite-framed structures in equally frequent contexts). Such properties seem to have implications not only on the formulation/articulation levels, but also on the conceptualization level, thereby reviving questions concerning the language–thought interface. The present study investigates the relative impact of language-independent and language-specific factors on spatial representations across three typologically different languages (English–French–Greek) combining a variety of complementary tasks (production, non-verbal, and verbal categorization). The findings show that typological properties of languages can have an impact on both linguistic and non-linguistic organization of spatial information, open new perspectives for the investigation of conceptualization, and contribute more generally to the debate concerning the universal and language-specific dimensions of cognition." .

It has now also been proved beyond any doubt that Muslim geographic thought was transmitted through Spain (Andalusia), Italy and Sicily during the Middle Ages to Europe. The Muslims had more advanced culture than did most of medieval Europe, and had made great discoveries in various fields of study (Hasan 1967). They had also preserved many of the writings of ancient Greek, Roman and other oriental civilizations. It was through Spain that the Muslims made these works as well as their own contribution available for European scholars. The centres of learning in Muslim Spain were thriving, with scholars from many places and particularly so from Europe. As Arabic was the language of culture and learning, many books were translated from Arabic into Latin and other European languages including German, French and English (Ahmed 1947; Hasan 1967; Kish 1978; James & Martin 1981; Muhammadain 1988). It is also understood that when geographical works were not translated some of the ideas and concepts revealed in them were adopted in other translated works. With the final collapse of Muslim rule in Spain (1492 AD), Muslim intellectual centres were opened to Christians from all over Europe. Indeed, translations from Arabic into European languages continued well into the 16th century, and some of the translated books remained in use until the 17th century. To ignore, as did some writers, the contribution of Muslims to geography during the Middle Ages, and to claim that the European Renaissance developed independently of what was happening in the Islamic world, is to dismiss seven centuries of Muslim leadership of world culture. Surely, no one nation or group of people can claim all the achievements of our present civilization. Present-day civilization is actually the sum total of all the past human efforts which have been accumulated over the long years of man's existence on earth, and as such there can be no gaps in human cultural history. While accepting the fact that the contribution of the various groups of people to the advancement of culture has not been the same, all are participants and have shared in its building and development. By looking at human cultural history in this spirit, it would not be difficult to appreciate the positive role played by the Arabs and Muslims in the advancement of knowledge during the Middle Ages. One of these branches of knowledge, which we have been trying to explain in this essay, is geography. To put the contribution of Arab and Muslim geographers into even more perspective, one can say that their most outstanding and original contributions, as has been stated before, were in the field of regional and mathematical geography as well as surveying. Although most of the studies were concerned with regions or individual countries, some contributions were highly specialized dealing with only one topic, such as climate or plants. The regional approach is represented by the many books written with the title: “Al-Masalik wa Al-Mamalik” or “Roads and Provinces”, and those with the title: “Al-Bilad” or “Countries”. As has been indicated earlier in this essay, treatment in these regional studies has beencomprehensive covering almost all aspects of physical and human geography. To contemporary Muslim people the science of geography will continue to be as appealing as it was to their predecessors, partly because of religious needs and partly because of the Muslim love for his environment. To sum up, in the following quotations from the Holy Quran Muslims are asked to contemplate four things: qu]Do they not look At the Camels, How they are made? And at the sky, How it is raised high? And at the mountains, How they are fixed firm? And at the Earth, How it is spread out? (Holy Quran: Sura LXXXVIII, verses 17\\2–20). The contemplation of these things does not only make Muslims sense the absolute powers of their Creator, but also makes them constantly aware of their geographical surroundings." .

Previous literature suggests language discordant clinical encounters compromise patient quality of care and health outcomes. The objective of this study was to quantify and visualize the linguistic and spatial mismatch between Ontario’s population not proficient in English or French but proficient in one of the top five non-official languages and the physicians who are proficient in the same non-official language. MethodsUsing data from the 2006 Canadian census and the 2006 Canadian Medical Directory, we determined the number of non-English/non-French (NENF) speaking individuals and the number of Ontario physicians proficient in the top five non-official languages in each census division (CD) of Ontario. For each non-official language, we produced bi-variate choropleth maps of Ontario, broken down into the 49 CDs, to determine which CDs had the highest risk of language discordant clinical encounters. ResultsAccording to the 2006 Canadian census, the top five non-official languages spoken by Ontario’s NENF population were: Chinese, Italian, Punjabi, Portuguese and Spanish. For each of the top five non-official languages, there were at least 5 census divisions with a NENF population speaking a non-official language without any primary care physicians proficient in that non-official language. The size of NENF populations within these CDs ranged from 10 individuals to 1,470 individuals. ConclusionsUnderstanding the linguistic capabilities of Ontario’s immigrant population & the linguistic capabilities of Ontario’s primary care physicians is essential to ensure equal access and quality of healthcare. As immigration continues to increase, we may find that the linguistic needs of Ontario’s immigrant population diverge from the linguistic capabilities of Ontario’s primary care physicians. Further research on the language discordance in Ontario is needed in order to reduce the risk of language discordant clinical encounters and the negative health outcomes associated with these encounters." .

The use of sexist language within official documentation allows us to assess the success of language and gender policies and the extent to which recommendations have been implemented.

It develops a core modal analysis for an imperfective operator (IMPF) within situation semantics, coupled with language-specific constraints formally encoded in modal bases. Cross-linguistic contrasts in the interpretation of imperfectives are explained in terms of variation in modal bases for IMPF, lexicalization patterns, and its interactions with other operators. The proposal accounts for why Romance languages use imperfectives to make reference to past plans while most Slavic languages do not, as well as for narrative uses specific to Romance languages, and factual uses specific to some Slavic languages. The proposal also accounts for lexically specified aspectual operators in Mẽbengokre, as well as language-specific interaction between IMPF and other modal operators, as in the Bulgarian Renarrated Mood, and two different semantic instances of Slavic Involuntary States. Appealing to cross-linguistic evidence to argue for a view according to which IMPF makes significant semantic contributions in all occurrences, the paper shows how a modal analysis can account for well-known temporal properties of imperfectives. It also demonstrates that data from closely related as well as unrelated languages provide evidence for an invariant semantic core behind imperfectivity." .

The participants were English-French bilinguals with varying degrees of secondlanguage (French) proficiency. Proficiency was operationalized as efficiency of lexical access in an animacy judgment task, as reflected in the coefficient of variability of response time adjusted for first-language performance on the same task. Attention control was operationalized as the shift cost obtained in a linguistic version of the alternating runs task-switching paradigm. Hierarchical regression revealed that, overall, attention control accounted for 59% of the variance of proficiency and that secondlanguage attention control alone accounted for 32% of the unique variance of proficiency, indicating a high degree of skill domain (second language) specificity in the relationship between attention control and proficiency. The results speak to issues regarding the development of expertise, second-language acquisition, and a cognitive linguistic approach to language and attention." .

First, its prehistory is not always clear. This makes it troublesome to identify its original meaning. Second, the multiple sources from the three schools, Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, often causecheng to be entangled with various concepts specifically affiliated to certain schools. The particular meanings of these concepts and their connections withcheng possibly mislead our effort to explore the core content ofcheng as such. Finally,cheng has been described as a force causing either “transformation” or “change.” In the former case, its influence is often exaggerated, while in the latter, it appears, more or less, mystical. However, despite all the complexity, the core content ofcheng is still identifiable. It consists of what two English terms-“sincerity” and “reality”-convey. In general, the termcheng can be properly applied to a person or thing so long as either one of them or the unity of them is present." .

As thesimplest case, we formalize the example of two grammars and show that eventhis situation leads directly to a nonlinear (quadratic) dynamical system.We study this one parameter model in a variety of situations for differentkinds of acquisition algorithms and maturational times, showing howdifferent learning theories can have very different evolutionaryconsequences. This allows us to formulate an evolutionary criterion for theadequacy of grammatical and learning theories.

MethodsNative-speaking residents of the target countries who reported urinary problems/lower urinary tract problems were asked to review a translation of the SAGA questionnaire, which was harmonized among 12 languages: Danish, Dutch, English (UK), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish. During a cognitive debriefing interview, participants were asked to identify any words that were difficult to understand and explain in their own words the meaning of each sentence in the questionnaire. The qualitative analysis was conducted by local linguistic validation teams (original translators, back translator, project manager, interviewer, and survey research expert). ResultsTranslations of the SAGA questionnaire from English to 12 European languages were well understood by the participants with an overall comprehension rate across language of 98.9%. In addition, the translations retained the original meaning of the SAGA items and instructions. Comprehension difficulties were identified, and after review by the translation team, minor changes were made to 7 of the 12 translations to improve clarity and comprehension.

Article 3 in this “Colonial Charter” dealt with language and linguistic rights. It epitomized the duality of language questions with which Belgium remained faced until Congolese independence in 1960, namely the tension between the French-Dutch language question (i.e., language choices for communication among the Belgian population in the colony) and the indigenous language question (i.e., choices for communication between colonizer and colonized). As such, article 3 was the expression of a microcosm of ideologies and political considerations that surrounded language and group relations at the time of its creation. Already hard to understand by laymen in its own time, the text defies a straightforward interpretation when read today in the absence of sufficient historical and contextual information. Presented in this paper are the following: an account of the article’s genesis, a sentence-by-sentence exegesis and an examination of some of its consequences. These are followed by a discussion of the theoretical significance of a historical case study of this kind for better understanding the broader issue of linguistic human rights." .

Various attempts have been made to locate the area of domestication of Brassica oleracea crops (i.e., cole crops). Contrasting hypotheses suggest either a North Atlantic or a Mediterranean origin. In the absence of archaeological proof, linguistic and literary considerations can offer some insight into this issue. Expressions indicating a deep-rooted knowledge and use of these crops are present in early works of ancient Greek and Latin literature, while no trace of cole crops has been found in documents from ancient Egyptian or other Fertile Crescent civilizations. Most cole crop terminology used in modern European languages can etymologically be traced to ancient Latin or Greek roots, particularly those terms indicating the most obvious morphological feature of the primitive domesticated forms, i.e., the solid upright stem (kaulos, caulis). Celtic tradition is not documented earlier than the Christian era, other than in stone inscriptions, and there is no clear evidence of a “cole tradition” among the Celts. This paper gathers information from the linguistic, literary, and historical points of view that are compatible with the domestication of B. oleracea in the ancient Greek-speaking area of Central and East Mediterranean." .

This view highlights the ‘cues’ that are available in the input to children, as well as childrens skills in extracting relevant information and forming generalizations on the basis of the data they receive. Nativists, on the other hand, contend that language-learners project beyond their experience in ways that the input does not even suggest. Instead of viewing language acqusition as a special case of theory induction, nativists posit a Universal Grammar, with innately specified linguistic principles of grammar formation. The ‘nature versus nurture’ debate continues, as various “poverty of stimulus” arguments are challenged or supported by developments in linguistic theory and by findings from psycholinguistic investigations of child language. In light of some recent challenges to nativism, we rehearse old poverty-of stimulus arguments, and supplement them by drawing on more recent work in linguistic theory and studies of child language." .

Secondly we present REF-MACHINE, a verification system architecture integrating a linguistic analyzer and a vision system. The global system can establish whether a sentence is true or flase in a situation given through a symbolic description of a scence or directly in a real scene (given full perception equipment, a camera, and so on).

In many places adult education is also carried out in a language the majority of people do not speak. The exogenous languages, which are the languages of the former colonial powers and mastered just by a small African elite, are used in most parliaments in Africa and in most newspapers. This problem is largely ignored by the international community. An argument often put forward against using African languages as Languages of Instruction (LOIs) is that there are so many of them, and it may be problematic to select one as an LOI. But is this really the case? And does one need to select one language? The main work of the Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society (CASAS) located in Cape Town has been to harmonise the written forms of most African languages so that these languages can be used as LOIs and as languages of government and the press. This paper examines in some detail the work undertaken by CASAS, its successes and challenges. It shows that the political process of getting the harmonised languages adopted is more difficult and unpredictable than the linguistic work itself." .

It analyses the language political dispute that has developed over the language political regulation of Övdalsk, a non-standard form of Scandinavian spoken in Älvdalen in northern central Sweden. The analysis focuses on the ways in which a discursive exchange over metalinguistic categories contributes to the efficacy of a state vision of linguistic divisions. In the wake of Sweden’s ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages (ECRML), and the language political reforms in which the ratification was embedded, Övdalsk has emerged as a contentious issue. Over three decades (1990s–2010s), the question of what Övdalsk ‘is’—a ‘language’, a ‘dialect’ or something else—has surged repeatedly in political, public and scholarly deliberations (i.e. in expert reports, in policy documents and in scientific publications). Nevertheless, the interests placed in this muddled taxonomic issue have not yet been subjected to any sociolinguistic analysis. Drawing on Bourdieu’s work on the state, the article attends to the ways in which the exchange over Övdalsk has paid tribute to an increasingly entrenched symbolic order. Commenting on Sweden’s commitment to the ECRML more generally, the article accounts for how and why an officialised vision of linguistic division has been rendered symbolically effective. Accordingly, the article argues that a sensitisation to the forms of tacit agreement that underwrite contention is a suitable lens for grasping the maintenance of a political order as legitimate and effective." .

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Mandarin Chinese learners of English were imaged while performing calculations, parity judgments and linguistic tasks in their L1 (Chinese) and L2 (English). Results show that compared to L1, (1) calculation in L2 involves additional neural activation, especially in the left hemisphere, including the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area); (2) parity judgment engages similar regions for both languages, and (3) phonetic discrimination in L2 does not involve the perisylvian language (Broca’s and Wernicke’s) areas. These findings indicate that, calculation in L2, but not parity, can be processed through the L1 system, suggesting that the interaction between language and mathematics involves a specific neurocircuitry when associated with L2." .

The effect due specifically to culture has already been demonstrated by comparing samples from different countries where the same language is spoken. On the other hand, it is still not clear how differences between languages may affect norms. The present study explores this issue by collecting and comparing norms on names and many other features from French Canadian speakers and English Canadian speakers living in Montreal, who thus live in similar cultural environments. Norms were collected for the photos of objects from the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) by asking participants to name the objects, to categorize them, and to rate their familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. Names and ratings from the French speakers are available in Appendix A, available in the supplemental materials. The results show that most of the norms are comparable across linguistic groups and also that the ratings given are correlated across linguistic groups. The only significant group differences were found in viewpoint agreement and visual complexity. Overall, there was good concordance between the norms collected from French and English native speakers living in the same cultural setting." .

Among other aspects, they address what context is and what is being done while speaking. Taking these two issues as point of departure, it is worth pondering on (1) what revolves around language and what the status of nonlinguistic semiotic systems is for the philosophers of language, (2) Umberto Eco’s critique of the Philosophy of Language, which has not problematized the pre-linguistic relationship with things, and (3) how ontogenesis may shed light on this scheme where linguistic and nonlinguistic aspects are inevitably interrelated. I will reflect on the pragmatic aspects in adult-child communication at its pre-linguistic level. I will underscore the key role played by the object as a complex referent and as a tool for communication." .

It proposes that the infant does not acquire his mother tongue by mastering its grammar, whether by inference from personal experience or via an innate Language Acquisition Device such as the UG, but that the language he hears is all saved in his extremely plastic and capacious brain, where it is stored in such a way as to organize it while populating it. The brain is thus transformed into a mind by language. Support for this theory is drawn from such topics as feral children and linguistic experiments with bonobos." .

Taking an ethnographically grounded case study approach, I situate families’ choices with regards to their children’s religious (language) education within the larger linguistic, social, and cultural context, focusing on new influences on Islamic education and Arabic learning in the community and the wider region during a period of Islamic resurgence. I examine families’ religious education choices with particular attention to what they mean for children’s Arabic learning and what they say about families’ orientations toward Arabic. This article is based on a language socialization study of seven young Fulbe children into three languages (Fulfulde, Arabic, and French) at home, Qur’anic school, and public school in northern Cameroon. Changes in the religious, linguistic, and educational landscape of the region are reflected in the variation within and among four focal families with respect to how they organized and envisioned their children’s religious study and Arabic language learning. In presenting ethnographic research conducted at the intersection of religious language policy, language education policy, and family language policy, my goal is to further our understanding of how private choices are connected to forces in the public sphere, giving rise to changes in the ways faith, language, and learning are practiced and conceptualized." .

The cross-linguisitc transfer between Chinese and English has been studied by scholars from different disciplines. However, variances and inconsistencies exist among prior studies regarding the investigated linguistic domains and reported results. Therefore, a meta-analysis is needed to systematically investigate the cross-linguistic transfer between Chinese and English. This meta-analysis presents research on cross-linguistic transfer between the two languages in four domains: phonological awareness, decoding skills, vocabulary, and morphological awareness. Using 33 articles conducted in different countries, our results show small to moderate levels of transfer in the above four domains. In addition, it was found that the results were moderated by geographic location of the study and participant age. Overall, the meta-analysis indicates that English and Chinese share common linguistic features that can allow for transfer in learning between the languages. Bilingual learners can benefit in educational environments that tap into these linguistic features." .

Recent arguments stress the idea of regionalization as a multi-layered process. Using Northern Europe as a study site, three such layers are explored: territorially bounded regionalization in the voting patterns of the Eurovision Song Contest, networked regionalization in the membership of intergovernmental organizations, and fluid regionalization in the geography of language. The associated regionalization processes are explained and visualized using mixed methodologies. Across these three layers of regionalization we can see the persistence of a Scandinavian core, but various territorial, networked and fluid forms of regionalization are stretching and pulling at the edges of Nordic regionalizations." .

It is suggested that some of the problem lies in the very nature of language itself, and that further fault can be found in the particular structures of Western language. Unfortunately, however, medical language has adopted special forms and metaphors which further serve to create distance." .

Nenek is based on a crowdsourcing scheme that supports native speakers, indigenous associations, government agencies and researchers in the creation of virtual communities of minority language speakers on the Internet. Nenek includes a set of web tools that enables users to work collaboratively on language documentation tasks, build lexicographic assets and produce new language resources. This platform includes a three-stage management model to control the acquisition of existent language resources, the manufacturing of new resources, as well as their distribution within the virtual community and to the general public. In the acquisition stage, existent language resources are either automatically extracted from the web by a crawler or received through donations from users who participate in a monolingual social network. In the manufacturing stage, lexicographic and collaborative tools enable users to build new resources while the acquired and manufactured resources are published in the diffusion stage, either within the virtual community or publicly. We present a life cycle mapping scheme that registers the transformations of the language resources at each of the three stages of language resource management. This scheme also traces the utilization and diffusion of each resource produced by the virtual community. The paper includes a case study in which we present the use of the Nenek platform in a language documentation project of a Mayan language spoken in Mexico's Gulf coast region called Huastec. This case study reveals Nenek's efficiency in terms of acquisition, annotation, manufacturing and diffusion of language resources; it also discusses the participation of the members of the virtual community." .

The Japanese color terms were either phonologically similar to (i.e., loan words) or dissimilar from (i.e., traditional color terms) English color terms. For both response languages, a significant between-language Stroop effect was found despite the orthographic dissimilarity between the languages. The magnitude of the between-language interference was larger with the phonologically similar terms. These findings implicate direct links connecting phonologically similar matching words in the lexicons of proficient bilingual speakers of dissimilar languages and imply that phonological processing in lexical access occurs even when the access is done unintentionally." .

Because no study has compared the gestures of bilinguals and monolinguals in both languages, the high gesture rate could be due to transfer from a high gesture language or could result from the use of gesture to aid in linguistic access. In this study we tried to distinguish between those causes by comparing the gesture rate of 10 French–English bilingual preschoolers with both 10 French and 10 English monolinguals. All were between 4 and 6 years of age. The children were asked to watch a cartoon and tell the story back. The results showed the bilingual children gestured more than either group of monolinguals and at the same rate in both French and English. These results suggest that that the bilinguals were not gesturing because they were transferring the high gesture rate from one language to another. We argue that bilinguals might gesture more than monolinguals to help formulate their spoken message." .

The analysis is based on diachronic website data and interviews with state employees concerning the presence or absence of different languages on the websites of three central state institutions. The article reveals a linguistic homogenization of the VLL of the public sector in Norway, which is mostly due to the removal of immigrant languages from state websites. The analysis also shows an increased linguistic presence of Nynorsk (the less used written standard of Norwegian), of the indigenous Sámi language, and of English, which performs a ‘hypercentral’ function. The virtual linguistic ethnography and follow-up interviews show that the websites of the three institutions in focus exist more or less fully only in two language versions: Bokmål (the more widespread written standard of Norwegian) and English. The translations into Nynorsk and Sámi are mainly done to comply with official regulations. Furthermore, immigration, rather than leading to an increased visibility of language diversity in the VLL, can also put pressure towards homogenization. One could perhaps even go so far as to see Norway as the harbinger of change: once multilingual provision has reached a notional peak, there is a chance that more and more state institutions will cut down on ‘less than necessary’ languages online, opting instead for ‘commonsense’ English together with the respective official language(s)." .

In song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), soft song has thus far been observed only in aggressive encounters, where its production is a more reliable predictor of attack than any other signaling behavior. We used song playback to test the response of both male and female song sparrows to soft song. The design of the playback experiments took into account the existence of two classes of soft song: crystallized soft song, which consists of song types also found in the broadcast repertoire, and warbled soft song, which consists of less-structured song types not found in the broadcast repertoire. Female song sparrows responded with significantly less courtship display to the playback of crystallized soft song than to that of normal broadcast song, and response to warbled soft song was if anything lower than to that of crystallized soft song. Male song sparrows responded equally aggressively to normal broadcast song as to crystallized soft song, and equally aggressively to warbled soft song as to crystallized soft song. The female results support the conclusion that neither form of soft song functions in courtship. The male results suggest that the reliability of soft song as a signal of aggressive intent is not maintained by a receiver retaliation rule." .

This top–down language policing practice was considered as a prerequisite for secularization, westernization, and modernization of the emerging Republic. Even though it was not always explicitly stated, the engineers of this emerging nation had the intention of breaking the cultural connection with the Ottoman past. Their ultimate goal was to generate a new linguistic order in the Turkish language, both in alphabet and lexicon, and to police the linguistic conduct of the country. This linguistic legitimacy and normativity was enforced through the entire body of state institutions. However, these policies encountered acute resistance from certain sectors of the public, especially those with conservative and religious ideologies. Utilizing Blommaert et al.’s (2009) notion of language policing as a conceptual apparatus and virtual ethnography/netnography (Hine 2000, 2005; Kozinets 2002, 2009) as a methodological approach, the current inquiry examined the textual and visual cultural artifacts produced, reconstructed, and disseminated in seven focal Facebook groups which have been created to maintain the use of Ottoman Turkish script and vocabulary. The recurrent themes centering on language policing in these virtual environments indicate that the postings are usually used to convince the group members that they need Ottoman Turkish to secure their ties and reconnect with their ancestors’ cultural heritage, to provide them with instructional support and practice opportunities, and to reach out to or align the group with macro language policing practices." .

Based on analysis of the texts by leading Lithuanian linguists published in the main language and culture journals during the period of 1960–2010, the paper argues that the concept of a good, proper language is a purely political idea, produced for the sake of governance by both the Soviet authorities as well as the pro-nationalist governments. The nationalist version of a “good language” is sanitized from foreign effects; the socialist version is sanitized from bourgeois remnants and capitalist influence. In both cases, the proper language is assigned a moral value, but the ideological construct masks inequalities of power. During the post-Soviet years, due to democratization, liberalization, and growing diversity, the idea of one “good, proper language” forfeited its social significance; it remained purely a linguistic ideal. With the development of multiple language cultures and subcultures, it stands increasingly as a metaphor for the totalitarian Soviet period for its omnipresent uniformity and homogeneity." .

Many educators have claimed that, as a result of their cultural and educational backgrounds, Asian students lack the CT skills essential for academic tasks such as essay writing and debates. Other researchers, however, have argued this is due simply to the disadvantages of carrying out studies in a foreign language. In fact, there have been surprisingly few studies directly comparing Asian students’ CT skills in their first compared to their second languages. Those that have been done have tended to employ standardised CT tests which, in their discrete, short-answer format, do not accurately reflect the tasks students carry out in university courses. In this study, therefore, two classes of Japanese university students, all with TOEFL scores high enough to enter Western universities, were asked to carry out an oral and written debate, one class in Japanese and the other in English. Evaluations of their performances by independent raters revealed stark differences between the two classes in their ability to construct and deconstruct arguments, find logical inconsistencies and express themselves clearly and persuasively." .

We define suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages in an analogous way, where by factor we mean contiguous subsequence, and by subword we mean scattered subsequence. We study the state complexity (which we prefer to call quotient complexity) of operations on prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages. We find tight upper bounds on the complexity of the subword-closure of arbitrary languages, and on the complexity of boolean operations, concatenation, star, and reversal in each of the four classes of closed languages. We show that repeated applications of positive closure and complement to a closed language result in at most four distinct languages, while Kleene closure and complement give at most eight." .

The Kumaun region of Utterakhand provides a local, minority-language perspective on national-level language planning. A look at the complexity of counting India’s languages reveals language planning implicit in the Indian census. The more explicit status planning involved in the naming of official languages is explored in the Indian Constitution. An overview of India’s language-in-education policies for languages to be taught and languages to be used as media of instruction further illustrates status and acquisitions planning affecting India’s linguistic minorities. The Indian example informs and stretches the language planning frameworks used to analyze it, adding status-planning goals of legitimization, minimization, and protection. Finally, the question of what actually happens in education for linguistic minorities opens up a conversation about the pluralistic language practices common in multilingual contexts beyond the implementation of official language and education policies." .

Like English-speaking children, Chinese children were found to be able to detect relatively large sound segments (e.g., partial homophones) at the beginning and gradually progress to smaller sound segments (e.g., rhymes and tones). Tasks detecting onsets and rhymes in a “similarity format” were found to be easier for Chinese children than those in an “oddity format.” In addition, cross-linguistic comparisons indicated that Chinese children develop an awareness of initial consonants and rhymes later than their English counterparts. The possible impact from differences in the oral and written languages between Chinese and English are also discussed." .

We focus on the Spanish-speaking population in the U.S., since they have the option of accessing their news in English, Spanish or in both languages. Our audience influence hypothesis predicts that Spanish-language news will cover immigration in a more positive and informative manner than will English-language news. Thus, Latinos who use Spanish-language news may have a higher likelihood of possessing pro-immigrant sentiments than Latinos who only use English-language news. Content analysis of Spanish and English-language television news segments reveals variations in the tone and substance of these news outlets. Analysis of Latino survey respondents indicates that immigration attitudes vary by news source. Generational status also influences Latinos’ immigration attitudes, though its impact is not as great as one’s news source." .

Such a shift of emphasis reflects, in part, the \"Sprachutilitarismus\" of the Young German Movement.

Spanish/English bilinguals were subjects in a GSR linguistic conditioning experiment using two intensities of buzzer sounds (stressful conditions) and two lists of words. One word for each list functioned as the conditioned stimulus. Generalization to semantically, phonemically, and unrelated words occurred in both languages and buzzer conditions. We found a differential impact of the buzzer on the functional separation of the languages, although not in the direction predicted. We concluded that stress produced code-switching, and hence, a primitivization of the subject's cognitive and linguistic functioning is assumed to have occurred. These findings are important in understanding the way stress affects the bilingual's languages at the linguistic and cognitive levels. They are also important in understanding the role of stress in language development and in the transfer of linguistic information." .

Tests that measure language proficiency in non-native speakers are typically linked to the common European framework of reference for languages. Such tests, however, often lack the criteria to define a practically relevant degree of proficiency in English. We approach this deficit by assessing non-native speakers’ performance within a native speakers’ framework. MethodItems from two English reading assessments—the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the National Assessment (NA) for English as a foreign language in Germany—were administered to N = 427 German high school students. Student abilities were estimated by drawing plausible values in a two-dimensional Rasch model. ResultsResults show that non-native speakers of English generally underperformed compared to native speakers. However, academic track students in the German school system achieved satisfactory levels of proficiency on the PISA scale. Linking the two scales showed systematic differences in the proficiency level classifications. ConclusionThe findings contribute to the validation and international localization of NA standards for English as a foreign language. Practical implications are discussed with respect to policy-defined benchmarks for the successful participation in a global English-speaking society." .

In 2000 a ``new'' linguistic situation developed when in addition to English, which holds an overwhelming position and has been taught compulsorily since 1962, five minority languages were also recognised. In December 2005 the Swedish parliament introduced a new language policy asserting Swedish as the main - but not de jure language of the country. However in the educational arena, the situation of second foreign language teaching is often described as ``catastrophic''. The main purpose of this article is to broaden the scope of research about language policy in Sweden to include issues related to foreign language education. While this study includes the needs factor at national and individual levels, it also illustrates the assertion that ``language policy is about choice'' (Spolsky, 2004: 217)" .

What emerges is a contradictory tension between the idea of a single, unifying national vernacular and competing varieties or kinds of English. Inherent to this tension is the question of whose English (and consequently who) was to be included in the constituency of the “our” in “our English tongue”—a recurring phrase in translators' comments on their work. In a fourth and final part (pp. 517–527), these linguistic—and political—stakes are shown to have accrued around a critique, by George Puttenham inThe Arte of English Poesie (1589), of Richard Stanyhurst's translation of the opening lines of theAeneid. Specifically, this critique is taken up in the following decade (the 1590s), and the politics of its hierarchical and exclusive linguistic ideology opposed, on the one hand, by Richard Carew, in an important essay on the English language, and, on the other, by William Shakespeare, in two of his early plays, most importantly,The Merry Wives of Windsor, a play unique in the Shakespearean canon for its focus on “our English tongue,” a focus which is here precisely placed in its intertextual relation to contemporary debate surrounding Richard Stanyhurst’s translation, of Virgil'sAeneid." .

On this view, similarities between child-English and adult-German are as unsurprising as similarities between cousins who have never met. By contrast, experience-based approaches to language acquisition contend that child language matches the input, with nonadult forms being simply less articulated versions of the forms produced by adults. This paper reports several studies that provide support for the theory of Universal grammar, and resist explanation on experience-based accounts. Two studies investigate English-speaking children’s productions, and a third examines the interpretation of sentences by Japanese speaking children. When considered against the input children are exposed to, the findings of these and other studies are consistent with the continuity hypothesis, which supposes that child language can differ from the language spoken by adults only in ways that adult languages can differ from each other." .

This skill is known as orthographic processing. We examined the nature of orthographic processing in English and French for children in the first grade of a French immersion program, and the relationship between orthographic processing and reading beyond controls for mother’s education, non-verbal reasoning, English vocabulary and phonological awareness. We found that children showed greater orthographic processing skill to patterns that were common to both of their languages than to those that occurred in just one of their languages. Across both lexical and sub-lexical orthographic processing measures, scores were related to word reading within each language, beyond our control variables. There was some evidence of cross-language relationships between orthographic processing and word reading, both for lexical and sub-lexical language-shared measures of orthographic processing. These findings suggest that children’s attention to features that are common both languages might be one source of transfer of orthographic processing to reading between languages." .

Many philosophers who have reflected on these questions have presented answers that attribute a central role to conventions. In one of its boldest forms such a view runs as follows. Languages are either social entities constituted by networks of social conventions or abstract objects where when a particular community speaks a given language they do so in virtue of the conventions operative within that community. Consequently, for an individual to know a given language is for them to be party to the relevant conventions. Call this view conventionalism. In this article my aim is to evaluate conventionalism. I will argue that although there are linguistic conventions and that they do play an important role in language development and communication conventionalism should be rejected in favour of a more psychologistically orientated position." .

Supposedly, it is not or only minimally sustained by the so-called embodied knowledge. Here, drawing upon studies in contemporary neuroscience and cognitive psychology, I propose that ‘derived’ embodiment is deeply involved in competent language use and, therefore, also in interactional expertise. My argument consists of two parts. First, I argue for a strong relationship among language acquisition, language use and the real world (i.e. the world accessible to the senses). Biological constraints in very early childhood anchor language to the body. These constraints are by-products of our evolutionary peculiarity that we gain because of our physical and psychological immaturity at birth. Thus, infancy is predominantly concerned with the bodily needs and experiences of the concrete while language acquisition takes place. Particular interest in the concrete furnishes our linguistic world and installs ‘concrete’ language as the principal constituent of competent language use. Second, I argue that well-established concrete language implicitly and explicitly elicits mental representations, namely partial reactivations of sensorimotor states that occur during experience. These are stepping stones by which we subsequently make sense of expressions in new linguistic areas. Like any competent language user, the interactional expert, therefore, prompts multimodal imagination and re-enacts concrete experiences when acquiring linguistic knowledge pertaining to a specialist field. Finally, I outline the characteristics of those imaginative powers to identify mechanisms that improve interactional expertise and discuss the obvious relation between interactional expertise and ordinary knowledge acquisition after the concrete language stage." .

African languages are still marginalised by colonial languages such as French and English. Looking at other African countries in general and at the case of Burundi in detail, an analysis is made of the adopted policies aimed at promoting the use of the mother tongue as a basis for knowledge acquisition and cultural integration. Burundi has gone through a series of educational reforms both before and after gaining independence in 1962, with French and Kirundi competing as curricular teaching languages. After the integration of Burundi into the East African Community in July 2007, English and Kiswahili were added to the curriculum, complicating education policies. This article places particular emphasis on the contextual challenges that tend to impair the full implementation of the adopted policy reforms. The paper concludes by advocating for a multilingual approach in which the indigenous mother tongue serves as the basis for the acquisition of other languages in the curriculum." .

Data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study was used. The average age of participants was 17.2 years; 1,494 were females and 1,332 were males. Among 2,826 participants, 61% reported Latin American and Caribbean national origin and 39% reported Asian national origin. Findings from probit regression analysis showed that adolescents who felt discriminated against by school peers were more likely to report speaking and reading English less than “very well”. On the other hand, adolescents who felt discriminated against by teachers and counselors at school or reported perceived societal discrimination were more likely to report speaking and reading English “very well.” The results suggest youth’s English, as opposed to non-English language, as the primary venue in which perceived discrimination influences youth’s linguistic adaptation. The findings further indicate that the direction and possible mechanisms of this influence vary depending on the source of perceived discrimination." .

Vocal experience with neighboring males then leads in most cases to the deletion from the male's repertoires of all but one song type. In 2 years, settling males retained the song type that most closely resembled that of a neighbor. Focal observations in 1 year revealed that the most actively singing neighbor was the one the new birds resembled. Songs were not selected on the basis of their absolute acoustic characteristics, but rather by their resemblance to neighbors' songs. After the attrition process is complete, males retain their song for the rest of their lives. Evidence supports the hypothesis that the actual acquisition of a song need not take place at the time and place as males occupy territories. Rather, males may acquire an abundance of song models earlier in life and then select songs from this repertoire that most closely resemble those of their neighbors. The development of mature repertoires and of local dialects is the outcome of one process in this species." .

Wet rice agriculture in Korea and Japan results from a later spread, also beginning in Shandong, crossing via the Liaodong peninsula and reaching the Korean peninsula around 1500 BCE. This dispersal is associated with the Mumun archaeological culture after 1500 BCE in the Korean peninsula and the Yayoi culture after 950 BCE in the Japanese archipelago. From a linguistic standpoint, it is associated with the entry of the Japonic language family, first into the Korean peninsula, subsequently into the Japanese archipelago. The arrival of Koreanic is associated with the advent of the Korean-style bronze dagger culture and a temporary hiatus in wet rice agriculture sites around 300 BCE. Both Koreanic and Japonic are relatively shallow language families, with Koreanic the shallower of the two, consistent with the chronology above. The gap between the earliest linguistically motivated dates for these language families and the archaeological events is the result of a linguistic founders effect, providing further evidence for demic diffusion as a source for their distribution." .

Swedish, like many national languages in Europe and throughout the world, is in an awkward position. It is at the same time a strong national language with the potential to dominate other languages within national borders and a potentially dominated language with respect to English as an international language. Sweden is currently faced with balancing this delicate position in its language policies. This paper explores recent developments in status planning, particularly with respect to language rights, for Sweden's five recognized national minorities and their languages. Swedish minority language issues are situated in sociohistorical context and recent language policy initiatives are analyzed.

Often sites have people living within or nearby who speak different languages, many of which are unique and similarly endangered. Here we examine the co-occurrence of Natural WHSs with languages, as a key index of cultural diversity, to identify locations for integrative conservation opportunities aimed at protecting human and non-human diversity. Our analysis reveals many WHSs with high linguistic diversity, as well as endangered sites with associated indigenous languages and endangered languages that intersect Natural WHSs. Results identify Australia as the continent which has the greatest number of Natural WHSs, many co-occurring with highly endangered languages. Engaging speakers of indigenous languages often can help maintain nature, while efforts to conserve Natural WHSs can help preserve settings that enabled indigenous languages and cultures to emerge and persist." .

In DBMT, although the linguistic knowledge sources are still crucial, and extralinguistic knowledge might be used if available, emphasis is on indirect pre-editing through a negotiation and a clarification dialogue with the author in order to get high quality translations without revision. Authors are distinguished from “spontaneous” writers or speakers by the fact that they want to produce a “clean” final message and may be willing to enter into such dialogues. After having described the main situational, linguistic and ergonomic issues in DBMT for monolingual authors, we describe ongoing work on the LIDIA project. The typical translational situation considered is the production of multilingual technical documentation in the form of HyperCard stacks. Notable points in the linguistic design include multilevel transfer with interlingual acceptions, properties and relations, the “guided language” approach (typed textual fragments and lexical peferences), and a TEI-inspired representation of texts and structures. The current mockup, LIDIA-1.0, demonstrates the majority of these ideas on a HyperCard stack, to be translated from French into German, Russian and English.

France was the nation-state where the ideology of national language was first clearly formulated and directly extended to overseas colonies. This shows the close relationship between linguistic nationalism and imperialism. It was believed that French was the language of universal human reason and had the power to civilize people who spoke it. This myth of the \"clarté française\" and the \"mission civilisatrice\" had a strong influence on various kinds of metalinguistic discourses that created the taken-for-granted representation of French as dominant language. It is the essential strategy of language dominance to establish the hierarchy of languages as if it were natural order of things. When French was obliged to yield the status of international language to English, there emerged the ideology of \"Francophonie\" which tried to defend its privilege against the monopoly of English, but the same ideology is also directed against minorities' claims for their own linguistic human right. It could be said that these discourses form a recursive prototype of language dominance whose variations are to be found in other shapes almost all over the world." .

Or it can deny them that right. In discussions on the role of African languages, there is a tendency to confine the discussion to language in education. I argue that unless we locate the discussion in a broader context, we are not going to make much progress in extending the use of African languages beyond the home domain. The paper therefore consists of three sections. The first section looks broadly at the domains where language has an impact. The second section briefly outlines a process underway in South Africa to develop a framework for a national language policy, whilst the final section looks at the implications of this for education. Here I look at language in Education Policy in Practice. I give examples from a piece of primary research that I have conducted with Xhosa -speaking Grade 4 and Grade 7 learners who have been given pictures to describe first in Xhosa and then in English. The examples show the rich vocabulary children have when they express themselves in Xhosa and the poor vocabulary they have when they express themselves in English." .

Over the last 30 years a burgeoning literature has devoted itself to the task of researching and directing English language education in Japan, but has, by its own admission, had little success in effecting much change in what it perceives as a system incompatible with effective language learning. By surveying prominent academic studies on this topic and analysing these with reference to the policy reforms with which they interact, the paper makes explicit the linguistic and socio-political assumptions upon which this work is based and suggests that a critical awareness of these ideologies can assist in the production of sustainable language regulation." .

Second language learners in particular need specific learning strategies, which not only aim at helping them understand the linguistic structure of the language of instruction, but also enable them to remember and comprehend the many different words in this “foreign” language. For second language learners, developing reading skills and improving language abilities need to go hand in hand independent of the language. This article presents suggestions for reading lessons emphasizing vocabulary for both first and second language learners of various linguistic backgrounds. These suggestions are especially useful for reading lessons in mainstream second and third grade classrooms. Approaches to vocabulary building are discussed with particular focus on aspects to be considered for vocabulary selection (e.g. linguistic aspects); followed by recommendations on the instruction of the selected vocabulary. All the presented suggestions are based on materials developed in the context of a project in Austria, hence in a German speaking environment. Applicability of these suggestions for other languages is emphasized." .

English typically conflates MOTION with MANNER, but Japanese and Spanish typically do not. We report a set of experiments that assessed the effect of this cross-linguistic difference on participants' decisions in a similarity-judgment task about scenes containing novel animations as stimuli. In Experiment 1, which required participants to encode the stimuli briefly into memory, we observed a language effect; in Experiment 2, which required participants to analyze the same stimuli, but not remember them, the language effect disappeared. Hence, these experiments reveal a task-dependent effect, which, we argue, points to working memory as the source of the language effect observed in Experiment 1 and, potentially, other experiments that have shown a linguistic relativity effect." .

However, sometimes it comprises a phrase of several chirps in a row, with one long chirp (chirp) and a few short chirps (trills). In this study, I compared the phrase containing only chirps with that containing both chirps and trills by analyzing male songs and conducting playback experiments of male songs to females. The song analyses showed significant differences between chirps and trills for all song parameters except bandwidth. To test whether female preference differed with respect to the two phrases, I performed two-speaker playback experiments. When the same numbers of phrases were presented per unit time, females preferred the song with trills to that without trills. This result may reflect female preference for songs with greater sound density. In subsequent playback experiments, I equalized the total sound duration per unit time (duty cycle) in songs with and without trills. The numbers of females that preferred songs with and without trills did not differ significantly. This suggests that trills can attract females like chirps do, even though the two sounds have different components." .

In order to evaluate Lucy's hypothesis, we replicated his critical object classification experiment using speakers of English and Japanese, a language with a number marking system very similar to that employed by Yucatec Maya. Our results failed to replicate Lucy's findings. Both Japanese and English speakers, who were comparable in their cultural and educational backgrounds, classified objects more on the basis of shape than material composition, suggesting that Lucy's original findings may have resulted not from differences between the number marking systems of Yucatec Maya and English but rather from differences in the cultural and educational backgrounds of his experimental groups. Alternative accounts of the cognitive consequences of inter-linguistic differences in number marking systems are discussed." .

Journals published in different languages and countries play a role both as sources of data and as channels through which evidence is incorporated into local public health practice. Databases in these languages facilitate access to relevant journals, and professional education in these languages facilitates the growth of native expertise in epidemiology and public health. However, as English has become the lingua franca of scientific communication in the era of globalisation, many journals published in non-English languages face the difficult dilemma of either switching to English and competing internationally, or sticking to the native tongue and having a restricted circulation among a local readership. This paper discusses the historical development of epidemiology and the current scene of epidemiological and public health journals, databases and professional education in three Western European languages: French, German and Italian, and examines the dynamics and struggles they have today." .

For linguistic minority individuals, ongoing multilingualism is seen as delimiting the possibilities of their integration into the national society and the successful acquisition of the dominant (national) language(s). For linguistic minority groups, the maintenance/support of minority languages is viewed as a willful form of communal ghettoization, while any accommodation of public multilingualism—via, for example, bilingual education—is concurrently constructed as both an obstacle to effective communication for these groups in the wider society and a threat to their social mobility. The latter preoccupations with effective communication and social mobility also underlie recent linguistic cosmopolitan arguments in political theory that link globalization, communication and social mobility inextricably with the need for acquiring English as the global lingua franca. In this article, I critique and contest both this ongoing opposition to multilingualism, and the related privileging of English as global lingua franca, drawing primarily on political theory accounts, by way of example. Following from this, I argue that ongoing support for individual and public multilingualism provides not only greater opportunities for linguistic justice but also, counter-intuitively, facilitates wider inclusion and social mobility for linguistic minorities in an increasingly globalized world." .

The adoption of the Impact Factor as the valuation criterion for scientific activities has favoured the consolidation of English language journals in the diffusion of scientific knowledge. The vernacular languages only conserve part of their importance in certain disciplines, such as Clinical Medicine or Social Sciences and Humanities.

English was their main instructional language, and Arabic was the language spoken at home. All children attended a Heritage Language Program in Toronto where they were taught to read and write Arabic. The children were administered word and pseudo-word reading, language, and working memory tests in English and Arabic. The majority of the children showed at least adequate proficiency in both languages. There was a significant relationship between the acquisition of word and pseudo-word reading working memory, and syntactic awareness skills in the two languages. The poor readers in Arabic had lower scores on all linguistic tasks, except the visual task. There were no significant differences between bilingual English Arabic children and monolingual English-speaking children on the reading, language, and memory tasks. However, bilingual English Arabic children who had reading problems in English had higher scores on English pseudo-word reading and spelling tasks than monolingual English-speaking children with reading disabilities, probably because of positive transfer from the regular nature of Arabic orthography. In this case, bilingualism does not appear to have negative consequences for the development of language reading skills in both languages—Arabic and English—despite the different nature of the two orthographies." .

Pressure for Standard Japanese language became particularly fervent during the national mobilization campaign, which started in 1939. Following the battle of Okinawa in 1945, the Ryūkyū Islands were separated from Japan and placed under U.S. trusteeship. Although Americans sought to foster Ryūkyūan independence and considered developing Ryūkyūan as a national language, the spread of Standard Japanese continued unabatedly until reunification with Japan in 1972. American attempts to encourage the use of Ryūkyūan notwithstanding, natural intergenerational transmission ceased after 1950. The weakening language loyalty after 1945 must be accounted for by language ideologies concerning Japanese and Ryūkyūan; any successful reverse language shift must take this into account." .

The design features of the song are as follows. The basic song evolves through a series of different sounds in a fixed order. The song is produced only in the winter tropical calving grounds, just before the whales arrive on the banks. Redundancy is high in that syllables, motifs, phrases and the entire song are repeated. Low, intermediate, and high-frequency sounds are scattered throughout the song. One sound is associated with blowing. The song appears to be partially different each year and there are some differences within a year between banks which may indicate that dialects are present. It is suggested that songs from other populations are quite different. The apparent yearly changes do not occur at one point in time. Only single individuals produce the song and they are hypothesized to be young, sexually mature males. The implications of these various design features are discussed." .

Many have contended that multilingual legislation, i.e., one law enacted in different languages, is unviable when carried out by means of translation. But not many have realized that the same would also be true of drafting if their contention could be justified. My involvement in the translation of Hong Kong laws into Chinese in the run-up to 1997 exposed me to a whole world of myths and misconceptions about legal translation arising from our failure to command a clear view of the workings of language. Over the years I have endeavoured to come to grips with the problems inherent in legal translation, showing that the arguments against the possibility of exact translation, against the possibility of achieving equivalence between different language texts of the law, and against the possibility of bridging the conceptual gap between legal terminologies in different languages, are all ill-grounded and misguided. There are indeed enormous difficulties in drafting and translating multilingual law, but they are essentially of a technical nature, by no means theoretically irresolvable. The viability of multilingual legislation is simply grounded in our innate communicative intention to use signs and symbols to convey meaning. As language users, we are capable of making language work for us for any particular purpose. Just as we can translate the rules of chess from one language to another whereby players speaking different languages can play the same game called “chess”, we don’t see why we can’t do the same with multilingual legislation. The door has always been open!" .

It argues that in his prefaces, Alfred constructs a role for himself as textual mediator for the audience of his vernacular translations, or adaptations, via his use of both conventional and novel metaphors. This paper examines the ways in which secular, textual authority is presented, sustained, and negotiated by Alfred through metaphoric language in these prefaces. In particular, it explores how claims to this type of authority rely on linguistic and interpretive prowess, the rhetorical power of the vernacular, or the thematization of language itself, and are expressed through the systematic figurative association of wisdom and physical strength, an idea still very familiar today." .

The sociolinguistic context of languages present in the education system will be presented first in order to explain the categorisation of languages into ‘foreign’, ‘regional’ and ‘origin’ (which we shall translate as ‘migrant’). It will then be explained how the first two categories allow for various didactic models (partial vs total immersion, content language integrated learning models, ‘European’ and ‘international’ classes etc.),while references to migrant languages and their speakers remain limited, ambiguous and unclear. It will be argued that while recent official texts and the new curriculum for primary schools (2002) show a first acknowledgement of linguistic and cultural diversity in France, bilingualism and bilingual education are still envisaged differently according to the social status of the languages concerned." .

It is difficult to distinguish between reading problems stemming from low levels of linguistic proficiency versus more general reading/learning difficulties. There is now growing research evidence of cross-language transfer in different literacy processes. Literacy components that reflect language-independent, metacognitive/metalinguistic processes show similarities across the two languages of students. Some examples are phonological awareness, syntactic awareness, knowledge of genres and meaning-making strategies. A possible way to use cross-language transfer as a diagnostic tool is proposed. If children have had enough exposure to and possibly instruction in their first language (L1), we can assess their skills and insights in L1. For LLs who have these skills and insights in their strong L1, we can expect transfer to their second language (L2). If they do not have these skills and insights in their L2 yet, it indicates a delay due to limited language proficiency, and not because of a disability. This way LLs who just need more L2 practice and exposure can be distinguished from those LLs who truly have special needs." .

This paper is a comparison of the English translations of Piaget's The Origins of Intelligence in Children and The Construction of the Real in the Child with the French originals. Three substantial differences between the French originals and the English translations are discussed: (a) many of Piaget's biological metaphors are altered in favor of more mechanistic ones, (b) some of Piaget's metaphors are entirely eliminated, and (c) Piaget uses metaphors to construct links between similar ideas. I conclude that the French originals offer more support for the assertion of Piaget's “organismic” model, and that the reader's understanding of Piaget is hindered by the exclusion of Piaget's metaphors from the English language texts." .

We argue against the common assumption that the Japanese topic marker wa and the Korean topic marker nun exhibit equivalent structural, semantic, and discourse-pragmatic properties by showing that they in fact involve different types of definiteness. In particular, we argue that the Korean topic marker encodes “episode-old” entities; it can only refer back to an entity that has been mentioned in the current episode, and an old entity is often re-introduced using the nominative marker ka across an episode boundary. On the other hand, the Japanese topic marker marks “hearer-old” entities; it often refers to an entity that is not explicitly mentioned but still inferred or assumed to be in the common ground. We present the evidence obtained from a comparison of Bible translations in Japanese and Korean and picture-elicited written narratives." .

Testing and training is left to individual health care facilities nationwide. Bilingual staff are often used to interpret, without any assessment of their skills. Assessing interpreters’ linguistic competence and setting standards for testing is a priority. ObjectiveTo assess dual-role staff interpreter linguistic competence in an integrated health care system to determine skill qualification to work as medical interpreters. DesignDual-role staff interpreters voluntarily completed a linguistic competency assessment using a test developed by a language school to measure comprehension, completeness, and vocabulary through written and oral assessment in English and the second language. Pass levels were predetermined by school as not passing, basic (limited ability to read, write, and speak English and the second language) and medical interpreter level. Five staff-interpreter focus groups discussed experiences as interpreters and with language test. ResultsA total of 840 dual-role staff interpreters were tested for Spanish (75%), Chinese (12%), and Russian (5%) language competence. Most dual-role interpreters serve as administrative assistants (39%), medical assistants (27%), and clinical staff (17%). Two percent did not pass, 21% passed at basic level, 77% passed at medical interpreter level. Staff that passed at the basic level was prone to interpretation errors, including omissions and word confusion. Focus groups revealed acceptance of exam process and feelings of increased validation in interpreter role. ConclusionsWe found that about 1 in 5 dual-role staff interpreters at a large health care organization had insufficient bilingual skills to serve as interpreters in a medical encounter. Health care organizations that depend on dual-role staff interpreters should consider assessing staff English and second language skills." .

Individuals proved to use equivalent proportions of higher-order problem solving strategies while writing and reading in both languages. These varied with people's levels of literate expertise in their mother tongue, correlating with the qualities of written summaries they produced in both languages. Uses of these problem solving strategies appeared unrelated to participants' levels (beginning and intermediate) of second language proficiency. Analyses of the verbal reports reveal thinking processes which are common to reading and summary writing in first and second languages but which appear to vary with people's literate expertise and relevant knowledge. Findings are interpreted in relation to Cummins' (1984) theories of the cross-linguistic interdependence of cognitive-academic skills and Van Dijk and Kintsch's (1983) model of discourse comprehension. Implications are drawn for theories of bilingual cognition, further research, and instruction in second language reading and writing." .

In prenominal languages (e.g., English), adjectives usually precede nouns, whereas in postnominal languages (e.g., Portuguese), nouns usually precede adjectives. We explored the influence of such rules upon similarity judgments about, and recognition of, objects with multiple category attributes (one nominal attribute and one adjectival attribute). The results supported the hypothesized primacy effect of native-language word order such that nouns generally carried more weight for Portuguese speakers than for English speakers. This pattern was observed for judgments of similarity (i.e., Portuguese speakers tended to judge objects that shared a noun-designated attribute as more similar than did English speakers), as well as for false alarms in recognition memory (i.e., Portuguese speakers tended to falsely recognize more objects if they possessed a familiar noun attribute, relative to English speakers). The implications of such linguistic effects for the cognition of similarity and memory are discussed." .

This program parses English language texts and provides a statistical description of many linguistic features which are of interest to those involved in stylistics. In order to produce an analytical approach which goes beyond the simple reporting of linguistic data, we have selected a small number of features which characterize noticeable elements of the language used and we have written programs to facilitate statistical comparisons among texts. While EYEBALL is not automatic, the interactive parsing routines are elegant enough that the users spend most of their time confirming accurate guesses, rather than having to determine the structure of each phrase and clause. We hope that the program will be used by humanities scholars who have not previously been inclined to wrestle with the barriers of mainframe computing in the past." .

Current cognitive hypotheses of language acquisition would argue against an autonomous linguistic system and would support the notion that language emerges from more general cognitive knowledge and is throughout its development fundamentally tied to a nonlinguistic cognitive base. This paper explores this issue and presents data from case studies of children showing clear dissociations between language and nonlanguage cognitive abilities. The implications of such data are discussed. The major implications appear to be that lexical and relational semantic abilities are deeply linked to broader conceptual development but morphological and syntactic abilities are not. The development of a normal linguistic system, however, one in which grammar is systematically related to meaning, requires concurrent and concomitant linguistic and nonlingustic cognitive development." .

On the example of the texts by Boris Larin, Georgij Danilov and Lev Jakubinskij we shall compare two attitudes about unity and division of a language. If the studies by Larin and Danilov in various ways establish divisions in society and language at the end of the ’20s, in the ’30s there is a marked tendency to recognize language unity and the cohesiveness of the proletarian society, as seen in socio-linguistic analyses by Jakubinskij. The conclusion, suggested at the end of this exposition, claims that the idea of one national language grows in importance in the discourse of the Soviet linguistics at the beginning of 1930s. Disappearance of the contemporary language heterogeneity in the discourse of Soviet linguists of the period corroborates how linguistics adapts to the political conceptions of society." .

This article considers how the language of international law can be used to advance such claims, by exploring how international law, as a discourse, approaches questions of language policy. This analysis reveals that international legal texts structure their engagement with “linguistic justice” around two key concepts: equality and culture. Through a close examination of the way in which these concepts function within international legal discourse, the article suggests that this conceptual framework may sometimes constrain, as well as enlarge, the possibilities for justice for minority language speakers. Thus while international law may provide a language for challenging injustices in the linguistic sphere, limitations inherent in this discourse may also restrict its emancipatory potential." .

Based on these findings and the literature about the sensitive period for language acquisition, we expected the acquisition to be larger with children. A short subtitled cartoon was presented to Dutch-speaking children (8–12 years old). We varied the channel in which the foreign and native languages were presented (sound track and subtitles); we also looked at the effects of the existing knowledge of the foreign language (due to formal teaching at school) and the linguistic similarity between the native and the foreign language (using Danish and French as foreign languages). We obtained real but limited foreign-language acquisition and in contrast to the sensitive language-acquisition hypothesis, the learning of the children was not superior to that of adults investigated in prior studies. The acquisition here does not profit from the more formal language learning at school. Contrary to the adults, the children tend to acquire more when the foreign language is in the sound track than in the subtitles." .

Rwanda’s new English language policy aims to drop French and install English as the only language of instruction. The policy-makers frame the change as a major factor in the success of social and education reforms aimed at promoting reconciliation and peace and increasing Rwanda’s participation in global economic development. However, in Rwanda, the language one speaks is construed as an indicator of group affiliations and identity. Furthermore, Rwanda has the potential to develop a multilingual educational policy that employs its national language, Kinyarwanda (Ikinyarwanda, Rwanda), to promote mass literacy and a literate, multilingual populace. Rwanda’s situation can serve as a case study for the ongoing roles that language policy plays in the politics of power." .

A professional translation of a text represents a series of linguistic decisions made by the translator in order to convey as faithfully as possible the meaning of the original text and to produce a “natural” text from the perspective of a native speaker of the target language. The “naturalness” of a translation implies not only the grammaticality of the translated text, but also style and cultural or social specificity. We describe a program that exploits the knowledge embedded in the parallel corpora and produces a set of translation equivalents (a translation lexicon). The program uses almost no linguistic knowledge, relying on statistical evidence and some simplifying assumptions. Our experiments were conducted on the MULTEXT-EAST multilingual parallel corpus (Orwell's “1984”), and the evaluation of the system performance is presented in some detail in terms of precision, recall and processing time. We conclude by briefly mentioning some applications of the automatic extracted lexicons for text and speech processing." .

Traditional accounts suggest that this verbal structure, which is found in Spanish and other Romance languages, evolved directly from the Latin Ablative gerund. Data from historical texts, however, indicate that the Latin gerundive – an adjectival form phonologically and morphologically similar to the gerund – is the correct source of the progressive construction. Using a generative framework, this article argues that the gerundive was reanalyzed as a non-finite verb. Furthermore, this syntactic reanalysis was facilitated by the identical position of subjects and predicates in constructions containing a raising verb or an auxiliary verb." .

In Vlach Gypsy communities, formal speech is differentiated from everyday informal speech. The frames of formal speech are the narratives including songs introduced by formulae of asking permission and greeting at communal events. In the paper, the form, content and music of the song are analyzed, together with some peculiarities of language ideology revealed in the song. In terms of dichotomies the singer separates the language and speakers of his community from other variants of Romani and from other languages and their speakers. The components of speech events have their constant epithets. These are \"true\", \"pure\" and \"Romani\". Language use also implies a value order, and the speech of Gypsy communities whose value system is identical with the singer's is considered \"correct\". At the same time, the \"purely\", that is, \"correctly\" performed narrative is the expression of the ritual purity of the community and the \"correctness\" of the given value order—the social-economic-cultural construction of Vlach Gypsies." .

Certain variants are regarded as inferior and restricted in expressive capacity, and are disadvantageous. The paper suggests that it is possible to map each person's linguistic identity in two dimensions: the number of languages spoken, and the situation-specific variants of each language. Further, it is argued that the distance between a “low” variant and a “high” standard form of a language may present to the “low” learner of a standardized mother tongue a barrier just as great as that posed by the learning of a related foreign language to a speaker of the high variant. It is proposed that greater tolerance be exercised in acceptance of variation and in recognition of linguistic identity, so that this can be built on in the necessary and desirable expansion of linguistic competence, rather than being devalued. The relevance of the communicative approach to language teaching is touched on." .

The applicability of the transformation is characterized by defining a subclass of LR(k) grammars, called predictive LR(k) grammars, with the property that a grammar is predictive LR(k) if and only if the corresponding transformed grammar is LL(k). Furthermore, it is shown that deterministic bottom-up parsing of a predictive LR(k) grammar can be done by the LL(k) parser of the transformed grammar. This parsing method is possible since the transformed grammar always ‘left-to-right covers’ the original grammar. The class of predictive LR(k) grammars strictly includes the class of LC(k) grammars (the grammars that can be parsed deterministically in the left-corner manner). Thus our transformation is more powerful than the one previously available, which transforms LC(k) grammars into LL(k) form." .

Each phrase in a song contains repetitions of a particular song syllable, with repetition rates for different syllables ranging from 3 to 35 notes/s. We measured tracheal airflow and air sac pressure in order to investigate respiratory dynamics during song. Song syllables (11–280 ms) are always accompanied by expiratory tracheal airflow. The silent intervals (15–90 ms) between successive syllables are accompanied by inspiration, except for a few phrases where airflow ceases instead of reversing. Thus, the mini-breath respiratory pattern is used most often by the five birds studied and pulsatile expiration is used only occasionally. Songs and phrases accompanied by minibreaths were of longer duration than those accompanied by pulsatile expiration, presumably because the animal's finite vital capacity is not a limiting factor when the volume of air expired for one note is replaced by inspiration prior to the next. Pulsatile expiration was used for only a few syllable types from one bird that were produced at higher repetition rates than syllables accompanied by mini-breaths. We suggest that male canaries switch to pulsatile expiration only when the syllable repetition rate is too high (greater than about 30 Hz) for them to achieve mini-breaths. Changes in syringeal configuration that may accompany song are discussed, based on the assumption that changes in the ratio of subsyringeal (air sac) pressure to tracheal flow rate reflect changes in syringeal resistance." .

This barrier is even growing as scientists of more and more countries publish in their own languages. Almost all studies addressing the language barrier problem were conducted from an Anglo-Saxon perspective, limiting their scope to English-language sources or English speakers. Little research has been devoted to studying and measuring language preference among non-English-speaking scholars. This article reviews measures proposed in former studies such as the “relative own-language preference” indicator, and the “straight odds ratio”, pointing out their advantages and drawbacks. Two new refined measures (in both “raw” and normalised versions) are offered, claiming to be free of these drawbacks, and thus enabling a better and more reliable comparison between journals of different languages. Practical use of the proposed measures is illustrated by applying them to findings of a former language-citation study done on nine sociology journals." .

Over the years since the turn of the century, CLIL has gained the support of language policy and research but the model has also come under fire for its possible elitism, for the alleged lack of fundamental research behind it and for its conspicuous favoring of English-medium school, a result that flies in the face of European multilingualism. This study provides results that put an end to the empirical vacuum of how European bilingual programs function in languages other than English and the outcomes delivered when the language of instruction is French. The study presents results of the first cohort of students leaving the CLIL/EMILE program after 12 years of French instruction. Results also show and interpret the effects of multilingual programs through (inter)national languages like French in monolingual areas of Southern of Europe, most precisely in Andalusia, Southern Spain." .

The object of the language of pain is restricted to an individual experience which excludes any form of direct access by others. Speaking about pain is thus one of the most difficult forms of linguistic activities, as has been repeatedly pointed out by Wittgenstein. The difficulties involved in this type of communication are not only dependent upon individual linguistic ability but are also clearly reflected in the state and structure of the linguistic means which are at the disposal of the speakers of a language. Linguistic means vary in status and complexity with respect to the ends which they can be used for. In this paper, I discuss two aspects of communicating pain: types of expression which are involved in speaking about pain, and linguistic activities which are carried out when speaking about pain. The two aspects are interrelated. My analysis makes use of categories belonging to the theory of linguistic activity and to the extended field theory of language (an expansion of Bühler's concept of symbolic and deictic field analysis of language)." .

However, this recognition is mostly symbolic: ultimately, regional or minority languages participate in emerging definitions of France as a diverse, multilingual nation, thus reflecting the construction of a new, multicultural European identity." .

In Australia, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are striving for the re-voicing of their mother tongue and the re-practicing of their mother culture to achieve cultural renewal in the wake of over 250 years of colonisation (Williams in Recover, re-voice, re-practise. Sydney, NSW AECG Incorporated, 2013).While 120 Indigenous languages are still spoken in Australia today, little has been documented regarding the extent to which languages are learned and maintained by young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The current paper offers a unique insight by drawing upon a large-scale dataset, Footprints in Time: the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC), to describe patterns of language use and maintenance among young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Of the 580 children followed longitudinally from the first wave of the baby cohort of LSIC (aged 0–1 years) until wave 4 (aged 3–5 years), approximately one in five (19.3 %) were reported to speak an Indigenous language. Children in the study were learning up to six languages simultaneously, including English (both Standard Australian English and Aboriginal Australian English), Indigenous languages, creoles, foreign languages (other than English) and sign languages. Social and environmental factors such as primary caregivers’ use of an Indigenous language and level of relative isolation were found to be associated with higher rates of Indigenous language maintenance. These findings have important implications for identifying ways of supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children to learn and maintain Indigenous languages during early childhood, especially for children who may not have the opportunity to learn an Indigenous language in the home environment and for children living in urban areas." .

A language L⊂X* is called a language with Hotz isomorphism if there exists a grammar G with L=L(G) such that the natural homomorphism F(X)/L→H(G) is an isomorphism. The main result of this paper states that homomorphic images of sentential form languages are languages with Hotz isomorphism. This is a generalization of a result of Frougny, Sakarovitch, and Valkema on context-free languages. Hotz groups are used to obtain lower bounds for the number of productions which are needed to generate a language. Further it is shown that there are languages with Hotz isomorphism without being a homomorphic image of a sentential form language, and there are context-sensitive languages without Hotz isomorphism. The theory of Hotz monoids is used to get some results on languages generated by grammars with a symmetric set of rules." .

The central notion that individuals with different linguistic and cultural backgrounds think differently is not far from our everyday experience. If you have had the opportunity to engage in a conversation with a person whose native language is not English, you may have found that communication breaks down at times and that some concepts are not easily translated into another language. Or if you happen to be a fluent bilingual or multilingual, you may agree with those bilinguals or multilinguals who mention that they think differently in each of their language. A number of intriguing questions arise here. Is there a particular style of thinking that is natural for speakers of each language? If so, is it possible for a person to think in a different way, one that is not natural for that individual? Is this style of thinking imparted by the language, the culture, or both? These and lots of other questions have engaged the attention of anthropologists, linguists and psychologists, but the point that we are going to explore is the lexical influences on cognition considering the relationship between language, culture and cognition." .

Work began systematically in 1978 through a research centre of the Catholic University, and throughout the 1980s the government has become increasingly committed to the principle of indigenous education. In 1980 agreement was reached on a common alphabet for all indigenous languages. In the same year the government accepted that vernacular languages might be used for education, and the “Macac” educational model was devised by the Catholic University's research centre. By 1984 there were 300 bilingual primary schools, but the government then suspended its experiment. This was restored four years later, with the addition of secondary education and teacher training colleges. What is stressed by NGOs active in promoting indigenous education is not only its use of vernacular languages, but the need for intercultural exchange, recognizing in a modified curriculum the cultural values of the indigenous population and their socioeconomic reality. This change has not been understood by all government agencies, although a new Directorate for Bilingual Intercultural Education was established in 1988 to provide education for people of all ages in indigenous communities. The traditional Spanish-language formal education system has exercised a restricting influence on innovation, and the response of the dominant Spanish-speaking majority has generally been indifference." .

Although this performance difference was related to the linguistic complexity of test items in some studies, other studies did not find linguistically demanding math items to be disproportionally more difficult for language minority students than for native speakers. Furthermore, previous studies investigating the effectiveness of linguistic simplification of test items have yielded inconsistent results. We tested the impact of linguistic simplifications of mathematics test items in Germany with a specific focus on the role of academic language features included in the items. Specifically, we carried out a large-scale linguistic simplification study to test whether the performance gap between language minority students and German monolinguals is smaller when students are assessed with linguistically simplified items. We additionally determined whether students’ socioeconomic status (SES) or their language proficiency moderate the effect of linguistic simplification. The study uses data from 17,738 fourth graders, 17 % of whom sometimes or always spoke a language other than German at home. Although differences between language minority students and German monolinguals in mathematics achievement were related to differences in their language proficiency and SES, we found no significant main effects of linguistic simplification. Differential effects for language minority students emerged, however, when we took the moderator effects of SES and language proficiency into account, indicating that some language minority students may profit from linguistic simplification in elementary school." .

Almost all studies, however, were conducted from the Anglo-Saxon perspective, limiting the scope of the study to English-published sources or English-speaking scientists and research workers. The present study aimed at assessing the scope of the language preference in a social sciences field, not only among American and British scholars, but among German and French ones as well, using the technique of citation analysis. Samples including mostly 50–60 original research articles were drawn from the 1985–1994 volumes of nine leading sociology journals published in the US, UK, Germany and France and the references appended to each were scrutinized in order to determine the frequency distribution of the languages cited in each periodical. Findings clearly showed a strong preference of writers to cite material in their own language. However, the extent of this bias differed from journal to journal. The American and British writers rank first, with close to 99% of their references being in English. German scholars rank next, preferring German sources in 75% of the cases, and French scholars quote French sources in only 66% of their references. In order to calculate the new refined measure of ‘relative own-language preference’ (ROLP) indicator, the proportions of ‘language self-citation’ were related to the estimated proportions of these languages in the existing body of sociology research. This measure reveals that German sociologists have the strongest bias towards their mother-tongue, their ratio of references in German exceeding almost 12 to 28 times the expected figure according to the German language share in sociology research. Next come French sociologists (8 to 14 times) while American and British ones display the lowest own-language bias, only slightly higher than expected. Further analysis of the foreign languages preference of each group, according to a ‘mutual-use’ matrix, shows a relative low use of German and French sources by British-American sociologists." .

Recent studies have confirmed that soft song is an aggressive signal. For example, the Brownish-flanked Bush Warblers Cettia fortipes use soft song in male-male conflicts, particularly prior to attacks. Although stable signaling systems require that signals be honest on average, models predict that cheating is an acceptable strategy for some individuals or in some contexts. MethodsThis study aimed to test the reliability of soft song as an aggressive signal in the brownish-flanked bush warbler. We used mounted specimens accompanied by broadcast songs or soft songs to simulate a male attempting to invade an existing territory. ResultsWe found the mounted specimen that coupled playback of soft songs suffered more and quicker attacks from the territory owner and that the relationship between soft song and subsequent attack in the territory owner was far from perfect. We observed territory owners that both over-signaled (i.e., produced soft song but did not attack) and under-signaled (i.e., attacked without producing soft song). Under-signaling territory owners were relatively more commonly than were over-signaling territory owners, particularly in simulated intrusion that coupled playback of soft song with a mount specimen. ConclusionsWe discuss the cost of producing soft song and the potential benefit of the unreliable use of soft song and propose a new hypothesis for under-signaling with soft song; i.e., under-signaling territory owners might benefit from taking the initiative in fights." .

Learning to read and write influences the functional organization of the brain. What is universal and what is specific in the languages of the world are important issues. Most studies on healthy bilinguals indicate that essentially the same neural mechanisms are used for first and second languages, albeit with some linguistic and cultural influences related to speech and writing systems, particularly between alphabetical and nonalphabetical languages. Proficiency, age of acquisition, and amount of exposure can affect the cerebral representations of the languages. Accumulating data support the important role of working memory for acquiring high proficiency in the reading of native and second languages. It is proposed that longitudinal studies on second language acquisition are essential and that the specific problems related to second language learning in dyslexic children should have high priority." .

Examples include McCarthy's definition of LISP, Landin's SECD machine, the Vienna definition of PL/I, Reynolds' definitions of GEDANKEN, and recent unpublished work by L. Morris and C. Wadsworth. Such definitions can be classified according to whether the interpreter contains higher-order functions, and whether the order of application (i.e., call by value versus call by name) in the defined language depends upon the order of application in the defining language. As an example, we consider the definition of a simple applicative programming language by means of an interpreter written in a similar language. Definitions in each of the above classifications are derived from one another by informal but constructive methods. The treatment of imperative features such as jumps and assignment is also discussed." .

In this paper we propose to shift the gaze to the linguistic, focusing on the ways in which the new diversity becomes the site of negotiations over linguistic resources, and to widen the scope of debate. The ways in which people negotiate access to resources in increasingly diverse societies are changing. Looking at these phenomena through a sociolinguistic lens is key to a developed understanding of superdiverse societies. García proposes the term ‘translanguaging’ to refer to the multiple discursive practices in which multilingual speakers engage in order to make sense of their worlds. Translanguaging goes beyond code-switching, but incorporates it. García points out that multilinguals translanguage to include and facilitate communication with others, but also to construct deeper understandings. Translanguaging includes but extends what others have called language use and language contact among multilinguals. Rather than focusing on the language itself, translanguaging makes it apparent that there are no clear-cut boundaries between the languages of bilinguals. This paper draws on sociolinguistic ethnographic research projects which investigate the linguistic practices of children and young people in and around complementary (community-language) schools, to argue that multilingual young people in English cities access a wide range of semiotic resources in ways which are not bounded as ‘languages’. In developing a sociolinguistics of superdiversity we should look closely at practices of translanguaging, and consider the histories, geographies, and discourses which shape them." .

The dominant frequency is 4.5 kHz for T. oceanicus song (Fig. 1A) and 13.5 kHz for G. bimaculatus (Fig. IB).2.When courting males are deprived of their courtship song by wing amputation, their courtship success declines markedly but is restored when courting is accompanied by tape-recordings of their courtship songs or a synthetic courtship song with only the dominant frequency of the natural song; other naturally occurring frequency components are ineffective for restoring mating success (Figs. 4, 5).3.It has been suggested that an identified auditory interneuron, AN2, plays a critical role in courtship success. Chronic recordings of AN2 in an intact, tethered female show that AN2's response to the natural courtship song and synthesized songs at 4.5 and 13.5 kHz is similar in T. oceanicus. By contrast, in G. bimaculatus, AN2's response to the natural courtship song and synthesized song at 13.5 kHz, but not at 4.5 kHz, is similar (Figs. 2,3).4.In behavioral experiments, playback of a 30 kHz synthetic courtship song in G. bimaculatus does not restore courtship success, yet this same stimulus elicits as strong a response from AN2 as does the normal courtship song (Fig. 6). Thus, contrary to earlier work by others, we conclude AN2 is not, by itself, a critical neural link in the courtship behavior of these two species of crickets." .

Language educators explored SL mainly as a virtual learning environment where learners can interact with native speakers (e.g., Hislope, 2008; Wang, Song, Xia, & Yan, 2009). Although most studies concluded positively about using SL for language learning and teaching, none of them have solved or avoided the practical issues associated with SL. These practical issues made SLbased language learning conceptually applicable but difficult to conduct. The purpose of this study was to use SL to assist language learning without the cost of tackling SL-related problems. In this study, students from an English-as-foreign-language (EFL) class in China were assigned to develop a Chinese version of the Second Life manual by translating English materials from various media. The findings of this study indicated that SL served appropriately both as a language learning task and a motivation factor." .

As a functional category, one would expect v to be the locus of parametric variation, as predicted by Hagit Borer’s (1984) original hypothesis. Some analyses have shown that v is involved in parametric variation concerning Case (Legate 2008) and probably Object Shift (Chomsky 2001). In this article, we argue that v is also involved in other forms of cross-linguistic variation, thus extending parameter theory in some unexpected directions. In particular, we argue that v is involved in three different features of cross-linguistic variation: the order of verb and complements, their prosodic structure and the expression of focus/background articulation. Our data come from a code-switching variety called Esplugish, part and parcel of the I-language of a community of German/Spanish bilinguals. In Esplugish, as in other code-switching varieties, it is possible to switch between v (L1) and its complement VP/RootP (L2). Surprisingly, we find that the grammatical properties of the VP/RootP are those of L1 and not those of L2, a fact that we account for by arguing that the source of those properties is the v." .

The differing situation from school to school shows inconsistency in the language policy implementation. Some teachers’ views show that indigenous languages should not be forgotten.

This paper argues that the failure to enact language regime change in Taiwan can best be explained by the logic of the Taiwanese party system, which incentivized mainstream parties to play down their antagonistic Hoklo-Taiwanese and Mainland-Chinese ethnocultural cores to vie for electoral support from Hakka and Aboriginal ethnic minorities. This party logic, compounded by the DPP’s minority position in the legislature, had two implications for language policy-making in Taiwan. First, the electoral incentive for the DPP to de-radicalize its pro-Taiwan identity platform pushed the party to resort to covert ways of showing commitment to its radical faction, such as appointing language revivalists to ethnolinguistic committees. This resulted in a shift in focus from de jure language regime change to a reliance on bureaucratic channels in language policy-making. Second, the same political dynamics have discouraged parties from appealing to ethnonationalist rhetoric, prompting them to express their antagonistic ideologies of Taiwanese and Chinese nationalism through typically liberal conceptions of language rights. Appeals to linguistic human rights, however, may not have constituted a strong enough justification for substantial changes in language policy. By appealing to the political and cultural status quo, the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuo Min Tang or KMT) has had the upper hand in the debates." .

Rather than for a theory, I take it for a “model” of the kind which gives us guidance in how to organize linguistic and language-related phenomena. My comments on it are restricted to three aspects: In 2 I deal with the question of how Lehrerian sense can be empirically distinguished from Lehrerian reference as a precondition for the claim that sense relationships are in general more stable than reference relations. It seems that this very claim must already be presupposed for doing the respective empirical investigation. But in 3, I argue for the option to interpret the Lehrers’ concept of sense resp. sense vectors as intension concepts, by which move one may gain a generalized concept, so-to-say “graded analyticity”, containing Carnapian strict analyticity for language systems as the extreme case of sense vectors with maximum value. Such graded sense may also be empirically investigated in the case of normal languages. In 4, I plead for my view that what the Lehrers take for communal languages are really collections of family-resembling idiolects of individual speakers and hypotheses of individual speakers about the idiolects of their fellow speakers. This move should free us from the fiction of, and sterile discussions about, the “true” meanings of words, but nevertheless keep normal language communication possible. As a concluding remark I propose in 5 to have both: normal languages from an empirical point of view, and codified languages from a logical reconstructionist one." .

In the first experiment, recordings of the three classes of songs were played to territorial males. Responses to playback of stranger song, as measured by song rate, intensity of Song Spread display, and closest approach, were significantly stronger than to playback of neighbor song. In addition, stranger song elicited significantly more intense Song Spread displays than did self song. In the second experiment, territorial males were removed from their territories and each was replaced with speakers broadcasting recorded songs of a stranger, and of the removed male. Broadcasts of the removed male's own songs were more effective in discouraging trespassing by neighboring male redwings than were broadcasts of songs of a stranger. However, the two broadcasts did not differ in their ability to deter nonneighboring male redwings from flying through or trespassing within the speaker territory. We suggest that neighbor-stranger discrimination in the Red-winged Blackbird develops as a consequence of associative learing." .

European Union (EU) acknowledgement of “national” languages as official languages results in a privileged status for these languages vis-à-vis the minority languages with which they cohabit. This support prevents hegemony by a single language such as English, yet the EU simultaneously undermines these national languages domestically by promoting their minority language competitors. This paradox can only be understood by examining the developing model for European identity whereby identity is viewed as variable and multi-faceted, rooted in multilingual facility and the absence of a single, monolithic source of identity. If the project of creating a European identity is viewed as nation-building,it is central to consider how the issue of language diversity is addressed at the European level. The paper begins by discussing the concept of national identity and the central role that language plays in its determination, as well as what modern conceptions of language planning bring to this process. After exploring the European language terrain, the paper considers whether the EU can even be said to have a language policy. The discussion focuses on multilingual education programs, the treatment of minority languages, and the issue of languages spoken by immigrant populations. Having presented these conceptual tools and policy surveys, an analytical framework is introduced that situates the nation-building process in relation to the creation of a common European identity." .

The author notes that English serves fundamentally the interests of those for whom it is both an export commodity and a language of conquest and domination. He argues that there is no compelling reason for adopting a foreign language as a national one. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that such linguistic imposition does more harm than good. When a language is artificially imposed, students are rarely able to master it sufficiently to work comfortably in it. Not only do they fail to acquire proficiency in the foreign language; they also lose proficiency in their own languages, becoming twice disadvantaged. The author sees dependency on a foreign language, like other forms of dependency, as a liability that a nation can ill afford. He quotes Ali Mazrui who raises the question: Will Africa ever effectively \"take off\" when it is so tightly held hostage to the languages of the former imperial masters?" .

The notion of logical form is to be made sense of in terms a ‘natural logic’, a logical for natural language, whose goals are to express all concepts capable of being expressed in natural language, to characterize all the valid inferences that can be made in natural language, and to mesh with adequate linguistic descriptions of all natural languages. The latter requirement imposes empirical linguistic constraints on natural logic. A number of examples are discussed." .

The situation is often compounded by the presence of at least one foreign language that is either the official or second language. The language situation in Botswana depicts this complex pattern. Out of the 26 languages spoken in the country, including Afrikaans, a language with European roots, only two, English and Setswana, dominate the public domain; the former is the official language, the language of government, business, media and international diplomacy, while the latter is the national language, the language of instruction in Standard 1, an alternative medium of communication in Parliament, the language of deliberations in Ntlo ya Dikgosi (House of Chiefs) and the language of the media for some specific programmes. The other 23 indigenous languages are relegated to local or tribal use, resulting in a pattern of language use which depicts an “imperfect triglossia” (Batibo in English language and literature: cross-cultural currents. Cambridge Scholars, New Castle upon Tyne, 2008: 18). Also, the problem of overlaps in the functions of English and Setswana has generated the concern that the roles of these minority languages in the family and immediate community domains are gradually being eroded. There are concerted efforts, through cultural renaissance on the part of many community groups, to preserve their languages. Such instances of cultural reawakening are discussed as types of micro language planning. Using the examples of two cultural groups, Kamanakao Association (KA) and the Society for the Promotion of Ikalanga Language (SPIL), the paper argues that the non-recognition of the need to develop and support the use of Botswana’s minority languages beyond the home domain is a major reason for the resurgence of cultural associations functioning as local language advocacy groups. The paper also contends that these associations have become extremely effective in influencing language policy makers to begin to acknowledge and celebrate Botswana’s linguistic and cultural diversity as national assets. The change is indicative of the fact that the linguistic terrain is gradually shifting, a situation which might herald the emergence of an inclusive language policy that harnesses both macro and micro level language planning." .

In this research, the achievement in French, English, and mathematics of two cohorts of anglophone students in each of these program options was evaluated longitudinally through grade 6 (12 years of age). The performance of these students was compared to that of comparable anglophone and francophone control groups who were attending conventional all-English and all-French schools, respectively. In terms of approximations to native-like command of French, the French-medium option was the most effective followed by the early immersion option: students in these programs were generally indistinguishable from the French Controls on all written French language tests and in mathematics. On tests of French oral skills, however, they scored below the French Controls, the extent of disparity depending on the opportunities available for social interaction with francophones. As well, no retardation in English language development was found for any of the options, even those that provided little instruction time in English. To the contrary, anglophone students scored significantly higher than English Controls on tests of English and mathematics, and in general the more concentrated the second language component, the better they performed relative to the controls on first language skills and mathematics. The apparent transfer of competence from second language to first and the bilingual advantages involved in these results are discussed in terms of time spent on the target language, the mode of instruction, and the opportunities provided for interaction with native-speaking peers." .

First, it provides a general framework of analysis. Second, it argues that Francophonie (the French-speaking countries and communities of the world collectively) constitutes geopolitical spaces sharing linguistic, cultural, economic and institutional constructions but that it is culturally and linguistically varied. This sociopolitical context gives rise to particular ideologies of language and to the consequent need for second/foreign language didactics. The examples of France and Quebec are used to show how contexts influence these didactics. Third, from the locus of professional associations, the paper shows empirically how geographic didactic clusters are both culturolinguistically colored and continentally influenced. It concludes that dealing with diversity (didactic diversity or linguistic and cultural diversity) is not an easy task: Both second/foreign language didactics and the constituent communities of Francophonie are searching for ways of being together in a postmodern world." .

We have seen that language was crucial in the creation and perpetuation of the Chinese patriarchal system. The physical structure of the Chinese language testified to the continuing inequalities of gender within Chinese society, the roots of which revert to antiquity. The Chinese writing system that is by and for men serves to maintain patterns of behavior that reflect as well as reinforce gender inequality. We should recognize that social change creates linguistic and behavioral changes. Linguistic disparties reflect real and sustained social inequalities that can and should be changed. There is no other alternative for Chinese women seeking equality but to change the language and its usages. Once Chinese women expose the falseness of existing male meanings and encode their own language, a more objective social reality can be envisaged and perhaps ultimately achieved." .

Medieval German poets were quite aware of this phenomenon, as illustrated by Gottfried of Strasbourg’s Tristan, Wernher the Gardener’s Helmbrecht, and Oswald of Wolkenstein’s maccaronic poems. Tristan knows many languages, but he does not acquire friends with his miraculous linguistic skill, and soon enough the entire court seems to hate him and makes every effort to betray this god-like but adulterous protagonist to the king. Young Helmbrecht tries to assume the posture of a polyglot, but the more he employs foreign language phrases in the exchange with his family, the more he becomes isolated and is in danger of being excluded from his old community. Oswald, on the other hand, playfully included many different language phrases in his poetry, but met with little interest among posterity. Languages are extremely important, but those who are fluent in many might find themselves without an identity and hence without a community." .

Research questions focused on students’ responses to questions; comments and requests by the teacher; and whether the response was given in Spanish, English, or nonverbally. Four Spanish-speaking students in a school-based preschool program were chosen as participants in this study. Multiple data sources were used and included a Family Culture and Language Survey, audio taped sessions, observations, and field notes. As Spanish-speaking students responded to an English-speaking teacher, they began communicating via observation and non-verbal responses. As relationships were established, students responded using a combination of English and Spanish and used one to two English word phrases. Small group sessions, activities, and language that were consistent and repeated daily elicited more verbal response from students." .

However, this paper makes the case that language policy may also be guided, to some degree, by what these societal agents of language policy claim to know as facts in linguistics, regardless of the empirical accuracy of their knowledge. Drawing on an analysis of qualitative data from folk linguistic research on Māori language revitalisation, the paper discusses instances of the policy ideas and discourses of a cohort of young New Zealanders relying on what they claimed as facts about revitalisation. By bringing a folk linguistic perspective to language policy theory, the paper argues that space should be made to accommodate the power of folk linguistic knowledge in language policy theory." .

All three groups exhibited significant switch costs across two languages, with symmetrical switch cost in balanced bimodal bilinguals and asymmetrical switch cost in unbalanced unimodal bilinguals and bimodal bilinguals. Moreover, the relative proficiency of the two languages but not their absolute proficiency had an effect on language switch cost. For the bimodal bilinguals the language switch cost also arose from modality switching.

We broadcast recorded song from speakers attached to nestboxes, while paired boxes with silent speakers served as controls. As predicted, females were attracted to the ‘song’ boxes. Contrary to prediction, males were also attracted to the `song' boxes. Singing by male starlings may be costly because it attracts competitors for limited nesting sites, but the cost cannot be avoided due to the need to attract a mate. In a second experiment ‘simple’ song (composed of 20 different phrase types) and ‘complex’ song (40 phrase types) were played simultaneously. More males were captured at boxes where ‘simple’ song was played. Song complexity may function as an indicator of male quality and be used by male starlings to assess potential competitors." .

Females respond more strongly to eight song types than to four, and to sixteen song types than to eight. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that female song sparrows prefer large repertoires, rather than preferring normal or natural repertoire sizes (5 to 13 song types). The results with captive females might be taken to imply that females in the field prefer as mates those males with the largest repertoire sizes. This hypothesis was tested by observing pairing in a field population. In each of 2 years, there was no significant correlation between male repertoire size and date of initial pair formation. Furthermore, there was no correlation between repertoire size and the speed with which a second mate was acquired after removal of the first. It is concluded that repertoire size does not have an important influence on female choice of mates in song sparrows." .

Language is a vital part of every human culture and is a powerful social tool that we master at an early age. A second feature of humans is our ability to solve complex problems. For centuries philosophers have questioned whether these two abilities are related and, if so, what the nature of the relationship between language and thought is. At the beginning of the last century psychologists joined this debate and it is a topic that is currently generating a lot of research. Another factor in the study of language and thought is the role of culture. When we study a language from another country we see that it is not just the words and grammar that are different but the customs and traditions as well. Even the ideas of that culture and the way of dealing with life can be different. There are a number of views on the nature of the relationship between language and thought. But here we are going to explore one of those views, the linguistic relativity hypothesis (LRH), concerning that the language a speaker uses influences the way the speaker thinks." .

Spolsky (Language policy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), for example, has questioned whether the spread of English was a result of language planning, or was incidental to colonialism and globalization. Phillipson (Lang Policy 6(3):377–383, 2007) contests this view, arguing that linguistic imperialism is not based on ‘conspiracy’, and is underpinned by evidence of explicit or implicit language policy that aims to intentionally advantage some languages at the expense of others. This paper analyses Irish Sign Language policy, or lack thereof, in terms of linguistic imperialism. It does this by presenting evidence within a conceptual framework of linguistic imperialism to explore how discrimination and inequality occurs in relation to Irish Sign Language users in Ireland. The findings highlight many policies and practices that fit the linguistic imperialism paradigm including linguicism, audism, and the denial of linguistic rights. The paper, therefore, challenges some views in language policy that linguistic imperialism lacks credibility by highlighting a current case of minority language (ISL) users under imperialistic-like control of policy geared towards a dominant language (English)." .

Since it partially relies on continuous speech, its performance may vary with voice-related phonetic differences and thus across languages. The present investigation therefore assessed the AVQI’s performance in English, Dutch, German, and French. Fifty subjects were recorded reading sentences in the four languages, as well as producing a sustained vowel. These recordings were later edited to calculate the AVQI. The samples were also perceptually rated on overall dysphonia severity by three experienced voice clinicians. The AVQI’s cross-linguistic concurrent validity and diagnostic precision were assessed. The results support earlier data, and confirm good cross-linguistic validity and diagnostic accuracy. Although no statistical differences were observed between languages, the AVQI performed better in English and German and less well in French. These results validate the AVQI as a potentially robust and objective dysphonia severity measure across languages." .

To critically examine the political conditions that promote such an ethical regime, we focus on how linguistic entrepreneurship can be indexed through two distinct aspects, the motivation for and the mode of language learning. We then discuss under what circumstances the notion of linguistic entrepreneurship might be invoked and what kind of contradictions this entails.

Creating a situation where mainstream students are less wary of foreign languages and cultures, and where newcomers feel their linguistic background is being valued, provides favourable conditions for the inclusion of these newcomers in the classroom and in society. However, language classrooms in French schools rarely take any previously acquired linguistic knowledge into account, thus unconsciously contributing to the rift between multilingual learners (e.g. 1st- and 2nd-generation immigrant children, refugees, children of parents with different mother tongues) and French learners. Native French learners’ first experience of learning another language is usually when English is added as a subject to their curriculum in primary school. In some schools in France, English lessons now include the simulation of multilingual situations, designed in particular for the French “quasi-monolingual” students to lose their fear of unknown languages and “foreignness” in general. But the overall aim is to help both groups of learners become aware of the positive impact of multilingualism on cognitive abilities. However, to achieve long-term effects, this awareness-raising needs to be accompanied by maximum engagement on the part of the students. This article explores an instructional strategy termed Pluralistic Approaches based upon Unknown Languages (PAUL), which was designed to develop learning strategies of quasi-monolingual students in particular and to increase learner engagement more generally. The results of a small-scale PAUL study discussed by the author seem to confirm an increase in learner engagement leading to an enhancement of learning outcomes. Moreover, PAUL seems indeed suitable for helping to prepare the ground for social inclusion." .

These grammars differ fundamentally from the Chomsky phrase-structure grammars, and they generate a distinct class of languages. In this paper, it is shown that the local adjunct languages are actually closely related to the regular and context-free languages, despite the entirely different form of definition. The adjunct languages are obtained by closure of the finite set of strings under the set operations of union, product, and a new operation, “iterated adjunction.” This method of generating adjunct languages is of exactly the same form as that of the regular sets (closure under union, product, and Kleene star) and a more recent characterization of the CFL's derived independently by several authors. In fact, iterated adjunction is obtained by a natural modification of the “iterated substitution” operation used to generate the CFL's." .

She had been announcing that her colleague “Heather Burke and [are] putting together a list of important non-Anglo archaeologists” and was asking whether “anyone has any recommendations” for that list and, if so, whether they would email her off list. I objected strongly. This paper explains why. In doing so I am describing the degree of complexity language use has acquired in the contemporary world with old linguistic maps quickly become obsolete. To insist that English is simply the lingua franca of academic discourse is to ignore that complexity. The wide use of English as an academic lingua franca means in practice that there are very strong asymmetries not only in individual archaeologists’ abilities to express themselves competently and confidently in that language but also in what is considered appropriate or possible to express. For a language is not simply a random code with which anything might be said to anybody. Language, and the conventions that govern how a given language is to be applied, influences to a large extent even what is a sensible thing to say in a given context. Language use in archaeology is not about translating the same archaeology into different languages but about translating between different archaeologies and associated cultural practices including languages. The only sensible way forward is for WAC to promote among its members the learning of more languages—which is something the vast majority of “non-Anglo” archaeologists already knows and accepts as a fact of life.

A dense language over X is a language containing a disjunctive language. A language L is an n-dense language if for any distinct n words $$w_1, w_2, \\ldots,w_n \\in X^+,$$ there exist two words$$u, v \\in X^*$$ such that$$uw_1v, uw_2v, \\ldots uw_nv \\in L.$$ In this paper we classify dense languages into strict n-dense languages and study some of their algebraic properties. We show that for each n  ≥  0, the n-dense language exists. For an n-dense language L, n  ≠  1, the language L ∩ Q is a dense language, where Q is the set of all primitive words over X. Moreover, for a given n  ≥  1, the language L is such that $$L \\cap Q\\in D_n(X)$$, then $$L\\in D_m(X)$$ for some m, n  ≤  m  ≤  2n + 1. Characterizations on 0-dense languages and n-dense languages are obtained. It is true that for any dense language L, there exist $$w_1\\neq w_2\\in X^+$$ such that$$uw_1v,uw_2v\\in L$$ for some$$u,v\\in X^\\ast$$.

Prof. Sharifian asserts this flourishing field of research can be applied in areas such as intercultural communication, cross-cultural pragmatics, language and politics, and World Englishes. He believes Cultural Linguistics has important implications for the practice of English Language Teaching (ELT) too, especially for Teaching English as an International Language (TEIL). Professor Sharifian also touches on the notion of “metacultural competence” and how new communication technology can help language learners develop that competence. He concludes by saying that the English as an International Language and World Englishes paradigms require us to revisit how we define and assess language proficiency and that intercultural communication skills should constitute the heart of the new definitions and assessment procedures." .

Eighty two bilingual subjects were administered the two language versions of WHOQOL-100 in a cross-over design after an interval of 1 week. More than half of item-facet correlations and one-third of Cronbach α values for facets were above 0.7 in both language versions. One third of facets and domain scores were significantly different in the two language versions, though these scores had high intraclass correlation coefficients (r > 0.7). Men and women had significantly different scores on ≤ 25% and ill and well subjects on ≥ 50% of facets and domains in both language versions and the pattern of significant differences in scores was similar in the two language versions. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a reasonable fit for a four-factor structure (CFI=0.82) in and across both language versions. Results suggest that Hindi and English versions of WHOQOL-100 have some equivalence but conceptual and scalar concerns remain regarding the application of a language version (of a simultaneously developed test) to subjects from another culture, even if they are proficient in the language of administration." .

Considerable effort is invested in this, but issues addressing metonymy in the context of natural language generation have been widely ignored so far, and also comparable multilingual analyses are rather sparse. Motivated by these shortcomings, we investigate methods for representing knowledge required to express metonymic relations in several ways and in multiple languages, and we present techniques for generating these alternative verbalizations. In particular, we demonstrate how mapping schemata that enable lexical expressions on the basis of conceptual specifications to be built are derived from the Qualia Structure of Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon. Moreover, our enterprise has led to the exposition of interesting cross-language differences, notably the use of prefixed verbs and compound nouns in German, as opposed to widely equivalent expressions entailing implicit metonymic relations, as frequently found in English. A main achievement of our approach lies in bringing computational lexical semantics and natural language generation closer together, so that the linguistic foundations of lexical choice in natural language generation are strengthened." .

The question was examined with respect to the biological gender marker in English and the lack of it in Chinese. In Experiment 1, English and Chinese participants listened to stories and answered gender and non-gender related questions immediately after. It was found that, relative to the non-gender-related questions, the English participants were much faster and more accurate than the Chinese participants in answering the gender-related questions. In Experiment 2, English and Chinese participants were asked to determine which of two pictures matched the sentence shown immediately before. Relative to the non-gender-related sentences, the English participants were less slower and more accurate than the Chinese participants in responding to the gender-related sentences. The findings support the view that language can have an effect on information processing in human cognition." .

This phenomenon is crucial in terms of cognitive motivations for language use; several explanations have been proposed to account for it, among which mental simulation (Talmy in Toward a cognitive semantics, vol 1. MIT Press, Cambridge, 2000) and visual scanning (Matlock in Studies in linguistic motivation. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin and New York, pp 221–248, 2004a). The aims of this paper were to test these competing explanations and identify language-specific constraints. To do this, we compared the linguistic strategies for expressing several types of static configurations in four languages, French, Italian, German and Serbian, with an experimental set-up (59 participants). The experiment yielded significant differences for motion-affordance versus no motion-affordance, for all four languages. Significant differences between languages included mean frequency of FM expressions. In order to refine the picture, and more specifically to disentangle the respective roles of language-specific conventions and language-independent (i.e. possibly cognitive) motivations, we completed our study with a corpus approach (besides the four initial languages, we added English and Polish). The corpus study showed low frequency of FM across languages, but a higher frequency and translation ratio for some FM types—among which those best accounted for by enactive perception. The importance of enactive perception could thus explain both the universality of FM and the fact that language-specific conventions appear mainly in very specific contexts—the ones furthest from enaction." .

While there are also donor interests and donor competition involved in retaining ex-colonial languages, as well as an African elite that may profit from this system, one of the main reasons why teaching in ex-colonial languages persists lies in the fact that a large proportion of the general public still believes that the best way to learn a foreign language is to have it as a language of instruction. By contrast, research studies conducted in Africa, as well as examples from Asian countries such as Sri Lanka and Malaysia, have shown that children actually learn mathematics and science much better in local and familiar languages. Though the recent World Bank Education Strategy policy paper is entitled Learning for All, it does not specify which language learning should take place in. A claim one often hears in countries of so-called Anglophone Africa is that English is the language of science and technology, and that teaching these subjects through English (instead of teaching English as a subject in its own right as a foreign language) is best. The monolingual island of Zanzibar is in fact about to reintroduce English as the language of instruction in maths and science from grade 5 onwards in primary school. The author of this paper suggests that when it comes to language policy, some African and some Asian countries could learn from each other." .

In particular, the language of politics is distinguished by the use of specific terms and phrases which often allude to other associated meanings. This means that caution must be exercised when interpreting the terms used not only within the context of the other language, but often also within its own linguistic context. The translator or commentator has to be familiar with the language code used in the given environment and within the cultural biases of that particular society so that meanings are not lost and the often crucial connotations are not misinterpreted. Political rhetoric often employs words and language in a manipulative yet frequently subtle manner. This paper analyzes examples of shifts in language code by looking at a number of cases in Japan and their cultural construction where loss of integrity and backstage practices are at stake." .

The linguistic discipline of contact linguistics is concerned with second language acquisition and bilingualism and their impact on peoples' language production. According to contact linguists, acquiring a second or third language means less a loss of competence in the mother tongue than an enrichment of the means of expression the speaker has to hand. Instead of seeing languages as closed systems, contact linguists focus on the individual's ability to interact adequately with his environment. From this viewpoint, mixtures between two languages can be seen not as detrimental to the first language, but as a means of communication or, in literature, as a stylistic device. The example of the often neglected German-Dutch exile writer Konrad Merz shows that this idea of the individual's so called `communicative competence' is in many respects more likely to explain the influence of foreign languages on the style of exile authors than the German-centred notion of language which underlies the assumptions of the Exilforscher." .

It argues that syntactic ergativity arises when the relevant operation is sensitive to (abstract) Case. Since not all syntactic operations are sensitive to Case, it is expected that some morphologically ergative languages do not show syntactic ergativity, or even demonstrate syntactic split ergativity. As an illustration, two types of coordination reduction in Tongan (Polynesian) are examined: pea-coordination showing an ergative/absolutive pattern and mo-coordination showing a nominative/accusative pattern. It is argued that DP ellipsis in pea-coordination is a Case-sensitive operation, i.e., PF deletion based on featural identity, whereas mo-coordination involves a null pronoun and LF copying, which is based on positional identity, regardless of Case." .

One Nearctic katydid species, Neoconocephalus ensiger, ceases or pauses singing in response to bat echolocation calls. We tested the hypothesis that song cessation is an effective defence against gleaning bats (i.e., bats that take prey from surfaces). We observed Myotis septentrionalis, a sympatric bat species that uses prey-generated sounds when gleaning, attack and feed on singing N. ensiger in an outdoor flight room. These bats demonstrated a preference for the calling song of N. ensiger over a novel cricket calling song when they were broadcast from a speaker in the flight room. Bats attacked speakers broadcasting N. ensiger calling song as long as the song was continuous and aborted their attack if the sound stopped as they approached, regardless of whether a katydid was present as a physical target on the speaker. Echolocation calls were recorded during attacks and no significant differences were found between continuous and interrupted song approaches for four call parameters, suggesting that M. septentrionalis may not use echolocation to locate silent prey. Therefore, song cessation by katydids in response to ultrasound is an effective defence against gleaning bats." .

But since such an analysis cannot explain the Ancient Greek data, we combine Klein’s (Time in language, 1994) theory of tense and aspect with Egg’s (Flexible semantics for reinterpretation phenomena, 2005) aspectual coercion approach. Following Klein. (grammatical) aspect relates the runtime of an eventuality and the current time of reference (topic time). We claim that these relations can trigger aspectual selection restrictions (and subsequent aspectual coercions) just like e.g. aspectually relevant temporal adverbials, and are furthermore susceptible to the Duration Principle of Egg (Flexible semantics for reinterpretation phenomena, 2005): Properties of eventualities must be compatible with respect to the duration they specify for an eventuality. The Duration Principle guides the selection between different feasible coercion operators in cases of aspectual coercion but can also trigger coercions of its own. We analyse the interpretations of aorist and imperfective as cases of coercion that avoid impending violations of aspectual selection restrictions or of the Duration Principle, which covers cases that are problematic for de Swart’s (Nat Lang Linguist Theory 16:347–385, 1998) analysis." .

One of the most significant reasons for this is the growing importance of English. While national languages were traditionally taught as the first foreign language and English as the second foreign language throughout Switzerland, English has gained in importance, leading, in some cantons, to its earlier introduction, or/and more hours of English in the curriculum. This paper reviews these issues, taking the historical roots and institutional aspects of Swiss multilingualism into account. Current developments in language education are analysed not just as pedagogical, put as political and policy responses to the major challenges confronting the longstanding principles of diversity management in Switzerland." .

Songs with modified DS or SRP were presented to virgin females and their response songs were recorded and counted. Female preference functions were unimodal for both characters. But while in the case of SRP the obtained female preference function reached its maximum at the mean value of that character, in the case of DS females preferred modified songs with a DS slightly higher than the natural range of that character. A comparison between the obtained preference functions and the DS and SRP values measured in sympatric Isophya species (with similar song structure) suggests that the two examined characters and female preferences for them may be effective components of the species-specific mate recognition system of I. camptoxypha. Moreover DS values may also convey information about the quality of the singing male." .

Because of controversy involving technical, religious and political questions, no script for the Somali language could be agreed upon, either in the colonial era or in parliamentary years, 1960–1969. The consequences of this non-decision were considerable for Somali society. However, when the authoritarian military rulers came to the power in the early 1970s, they made a final decision in regard to script. They also issued a decree to the effect that Somali was to be the language of political and administrative discourse in the Somali Republic. That act marked the beginning of the restoration of cultural and linguistic rights for Somali society.

Combined with statistical methods borrowed from evolutionary biology, this Darwinian perspective has brought new opportunities to the study of the evolution of human languages.

The articles in this special issue of Language Policy advance this line of inquiry through their shared focus on what happens to languages and their speakers as they move into the realm of commodification. Many of the articles build from Duchêne and Heller’s seminal work theorizing the transformation in how language is valued in the context of new economies. My discussion contextualizes these pieces by linking them to ongoing conversations within linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, and aligned fields about the changing role of and potentials for language to be an economic object as well as practice. The growth of neoliberal ideologies and policies has facilitated transformations in the relationships of speakers to their languages, and moved much linguistic activity into the realm of exchange. Building from the specific cases included here, which in large part focus on the moments in which languages and their speakers enter into the market (or fail to), this discussion piece focuses on how linguistic value is produced in moments of production, contexts of circulation, and processes of production, in order to highlight the importance of documenting and analyzing the shifting political economic conditions within which speakers and languages are caught up as well as the choices that face them as they negotiate this complex terrain." .

We tested the hypothesis that this pattern is achieved through vocal flexibility, by which individuals add elements to their songs when noise increases; we also tested whether males modulate other song attributes and song output with noise. To this end, we did a playback experiment with free-living males where we recorded their songs during three noise treatments: first ambient noise (FAN), high urban noise (HUN), and second ambient noise (SAN) treatments. We counted the number of song elements and measured acoustic attributes both in the whole song and in the song terminal element (T). Males did not modify the number of song elements, nor song minimum frequency, with noise. The T minimum frequency slightly increased during SAN when compared to the FAN and HUN treatments, but it did not differ between the HUN and FAN treatments. Thus, we interpret these results as a lack of reliable evidence of immediate noise-induced song flexibility in frequency parameters. Song entropy decayed during the trials, but this seemed to be an effect of time and not a noise-induced change. Vermilion flycatchers appear to be less capable of modulating spectral song attributes to cope with noise than many oscines. We discuss other potential strategies that this species may use to deal with noise and a possible mechanism by which males end up singing longer songs in noisier territories (natural selection)." .

Higher proficiency in the language and experience of having been married indicated a lower vulnerability. Vulnerability defined by onset time may share a certain common ground with liability defined by prevalence." .

It provides initial considerations of a poststructuralist, non-heteronormative language policy for German and English—two languages whose structural make-up differs fundamentally with respect to gender representation. Gendered structure types (lexical, grammatical, social, referential gender; agreement patterns) and their relevance in the two languages are outlined. Three main strands of verbal hygiene in language, gender and sexuality studies (and their language policy strategies) are differentiated: non-sexist, LGBT-friendly and non-heteronormative language policies. The main focus is a specific type of non-heteronormative language policy, namely one which is guided by Queer Linguistic as well as applied linguistic principles. Gender neutralisation is found to be the most useful strategy in this respect. Whereas this strategy is usually unproblematic in English, the existence of a grammatical masculine–feminine contrast in German in some cases renders non-heteronormative language use impossible. It is argued that, in tune with a poststructuralist conceptualisation of language, Queer Linguistic intervention should not aim at changing the language system but at affecting the formation of gender and sexuality at the discursive level." .

New evidence points to improvements in understanding decipherment as a discipline and social practice, the origins of Maya script, the use and meaning of glyphs in ancient society, and the language and sociolinguistic implications of Maya texts. The glyphs reveal information about Maya kingship and its relation to supernatural forces along with cues to a synthesis of history during the Classic period (A.D. 250–850). A test case from Piedras Negras, Guatemala, relates such discoveries to the ongoing excavation of a Classic city with abundant inscriptions." .

Within the scope of this essay, there are predominantly two ways in which novel terms and expressions are created leading to language change: formally through remodelling and semantically through figurative language. Consider some of the words for nakedness. There is the orthophemistic term nude, from Latin nudus, often used of photographic or painted representations of naked women and, much more rarely, of a naked man—hence the marked term male nude. Whether a nude is artistic or pornographic depends on the viewer belief. A colloquial Australian euphemism for being in the nude is in the nuddie. Other euphemisms include as nature intended, in one’s birthday suit, in the altogether, and in the buff (⇐buff[alo] leather, buff skin transferred to humans). Being naked is captured by the dysphemism bare-arsed and the more euphemistic butt / buck naked in which buck ⇐ butt. The orthophemistic term stark naked and the connected colloquial euphemism starkers also arose by replacing a final /t/ with a /k/: stark ⇐ start “tail, arse”. Nudists like to go about in the open air without clothes on and, being as nature intended when in natural surroundings, are euphemistically called naturists. Such expressions display folk-culture in a remarkable inventiveness of metaphor and figurative language sourced in the perceived characteristics of whatever is being talked about. For instance, terms for tabooed objects and events provide ready-made material for the dysphemistic language of curses, insults, epithets, and expletives. The essay shows that X-phemisms (orthophemisms and/or euphemisms and/or dysphemisms) are motivated by a speaker/writer’s want to be seen to take a certain stance by upgrading, downgrading, obfuscating, and deceiving; and they extensively manifest indulgence in verbal play. Although the discussion focuses on English, the categories illustrated occur across the world’s languages, and many of them are significant for the study of language change." .

French translation and linguistic validation of the Acne-QoL have recently been completed (Acne-QoLfr). PurposeThis study sought to evaluate reliability and responsivity of the French version of the AcneQ4 (AcneQ4fr). MethodsCalculation of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and regression modeling was performed to evaluate reliability (comparing Day 0 to Day 2–3 responses) and responsivity (comparing Day 0 to Day 60+ responses). ResultsThirty-four native French-speaking acne subjects in Quebec, Canada (n = 20) and France (n = 14) completed the Acne-QoLfr on 3 occasions over 3 months (Day 0, Day 2–3, and Day 60+). Of 14 completed responses for Day 0 and Day 2–3, ICC for AcneQ4fr was 0.73 (with 95 % confidence interval (0.348, 0.905) and P value 0.001), and mean score difference was 0.85 (range of possible scores for AcneQ4fr: 0–24; P = 0.41). Of 19 completed responses for Day 0 and Day 60+, ICC for Acne-Q4fr was 0.45 (with 95 % confidence interval (0.046, 0.728) and P value 0.015) and mean score difference was 4.14 (P = 0.001). ConclusionsThe abbreviated AcneQ4fr is somewhat reflective of the entire Acne-QoLfr and by its brevity may facilitate psychometric evaluation of francophone acne patients in routine practice." .

The language investigated is St’át’imcets (Lillooet Salish). I argue that although St’át’imcets lacks overt tense morphology, every finite clause in the language possesses a phonologically covert tense morpheme; this tense morpheme restricts the reference time to being non-future. Future interpretations, as well as ‘past future’ would-readings, are obtained by the combination of covert tense with an operator analogous to Abusch’s (1985) WOLL. I offer St’át’imcets-internal evidence (of a kind not previously adduced) that the WOLL-like operator is modal in nature. It follows from the analysis presented here that there are only two (probably related) differences between St’át’imcets and English in the area of tense. The first is that St’át’imcets lacks tense morphemes which are pronounced. The second is that the St’át’imcets tense morpheme is semantically underspecified compared to English ones. In each of these respects, the St’át’imcets tense morpheme displays similar properties to pronouns, which may be covert and which may fail to distinguish person, number or gender. Along the way, I point out several striking and subtle similarities in the interpretive possibilities of St’át’imcets and English. I suggest that these similarities may reveal non-accidental properties of tense systems in natural language. I conclude with discussion of the implications of the analysis for cross-linguistic variation, learnability and the possible existence of tenseless languages." .

The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) is a formally validated scale according to the requirements for quality of life instruments. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of the instrument particularly concerning versions of the scale in different languages. MRS versions availableThe translations were performed following international methodological recommendations for the linguistic & cultural adaptation of HRQoL instruments. The first translation was done from the German original scale into English (UK & USA). The English version was used as the source language for the translations into French, Spanish, Swedish, Mexican/Argentine, Brazilian, Turkish, and Indonesian languages (attached as additional PDF files). ConclusionThe MRS scale is obviously a valuable tool for assessing health related quality of life of women in the menopausal transition and is used worldwide. The currently available 9 language versions have been translated following international standards for the linguistic and cultural translation of quality of life scales. Assistance is offered to help interested parties in the translation process." .

We tested the phonotactic attractiveness to femaleT. oceanicus of the chirp and trill components of the song by permitting crickets to choose between synthetic song models in two-choice behavioral assays. In a flight phonotaxis assay tethered flying crickets were simultaneously offered two different song models from loudspeakers located to the left and right. Song preference was indicated by postural changes associated with steering attempts. In the flight assay females preferred a song derived from the chirp component of the normal song pattern to one derived from the trill component (Figs. 3, 4A). They also preferred a song which consisted of 100% chirp over the normal song pattern, which is only 16% chirp (Fig. 6A). And, they preferred the normal song pattern to a chirp-free, trill-derived model (Fig. 5A). Two other song models, in which the percent of time occupied by the chirp was approximately twice normal, were also preferred to the normal pattern (Fig. 7). Thus, the chirp section of the song was more attractive than the trill section. Although the two components differed in their relative attractiveness, either was preferred to a heterospecific song model (Figs. 8A, 9A). Five of these experiments were also performed using a walking phonotaxis assay. Crickets were released in an arena in which two loudspeakers broadcast different song models. Song preferences were indicated by the relative number of times each loudspeaker was approached. For three experiments (Figs. 4, 5, 8) the results obtained with the walking assay were qualitatively similar to those obtained with the flight assay. In two experiments there was no apparent discrimination of the songs in the walking assay, although the songs were discriminated in the flight assay (Figs. 6, 9). Possible reasons for the differences observed between the assays are discussed." .

Their singing is characterized by a typically discontinuous performance, strict stereotypy of all song types and immediate variety in the course of a song. The songs of both species have a typical trill structure and the repeated trill syllables are composed of up to three notes. Individual repertoires of Dusky Warbler males include 60–70 song types, but each male has just 3 or 4 “favorite” song types which are produced more often than all the others and in total make up to a third of all vocal production. The rest of the vocalizations are represented by rare song types. The sequence order of different song types looks like a random process. Only a few transitions within the songs of some males appear more often than might be expected by chance. In contrast, vocalizations of the Radde’s Warbler represent a strictly determined periodic process. All song types are produced according to fixed sequences which include up to 22 different types. Because of prolonged pauses between the songs, the performance of such sequences takes up to 160–190 s. The rigid order of performance of the song types does not change even with the longest pauses (up to 20–30 s). After a pause, the male invariably executes that song type which is expected in its given place. The adaptive value of large repertoires with either fixed or random sequences of song types is discussed." .

Song type variants are different versions of a given song type and are defined by much smaller acoustic differences than those defining separate song types. The principal evidence that switching between song types functions as an aggressive signal, in song sparrows and other species, is that song type switching frequencies increase during aggressive contexts, for example during simulated territorial intrusions. We tested whether variant switching frequencies change in the same way, using playback of conspecific song to simulate intrusions. Male song sparrows showed a significant increase in variant switching frequencies during intrusion relative to before intrusion. After intrusions, variant switching frequencies returned to pre-intrusion levels. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that variant switching is a graded aggressive signal, but other interpretations are possible, for example, that variant switching is a signal of submission or represents simple production error." .

Playback of song does not elicit song matching. The tendency to approach the source of playback wanes with repeated presentation of song — the birds habituate.

The functional significance of song types and the reason for differences in song type use between British and European populations remain unclear." .

As for descriptive accounts, two approaches are noteworthy. Firstly, Anglophone scholars have dealt with legal language from a genre-based viewpoint. Secondly, French studies have focused on argumentation in judicial texts, by considering the forms of reasoning involved in it and, albeit more rarely, its linguistic constituents. This paper aims at reinforcing the linguistic component of the analysis of legal discourse, by carrying out a corpus-based genre analysis on a sample of 40 judgments. First of all, the results of the investigation of the genre structure of judgments will be presented. The comparative approach adopted will show that the differences between European and English/Irish judgments mainly concern the generic move Arguing the case. Secondly, analysis will concentrate in more detail on one of the most frequent tools used in the discursive construction of argumentation within the aforementioned move, i.e. the widely spread reporting verb HOLD. A study of its concordances suggests that it is used in all types of judgments as a meta-argumentative operator signalling either an authoritative stance taken by the Court or an equally authoritative reported argumentation of another judge or court." .

In particular, we test a proposal made by Yuan [1997, Studies in Second Language Acquisition 2, 16–32] which argues for initial full transfer of the Chinese functional category features into L2 English. Chinese speakers then readjust the features of Infl as a result of contact with English, and this requires their grammars to have obligatory subjects. However, they continue to allow null objects in their English simply because positive evidence is not available to eliminate them. The implication of Yuan’s proposal is that features of functional categories in the L2 which differ from those in the L1 are in principle resettable, which argues against the claim made by Tsimpli and Roussou [1991, UCL Workings Papers in Linquistics 3, 149–170], and Smith and Tsimpli [1995, The Mind of Savant: Language Learning and Modulority, Blackwell, Oxford.] that parameter values associated with functional categories are inaccessible to L2 learners after the critical period. The results do not lend support to Yuan’s claim that the recognition of the features of Infl in English causes Chinese speakers to unlearn null subjects while lack of positive evidence in relation to functional category features allows them to continue accepting null objects. Rather, they support the view of Tsimpli and Roussou and Smith and Tsimpli that older learners do not reset their parameters. It could be argued that learners are more successful in disallowing null matrix subjects than null arguments in other positions because they make a small adjustment to the use of topic chains while the parameter settings of Chinese are maintained. This adjustment is that one topic at the head of every sentence must be overt." .

In this paper, we further investigate the mechanisms that are responsible for such effects. In Experiment 1, we report that, for bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, exposure to compressed sentences in either language improves performance on sentences in the other language. Experiment 2 reports that Catalan/Spanish transfer of performance occurs even in monolingual speakers of Spanish who do not understand Catalan. In Experiment 3, we study another pair of languages— namely, English and French—and report no transfer of adaptation between these two languages for English—French bilinguals. Experiment 4, with monolingual English speakers, assesses transfer of adaptation from French, Dutch, and English toward English. Here we find that there is no adaptation from French and intermediate adaptation from Dutch. We discuss the locus of the adaptation to compressed speech and relate our findings to other cross-linguistic studies in speech perception." .

The particular need to accommodate the enhanced linguistic diversity among the linguistically heterogeneous Indians, previously served by Tamil, has led to the ‘semiofficial’ representation of Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, and Urdu in the language policy in recent years. Notwithstanding the choices, a majority of the target Indians prefer Hindi over the familial languages as the national status of Hindi in India better meets the multilingual aspirations of transmigrants with uncertain itineraries. The language choices of Indian parents indicate that language values derive from the range of mobility (e.g., translocal or transnational) that languages have promoted or are perceived to help chart in the future. Adopting the metaphor of cartographies of language used by Park (2014), we suggest that these cartographic perceptions pose a challenge to language policies. We attribute the cartographic mismatches between policy and individual goals to distinctions between language valuations. Through an analysis of school enrolment data and ethnographic interviews, we suggest that language in education decisions of transmigrant populations are mediated through valuations of languages that allow the widest radius of mobility across multiple sites rather than attachments to linguistic, ethnic, or national communities." .

This affects uses of spatial terms used in mathematics such as ‘in front’ and ‘behind.’ Speakers of the endangered Indigenous Australian language Iwaidja use the intrinsic frame of reference in contexts where speakers of Standard Australian English use the relative frame of reference. Children speaking Aboriginal English show patterns of use that parallel the Iwaidja contexts. This paper presents detailed examples of spatial descriptions in Iwaidja and Aboriginal English that demonstrate the parallel patterns of use. The data comes from a study that investigated how an understanding of spatial frame of reference in Iwaidja could assist teaching mathematics to Indigenous language-speaking students. Implications for teaching mathematics are explored for teachers without previous experience in a remote Indigenous community." .

This misrepresents the role of the AF in the regulation of French while overlooking the role of language ideologies, most evident in the two great dictionary projects (OED and DAF). This paper examines the actual role of the AF and other institutions in French language policy. Exploring popular linguistic representations of the AF and reiterated discourses about the relative numbers of words in English and French, we emphasize the dangers for language policy generally of reinforcing triumphalist views about English." .

Although this argument indicates a need for domain-specific constraints, it does not support their innateness. Learning from mostly positive data proceeds unproblematically in virtually all domains. Since not every domain can plausibly be accorded its own special faculty, the probative value of the argument in the linguistic case is dubious. In ignoring the holistic and probablistic nature of theory construction, the argument underestimates the extent to which positive data can supply negative evidence and hence overestimates the intractability of language learning in the absence of a dedicated faculty. While nativism about language remains compelling, the alleged ‘Logical Problem’ contributes nothing to its plausibility and the emphasis on the Problem in the recent acquisition literature has been a mistake." .

They also differed in vocabulary scores. When controlling for differences in vocabulary, no differences between the DLL and monolingual groups in accuracy were found. In addition, the DLL children used a greater proportion of literate language features in their texts than the monolinguals did. The results suggest that improving DLL children’s vocabulary would improve their writing in multiple areas. The possibility of a DLL advantage in literate language is addressed in the context of the children’s need to regularly switch between their home and school languages." .

Related primes were the translation equivalents of target words, morphologically related to targets, or phonologically related to targets. In Experiment 1, cognate translation equivalents (phonologically similar translations) showed facilitatory priming, relative to matched phonologically related primes, in conditions in which morphologically related primes showed no effect (50-msec prime exposure). Cross-language morphological priming emerged at longer prime exposure durations (66 msec), but cognate primes continued to generate more priming than did those in the morphological condition. In Experiments 2 and 3, the level of phonological overlap across translation equivalents was varied, and priming effects were measured against those for matched phonologically related primes and those in an unrelated prime condition. When measured against the unrelated baseline, cognate primes showed the typical advantage over noncognate primes. However, this cognate advantage disappeared when priming was measured against the phonologically related prime condition. The results are discussed in terms of how translation equivalents are represented in bilingual memory." .

We tested whether an oscine bird with a small repertoire size, the Yellow-bellied Tit Parus venustulus, discriminated between songs of neighbours and strangers. We carried out playback experiments on 18 males to detect the response of each male to the song of a neighbour as well as its response to the song of a stranger. In both cases the songs were broadcast from the territory boundary shared by the subject male and the neighbour. Subjects responded more aggressively to songs of strangers than neighbours. They approached the loudspeaker faster and closer, and performed more flights during playbacks of stranger songs than neighbour songs. There were no significant differences in vocal response between treatments. We conclude that the Yellow-bellied Tit can discriminate between songs of neighbours and strangers. As there is no song-type match across subjects, neighbours and strangers, and no differences of shared song type numbers between familiar pairs and stranger pairs, we think that song characteristics may play a role in neighbour–stranger discrimination." .
