This study investigates lithofacies and discontinuities types of the Upper Jurassic Arab-D Member of Arab Formation and the underlying Upper Jurassic Upper Jubaila Formation based on outcrop analogs in central Saudi Arabia. The study describes the lithofacies and characterizes the discontinuity properties. The Arab-D Member and Upper Jubaila Formation vary in their lithofacies types, thicknesses, abundances, and stacking patterns. Lithofacies include mudstone/wackestone, packstone/grainstone that deposited within a tidal flat, skeletal banks and shallow to deep lagoonal paleoenvironments. The Upper Jubaila Formation shows several fracture sets that are oriented north–west, north $$20{^{\\circ }}$$ 20∘ east, and north $$40{^{\\circ }}$$ 40∘ east. Most of these fracture sets exhibit near horizontal (5ͦ–15ͦ) to near-vertical dipping (70ͦ–90ͦ). The Arab-D member is intersected by four fracture sets oriented north $$20{^{\\circ }}$$ 20∘ east, north–south, east–west and north–west. These fractures also exhibit near near-vertical (70ͦ–80ͦ) dipping. In both the Arab-D and Upper Jubaila Formation, the northwest-oriented sheared fractures show small vertical displacements. Regional and local controls seem to have affected fractures within the Jurassic carbonate rocks. Regionally, the fractures appear to be structurally controlled by the Central Arabian Graben System, which affected central Saudi Arabia. Locally, at the outcrop scale, stratigraphic, depositional and diagenetic factors have also affected the fracture development and intensity. Bed perpendicular fractures sets were interpreted to be formed at three separate stages: the first stage is associated with the initiation of Central Arabian Graben System during Quaternary which lead to formation of NW–SE-oriented fractures set, the second stage the NE–SW-oriented set, this set is associated with the abutting of the older fracture set along beds and sequence boundaries forming several types of fractures deflections along these boundaries, the last stage is the E–W-oriented set that cross-cut the previously existed set. The integration of discontinuities characteristics revealed from the Arab-D outcrop with subsurface data might help to understand and predict discontinuity properties and patterns of the Arab-D reservoir in the subsurface." .

The low temperature nature of these mineralized sediments and their composition stimulated this first attempt to synthesize Pt- and Pd-phases in solutions at temperatures below 100°C under reducing conditions with H2S flow through the solution. Experiments under controlled Eh-pH with montmorillonite presaturated in Pd and Pt in different chloride solutions resulted in the formation of Pt- and Pd-sulphides. PtS- and PdS-stability fields are very close to each other in Eh-pH values (∼400mV, 9). These data are in good agreement with those determined for some base metal sulphides synthesized at similar temperature by other researchers. The results may support the role of clay minerals as possible concentrators for PGE in the sedimentary environment." .

The EMP data reveal zoned amphibole compositions clustering around two predominant compositions: a glaucophane end-member ( B Na2 C M2+ 3 M3+ 2 T Si8(OH)2) in the cores, whereas the mantle to rim of the samples has an intermediate amphibole composition ( A 0.5 B Ca1.5Na0.5 C M 2+ 4.5 M 0.53+ T Si7.5Al0.5(OH)2) (A = Na and/or K; M 2+ = Mg and Fe2+; M 3+ = Fe3+ and/or Al) between winchite (and ferro-winchite) and katophorite (and Mg-katophorite). Furthermore, we observed complicated FTIR and Raman spectra with OH-stretching absorption bands varying systematically from core to rim. The FTIR/Raman spectra of the core amphibole show three lower-frequency components (at 3,633, 3,649–3,651 and 3,660–3,663 cm−1) which can be attributed to a local O(3)-H dipole surrounded by M(1) M(3)Mg3, M(1) M(3)Mg2Fe2+ and M(1) M(3) Fe2+ 3, respectively, an empty A site and T Si8 environments. On the other hand, bands at higher frequencies (3,672–3,673, 3,691–3,697 and 3,708 cm−1) are observable in the rims of the amphiboles, and they indicate the presence of an occupied A site. The FTIR and Raman data from the OH-stretching region allow us to calculate the site occupancy of the A, M(1)–M(3), T sites with confidence when combined with EPM data. By contrast M(2)- and M(4) site occupancies are more difficult to evaluate. We use these samples to highlight on the opportunities and limitations of FTIR OH-stretching spectroscopy applied to natural high pressure amphibole phases. The much more detailed cation site occupancy of the zoned amphibole from the western Tianshan have been obtained by comparing data from micro-chemical and FTIR and/or Raman in the OH-stretching data. We find the following characteristic substitutions Si(T-site) (Mg, Fe)[M(1)–M(3)-site] → Al(T-site) Al[M(1)–M(3)-site] (tschermakite), Ca(M4-site)□ (A-site) → Na(M4-site) Na + K(A-site) (richterite), and Ca(M4-site) (Mg, Fe) [M(1)–M(3)-site] → Na(M4-site) Al[M(1)–M(3)-site] (glaucophane) from the configurations observed during metamorphism." .

Experiments suggest that deformation of partially molten granite with low-viscosity melt (104 Pa s) exhibits a rheological critical melt percentage (RCMP). In case of high viscosity melts (108 Pa s), however, the relationship between melt fraction and log viscosity of the partially molten granite may be linear. Considerations about viscosity, rheological thresholds, and segregation of natural melts suggest that low-viscosity melt experiments simulate natural conditions more realistically. Therefore, an RCMP is to be expected under natural conditions. Both diffusion creep and dislocation creep may occur under natural conditions, whereas cataclastic flow is only observed under experimental conditions. A melt-induced transition from dislocation creep to diffusion creep occurs under experimental and natural conditions. Melt topology is controlled by the magnitude of differential stress under experimental conditions. If differential stress is higher than ~100–150 MPa, melt pockets are elongate and oriented at a low angle to the maximum compressive stress. In contrast, in nature, melt pockets tend to be oriented subparallel to the foliation plane, i.e., presumably at a high angle to the maximum compressive stress." .

The Marimanha granite intrudes Cambro–Ordovician clastic rocks and Silurian–Devonian limestones and slates. The zonation of the low field magnetic susceptibility, consistent with the petrological zonation of the igneous body, indicates a concentric arrangement of rock types, with more basic compositions at the external areas. This pluton is characterized by a low susceptibility, and rock–magnetic studies indicate a majority of “paramagnetic” samples. Magnetic foliations strike parallel to petrographic contacts and to contours of zonation of magnetic susceptibility, and show a dominant NE–SW strike, steeply dipping towards the North. Locally, in the northern border of the pluton foliation directions become perpendicular to petrographic contacts and depict sigmoidal trajectories. Magnetic lineations are characterized by the predominance of NE–SW trends with shallow plunges to the NE and SW. These foliations and lineations are parallel to the slight elongation of internal petrographic zonation. Magnetic fabric within the granitoid body and internal elliptical shape of petrographic zonation, suggest an intrusion contemporary with a transpressional regime and NNW–SSE shortening, syntectonic with the late stages of the Variscan orogeny. These results are in accordance with anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility studies of others plutons in the Pyrenees. To explain the origin of the Marimanha granite we propose magma ascent through faults at depth and emplacement by ballooning in situ at the rheological boundary between Cambro–Ordovician and Siluro–Devonian metasediments." .

The input parameters used to estimate daily pan evaporation from Lake Eğirdir in the southwestern part of Turkey are the daily pan evaporation data of Lake Kovada (Ko t ) and Lake Karacaören Dam (Ka t ) and the previous 1-, 2-, and 3-day pan evaporation values of Lake Eğirdir. The various input combinations were tried by using pan evaporation data for the years 1998–2005. The GEP model with the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and the lowest mean square error have the daily pan evaporation data of Lake Kovada (Ko t ) and Lake Karacaören Dam (Ka t ) and the previous 1-day pan evaporation values of Lake Eğirdir. The NSE of the best GEP model was obtained as 0.729, 0.722, and 0.701 for training, testing, and validation sets, respectively. Furthermore, the ANFIS models were developed using the same input combinations. It was seen that the GEP model was more superior to the ANFIS model." .

The aim of this work was to determine weather perception seasonal variability of people staying outdoors in urban environment for tourism and recreation, as well as to determine if personal factors influence estimation of recreationist actual biometeorological conditions and personal expectations towards weather elements. To investigate how human thermal sensations vary upon meteorological conditions typical for temperate climate, weather perception field researches were conducted in Warsaw (Poland) in all seasons. Urban recreationists’ preference for slightly warm thermal conditions, sunny, windless and cloudless weather, were identified as well as PET values considered to be optimal for sightseeing were defined between 27.3 and 31.7 °C. The results confirmed existence of phenomena called alliesthesia, which manifested in divergent thermal perception of comparable biometeorological conditions in transitional seasons. The results suggest that recreationist thermal sensations differed from other interviewees’ responses and were affected not only by physiological processes but they were also conditioned by psychological factors (i.e. attitude, expectations). Significant impact of respondents’ place of origin and its climate on creating thermal sensations and preferences was observed. Sex and age influence thermal preferences, whereas state of acclimatization is related with thermal sensations to some point." .

Dolomite and quartz in siliceous dolomites started to react at the lower grade part of the amphibolite facies. The increase of metamorphic grade brought three-, four- and five-mineral assemblages, with calcite, talc, tremolite, diopside and forsterite arriving successively. The four- and five-mineral assemblages can be related to divariant and univariant assemblages respectively in the system CaO-MgO-SiO2-CO2-H2O, and are considered to represent components of reactions that buffered the chemistry of intergranular fluids. The dolomite-calcite solvus geothermometry gives temperatures 465 ° C for the assemblage dolomite-quartz-talc-tremolite-calcite, 555 ° C for the assemblage dolomite-quartz-tremolite-diopside-calcite, and 595 ° C for the assemblage dolomite-tremolite-diopside-forsterite-calcite. Equilibrium fluid pressures, calculated with available experimental data, are 2.6 kb for the first five-mineral assemblage, and 3.5 kb for the latter two. Fluid compositions were controlled by reactions in each local system, but changed toward a water-rich one when the reactions ceased. The fluid pressures as distinct from the possible rock pressures and the controlling of the fluid composition by reactions are interpreted in terms of the ratio of reaction to fluid migration. Of a skarn zone developed around a chert nodule its mineralogy and deduced composition of the fluids enabled to estimate the size of the microdomain in which equilibrium was maintained. It is of millimeter size. Equilibrium systems of larger sizes are concluded to represent overlapped microdomains of a size." .

Marine species rely on other senses as well, but we know little of how these might be affected by ocean acidification. We tested whether ocean acidification can alter the preference for physicochemical cues used for dispersal between ocean and estuarine environments. We experimentally assessed the behavioural response of a larval fish (Lates calcarifer) to elevated temperature and reduced salinity, including estuarine water of multiple cues for detecting settlement habitat. Larval fish raised under elevated CO2 concentrations were attracted by warmer water, but temperature had no effect on fish raised in contemporary CO2 concentrations. In contrast, contemporary larvae were deterred by lower salinity water, where CO2-treated fish showed no such response. Natural estuarine water—of higher temperature, lower salinity, and containing estuarine olfactory cues—was only preferred by fish treated under forecasted high CO2 conditions. We show for the first time that attraction by larval fish towards physicochemical cues can be altered by ocean acidification. Such alterations to perception and evaluation of environmental cues during the critical process of dispersal can potentially have implications for ensuing recruitment and population replenishment. Our study not only shows that freshwater species that spend part of their life cycle in the ocean might also be affected by ocean acidification, but that behavioural responses towards key physicochemical cues can also be negated through elevated CO2 from human emissions." .

It was characterized by effusive activity on the Sciara del Fuoco and by a paroxysmal event (15 March). This crisis represented an opportunity for us to refine the model that had been developed previously (2002–2003 eruption) and to improve our understanding of the relationship between the magmatic dynamics of the volcano and the geochemical variations in the fluids. In particular, the evaluation of the dynamic equilibrium between the volatiles (CO2 and SO2) released from the magma and the corresponding fluids discharged from the summit area allowed us to evaluate the level of criticality of the volcanic activity. One of the major accomplishments of this study is a 4-year database of summit soil CO2 flux on the basis of which we define the thresholds (low–medium–high) for this parameter that are empirically based on the natural volcanological evolution of Stromboli. The SO2 fluxes of the degassing plume and the CO2 fluxes emitted from the soil at Pizzo Sopra la Fossa are also presented. It is noteworthy that geochemical signals of volcanic unrest have been clearly identified before, during and after the effusive activity. These signals were found almost simultaneously in the degassing plume (SO2 flux) and in soil degassing (CO2 flux) at the summit, although the two degassing processes are shown to be clearly different. The interpretation of the results will be useful for future volcanic surveillance at Stromboli." .

In this study, we examined the trend in the occurrence of haze days based on horizontal visibility in Xi’an, a major city in central China, since 2000. There were 49 haze days per year on average in Xi’an during 2000–2013, and the number of haze days has increased significantly since 2008, reaching 102 days in 2013. December is the month of the highest frequency of occurrence. During December 18–25 of 2013, the longest-lasting and most severe haze event in the recent decades occurred. The 8-day mean visibility in Xi’an was only 2.5 km with 5 days below 2 km. The mean air quality index in Xi’an during this period was 486.5, and in four of those days, it reached or exceeded the index’s upper limit of 500. The exceptionally high level of PM2.5 concentration was inferred as the main reason of this severe haze episode. The local weather conditions were characterized by weak winds, enhanced atmospheric stability, and high relative humidity. Strong mid-tropospheric zonal flows in combination with weakened East Asian winter monsoon limited the cold air invasion from the higher latitudes, creating a condition of low pressure gradients in the lower troposphere and near the surface for a large region in central and eastern China. With high background emission levels, the suppressed dispersion of air pollutants eventually caused this severe haze episode affecting a large region in China." .

Therefore, in this paper, a new process of identifying deep-water reservoirs is proposed. First, strata slice technology is adopted to guide the analysis of seismic facies and preliminary recognition of the distribution and scale of geologic bodies; then based on the seismic facies analysis, the reservoir is depicted in detail with the application of seismic phase-controlled nonlinear random inversion; and finally, the comprehensive analysis of various features like strata slices, seismic facies, and seismic inversion are used to predict the favorability of the reservoir. The results show that the application of this method not only successfully predicts the distribution of the reservoir but also provides a reliable basis for future well drilling." .

La Réunion island was chosen as a test-site. We used georeferenced topographic maps, aerial photos and digital terrain models to perform a statistical analysis of several morphometric parameters of pyroclastic cones. This provides a great deal of geometric information that can help in distinguishing the localisation and orientation of buried magma-feeding fractures, which constitute the surface expression of rift zones. It also allowed the construction of a complete GIS database of the pyroclastic cones. La Réunion is a perfect example where past and active volcanic rift zones are mostly expressed by clusters of monogenic centres. The data has been validated in the field and compared and integrated with the distribution and geometry of dyke swarms. Results show the presence of several main and secondary rift segments of different ages, locations and orientations, whose origin is discussed considering regional tectonics, local geomorphology, and volcano deformation." .

Sufficiently large morphotypes of the first group are identified with remains of cyanobacteria. Morphotypes of variable spiral structure, which dwelt in association or in symbiosis with cyanobionts, are attributed to the same bacterial community. The other group includes a series of different acritarch genera whose characters suggest their affinity with green algae of the order Desmidiales. It is very likely that this group coexisted on siliciclastic shoals with large ancestral forms of the present-day brown algae. Several microfossil taxa have been known before from the Neoproterozoic deposits only. With due regard for the relatively gradual accumulation of sedimentary succession lacking large hiatuses and for the regular series of K-Ar dates characterizing three Riphean formations of the Olenek Uplift, it is possible to suggest that there was the Arymas-Debengda-Khaipakh cycle of long-lasted, almost uninterrupted sedimentation within the time span of 1250–900 Ma. It is also admissible that age ranges of some Late Precambrian microfossils are much larger than their distribution intervals postulated formerly." .

The >1 km thick volcanic pile is divided into three phases of volcanism: a main basaltic stage (31 to 29.7 Ma), a main silicic stage (29.7 to 29.5 Ma), and a stage of upper bimodal volcanism (29.5 to 27.7 Ma). Eight large-volume silicic pyroclastic eruptive units are traceable throughout northern Yemen, and some units can be correlated with silicic eruptive units in the Ethiopian Traps and to tephra layers in the Indian Ocean. The silicic units comprise pyroclastic density current and fall deposits and a caldera-collapse breccia, and they display textures that unequivocally identify them as primary pyroclastic deposits: basal vitrophyres, eutaxitic fabrics, glass shards, vitroclastic ash matrices and accretionary lapilli. Individual pyroclastic eruptions have preserved on-land volumes of up to ∼850 km3. The largest units have associated co-ignimbrite plume ash fall deposits with dispersal areas >1×107 km2 and estimated maximum total volumes of up to 5,000 km3, which provide accurate and precisely dated marker horizons that can be used to link litho-, bio- and magnetostratigraphy studies. There is a marked change in eruption style of silicic units with time, from initial large-volume explosive pyroclastic eruptions producing ignimbrites and near-globally distributed tuffs, to smaller volume (<50 km3) mixed effusive-explosive eruptions emplacing silicic lavas intercalated with tuffs and ignimbrites. Although eruption volumes decrease by an order of magnitude from the first stage to the last, eruption intervals within each phase remain broadly similar. These changes may reflect the initiation of continental rifting and the transition from pre-break-up thick, stable crust supporting large-volume magma chambers, to syn-rift actively thinning crust hosting small-volume magma chambers." .

We study the fine-scale characteristics of its structure near sector boundaries (SB) detected in the vicinity of the Earth, using interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind velocity data, as well as temperature measurements (mainly from IMP data). We observe small vortices (eddies) of the order of 0.2 to 0.4 AU in diameter, with time scales of several hours to days. Vortices appear frequently in the plasma near the so-called ‘thick’ sectors.

This paper reports on a generic algorithm that captures global variation in monthly WVP. The algorithm solves WVP in terms of reduction from saturation WVP as a negative exponential function of potential evapotranspiration; the reduction rate per unit potential evapotranspiration in turn varies with monthly precipitation and a series of variables that distinguish local climate regimes. Data input to the algorithm is limited to monthly air temperature and precipitation, plus latitude, longitude and elevation. The algorithm is specified through regression fitting to monthly climate normal data from 852 stations around the world. It accounts for 96% of the variance in the WVP data, with a root mean square error of 0.17 kPa, or 12% of the data mean. The algorithm closely reproduces five-year sequential monthly WVP data for each of five selected United States locations representitative of diverse climate regimes: the average error generally falls within ±12% of the data mean, and the absolute error within ±0.2 kPa. Its projections also compare favorably against the WVP output from the General Circulation Models for temperature and precipitation conditions under the scenario of a doubled atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentration: the two fall within ±10% of each other for 75% of a total 264 data cases, or within ±20% for 94% of the cases. These statistics suggest that the spatially-based algorithm is useful for projecting temporal variation in WVP, and for extrapolative applications beyond the fluctuation range of present climate." .

Peridotites occur as lenses along a unit rooted in the main Variscan suture zone. They are dominantly spinel peridotites and minor garnet–spinel peridotites. Spinel peridotites represent both residual mantle and ultramafic cumulates. Mantle-related dunites and harzburgites display high temperature textures, with olivine (Mg#0.90), orthopyroxene (Mg#0.90) and spinel (TiO2 < 0.2%; Cr#0.64–0.83) compositions typical of fore-arc upper mantle. Ultramafic cumulates are dunite adcumulates, harzburgite heteradcumulates and mesocumulates, melagabbro heteradcumulates and amphibole peridotites, with olivine (Mg#0.85–0.89), orthopyroxene (Mg#0.86–0.89) and Cr-spinel (TiO2 = 0.5–3.3%; Cr#0.7–0.98) compositions typical of ultramafic cumulates. Cr-spinel compositions of both spinel peridotite types suggest their genesis in a supra-subduction zone lithosphere. Core to rim zoning in spinel is related to the incomplete influence of regional metamorphism and serpentinisation. The covariation of major and minor elements with Al2O3 for cumulates is consistent with igneous processes involving crystal accumulation. Both mantle and cumulate dunites and harzburgites have U-shaped REE patterns and extremely low trace element contents, similar to peridotites from modern fore-arc peridotites (South Atlantic) and from ophiolites related to supra-subduction zones (Semail, Cyclops, Pindos, Troodos). Melagabbros also have U-shaped REE patterns similar to xenoliths from the Philippine island arc, but also similar to intrusive ultramafic cumulates from the Semail nappe of Oman related to a proto-subduction setting. A wehrlite has a REE pattern similar to that of amphibole peridotites reflecting metasomatism of clinopyroxene-bearing peridotites due to subduction-related fluids. The Maures spinel peridotites and melagabbros are therefore interpreted as the lowermost parts of a crustal sequence and minor residual mantle of lithosphere generated in a supra-subduction zone during Early Palaeozoic time. Garnet–spinel peridotites are chemically close to melagabbros, but have recorded high pressure metamorphism before their retrogression similar to spinel peridotites into amphibolites to greenschists facies metamorphism. They indicate burial to mantle depths of the margin of the supra-subduction lithosphere during the Early Palaeozoic continental subduction. Both peridotite types were exhumed during the Upper Palaeozoic continental collision. Comparable observations from other Variscan-related peridotites, in particular of the Speik complex of the Autroalpine basement, and a common age for the subduction stage allow extension of these regional conclusions to a broad area sharing the Cambrian suture zone, extending from the Ossa-Morena to the Bohemian massif." .

They contain Zn and Fe bearing low Mg-calcite, dolomite, Fedolomite, minrecordite-CaZn (CO3)2, sphalerite, pyrite, melnikovite and overgrown quartz. — Zn-dolomite consists probably of CaMg (CO3)2 and CaZn (CO3)2 domains about 10×35 nm in size. Zn-dolomite is sulfidized (replaced by ZnS) which is demonstrated by both reflected light and electron microscope methods. — CaZn (CO3)2 from the Navan ore has cell parameters: a0=0.484±0.004 and c0=1.608±0.012 nm and is rhombohedral. It forms close, tiny intergrowths with calcite. — Base metals at Navan were exhaled to form at least partly carbonate minerals which subsequently reverted to sulfides in the diagenetic environment. The reversion of base metals carbonates to sulfides is connected with reduction in volume. The reduction in volume allowed the ore zone to retain its permeability after lithification of the host rock. It allowed lateral flow of hydrothermal solutions, which deposited further generations of sulfides and increased the base metal content producing a high grade ore." .

The interdecadal changes in the South Asia High (SAH) intensity derived from the reanalysis data are also compared with ground-based radiosonde observations and atmospheric model outputs. The JJA mean geopotential heights in the 1980s are distinctly larger than the 1970s in NCEP1 over most of the regions in the Northern Hemisphere, while no obvious difference is observed in ERA-40. The interannual variation of the SAH strength is very close in the two reanalysis data, so that it is appropriate to utilize the reanalysis data to study the interannual variation of SAH strength after removing the interdecadal trend. However, the discrepancy in SAH intensity between NCEP1 and ERA-40 mainly exists on the interdecadal time scale. The SAH intensity in the NCEP1 was close to that in the ERA-40 before the late 1970s but became remarkably stronger after the late 1970s, leading to a much larger decadal strengthening during the period 1970–1990. Based on the six radiosonde observation stations in the area of the SAH, the results indicate that the decadal reinforcing in the SAH strength occurs around the mid-1980s. Thus, NCEP1 may overestimate the decadal shift in the SAH intensity around the late 1970s, while ERA-40 may underestimate it. Much attention needs to be paid when we use the reanalysis data to study the decadal variability of the SAH intensity." .

The discussion topics were motivated by a case study on the influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation on the flood regime in the Itajaí river basin, in Southern Brazil. The Niño3.4 (DJF) index is used as a covariate in nonstationary estimates of the Poisson and GP distributions scale parameters. Prior to the positing of parametric dependence functions, a preliminary data-driven analysis was carried out using nonparametric regression models to estimate the dependence of the parameters on the covariate. Model fits were evaluated using asymptotic likelihood ratio tests, AIC, and Q–Q plots. Results show statistically significant and complex dependence relationships with the covariate on both nonstationary parameters. The nonstationary flood hazard measure design life level (DLL) was used to compare the relative performances of stationary and nonstationary models in quantifying flood hazard over the period of records. Uncertainty analyses were carried out in every step of the application using the delta method." .

The bentonite layers are dated by planktonic foraminifera to the Globotruncanita elevata zone, early Campanian, and by calcareous nannofossils to the Aspidolithus parcus zone (CC 18); they fall into the reversed interval of chron 33. Detailed correlation shows the layers to be of exactly the same age. The upper layer is dated by U/Pb on magmatic zircons to 81.67±0.21 Ma, an age compatible with the Cretaceous time-scale of Obradovich. The mineralogy of the bentonitic clays is almost pure montmorillonite and contrasts sharply with the clay mineral assemblage of the enclosing pelagic and turbiditic limestones, which is dominated by soil-derived smectite and illite in different proportions. The bentonite seams are interpreted as the submarine alteration products of wind-borne volcanic ashes. They can be followed with only minor changes in thickness over 200 km and must be derived from distant volcanic sources and related to extreme volcanic events. A possible source area is present in the Dinarides where Upper Cretaceous subduction-related magmatic rocks are widespread." .

This metallurgical complex is amongst the largest in Eurasia and constitutes Southeast Asia's only documented pre-modern copper-smelting evidence. The two Iron Age smelting sites investigated, Non Pa Wai (NPW) and Nil Kham Haeng (NKH), provide a sequence of metallurgical consumption and production evidence from c. 500 BCE to c. 500 CE. The enormous quantity of industrial waste at these sites suggests they were probably major copper supply nodes within ancient Southeast Asian metal exchange networks. Seventy-six excavated samples of mineral, technical ceramic and slag from NPW and NKH were analysed in hand specimen, microstructurally by reflected-light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and chemically by polarising energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The analytical data were used to generate detailed technological reconstructions of copper-smelting behaviour at the two sites, which were refined by a programme of field experimentation. Results indicate an approximately 1,000-year trend of Valley copper smelters' improving technical proficiency from what may be an experimental phase of production in the mid-first millennium BCE. This amelioration in production was accompanied by a substantial increase in the human effort of copper extraction. This shift in local ‘metallurgical ethos’ is interpreted as a response to rising regional demand for copper in late prehistory." .

The KCPS is a deformed and highly sheared, dome-shaped rhyolitic body with a granitic core. Quartz porphyry dikes intrude both the slightly metamorphic igneous and the sedimentary rocks of the basement complex. Both the quartz porphyries and rhyolites were converted into mylonites with relict igneous textures. Geochemical data show that these felsic igneous rocks are subalkaline and mainly granitic in composition with SiO2 >72 wt% and Al2O3 >11.5 wt%. The chondrite-normalized incompatible trace element patterns are characterized by distinct negative Rb, Nb, Sr, P, Ti, and Eu with enrichment in Th, U, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Zr. The REE patterns of the felsic rocks indicate a strong enrichment in LREE but display slightly flat HREE patterns. According to geochemical characteristics and petrogenetic modeling, extrusive and intrusive rocks of the KCPS were probably derived from an upper continental crustal source (partial melting of granites/felsic rocks) by 18–20% fractional melting plus 18–20% Rayleigh fractional crystallization, which seems to be the most effective igneous process during the crystallization of the KCPS. Single zircon age data from the granitoids and fossils from the disconformably overlying sedimentary successions indicate that the metamorphism and the igneous event in the Taurides are related to the Cadomian orogeny. Based on the geological, geochemical and petrogenetic correlation of the post-collisional granitoids it is further suggested that the Tauride belt in western central Turkey was in a similar tectonic setting to the Gondwanan terranes in North Africa (Younger Granitoids) and southern Europe (Spain, France, Bohemia, Brno Massifs) during the Late Cadomian period." .

In order to accomplish this task, a methodology is needed that estimates sediment transport capacity for various channel configurations. Such a procedure is described which allows the computation of the total sediment transport capacity for each of several T-year return frequency runoff hydrographs. This information is used to obtain an approximate probability distribution for the total sediment transport capacity, and the mean and standard deviation of this distribution are computed. Comparing the results for the catchment in its present state with a future developed state, using a selection of new channel parameters, indicates how to improve the channel to control changes in sedimentation due to development. The analysis procedure provides a basis for estimating a new channel configuration such that the new flow conditions retain, as best as possible, the existing condition sedimentation effects, and hence retain the natural sediment supply and transport trends even though runoff flow rates have changed due to land development within the catchment. The results of Wilson Creek are typical of the several sites examined, see Table 3 below. The T=2, T=5, T=25, and T=100 year values for total sediment transport capacity, in kilotons, are 6.9, 39.4, 61.3, and 96.7 with a mean of 17.1 and standard deviation of 19.3. After development with no change in the channel the respective values increase to: 17.9, 84.6, 128.1, and 258.0 with a mean of 39.1 and standard deviation of 44.3. A new channel can be constructed which will reduce these sediment transport capacity values, after development, to 5.2, 41.0, 62.0, and 124.8 with a mean of 17.4 and standard deviation of 22.0." .

The Eumsung Basin contains contrasting basin fills according to marginal settings. The southeastern part of the basin forms sequential development of alluvial/lacustrine systems along transform margin, and the southwestern part constitutes synchronous development of alluvial-to-lacustrine systems in pull-apart margin. Along the basin margins and toward the basin center, both sequential and synchronous developments of the alluvial and lacustrine systems have filled basinal accommodation spaces created by pull-apart opening. The formative processes of the basin were caused by the strike-slip fault movements and the accompanying changes in drainage network along the basin margin. The overall development patterns of the depositional systems conform to the sinistral strike-slip fault activation during the Early Cretaceous." .

The area of snow-free ground in the active crater has not returned to pre-unrest levels, and fumarole gas geochemistry shows a decreasing magmatic signature over that same interval. A relative microgravity survey revealed a substantial gravity increase in the ~30 years since the unrest, while deformation measurements suggest slight deflation of the edifice between 1981–83 and 2006–07. The volcano remains seismically quiet with regard to impulsive volcano-tectonic events, but experiences shallow (<3 km) low-frequency events likely related to glacier activity, as well as deep (>10 km) long-period earthquakes. Reviewing the observations from the 1975 unrest in combination with geophysical and geochemical data collected in the decades that followed, we infer that elevated gas and thermal emissions at Mount Baker in 1975 resulted from magmatic activity beneath the volcano: either the emplacement of magma at mid-crustal levels, or opening of a conduit to a deep existing source of magmatic volatiles. Decadal-timescale, multi-parameter observations were essential to this assessment of magmatic activity." .

Available Rb–Sr and K–Ar whole-rock and mineral age data on the H- and A-type granitoids in central Anatolia are inconsistent. To better constrain the geological relevance and the timing of the change in the chemical character of magmatism in the wake of the Alpine orogeny in Anatolia, we re-evaluated the geochemical characteristics and dated titanite from representative H- (Baranadag quartz-monzonite: BR) and A-type (Çamsari quartz-syenite: CS) granitoids by the U–Pb method. BR is a high-K calc-alkaline intrusion with mafic microgranular enclaves and shows enrichment of LILE relative to HFSE. The alkaline CS displays higher SiO2, Na2O+K2O, Fe/Mg, Rb, Th and HFSE with corresponding depletion in CaO, MgO, Fe2O3tot, P2O5, Ba, Sr, and Ti. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the BR and CS samples have LREE-enriched and flat HREE patterns, whereas CS differs from BR by higher LREE enrichment and lower MREE and HREE contents. Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics suggest that BR and CS were not products of the same magma source. BR was derived from a subduction-modified depleted hybrid-source and CS had an enriched mantle source with significant crustal contribution. The U–Pb titanite ages of the H-type central Anatolian granitoids (BR) and the A-type granitoids (CS) are 74.0±2.8 and 74.1±0.7 Ma, respectively. The coeval evolution of post-collisional/calc-alkaline H- to A-type magmatism was possibly associated with source heterogeneity and variable involvement of continental materials during the evolution of these granitoids. These new age data constrain the timing of the onset of a post-collision extensional period following the Alpine thickening within the passive margin of the Tauride–Anatolide platform, which occurred before the opening of the latest Cretaceous central Anatolian basins." .

The analysis indicates that a significant fraction of variability in the tropical Pacific can be explained in terms of an irregular interplay of two dominant modes: the low-frequency mode and the biennial mode. These modes, and in particular the biennial mode, are well defined coupled modes of the tropical ocean-atmospheric circulation system, as suggested by strong correlation (> 0.9) in the evolution of the different physical variables. The low-frequency mode and its PC time series are very similar to the so-called “interdecadal” mode identified by earlier investigators. The corresponding PC time series of the low-frequency mode has a broad spectral peak at 5.3 yrs. The biennial mode represents the oscillation pattern of El Niño and La Niña and has a clear biennial cycle, the amplitude of which varies on a longer time scale. There is a broad spectral peak also at 5.3 yrs in the principal component (PC) time series of this mode. Unlike in earlier studies, this biennial mode is clearly separable from the low-frequency mode, since these two modes have different physical evolution patterns. Results of the present study also indicate that the biennial component, having a clear phase-locking tendency, is not as variable as has been suggested in some previous investigations. It is shown that much of the inter-El Niño variability can be explained in terms of an irregular interplay between the biennial mode and the low-frequency mode. Finally, the role of the low-frequency mode in the tropical Pacific seems to be more important than has been suggested previously. Specifically, recent warming events since 1975 are shown to be associated with the low-frequency mode rather than with the biennial mode." .

In the first experiment, the formation of sandbanks in an ideal rectangular basin, resembling the Taylor’s problem, was calculated. Sandbanks occur in a small area at the closed boundary. Similar experiments were carried out for a range of wavelengths of the incident Kelvin wave. The results reveal that large wavelengths favor the generation of sandbanks. In subsequent calculations, the basin was modified by introducing new geographical features like bays and peninsulas. The numerical experiments show that geometry is a fundamental factor to determine the position where groups of sandbanks appear. The results suggest that in regions where the Kelvin wave is diffracted, the formation of sandbanks occurs. An experiment, in which we applied an ideal geometric configuration representing that of the Southern Bight of the North Sea, generated sandbank patterns resembling those observed in the region." .

In this study, an analysis of temperature data has been performed over 22 series observed in New Zealand. In particular, to detect possible trends in the time series, the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was first applied at monthly scale and then to several indices of extreme daily temperatures computed since 1951. The results showed a positive trend in both the maximum and the minimum temperatures, in particular, in the autumn-winter period. This increase has been evaluated faster in maximum temperature than in minimum one. The trend analysis of the temperature indices suggests that there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, while most of the cold extremes showed a downward tendency." .

When ENSO and PDO are in-phase [i.e., El Niño events during warm PDO (EN_WPDO) and La Niña events during cold PDO (LN_CPDO)], the positive correlations between ENSO and SCSR are enhanced significantly, with above-normal (below-normal) SCSR generally following EN_WPDO (LN_CPDO) events. In contrast, the ENSO–SCSR relationship becomes ambiguous when ENSO and PDO are out-of-phase [i.e., El Niño events during cold PDO (EN_CPDO) and La Niña events during warm PDO (LN_WPDO)]. The PDO modulates the ENSO–SCSR relationship through the impact of variations in the lower-tropospheric subtropical anticyclone over the western North Pacific (WNP) and upper-tropospheric westerly jets over East Asia and the midlatitude North Pacific. An EN_WPDO (LN_CPDO) event induces an enhanced subtropical anticyclone (cyclone) over the WNP and intensified (weakened) subtropical westerly jet around the southern Tibetan Plateau due to modification by the PDO-forced anomalous circulation. Thus, South China falls just under the influence of the anomalous lower-tropospheric southwesterlies (northeasterlies) and upper-tropospheric divergent (convergent) environment, leading to above-normal (below-normal) SCSR. In contrast, the SCSR anomalies exhibit no wet or dry preference following EN_CPDO (LN_CPDO) events, because ENSO-induced and PDO-forced circulation anomalies tend to cancel each other out. These modulating effects by the PDO on the ENSO–SCSR relationship and related physical processes are also examined with coupled model simulations." .

Back analysis carried out identified that the main cause of failure is due to the existing high groundwater level within the cut slope. It is also observed that the continuous discharge from the horizontal drains yield approximately 100 ml/s even during dry season. Thus, it is suspected that the main contribution to the high groundwater level is due to the leakage from the large water tank constructed on the crest of the slope. Electrical resistivity survey was adopted to facilitate the investigation for the source of high groundwater level within the slope. A 3-dimensional resistivity model was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation method. The 3D resistivity model shows that the high water content zone is not caused by the leakage of water tank but is originated from an unknown source at the south-east side of the slope." .

The bias correction methods are able to significantly improve the biases in the mean values of TRMM and WFD datasets. The nonlinear bias correction method gives good results in correcting the standard deviations of TRMM/WFD data.

A 1.4–5.8 °C warming by 2100 will likely change the sign of mean annual air and ground temperatures over much of the zones of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in the northern hemisphere, causing widespread permafrost thaw. In this study, I examined rates of discontinuous permafrost thaw in the boreal peatlands of northern Manitoba, Canada, using a combination of tree-ring analyses to document thaw rates from 1941–1991 and direct measurements of permanent benchmarks established in 1995 and resurveyed in 2002. I used instrumented records of mean annual and seasonal air temperatures, mean winter snow depth, and duration of continuous snow pack from climate stations across northern Manitoba to analyze temporal and spatial trends in these variables and their potential impacts on thaw. Permafrost thaw in central Canadian peatlands has accelerated significantly since 1950, concurrent with a significant, late-20th-century average climate warming of +1.32 °C in this region. There were strong seasonal differences in warming in northern Manitoba, with highest rates of warming during winter (+1.39 °C to +1.66 °C) and spring (+0.56 °C to +0.78 °C) at southern climate stations where permafrost thaw was most rapid. Projecting current warming trends to year 2100, I show that trends for north-central Canada are in good agreement with general circulation models, which suggest a 4–8 °C warming at high latitudes. This magnitude of warming will begin to eliminate most of the present range of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in central Canada by 2100." .

The study area is typified by mineralized cataclastic levels related to Late Oligocene–Early Miocene thrust surfaces, and to the following two generations of normal faults of Miocene and Pliocene ages, respectively. Within the damage zone of the Pliocene Boccheggiano fault, the mineralization is mainly made up of quartz and pyrite. Quartz + Pb–Zn sulfides, or quartz + Pb–Zn sulfides + fluorite + carbonates assemblages occur instead in the older cataclastic levels. Two generations of liquid-rich fluid inclusions were recognized in quartz and fluorite: the first one, with homogenization temperatures ranging between 172 and 331°C and salinity between 0.0 and 8.8 wt.% NaClequiv., records the early stage of hydrothermal activity. The second generation of fluid inclusions documents a later stage, with homogenization temperature from 124 to 288°C and salinity from 0.2 to 1.9 wt.% NaClequiv.. Fluid inclusions analyses also indicate that mixing of fluid with distinct salinities and/or temperatures was a widespread process during the early stage, and that fluid temperatures decreased moving from the Boccheggiano fault toward the more distal and older cataclastic levels. The δ18O values of water in equilibrium with hydrothermal quartz, which range from −5.7 to −0.1‰, are related to the circulation of meteoric water mixed with saline water that leached the evaporite level and enriched in δ18O through water–rock interaction, and/or with magmatically derived fluids. Results indicate that the damage zone of the Pliocene Boccheggiano fault represented the main channel for the flow of meteoric water, which was heated at depth, then mixed with high salinity fluids, and finally ascend to infiltrate along the older cataclastic levels. Our results, based on fluid inclusions, oxygen isotopic compositions and structural analyses indicate that a single fluid flow path run through the damage zone of the Boccheggiano fault and the older cataclasites, which were thus hydraulically connected." .

The potential of ARD occurrence of a certain area sometimes must be assessed before initiation of any engineering earth works.

In this study, a new prediction protocol using a geochemical exploration survey technique of stream sediment is proposed. Sediment samples were collected at the case study area where a large development is expected in the future, and the contents of some major and heavy metal elements were compared according to the major geologies of the sampling points. The modified geoaccumulation indices (I geo) of Fe, Pb and As could indicate a possible zone of pyrophyllite mineralization, which may cause the occurrence of ARD at the study area. Using the enrichment index of the three elements relative to the median values of the area, a high potential zone of ARD could be designated, which was in agreement with the laboratory ARD prediction tests of the rock samples. In the other areas with different mineralization processes, other metallic elements can be selected as indicators of the ARD potential. Likewise, the potential of the occurrence of ARD at an area can be assessed by evaluating the geochemical distributions and drawing the indicator elements for ARD through a stream sediment survey." .

This database was never published in the referred literature, despite its regional significance. It was collected prior to widespread application of GIS technologies in landsliding studies, limiting the analyses undertaken at the time. Gimbarzevsky identified landslides using 1:50,000 aerial photographs, and transferred the information to NTS map sheets. In our study, we digitized the landslide vectors from these original map sheets and connected each landslide to a digital elevation model. Lengths of landslide vectors are compared to the landsliding inventory for Haida Gwaii analyzed in Rood (1984), Martin Y et al. BC Can J Earth Sci 39:289–305 (2002); the latter inventory is based on larger-scale aerial photographs (~1:12,000). Rood’s database contains a more complete record of smaller landslides, while the inventory of Gimbarzevsky provides improved statistical representation of less frequent, medium to large landslides. It is suggested that combined landslide delineation at different scales could provide a more complete landslide record. Discriminant analysis was undertaken to assess which of nine predictor variables, chosen on the basis of mechanical theory, best predict failed versus unfailed locations. Seven of the nine variables were found to be statistically significant in discriminating amongst failed and unfailed locations. Results show that 81.7% of original grouped cases were correctly classified." .

In this study, the percentages of variance, amplitudes, and phase angles are calculated in order to depict the spatial and temporal characteristics of the country’s rainfall. The first harmonic explains 42 % of rainfall variation in the western (W) region. This percentage increases toward east (E) and north (N) with 69 and 67 %, respectively. In the southwest (SW) region, the percentages explain 43 % of rainfall variation. The percentages of variance in W and SW are lower than in the E, NW, and central (C) regions. This implies significant contributions of the second harmonic in W and SW regions with 26 and 16 %, respectively. The high percentages of the second and third harmonics in W and SW regions suggest that these two regions are affected by different weather systems at different times. The SW region has the highest amplitudes of the first, second, and third harmonics. The amplitude of the first harmonic reaches to 21 mm in SW and 9 mm in both C and E regions. The time of maximum rainfall is calculated using phase angle; the result reflects that maximum rainfall is shifted forward on the time axis toward the spring season in SW and C regions, January in E and NW regions, and October and November in the W region. This reveals that the SW region is a completely different climatic region, though some of what affects this region also affects the central region. Conditions in the E and NW regions are mainly affected by Mediterranean weather systems, while the W region is affected by unstable conditions caused by the active Red Sea Trough (RST) in October and November." .

The objective of this paper is to use the universal thermal comfort index (UTCI) to compare the outdoor thermal comfort in Hong Kong in the past (1971–2000) and the future (2046–2065 and 2081–2100). The future climate of Hong Kong was determined by the general circulation model (GCM) simulations of future climate scenarios (A1B and B1) established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Three GCMs were chosen, GISS-ER, GFDL-CM2.1 and MRI-CGCM2.3.2, based on their performance in simulating past climate. Through a statistical downscaling procedure, the future climatic variables were transferred to the local scale. The UTCI is calculated by four predicted climate variables: air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and solar radiation. After a normalisation procedure, future UTCI profiles for the urban area of Hong Kong were created. Comparing the past UTCI (calculated by observation data) and future UTCI, all three GCMs predicted that the future climate scenarios have a higher mode and a higher maximum value. There is a shift from ‘No Thermal Stress’ toward ‘Moderate Heat Stress’ and ‘Strong Heat Stress’ during the period 2046–2065, becoming more severe for the later period (2081–2100). Comparing the two scenarios, B1 exhibited similar projections in the two time periods whereas for A1B there was a significant difference, with both the mode and maximum increasing by 2 °C from 2046–2065 to 2081–2100." .

The concentrations of immobile major and trace elements resemble those encountered in Phanerozoic enriched oceanic ridge basalts (E-MORB) emplaced in incipient oceanic rifts such as Red Sea and Tadjura Gulf troughs. This conclusion is also sustained by: elemental ratios which are MORB-like; multielement chondrite- and MORB-normalized patterns; sedimentological data, especially the shallow water conditions which prevailed during the deposition of lower Kundelungu tillite in which these basic rocks are interstratified; and the geological and structural framework, notably the emplacement of these igneous rocks in a basin not distant from the Kibaran continental land mass. In this area the geological units containing the igneous rocks are not affected by significant tangential tectonism and so the present structural relationships are relatively undisturbed compared with those which prevailed during the emplacement of the igneous rocks." .

According to surface pollen assemblages and the results of the detrended correspondence analysis, the transect can be divided into six major altitudinal pollen zones as alpine cushion vegetation, alpine and subalpine meadows, montane Picea forest, forest-steppe ecotone, Artemisia desert and typical desert, which basically reflect the characteristics of the mountainous vegetation patterns on the north slope of the Middle Tianshan Mountains. However, Picea pollen also exists outside the spruce forest, Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia pollen appeared above the elevation of 1,300 m, indicating that most of them might be introduced from lower elevations by upslope winds. Airborne pollen researches from three regions at different elevations further suggest that a high-frequency northwest anabatic wind has a remarkable influence on the transportation and dispersion of surface pollen in the area." .

Precisely assessment and prediction of drought is important for water resources planning and management. Sampling uncertainty commonly exists in frequency analysis-based hydrological drought assessment due to the limited length of observed data series. Based on the daily streamflow data of the Yichang hydrological station from 1882 to 2009, the streamflow drought index (SDI) series with 12-month time scale was calculated and the hydrological drought of the upper Yangtze River was assessed. By employing the bootstrap method, the impact of sample size on the sampling uncertainty of the SDI was analyzed. The longer record is used to derive the SDI, the narrower the shifting ranges of the parameters of the streamflow volume probability distribution functions and corresponding interval estimators of SDI are. The upper Yangtze River basin has experienced successive alternation of wet and dry years, and the spring seems to be the driest season within a year. The current difficulty in fighting against increasing droughts in upper Yangtze River basin is upgrading. Considering the possible misjudgment of drought degree results from the sampling uncertainty, attention should be paid to the preparation of drought relief strategies in order to reduce the potential losses." .

This observational study attempts to determine factors responsible for the occurrence of heavy rainfall over Iran induced by Mediterranean cyclone, a western severe sub-tropical storm that made rainfall on most regions of the country. On the surface chart, cyclones, anticyclones and weather fronts were identified. The positions of the cold and warm fronts, which extended from a two-core low pressure center, were quite in good agreements with directions of winds i.e., westerly, southerly and easterly flows as well as the regions of precipitation. The heavy rain event occurred due to a Mediterranean cyclone’s activity over the study area, while other conditions were also responsible for this event such as an unstable atmosphere condition with abundant low-level moisture, which the warm and moist air parcels were brought by the southwesterly low-level jet into the country from Persian Gulf, Oman Sea, Indian Ocean and Caspian Sea at lower levels as well as Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Persian Gulf at upper levels over the examined period. A strong low-level convergence zone was observed along the wind-shift line between the southwesterly flow because of the low-level jet and the northeasterly flow due to the Russian high pressure. The amount of precipitable water varied between 20 and 24 kg m−2, surface moisture convergence exceeded 2.5 g kg−1 s−1 and the highest CAPE value in the sounding profiles was observed in Birjand site with 921 J kg−1 during the study period.

New geochemical and chemostratigraphical data and Ar–Ar age determinations for several units of the Breccia Museo deposits (~39 ka), correlate well with the Campanian Ignimbrite-forming eruption.

Lake sediments were dated with210Pb,134Cs and137Cs and the annual deposition rates of organic halogens and organic matter were calculated. Organic bound halogen contents of the sediment aged 150 years was 180 μg Cl g−1 d.w. in both lakes. The concentration of organic bound halogen at the topmost 6 cm of the sediments (less than 20-years-old) ranged from 45 to 80 μg Cl g−1 d.w. This suggests that solvent extractable halogen had enriched in the older sediment layers. The deposition of extractable organic halogen (EOX) in the lakes in 1950’s was 4 to 5 mg Cl m−2 a−1. Since then, the depositon of EOX doubled in both lakes. The deposition of organic matter increased concomitantly from 50 g m−2 a−1 to 110 g m−2 a−1 in Lake Mustalampi and from 35 g m−2 a−1 to 62 g m−2 a−1 in Lake Pyylampi suggesting that the increase in the deposition of organic halogen followed the increase in the deposition of organic matter. Of the 2 kg of organic halogen discharged into the lake, 5% or less was detected in the sediment in tetrahydrofuran extractable form 15 years later." .

Then, the Xin’anjiang Model is applied for runoff production in each grid element where rain data measured by radar at Fuyang station is utilized as the input of the hydrological model. The elements are connected by flow vectors to the outlet of the drainage catchment where runoff is routed by the Muskingum method from each grid element to the outlet according to the length between each grid and the outlet. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is 92.41% from 31 May to 3 August 1998, and 85.64%, 86.62%, 92.57%, and 83.91%, respectively for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th flood events during the whole computational period. As compared with the case where rain-gauge data are used in simulating the hourly hydrograph at Huangnizhuang station in the Shihe Catchment, the index of model efficiency improvement is positive, ranging from 27.56% to 69.39%. This justifies the claim that radar-measured data are superior to rain-gauge data as inputs to hydrological modeling. As a result, the grid-based hydrological model provides a good platform for runoff computation when radar-measured rain data with highly spatiotemporal resolution are taken as the input of the hydrological model." .

The study was performed to determine if chromite ore processing residues (COPR) in fill material surrounding one of the two sites (i.e., the “Study Site”) were associated with statistically significant higher total chromium concentrations in the biotic media at the Study Site relative to the other site (i.e., the “Reference Site”). Copper and lead concentrations were evaluated to determine whether other metals may have accumulated at the Study Site due to factors other than COPR. Concentrations of the three metals were evaluated in samples of water, sediment, plant tissue (Phragmites root and shoot tissues), fish tissue (Fundulus sp. whole body tissue), and blue crab tissues (Callinectes sapidus muscle and hepatopancreas tissues). Physical and chemical characteristics of the two sites that could have influenced the environmental fate and bioavailability of the metals were also evaluated. Concentrations of each of the three metals were approximately an order of magnitude higher in sediment samples from the Study Site. Concentrations of “total” and “dissolved” metals, however, were similar between the water samples collected at the two sites. Tidal flushing of the Study Site was restricted by tidal gates, and the higher metal concentrations in the sediments were attributed to factors resulting from the restricted tidal flushing. Statistically significant higher biota metal concentrations were found at the Study Site only for total chromium in blue crab hepatopancreas tissue and for lead in Phragmites shoot tissue. Tissues from the Study Site contained statistically significant lower concentrations of copper in all the biotic samples and of lead in blue crab hepatopancreas tissue than corresponding tissues from the Reference Site. Despite the Study Site sediments containing metal concentrations three to nine times greater than those in the Reference Site's sediments, no pattern of higher metal concentrations in biotic samples from the Study Site was found. The metals, including total chromium, were tightly bound to the sediments and therefore not bioavailable. Study Site sediment characteristics apparently limiting metal bioavailability included high organic carbon content, reducing conditions, high sulfide concentrations, high specific surface areas associated with a high proportion of silt and clay components, and high cation content." .

The analyses relied on data from 520 slug tests together with 38,000 one-foot core intervals lithological data from the site of the General Separations Area in central Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA. The skewness in the hydraulic conductivity histograms supported the geologic information for the top two aquifers, but revealed stronger clay content, than was reported for the bottom aquifer. The log-normal distribution model described adequately the hydraulic conductivity measurements for all three aquifers although, other distributions described equally well the bottom aquifer measurements. No apparent anisotropy on the horizontal plane was found for the three aquifers, but ratios of horizontal to vertical correlation lengths between 33 and 75 indicated a strong stratification at the site. Three-dimensional Monte Carlo stochastic simulations utilized a grid with larger elements than the support volume of measurements, but of sub-REV (representative elementary volume) dimensions. This necessitated, on one hand, the use of upscaled hydraulic conductivity expressions, but on the other hand did not allow for the use of anisotropic effective hydraulic conductivity expressions (Sarris and Paleologos in J Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess 18: 188–197, 2004). Flux mean and standard deviations components were evaluated on three vertical cross-sections. The mean and variance of the horizontal flux component normal to a no-flow boundary tended to zero at approximately two to three integral scales from that boundary. Close to a prescribed head boundary both the mean and variance of the horizontal flux component normal to the boundary increased from a stable value attained at a distance of about five integral scales from that boundary. The velocity field 〈qx〉 was found to be mildly anisotropic in the top two aquifers, becoming highly anisotropic in the bottom aquifer; 〈qy〉 was anisotropic in all three aquifers with directions of high continuity normal to those of the 〈qx〉 field; finally, 〈qz〉 was highly anisotropic in all three aquifers, with higher continuity along the east–west direction. The mean head field was found to be continuous, despite the high heterogeneity of the underlying hydraulic conductivity field. Directions of high continuity were in alignment with field boundaries and mean flow direction. Conditioning did not influence significantly the expected value of the flux terms, with more pronounced being the effect on the standard deviation of the flux vector components. Conditioning reduced the standard deviations of the horizontal flux components by as much as 50% in the bottom aquifer. Variability in the head cross-sections was affected only marginally, with an average 10% reduction in the respective standard deviation. Finally, the location of the conditioning data did not appear to have a significant effect on the surrounding area, with uniform reduction in standard deviations." .

To assess them, the Effective Drought Index (EDI), which was calculated from the daily precipitation data for 109 grids of the Korean Peninsula, was used. The daily precipitation data were extracted from the Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE). The characteristics of the drought occurrence in North Korea were summed up in the following five points. First, North Korea was divided into four drought sub-regions: the Northeastern region (G1), the Northern region (G2), the Central region (G3), and the Southern region (G4). Second, droughts occurred most frequently in G1 (28) and G4 (28 events) and least frequently in G3 (15 events). Third, in all sub-regions, short-term droughts lasting less than 100 days were the most frequent (53 % or higher) and the longest drought lasted 2,911 days (June 30, 1973 to June 20, 1981), which occurred in G3. Fourth, short-term droughts occurred mainly in spring, mid-term droughts (100–500 days) in spring and summer, and long-term droughts (over 500 days) in summer. Fifth, a dry period (monthly mean EDI <0) appeared in all sub-regions between 1973 and 1981 and between 1990 and 1993, and a strong negative precipitation anomaly appeared during each of these periods. When compared to the droughts in South Korea, those in North Korea were less frequent, but the mean duration was longer. Until 1979, droughts occurred almost at the same time in North Korea as South Korea, but beginning in 1980, the time differences between two regions became larger. Thus, the characteristics of the drought occurrence in North and South Korea differ." .

Variability of various precipitation characteristics, including selected indices of intense precipitation in Zakopane and at Kasprowy Wierch, is illustrated in this paper. None of the trends in these characteristics and indices calculated for the entire time interval exhibit a statistical significance, but short-time fluctuations are evident. The occurrence of intense precipitation in the Tatra Mountains is strongly related to three circulation types. These situations (Nc, NEc, Bc) are associated with cyclones following track Vb after van Bebber. In addition to changing frequencies of circulation, this study also reveals an increase in the frequency of the circulation types associated with extreme precipitation." .

The data series is divided into two parts, namely before and after 1780 AD to better study the characteristic of its cyclicities before, during and after the Maunder Minimum period. The data after 1780 AD show the presence of significant cyclical variations in the 10–12 year range, similar to the ones observed in other solar-activity index series. On longer time scales, only the «Gleissberg» cycle, which appears to modulate the 11 y cycle, seems to be significant. The origin of this last fluctuation in radiocarbon production is influenced by cosmic-ray intensity variations connected to long-term solar-wind flux variations. The analysis of Δ14C in two independent series of dated tree rings during 1564–1780 AD shows that there is an enhancement in radiocarbon level during the Maunder Minimum. Our data show that there are time variations of14C production rate even during the Maunder Minimum, as cosmic rays were modulated by the Sun in spite of the very low solar activity." .

Many prominent fracture zones appear to have depressed transmissivity due to secondary swelling-clay mineral infillings. No current geophysical technique can adequately distinguish these zones from transmissive ones. Given that siting of boreholes on the basis of geology alone can be unreliable, hydrogeologists should concentrate on quantifying the chances of a successful boring, and optimizing those chances by sensible location, favourable borehole orientation and use of artificial enhancement techniques." .

Steeply dipping thick coal seams (SDTCS) are common in the Urumqi coalfield, and some dynamical hazards such as roof collapse and mining- induced seismicity occur frequently in the coal mines. The cause of these events is mainly structure instability in giant rock pillars sandwiched between SDTCS. Developing methods to predict these events is important for safe mining in such a complex environment. This study focuses on understanding the structural mechanics model of a giant rock pillar and presents a viewpoint of the stability of a trend sphenoid fractured beam (TSFB). Some stability index parameters such as failure surface dips were measured, and most dips were observed to be between 46° and 51°. We used a digital panoramic borehole monitoring system to measure the TSFB’s height (ΔH), which varied from 56.37 to 60.50 m. Next, FLAC3D was used to model the distribution and evolution of vertical displacement in the giant rock pillars; the results confirmed the existence of a TSFB structure. Finally, we investigated the acoustic emission (AE) energy accumulation rate and observed that the rate commonly ranged from 20 to 40 kJ/min. The AE energy accumulation rate could be used to anticipate impeding seismic events related to structure failure. The results presented provide a useful approach for forecasting catastrophic events related to structure instability and for developing hazard prevention technology for mining in SDTCS." .

After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann–Kendall (modified Mann–Kendall) test was applied to non-autocorrelated (autocorrelated) series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and Sen’s slope estimator test was used to find the magnitude of change over a time period. Pettitt’s test, Standard Normal Homogeneity Test, and Buishand’s test were further used to test the homogeneity of the rainfall series. The results show an increasing trend in annual rainfall; however, only nine stations have a significant increase during the period of study. On the seasonal time scale, a significant increasing trend was observed in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons, while only nine stations show a significant increasing trend in monsoon rainfall and a significant decreasing trend in the winter rainfall over the last 40 years. During the study period, 15.4 and 13.90 % increase were estimated for annual and monsoonal rainfall, respectively. Furthermore, seven stations exhibit changes in mean rainfall while majority of the stations considered (Eighteen stations) exhibit homogeneous trends in annual and seasonal rainfall over the country. The performance of the different tests used in this study was consistent at the verified significance level." .

The fracture maps help to identify at least three different types of co-seismic ruptures, e.g., X–X′, T1 and T2, which characterize sinistral-sense shearing of rocks, confined between two sinistral strike-slip faults slipping at seismic rate. From the asymmetric distribution of tensile fractures around the sinistral-sense fault vein, the direction of seismic rupture propagation is predicted to have occurred from west-southwest to east-northeast, during an ancient (Ordovician?) earthquake. Calculations of approximate co-seismic displacement on the faults and seismic moment (M 0) of the earthquake are attempted, following the methods proposed by earlier workers. These estimates broadly agree to the findings from other studied fault zones (e.g., Gole Larghe Fault zone, Italian Alps). This study supports the proposition by some researchers that important seismological information can be extracted from tectonic pseudotachylytes of all ages, provided they are not reworked by subsequent tectonic activity." .

Meta-igneous samples collected from the region were studied to determine their sources and ages. We find significant geochemical differences between metagabbros of the Karakaya and Neo-Tethyan units in terms of their trace elements: Neo-Tethyan rocks are consistent with generation in an island arc setting, whereas Karakaya assemblages were likely generated in an oceanic spreading-center environment. Karakaya metagabbros also contain glaucophane, consistent with subduction subsequent to formation. Small (2–50 μm) zircon and baddeleyite grains from four Karakaya metagabbros were dated in thin section using an ion microprobe. The results demonstrate the reliability of the method to directly constrain the tectonomagmatic history of these types of assemblages. The rocks yield Late Permian/Early Triassic 238U/206Pb crystallization ages of 258 ± 14 Ma (±1σ, zircon) and 254 ± 8 Ma (±1σ, baddeleyite) and an Early Cretaceous minimum metamorphic age of 137 ± 8 Ma (±1σ, zircon). Some zircon grains and baddeleyite grains with zircon overgrowths yield Early to Middle Jurassic ages. Here we present a model in which metamorphism and deformation in this region occurred during northward subduction and closure of a Paleo-Tethyan ocean basin and accretion of the Karakaya units to the Laurasian continental margin. This was followed by the onset of closure of the Neo-Tethys during the Campanian-Paleocene and accretion of island arc units to the Tokat region." .

Diagenetic processes in sandstones can be grouped as eodiagenetic, mesodiagenetic, and telodiagenetic. Eodiagenesis can be associated with Muschelkalk, Keuper, and probably early Jurassic times. Mesodiagenesis is probably related to Jurassic times. Diagenetic chemical reactions suggest a maximum burial less than 1.5 km and low temperatures (<120°C). Patterns of porosity reduction by compaction and cementation suggest four diagenetic stages: (1) Loss of primary porosity by early mechanical compaction; (2) early cementation (K-feldspar and dolomite); (3) dissolution of cements; and (4) framework collapse by re-compaction. These stages are manifested by the presence of two types of sandstone. Type I sandstones present high intergranular volume (mean, 30%). Type II sandstones are characterized by high compactional porosity loss and exhibit low values of intergranular volume (mean, 16.9%). Type II sandstones are associated with the dissolution of cement and later re-compaction of type I sandstones. An intermediate telodiagenetic phase is deduced and related to the sharp unconformity between Lower Cretaceous sediments and the underlying sediments. This suggests that a mechanically unstable framework collapsed during the Cretaceous, generating type II sandstones. The analyzed diagenetic paths have a wide applicability on similar marginal areas of rift basins." .

Major and trace-element concentrations define two distinct protolith groups for the eclogites. The low-Fe–Ti (LFT) eclogites have low-TiO2 content (<0.67 wt%), negative high field strength element anomalies, and variable enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILE). The rare earth element (REE) patterns are characterized by strong light-REE (LREE) enrichment and heavy-REE (HREE) depletion. The high-Fe–Ti (HFT) eclogites have small to moderate LILE enrichment and lack Nb anomalies. The REE patterns of the HFT eclogites are characterized by LREE depletion and relatively flat MREE–HREE patterns. The rock compositions and petrographic features of the LFT eclogites resemble gabbros formed in a continental rift environment with minor to moderate contamination of a mantle-derived mafic magma by continental crust, whereas the HFT eclogites resemble mafic rocks formed in extensional oceanic environments. We interpret the HFT suite to represent a later stage in an evolution from continental rift to open ocean, following the origin of the LFT suite. Dyke amphibolite compositions, except for probable SiO2 loss associated with metamorphic dehydration reactions, appear to represent liquid compositions quenched in conduits through the lower crust. MELTS modeling shows that dyke amphibolite compositions can be related to each other by fractional crystallization under strongly oxidizing conditions at ~0.5 GPa pressure, and all can be derived from a low-degree melt of modified fertile peridotite from around 1.7 GPa. Cumulates crystallized from the parental liquids of the amphibolites under oxidizing conditions may have yielded the protoliths of the HFT suite." .

These highly destructive events may cause loss of life and substantial damage to infrastructure, especially in densely populated areas and where geothermal systems are actively exploited for energy. We report on the occurrence of a large number of explosion craters associated with the offshore venting of gas and thermal waters at the volcanic island of Panarea, Italy, demonstrating that violent explosions similar to those observed on land also are common in the shallow submarine environment. With diameters ranging from 5 to over 100 m, the observed circular seafloor depressions record a history of major gas explosions caused by frequent perturbation of the submarine geothermal system over the past 10,000 years. Estimates of the total gas flux indicate that the Panarea geothermal system released over 70 Mt of CO2 over this period of time, suggesting that CO2 venting at submerged arc volcanoes contributes significantly to the global atmospheric budget of this greenhouse gas. The findings at Panarea highlight that shallow submarine gas explosions represent a previously unrecognized volcanic hazard around populated volcanic islands that needs to be taken into account in the development of risk management strategies." .

Extreme temperature indices were examined, which were defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices, for Doha, Qatar; these indices were then compared with those from neighboring countries. The trends were calculated for a 30-year period (1983–2012), using hourly data obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. The results showed spatially consistent warming trends throughout the region. For Doha, 11 of the 12 indices studied showed significant warming trends. In particular, the warming trends were represented by an increase in the number of warm days and nights and a decrease in the number of cool nights and days. The high-temperature extremes during the night have risen at more than twice the rate of their corresponding daytime extremes. The intensity and frequency of hot days have increased, and the minimum temperature indices exhibited a higher rate of warming. The climatic changes in Doha are consistent with the region-wide heat-up in recent decades across the Middle East. However, the rapid economic expansion, increase of population since the 1990s, and urban effects in the region are thought to have intensified the rapidly warming climate pattern observed in Doha since the turn of the century." .

Tombel graben is a young volcanic field, whereas Mounts Bambouto horst is an old stratovolcano with calderas. Volcanic products in both settings have a signature close to that of Ocean Island Basalt implying a major role of FOZO (focal zone) component and varied contribution of depleted mantle (DMM) and enriched mantle (EM) components. The Cameroon Volcanic Line is a hot line essentially resulting from passive rifting. Eocene to Recent intraplate basaltic volcanism in the study area was probably a result of mantle upwelling coupled with lithospheric extension. The olivine basaltic magma of horst volcanoes evolved in a large-scale, steady-state magmatic reservoir via crystal fractionation and limited contamination to highly differentiated alkaline lavas (trachyte and phonolite). Conversely, rapid ascent of lavas along multiple fault lines of graben structures produced less evolved lavas (hawaiite) within small reservoirs. This model, evaluated for the study area, involves mantle upwelling inside zones of weakness in the lithosphere after intra-continental extension. It can be applied to other parts of the Cameroon Volcanic Line as well, and is similar to that described in other intra-continental rift-related areas in Africa." .

The cyclic strain rates were chosen as 1.0×10−2, 1.33×10−3 and 0.33×10−3 s−1. The octahedral slip systems were confirmed to be activated on all the specimens. The experimental result shows that the fatigue behavior depends on the crystallographic orientation and cyclic strain rate. Except [001] orientation specimens, it is found from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination that there are typical fatigue striations on the fracture surfaces. These fatigue striations are made up of cracks. The width of the fatigue striations depends on the crystallographic orientation and varies with the total strain range. A simple linear relationship exists between the width and total shear strain range modified by an orientation and strain rate parameter. The nonconformity to the Schmid law of tensile/compressive flow stress and plastic behavior existed at 950°C, and an orientation and strain rate modified Lall-Chin-Pope (LCP) model was derived for the nonconformity. The influence of crystallographic orientation and cyclic strain rate on the LCF behavior can be predicted satisfactorily by the model. In terms of an orientation and strain rate modified total strain range, a model for fatigue life was proposed and used successfully to correlate the fatigue lives studied in this article." .

In addition, we report Nd-isotopes in a few kimberlites from South Africa, Lesotho and from the eastern part of China. The major element compositions of the New York dike rocks and of their constituent minerals including a xenolith of eclogite are comparable with those from the Kimberley area in South Africa. The K-Ar age of emplacement of the New York dikes is further established to be 143 Ma. We have analyzed the Nd-isotopic composition of the following kimberlites and related rocks: Nine kimberlite pipes from South Africa and Lesotho, two from southern India; one from the U.S.S.R., fifteen kimberlite pipes and related dike rocks from eastern and central U.S. and two pipes from the Shandong Province of eastern China. The age of emplacement of these kimberlites ranges from 1300 million years to 90 million years. The initial Nd-isotopic compositions of these kimberlitic rocks expressed as ɛ NdIwith respect to a chondritic bulk-earth growth-curve show a range between 0 and +4, with the majority of the kimberlites being in the range 0 to +2. This range is not matched by any other suite of mantle-derived igneous rocks. This result strengthens our earlier conclusion that kimberlitic liquids are derived from a relatively primeval and unique mantle reservoir with a nearly chondritic Sm/Nd ratio." .

The global and regional climates simulated by such models are demonstrably sensitive to the parameterization of terrestrial hydrologic processes. There exists, therefore, a clear requirement to evaluate different parameterization approaches in terms of the representation of the terrestrial phase of the hydrologic cycle. One potential means of meeting this requirement is by using available continental water-balance summaries. In this study three versions of a GCM, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model Version l (CCM1), differing mainly in spatial resolution and the representation of the surface hydrology, are compared against existing water-balance studies. Additional streamflow data are incorporated as a means of further validating both the water-balance approach and the GCM surface hydrologic parameterization in capturing the gross features of continental-scale hydrology." .

A study of juvenile, cognate, and accidental components in the eruption products provides new constraints on vent development during the five eruptive phases, and on the processes that initiated the eruption. The eruption began with subplinian (phase 0) and plinian (phase 1) phases from a vent on a NE–SW fault line that bisects the volcanic field. During phase 1, the magma fragmentation level dropped from the surface to the level of subvolcanic basement and magmatic intrusions. The fragmentation level shallowed again, and the vent migrated northwards (during phase 2) into the flooded 22 ka caldera. The eruption then became strongly phreatomagmatic and discharged low-temperature ignimbrite containing abundant fragments of post-22 ka, pre-Minoan intracaldera lavas (phase 3). Phase 4 discharged hot, fluidized pyroclastic flows from subaerial vents and constructed three main ignimbrite fans (northwestern, eastern, and southern) around the volcano. The first phase-4 flows were discharged from a vent, or vents, in the northern half of the volcanic field, and laid down lithic-block-rich ignimbrite and lag breccias across much of the NW fan. About a tenth of the lithic debris in these flows was subvolcanic basement. New subaerial vents then opened up, probably across much of the volcanic field, and finer-grained ignimbrite was discharged to form the E and S fans. If major caldera collapse took place during the eruption, it probably occurred during phase 4. Three juvenile components were discharged during the eruption—a volumetrically dominant rhyodacitic pumice and two andesitic components: microphenocryst-rich andesitic pumices and quenched andesitic enclaves. The microphenocryst-rich pumices form a textural, mineralogical, chemical, and thermal continuum with co-erupted hornblende diorite nodules, and together they are interpreted as the contents of a small, variably crystallized intrusion that was fragmented and discharged during the eruption, mostly during phases 0 and 1. The microphenocryst-rich pumices, hornblende diorite, andesitic enclaves, and fragments of pre-Minoan intracaldera andesitic lava together form a chemically distinct suite of Ba-rich, Zr-poor andesites that is unique in the products of Santorini since 530 ka. Once the Minoan magma reservoir was primed for eruption by recharge-generated pressurization, the rhyodacite moved upwards by exploiting the plane of weakness offered by the pre-existing andesite–diorite intrusion, dragging some of the crystal-rich contents of the intrusion with it." .

Six releases of SF6 tracer were performed (March 9–11 and July 1–3, 2004) in the same suburban area of Toulouse conurbation, during the Intensive Observing Periods (IOP) of CAPITOUL. Concentration data were collected both at ground-level along axes perpendicular to the wind direction (at distances ranging between 280 m and 5000 m from the release point), and above the ground at 100 m and 200 m height using aircraft flights. Meteorological conditions were all associated with daytime anticyclonic conditions with weak winds and convective clear and cloudy boundary layers. A meso-scale dispersion modelling system, PERLE, developed at Meteo-France for environmental emergencies in case of atmospheric accidental release, was evaluated in terms of meteorology and dispersion, for the different tracer experiments, in its operational configuration. PERLE is based on the combination of the non-hydrostatic meso-scale MESO-NH model, running at 2 km horizontal resolution, and the Lagrangian particle model SPRAY. The statistical meteorological evaluation includes two sets of simulations with initialisation from ECMWF or ALADIN. The meteorological day-to-day error statistics show fairly good Meso-NH predictions, in terms of wind speed, wind direction and near-surface temperature. A strong sensitivity to initial fields concerns the surface fluxes, crucial for dispersion, with an excessive drying of the convective boundary layer with ALADIN initial fields, leading to an overprediction of surface sensible heat fluxes. A parameterization of dry and shallow convection according to the Eddy-Diffusivity-Mass-Flux (EDMF) approach (Pergaud et al. 2008) allows an efficient mixing in the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) and improves significantly the wind fields. A statistical evaluation of the dispersion prediction was then performed and shows a realistic behaviour of the system, with a good location of the concentration maxima. But the lateral spread of the plumes is quasi-systematically underestimated, mainly in July, even when meteorological conditions are well reproduced. In the same way, higher integrated concentration values are slightly overestimated. The remove of the EDMF scheme in Meso-NH artificially improves the horizontal dispersion, underlying compensating errors. Sensitivity tests performed on the Lagrangian time scales in the coupling Meso-NH-SPRAY have been conducted. But they don’t solve the shortcoming and lead to the conclusion that SPRAY could have some difficulties to correctly reproduce the mixing for daytime thermal convection." .

The prevailing diurnal behavior of the wind speed and wind direction as a function of the season was highlighted for the winter and the summer 2007. Two different patterns of the local circulation can be alternately observed in the night to early morning and after the sunset to late evening. The data analysis has shown that the statistical distribution of wind direction during the night, in winter, presents great occurrence at low levels in the northeastern sector and around 100°. Moreover, it has been observed that the nocturnal components of the wind direction at low-level changes with the height, and these changes can be associated with the effects induced by the large-scale flow on the local circulation at higher levels." .

The resulting geothermobarometers involve thermodynamic expressions that relate temperature and pressure to equilibrium constants. Specifically, the jadeite (Jd; NaAlSi2O6)–diopside/hedenbergite (DiHd; Ca(Mg, Fe) Si2O6) exchange equilibrium between clinopyroxene and liquid is temperature sensitive. When compositional corrections are made to the calibrated equilibrium constant the resulting geothermometer is (i) 104 T=6.73−0.26* ln [Jdpx*Caliq*FmliqDiHdpx*Naliq*Alliq] −0.86* ln [MgliqMgliq+Feliq]+0.52*ln [Caliq] an expression which estimates temperature to ±27 K. Compared to (i), the equilibrium constant for jadeite formation is more sensitive to pressure resulting in a thermobarometer (ii) P=−54.3+299* T104+36.4* T104 ln [Jdpx[Siliq]2*Naliq*Alliq] +367*[Naliq*Alliq] which estimates pressure to ± 1.4 kbar. Pressure is in kbar, T is in Kelvin. Quantities such as Naliq represent the cation fraction of the given oxide (NaO0.5) in the liquid and Fm=MgO+FeO. The mole fractions of Jd and diopside+hedenbergite (DiHd) components are calculated from a normative scheme which assigns the lesser of Na or octahedral Al to form Jd; any excess AlVI forms Calcium Tschermak’s component (CaTs; CaAlAlSiO6); Ca remaining after forming CaTs and CaTiAl2O6 is taken as DiHd. Experimental data not included in the regressions were used to test models (i) and (ii). Error on predictions of T using model (i) is ±40 K. A pressure-dependent form of (i) reduces this error to ±30 K. Using model (ii) to predict pressures, the error on mean values of 10 isobaric data sets (0–25 kbar, 118 data) is ±0.3 kbar. Calculating thermodynamic properties from regression coefficients in (ii) gives VJd f of 23.4 ±1.3 cm3/mol, close to the value anticipated from bar molar volume data (23.5 cm3/mol). Applied to clinopyroxene phenocrysts from Mauna Kea, Hawaii lavas, the expressions estimate equilibration depths as great as 40 km. This result indicates that transport was sufficiently rapid that at least some phenocrysts had insufficient time to re-equilibrate at lower pressures." .

We analyzed the changes in the indices of climate extremes, on the basis of daily maximum and minimum air temperature and precipitation at 59 meteorological stations in the arid region of northwest China over the period 1960–2003. Twelve indices of extreme temperature and six indices of extreme precipitation are examined. Temperature extremes show a warming trend with a large proportion of stations having statistically significant trends for all temperature indices. The regional occurrence of extreme cool days and nights has decreased by −0.93 and −2.36 days/decade, respectively. Over the same period, the occurrence of extreme warm days and nights has increased by 1.25 and 2.10 days/decade, respectively. The number of frost days and ice days shows a statistically significant decrease at the rate of −3.24 and −2.75 days/decade, respectively. The extreme temperature indices also show the increasing trend, with larger values for the index describing variations in the lowest minimum temperature. The trends of Min Tmin (Tmax) and Max Tmin (Tmax) are 0.85 (0.61) and 0.32 (0.17) °C/decade. Most precipitation indices exhibit increasing trends across the region. On average, regional maximum 1-day precipitation, annual total wet-day precipitation, and number of heavy precipitation days and very wet days show insignificant increases. Insignificant decreasing trends are also found for consecutive dry days. The rank-sum statistic value of most temperature indices exhibits consistent or statistically significant trends across the region. The regional medians after 1986 of Min Tmin (Tmax), Max Tmin (Tmax), warm days (nights), and warm spell duration indicator show statistically more larger than medians before 1986, but the frost days, ice days, cool days (nights), and diurnal temperature range reversed. The medians of precipitation indices show insignificant change except for consecutive dry days before and after 1986." .

Little geological information is available for improving the understanding of the structure of this large volcanic system and its relationship to regional tectonics. After reviewing the tectonic evolution of the region, the analysis of a Digital Elevation Model and results from a field campaign dedicated to mapping geological structures in the summit area and at the SE base of Mt Cameroon are presented. Mt Cameroon is a lava-dominated volcano with long steep (over 30°) flanks. It is elongate parallel to its well defined rift zone. The summit plateau is bordered by 10 m high cliffs formed by summit subsidence along normal faults. Geological profiles were measured along rivers cutting through a topographic step at the SE base of Mt Cameroon. This step is associated with deformed Miocene sediments from the Douala basin that are overlain by volcanic products. Weak sediments of this area are deformed by 050°–060° and 020°–030° trending asymmetrical folds verging toward the SE, and thrusts faults related to the spreading of the volcano over its mechanically weak substratum. Combined remote sensing and field observations suggest that spreading is accommodated by summit subsidence and flanks sliding. Both slow spreading movements and catastrophic collapses of the steep flanks are interpreted to result from complex interactions between the growing edifice, repeated dyke intrusions, the weak sedimentary substratum and tectonic structures." .

We have performed a K-white mica study using powder X-ray diffraction derived Kübler Index (KI) and K-white mica b cell dimension, and the spectrally derived wavelength of the 2,200 nm absorption feature (“2200wvl”) of supposedly allochthonous units and the underlying par-autochthon. KI reveals a slight, but significant inversion of metamorphic grade, which shows that the Hörre Belt and the Hessische Schieferserie adjacent to the South were emplaced by thrusting after they had acquired peak metamorphism (M 1) in deeper parts of the orogenic wedge. Only in the westernmost part of the study area, the par-autochthon and the allochthon show the same grade of anchizonal metamorphism. This observation, together with K-white mica b cell dimensions <9.000 Å and 2200wvl <2,204 nm, suggests a second, low-pressure metamorphism M 2 subsequent to the emplacement of the allochthon. This is supported by an anomaly of published conodont alteration index data. Our results expand the original width of the Rheno-Hercynian passive margin to at least 580, more probably to 670 or even 750 km. Palinspastic restoration also reveals that the Givetian to Early Carboniferous volcanic belt of the Lahn/Dill area is not only younger than the Emsian MORB-type lavas of the Rheno-Hercynian ocean, but was also separated, from the latter, by a largely non-volcanic belt of at least c. 220 km width. Apparently, the Givetian to Early Carboniferous volcanic episodes were unrelated to the Rheno-Hercynian drift stage." .

Component analyses of the horizons within single units reveal that almost all wet and cohesive horizons contain ash aggregates. Based on their morphology and internal structure four different types of aggregates were distinguished: (a) accretionary lapilli, (b) armored lapilli, (c) irregular aggregates, and (d) cylindrical aggregates. The first three types have been described in the volcanological literature (field and experimental studies); cylindrical forms are reported here for the first time. These hollow cylindrical aggregates consist of concentric layers of crystals and glass fragments set in a finer-grained matrix. They formed around millimeter-size foliage fragments that are locally preserved in the interior of the aggregates as scorched or completely carbonized vestiges. SEM analyses suggest different mechanisms of formation for the four types of aggregates. Irregular aggregates and armored lapilli formed nearly instantaneously, whereas accretionary lapilli and cylindrical aggregates resulted from progressive aggregation of ash in different regions of the eruptive cloud. All types of ash aggregates contain fractured particles. This common feature suggests that particles ruptured during fragmentation prior to the growth of the aggregates. Broken clasts with cracks filled by a fine-grained matrix only occur inside the cylindrical ash aggregates and to a lesser degree in some types of accretionary lapilli. This suggests that small thermal contrasts at the contact of warm particles with the colder fine-grained matrix of the aggregate cause existing small fractures to propagate and open as the already weakened clasts deform slightly. The occurrence of all four types of aggregates in some horizons indicates that several mechanisms of aggregation occurred nearly simultaneously. The pyroclastic clouds therefore were not only stratified in terms of density but the content of fluid phases also were not uniform. A dark-red, Fe-rich amorphous film (locally rich in P and S) envelops the particles and fosters their preservation in the deposits by forming a hard shell. The composition of this cement reflects the abundance of these elements in acid fluids of hydrothermal systems that were intersected by the conduit during the eruption. In distal areas, fallout aggregates were incorporated by dissipating pyroclastic surges." .

Regional evidence indicates that the rocks are exhumed from depths of 8–10 km and temperatures of 200–250 °C. Foliated cataclasites in a zone 5–40 m thick are accompanied by interlaced pseudotachylyte, and are cut through by a late-stage master fault and zones of random fabric cataclasite. Textures and microstructures in the foliated cataclasites reflect contemporaneous or cyclic operation of cataclastic, crystal–plastic and solution transfer deformation mechanisms, partitioned differently between different phases. The deformation regime is interpreted as a form of semi-brittle flow, facilitated by crystal–plastic deformation of phyllosilicate phases in a relatively weak interconnected matrix. Quartz and feldspar are deformed mainly by cataclasis. The presence of pseudotachylyte indicates the fault was seismically active, and non-localised semi-brittle flow was episodically punctuated by high strain-rate earthquake events. Late-stage formation of a discrete master fault probably reflects a change from semi-brittle flow to brittle faulting. The presently exposed level of the fault is thought to represent a section of the mid-crustal brittle–ductile transition in the seismogenic zone. Thus, this study provides a tangible natural example of theoretically and experimentally predicted fault rocks." .

The hydrogeological properties and the temperature variations with depth have been examined under the Geological Society of India by drilling borewells at a few locations. The temperature distribution is one of the most essential parameters in quantifying the energy potential of a geothermal reservoir in its life time. Such temperature distribution has not been mapped for the Puga Valley. 2D Kriging technique is adopted in this study to assess temperature distribution for thermal manifestation zone at various depths and these are further used to estimate the thermal gradients at ungauged locations of the valley. From the results obtained, it is observed that the thermal gradient in the eastern zone of the valley is relatively higher. This indicates a possible bottom heat source in the eastern zone of the valley. The results of this study could be helpful in identifying the distinctive conceivable locations of injection and production wells for the extraction of entrapped heat within the rock strata. Also, a priority order is drawn in terms of thermal gradients at gauged and ungauged locations which may be helpful in deciding the zones of high and low heat sources in the reservoir." .

They form part of the basement of the Neuquén Basin and are mostly coeval with the Late Paleozoic accretionary prism complex of the Coastal Cordillera, south-central Chile. U–Pb SHRIMP dating of detrital zircon yielded a maximum depositional age of 374 Ma (Upper Devonian) for the Guaraco Norte Formation and 389 Ma for the Arroyo del Torreón Formation. Detrital magmatic zircon from the Guaraco Norte Formation are grouped into two main populations of Devonian and Ordovician (Famatinian) ages. In the Arroyo del Torreón Formation, zircon populations are also of Devonian and Ordovician (Famatinian), as well as of Late Neoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic ages. In both units, there is a conspicuous population of Devonian magmatic zircon grains (from 406 ± 4 Ma to 369 ± 5 Ma), indicative of active magmatism at that time range. The εHf values of this population range between −2.84 and −0.7, and the TDM-(Hf) are mostly Mesoproterozoic, suggesting that the primary sources of the Devonian magmatism contained small amounts of Mesoproterozoic recycled crustal components. The chemical composition of the Guaraco Norte Formation corresponds to recycled, mature polycyclic sediment of mature continental provenance, pointing to a passive margin with minor inputs from continental margin magmatic rocks. The chemical signature of the Huaraco Formation indicates that a magmatic arc was the main provenance for sediments of this unit, which is consistent with the occurrence of tuff—mostly in the Arroyo del Torreón Formation and very scarcely in the Huaraco Formation—with a volcanic-arc signature, jointly indicating the occurrence of a Carboniferous active arc magmatism during the deposition of the two units. The Guaraco Norte Formation is interpreted to represent passive margin deposits of mostly Lower Carboniferous age (younger than 374 Ma and older than 326 Ma) that precede the onset of the accretionary prism in Chile and extend into the earliest stage of the accretion, in a retrowedge position. The Arroyo del Torreón and Huaraco formations are considered to be retrowedge basin deposits to the early frontal accretionary prism (Eastern Series) of Chile. The presence of volcanism with arc signature in the units provides evidence of a Mississippian magmatic arc that can be correlated with limited exposures of the same age in the Frontal Cordillera (Argentina). The arc would have migrated to the West (Coastal Batholith) during Pennsylvanian–Permian times (coevally with the later basal accretionary prism/Western Series). The source of a conspicuous population of Devonian detrital zircon interpreted to be of magmatic origin in the studied units is discussed in various possible geotectonic scenarios, the preferred model being a magmatic arc developed in the Chilenia block, related to a west-dipping subduction beneath Chilenia before and shortly after its collision against Cuyania/Gondwana, at around 390 Ma and not linked to the independent, Devonian–Mississippian arc, developed to the south, in Patagonia." .

The geological investigations carried out on the slope of the landslide showed that the sliding mass was cut by numerous faults. The factors controlling the landslide failure were complex, and it is known that neither earthquakes nor heavy precipitation could have triggered the disruption. The groundwater within the solid rock mass has been surveyed, because significant precipitation events during the 2 years preceding the beginning of the paroxysmal phase of the landslide could have led to an increase in pore water pressure along these fractures, thereby triggering the landslide. In order to achieve a full understanding of the failure mechanism, and to identify the origin of the groundwater, a hydrogeochemical survey was carried out over a period of 1 year. The results reveal the existence of high sulphate concentrations in the groundwater originating in springs located at the bottom of the landslide. The sulphate concentrations are correlated with high calcium concentrations, and clearly indicate the presence of gypsum in the vicinity of the lower reaches of the landslide. The presence of gypsum in this area of the Pyrenees suggests that deep groundwater played a role in triggering the landslide." .

The groundwater was confirmed to be the origin of nitrate input into this hydrosystem. Multivariate statistical treatment of the analytical results for principal components, combined with hierarchical clustering of samples allowed us to describe the behaviour of this hydrosystem. From our findings, the pools can be classified in two main groups depending on the main source of the water input, which is either surface or groundwater. Simultaneously, a comprehensive study has been undertaken to achieve a characterization of sediments by analysing major components and heavy metal.

All maps were co-registered in the same reference system and used to build a quantitative reconstruction of the morphological changes of the Sciara del Fuoco slope. The changes mainly relate to the emplacement of many lava flows and their successive erosion. A comparative quantitative analysis yields estimates of areas and volumes of the lava fields formed on the sub-aerial part of the Sciara del Fuoco during a number of effusive events between 1937 and 2001, some of them never assessed before. The results of the analysis constrain the interpretation of the evolution and the magnitude of the recent effusive activity at the Stromboli volcano.

Zn was determined at pH 3.5 in HCl and pH 4.5 in HNO3, after neutralizing the samples with NH3/NH4Cl buffer. Manganese could then be determined, after further addition of ammoniacal buffer solution up to pH 7.5 and 8.5. Ni and Co were determined in the adsorptive mode after formation of dimethylglyoximates at pH 9.2. The effect of pH on the stripping peaks of manganese was studied. Good agreement was observed between DPSV and AAS results for Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu and Mn, but the concentrations of Ni and Co were below the detection limits for AAS. Good agreement was obtained between DPSV results in HCl and HNO3 for Ni and Co.

Several domains with different exhumation histories are identified. The Coastal Cordillera is characterized by uniform and coherent exhumation between Late Triassic (∼200 Ma) and late Miocene times, with surprisingly slow average rates of 0.03–0.04 mm/a. Thermal anomalies, related to Late Cretaceous and early Miocene magmatism, have regionally modified fission track age patterns. The Upper Cretaceous thermal overprint is of previously unrecognized significance and extent in the Coastal Cordillera south of 39°S. With the exception of a local but distinct Pliocene to Recent exhumation period in the high-relief Cordillera Nahuelbuta segment between 37°S and 38°S, Cenozoic overall exhumation in the Coastal Cordillera was very slow. The sedimentary record shows that uplift and subsidence here was episodic, with low amplitudes and durations. This rules out large-scale, long-term, Cenozoic accretion, trench-parallel tilting, and tectonic erosion processes in the forearc. The Main Andean Cordillera shows markedly greater long-term exhumation rates than the Coastal Cordillera and, at ∼39°S, a steep exhumation gradient. To the south, long-term average Pliocene to Recent exhumation rates of ∼1 to ∼2 mm/a in the Liquiñe area (39°45′S) are almost an order of magnitude more rapid than average Paleogene to Recent exhumation near Lonquimay (38°30′S) and farther north. While no imprint of the intra-arc Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault Zone on the exhumation pattern is evident, long-term exhumation rates decrease from the crest of the Andes toward the western foothills. Exhumation gradients correlate with climatic gradients, suggesting a causal link to the variable intensity of late Miocene to Pleistocene glacial erosion." .

The fallout tephra was dispersed from a progressively rising plinian eruption column that became exposed to different wind speeds and directions at different heights in the stratosphere, leading to an asymmetric tephra fan with different facies in the western and southern sector. Tephra dispersal data integrated with geochemical compositions of lava flows in the area facilitate delimitation of the source vent to the south of Chiltepe Peninsula. UAq, Lower Apoyeque Tephra, Apoyeque Ignimbrite, and two lava lithic clasts in San Isidro Tephra together form a differentiation trend distinct from that of the younger tephras and lavas at Chiltepe Volcanic Complex in a TiO2 versus K2O diagram, compositionally precluding a genetic relationship of UAq with the present-day Apoyeque stratovolcano. Apoyeque Volcano in its present shape did not exist at the time of the UAq eruption. The surface expression of the UAq vent is now obscured by younger eruption products and lake water. Pressure-temperature constraints based on mineral-melt equilibria and fluid inclusions in plagioclase indicate at least two magma storage levels. Clinopyroxenes crystallised in a deep crustal reservoir at ∼24 km depth as inferred from clinopyroxene-melt inclusion pairs. Chemical disequilibrium between clinopyroxenes and matrix glasses indicates rapid magma ascent to the shallower reservoir at ∼5.4 km depth, where magnesiohornblendes and plagioclase fractionated at a temperature of ∼830 °C. Water concentrations were ∼5.5 wt.% as derived from congruent results of amphibole and plagioclase-melt hygrometry.

Both CFSv1 and CFSv2 overestimate SSS over the TIO throughout the year. CFSv1 displays improper SSS seasonal cycle over the Bay of Bengal (BoB), which is due to weaker model precipitation and improper river runoff especially during summer and fall. Over the southeastern Arabian Sea (AS) weak horizontal advection associated with East Indian coastal current during winter limits the formation of spring fresh water pool. On the other hand, weaker Somali jet during summer results for reduced positive salt tendency in the central and eastern AS. Strong positive precipitation bias in CFSv1 over the region off Somalia during winter, weaker vertical mixing and absence of horizontal salt advection lead to unrealistic barrier layer during winter and spring. The weaker stratification and improper spatial distribution of barrier layer thickness (BLT) in CFSv1 indicate that not only horizontal flux distribution but also vertical salt distribution displays large discrepancies. Absence of fall Wyrtki jet and winter equatorial currents in this model limit the advection of horizontal salt flux to the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The associated weaker stratification in eastern equatorial Indian Ocean can lead to deeper mixed layer and negative Sea Surface Temperature (SST) bias, which in turn favor positive Indian Ocean Dipole bias in CFSv1. It is important to note that improper spatial distribution of barrier layer and stratification can alter the air–sea interaction and precipitation in the models. On the other hand CFSv2 could produce the seasonal evolution and spatial distribution of SSS, BLT and stratification better than CFSv1. However CFSv2 displays positive bias in evaporation over the whole domain and negative bias in precipitation over the BoB and equatorial Indian Ocean, resulting net reduction in the fresh water availability. This net reduction in fresh water forcing and the associated weaker stratification lead to deeper (than observed) mixed layer depth and is primarily responsible for the cold SST bias in CFSv2. However overall improvement of mean salinity distribution in CFSv2 is about 30 % and the mean error has reduced by more than 1 psu over the BoB. This improvement is mainly due to better fresh water forcing and model physics. Realistic run off information, better ocean model and high resolution in CFSv2 contributed for the improvement. Further improvement can be achieved by reducing biases in the moisture flux and precipitation." .

Major transgressive events and the Ordovician glaciation are nevertheless documented, allowing the delineation of tectonic-, eustasy- or climate-driven unconformities. Lower Palaeozoic key events and related unconformities that characterize the North Gondwana platform have therefore a signature in the eastern Murzuq Basin. The basement/cover unconformity, also known as the infra-Tassilian surface, truncates all the deformed and metamorphosed Lower Cambrian and older rocks. Above is a ?Middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician megasequence (Murizidié and Hasawnah Fms.), which is in turn truncated by an intra-Ordovician, angular unconformity. This megasequence is unconformably overlain by a Middle Ordovician (Hawaz Fm.) to Silurian (Tanzzuft and Akakus Fms) megasequence, which includes the Upper Ordovician glaciogenic unit (Mamuniyat Fm.), bounded at the base by a polygenic glacial erosion surface showing corrugated glacial lineations, tillites, and glaciotectonic structures. The Middle Ordovician to Silurian megasequence is finally truncated by a base-Devonian, angular unconformity overlain by fluvial sandstones. Regarding the possibility that those fluvial deposits may be as younger as Late Devonian in the eastern Murzuq Basin based on palaeoflora, the so-called Caledonian unconformity might be here a much younger (mid-Eifelian?) surface, and the occurrence of the Lower Devonian “Tadrart Fm.” is questioned. The Upper Ordovician glacial erosion surface, which is sometimes referred to as the Taconic unconformity, usually truncates Middle Ordovician strata in the Murzuq Basin but reaches significantly deeper stratigraphic levels in places that have been previously involved in the intra-Ordovician deformation event. In the Murizidié (southeastern Murzuq Basin), the infra-Tassilian surface, the intra-Ordovician unconformity, and the Upper Ordovician glacial erosion surface amalgamate together. Here, an estimate of the glacial erosion depth cannot be derived from the stratigraphic hiatus beneath the glacial incision, the main part of which relate to the intra-Ordovician tectonic event. The Upper Ordovician climate-related glacial erosion surface is not a valid unconformity for a sequence hierarchy framework of the Lower Palaeozoic, although it presents most of the physical attributes of tectonic-driven unconformities." .

The variability of the boreal winter AAO is positively related to the SMJ intensity in both spring and summer. The analyses show that the SST in southern high and middle latitudes seems to serve as a bridge linking these two systems. When the AAO is in strong positive phase, SST over the Southern Ocean cools in the high latitudes and warms in the middle latitudes, which persists into summer; however, the variability of SST in southern high and middle latitudes is also closely correlated to SMJ intensity. A possible mechanism that links SST variability with the AAO-SMJ relationship is also discussed. The AAO in boreal winter produces an SST anomaly pattern in southern high and middle latitudes through the air–sea coupling. This AAOrelated SST anomaly pattern modulates the local Ferrel cell anomaly in summer, followed by the regional Hadley cell anomaly in tropics. The anomalous vertical motion in tropics then changes the land–sea thermal contrast between the tropical Indian Ocean and the Asian continent through the variability of low cloud cover and downward surface longwave radiation flux. Finally, the land–sea thermal contrast anomaly between the tropical Indian Ocean and the Asian continent changes the SMJ intensity. The results from Community Atmosphere Model experiments forced by the SST anomaly in southern high and middle latitudes also confirm this diagnostic physical process to some extent." .

Exponents of craters of elevation attempted to apply it to explain the origin of all volcanoes, and rapidly the contemporary competing ‘craters of eruption’ theory replaced it as the paradigm for volcano construction. Several historic examples have shown that intrusions can cause uplift, termed bulges and can create features like those proposed for craters of elevation (e.g. at Usu 1944, Bezymianny 1955 and Mt. St. Helens 1980). Work on sedimentary basins that have had igneous activity has shown that intrusions create ‘forced folds’ that uplift and deform strata in a similar way to that originally proposed for craters of elevation. In view of the above, we investigate large-scale intrusion-related topographic changes at two sites where the craters of elevation theory was developed: the monogenetic volcanoes of the Chaîne des Puys, France and the Teide stratovolcano, Tenerife. We combine observations of such features with examples of forced folding to integrate the two fields of research. Our observations in the Chaîne des Puys show that: (1) the Petit Puy de Dôme has a bulge of up to 150-m uplift. The uplift has a central depressed area (a graben), a dense network of normal faults, basal thrusts and an aborted landslide. (2) The Grosmanaux volcano is a forced fold created by uplift of a previously flat-lying area, and has dense faulting and a graben on the resultant topographic bulge. It was the site also of a major vulcanian eruption from the associated Kilian crater. (3) The Gouttes volcano was uplifted by an intrusion like the Petit Puy de Dôme, but then collapsed to generate a landslide and lateral blast. (4) Excavation in the Lemptégy Volcano exposes intra-eruption intrusions with associated uplift, providing examples in cross-section of the internal deformation likely to be found inside other Chaîne des Puys uplifted bulges. On Teide, a bulge near the summit shows similar structures and surface tilting as seen on the Petit Puy de Dôme and this bulging may have formed during the eruption of the Lavas Negras, the most recent activity on the summit area. Fault scarps on Teide also expose small cryptodomes, like those seen at Lemptégy. These examples, coupled with field studies on eroded intrusions, data on forced folds in basins and analogue models, show how large-scale topographic remodelling and structural change can be created by intrusions. These can rapidly and significantly change the volcanic edifice. A crater of elevation bulge, or forced fold that is stabilised by the cooling of the intrusion, will remain an important structural element in a volcano. This process starts even at the small scale of monogenetic volcanoes, and could occur through the lifetime of any growing stratovolcano. Such activity may be commonplace, but may be masked by concomitant eruption or removed by subsequent collapse. Monitoring and hazard strategies should be ready to deal with such large-scale events that will seriously modify the eruptive activity and stability of a volcano within days or weeks." .

With respect to their degrees of metamorphism and their structural characteristics, the lithological units of the Delgo area are significantly different from the adjacent basement rocks in the east and west. The lithological contacts of the metavolcanic-metasedimentary rocks with the basement rocks are often marked by intermediate-dipping mylonites which are locally overprinted by ductile to brittle-ductile strike-slip faults. The Delgo suture evolved through the subduction-related closure of an oceanic basin and final collision of the island arc with the migmatitic basement blocks on either side of the oceanic basin. Peak metamorphism of deeply buried back-arc basin sequences occurred at around 700 Ma ago. During the collision stage, island arc rocks, passive margin sequences and ophiolitic rocks were thrust to the east and west over the basement blocks, causing limited crustal thickening and a minor isostatic rebound. Lithospheric extension associated with increasing heat flow caused migmatization in the basement between ca. 580 and 540 Ma ago. The development of numerous intermediate-dipping mylonitic shear zones at decreasing temperatures post-dates the migmatization. Lithospheric extension may explain the juxtaposition of rocks which were formed and/or metamorphosed at significantly different crustal levels." .

It is characterized by what has been traditionally labelled a ‘continuous’ shallow marine carbonate sedimentation, without terrigenous influences. However, global sea-level changes left unequivocal imprints in the ‘continuous’ carbonate record, thus proving that the carbonate platform sensitively responded to sea-level fluctuations. This paper focuses on the relatively short Cenomanian — Turonian drowning event, which temporarily submerged the platform below the euphotic zone, and which is related here to the well known global Cenomanian — Turonian sea-level highstand. This drowning episode is characterized by the abrupt disappearance of numerous shallow water benthic invertebrate taxa and by an abundant occurrence of planktonic organisms, including calcispheres and ‘primitive’ planktonic foraminifera. Near the middle of the Turonian, the platform regime was re-established, correlating with the global fall in sea level. The situation is different only at the south-west margin of the platform, where pelagic sedimentation, initiated near the end of the Cenomanian, continues into the Santonian and probably marks the Adriatic trough. The drowning began earlier (in the Middle Cenomanian) in those areas nearer to the north-east margin of the platform (the area of what is today central Croatia) and then progressed gradually towards the more interior areas of the platform (the middle Dalmatian islands), which were drowned near the end of the Cenomanian." .

The study area does not show any anomalies in the energy spectrum of fast neutrons, indicating that a thin (10–20 cm) subsurface layer in the equatorial region is characterized by quite a uniform distribution of hydrogen-containing phases. At the same time, the studied region is characterized by a distinct depression in the epithermal-neutron flux, which is outlined by a 0.150–0.170 counts/s contour line and does not show any seasonal changes in its shape, depth, and latitudinal position. This suggests that the depression is not associated with the short-term (seasonal) variations of the temperature regime and that it represents an aggregation of hydrogen-containing phases with longer lifetimes. The position of the epithermal-neutron-flux depression does not correlate with regional geology, and none of the geological units can be responsible for its appearance. To a rather greater degree, the flux of epithermal neutrons correlates with the amount of dust material on the surface. This indicates that the dust material presumably played a major role in the formation of the neutron-flux depression within the Medusae Fossae—Elysium region. The depression of the epithermal-neutron flux presumably has a polygenic nature. It can be related both to the primary accumulation of water-bearing material and to the later blowing of this material by wind and transportation of the dust fraction with its simultaneous enrichment in hydrogen-containing phases (most likely, in water-bearing minerals)." .

The HW events were classified into two groups by mean RH: dry HW and wet HW. In total, 211 wet HW events and 64 dry HW events were identified. Wet HW events were commonly located in the southeastern China in the monsoon area, while dry HW events occurred mostly in the northwestern China and North China. Wet HW events occurred from April to September and mostly in July and August, while dry HW events occurred from May to August and mostly in June. The average duration of wet HWs was longer than those of dry HWs, while the average intensity of the wet HWs was lower than those of dry HWs. The annual occurrences of wet HW events and dry HW events increased significantly during 1960–2013, with magnitudes of 0.54 and 0.34 times per decade, respectively. The comprehensive index (C i ) of wet HWs showed a significant positive trend, indicating an increasing severity of wet HWs. The strong wet HW events and dry HW events became more frequent and stronger significantly in the 54 years. The decadal changes in HWs are remarkable, with significant transition points for the frequencies of the wet HWs and dry HWs at 2002 and 1996, respectively. A remarkable increasing trend of frequencies of HWs occurred after the 1990s. Stations with significant positive trends for the annual number of days of the wet HWs were widespread over southern China. The wet HWs in 2003 and 2013 summer were among the top three events in China in the study period, and a large number of sites in East China were affected. The HW event in 2013 lasted shorter and affected less area than that in 2003 but was more intense with higher temperature anomaly during the duration. The more frequent and stronger HW events in the recent years may be partly due to global warming. However, different variations in the dry and wet HW events existed, and possible reasons might be the strong interdecadal and interannual variations in different regional atmospheric circulations." .

This framework is based on a novel and recently published Hamilton–Jacobi formulation by which a continuum of layer boundaries of a fold is modeled as a propagating front. All the fold classes from the classical literature (parallel folds, similar folds, and other fold types with convergent and divergent dip isogons) are modeled in two and three dimensions as continua defined on a finite difference grid. The propagating front describing the fold geometry is governed by a static Hamilton–Jacobi equation, which is discretized by upwind finite differences and a dynamic stencil construction. This forms the basis of numerical solution by finite difference solvers such as fast marching and fast sweeping methods. A new robust and accurate scheme for initialization of finite difference solvers for the static Hamilton–Jacobi equation is also derived. The framework has been integrated in simulation software, and a numerical example is presented based on seismic data collected from the Karama Block in the North Makassar Strait outside Sulawesi." .

The intra-seasonal to inter-annual fluctuations of atmospheric circulations has often been described as the alternation between a limited number of preferential weather regimes. Such discrete description can be justified by the multi-modality of the latitudinal position of the jet stream. In addition, seasonal extremes in European temperatures are generally associated with an exceptional persistence into one weather regime. Here we investigate the skill of the IPSL model to both simulate North-Atlantic weather regimes and European temperature extremes, including summer heat waves and winter cold spells. We use a set of eight IPSL experiments, with six different horizontal resolutions and the two versions used in CMIP3 and CMIP5. We find that despite a substantial deficit in the simulated poleward peak of the jet stream, the IPSL model represents weather regimes fairly well. A significant improvement is found for all horizontal resolutions higher than the one used in CMIP3, while the increase in vertical resolution included in the CMIP5 version tends to improve the wintertime dynamics. In addition to a recurrent cold bias over Europe, the IPSL model generally overestimates (underestimates) the indices of winter cold spells (summer heat waves) such as frequencies or durations. We find that the increase in horizontal resolution almost always improves these statistics, while the influence of vertical resolution is less clear. Overall, the CMIP5 version of the IPSL model appears to carry promising improvements in the simulation of the European climate variability." .

An empirical index, called genesis potential index (GPI), is used to quantify the relative importance of four environmental parameters responsible for the modulation of TCs characteristics. The analysis shows that TC frequency and RI of TC’s is higher in La Niña than El Niño regime during the primary TC season in the BoB. The combined effect of enhancement (reduction) in mid-tropospheric humidity (primary factor) and relative vorticity (secondary factor) played a major role in the enhancement (reduction) of the TC activity under La Niña (El Niño) regime. In addition, when the MJO is active over the BoB (phases 3–4; characterized by enhanced convective activity in the BoB) under La Niña regime, environmental conditions were more conducive for enhancement of TC activity and RI of TCs compared to corresponding MJO phase under El Niño regime. Increase in mid-tropospheric humidity and reduction in vertical wind shear were identified as the primary and secondary factors enhancing the likelihood of RI of TCs in the BoB during phases 3–4 of MJO under La Niña regime. Further, the role of accumulated tropical cyclone heat potential (ATCHP) on the RI of TC during primary TC season is also investigated. Our analysis demonstrates that ATCHP is large for TCs which undergo RI compared to TCs not undergoing RI." .

This holds true in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia where communities rely on highly climate-sensitive rainfed subsistence farming for livelihoods. This study investigates changes in ten extreme rainfall indices over a period of 40 years (1970–2009) using 14 meteorological stations located in the CRV. The CRV consists of three landscape units: the valley floor, the escarpments, and the highlands all of which are considered in our data analysis. The Belg (March–May) and Kiremt (June–September) seasons are also considered in the analysis. The Mann-Kendall test was used to detect trends of the rainfall indices. The results indicated that at the annual time scale, more than half (57 %) of the stations showed significant trends in total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT) and heavy precipitation days (R10mm). Only 7–35 % of stations showed significant trends, for the other rainfall indices. Spatially, the valley floor received increasing annual rainfall while the escarpments and the highlands received decreasing annual rainfall over the last 40 years. During Belg, 50 % of the stations showed significant increases in the maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) in all parts of the CRV. However, most other rainfall indices during Belg showed no significant changes. During Kiremt, considering both significant and non-significant trends, almost all rainfall indices showed an increasing trend in the valley floor and a decreasing trend in the escarpment and highlands. During Belg and Kiremt, the CDD generally showed increasing tendency in the CRV." .

SHRIMP U-Pb zircon analysis indicates that the granite porphyries were emplaced at 58.7±1.1 Ma (MSWD = 0.79) during the Indo-Asian continental collision. The granite porphyries are peraluminous and high in K, belonging to the calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline series. They are relatively enriched in LILE, Th and LREE and depletion in Ba, Nb, P and Ti, characterized by LREE-enriched patterns with slightly to moderately negative Eu anomalies. These Paleocene granite porphyries are interpreted as the products generated by partial melting of the pre-existing arc crustal rocks caused by the increase of pressures and temperatures during the crustal shortening at the early stages of the Indo-Asian continental collision since 65 Ma. Despite inherited geochemical features and tectonic settings of the arc protoliths, they are significantly different from the volcanic rocks of the Dianzhong Formation within the Linzizong Group and the Miocene granite porphyries in the Gangdise belt." .

The results provide three dominant modes with distinct convective features, which are referred to as: equatorially antisymmetric, intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and symmetric modes. The first two modes vary in an annual scale, and the latter one in a semiannual scale. The evolving aspects of these modes are studied by correlating (lagged and simultaneously) the principal component of each mode and the filtered OLR time series. The antisymmetric and the ITCZ modes evolve smoothly into each other reflecting the northwestward and northeastward propagation of convective activity. The propagation rates vary depending on development stage and region considered. On the other hand, the symmetric mode with the largest convective activity in the western Amazon evolves independently, and depicts the transition from dry to wet seasons and vice-versa." .

Most maps show the inundation boundaries as crisp lines on visually appealing maps, whereby many planners and decision makers, among others, automatically believe the boundaries are both accurate and reliable. However, as this study shows, probably all such maps, even those that are based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), have immanent uncertainties which can be directly related to both DEM resolution and the steepness of terrain slopes perpendicular to the river flow direction. Based on a number of degenerated DEMs, covering areas along the Eskilstuna River, Sweden, these uncertainties have been quantified into an empirically-derived disparity distance equation, yielding values of distance between true and modeled inundation boundary location. Using the inundation polygon, the DEM, a value representing the DEM resolution, and the desired level of confidence as inputs in a new-developed algorithm that utilizes the disparity distance equation, the slope and DEM dependent uncertainties can be directly visualized on a map. The implications of this strategy should benefit planning and help reduce high costs of floods where infrastructure, etc., have been placed in flood-prone areas without enough consideration of map uncertainties." .

The use of an air mass approach in dendroclimatology is somewhat unconventional and has not been fully explored. However, we believe that it may be useful because the air mass approach represents a holistic and comprehensive measure of surface conditions. Cores from 36 slash pines (Pinus elliotti) were extracted and ring widths were measured to the nearest 0.01 mm. The cores were then cross-dated and a standardized ring index series was established. Relationships were explored between the index series and several climate variables and teleconnections. The index series showed significant relationships with SSC air mass types and SSC air mass ratios, but insignificant results with teleconnections. Specifically the Dry Tropical air mass type was negatively correlated with tree growth while Moist Moderate was positively correlated. Concomitantly, Dry Tropical : Moist Moderate, Dry Tropical : Moist Tropical, and Dry Moderate : Moist Moderate air mass ratios also showed negative correlations. Positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) sea surface temperatures were also associated with significant moisture and air mass variability in the region, although the PDO did not have a significant relationship with tree growth. The significance between SSC air mass variability and tree growth in the humid subtropical climate of coastal Alabama has favorable implications for dendroclimatological research in drier environments where trees are more sensitive to climatic variables." .

Theoretical temperature models are computed taking into account different initial conditions, heat sources, differentiation and simulated convection. To account for the early formation of the lunar highlands, the time duration of magmatism and presentday temperatures estimated from lunar electrical conductivity profiles, it is necessary to restrict initial temperatures and abundances of radioactivie elements. Successful models require that the outer half of the Moon initially heated to melting temperatures, probably due to rapid accretion. Differentiation of radioactive heat sources toward the lunar surface occurred during the first 1.6 billion years. Temperatures in the outer 500 km are currently low, while the deep interior (radius less than 700 to 1000 km) is warmer than 1000°C, and is of primordial material.

Four reversed polarity patches, as one of the most important features of the CMB field, are revealed. Two patches with +Z polarity (downward) at the southern African and the southern American regions stand out against the background of ™Z polarity (upward) in the southern hemisphere, and two patches of ™Z polarity at the North Polar and the northern Pacific regions stand out against the +Z background in the northern hemisphere. During the 1900–2000 period the southern African (SAF) patch has quickly drifted westward at a speed of 0.20–.3° /a; meanwhile its area has expanded 5 times, and the magnetic flux crossing the area has intensified 30 times. On the other hand, other three patches show little if any change during this 100-year period. Extending upward, each of the reversed polarity patches at the CMB forms a chimney-shaped “reversed polarity column” in the mantle with the bottom at the CMB. The height of the SAF column has grown rapidly from 200km in 1900 to 900km in 2000. If the column grows steadily at the same rate in the future, its top will reach to the ground surface in 600–700 years. And then a reversed polarity patch will be observed at the Earth’s surface, which will be an indicator of the beginning of a magnetic field reversal. On the basis of this study, one can describe the process of a geomagnetic polarity reversal, the polarity reversal may be observed firstly in one or several local regions; then the areas of these regions expand, and at the same time, other new reversed polarity regions may appear. Thus several poles may exist during a polarity reversal." .

It is found that positive (negative) latent heat flux anomalies over the western North Pacific are associated with warm (cold) state of the warm pool. The analysis suggests that the change in sea-air humidity difference has a direct contribution to surface latent heat flux anomalies over the western Pacific in warm state years of the warm pool. However, the change in surface wind speed is the main cause of surface latent heat flux anomalies over central tropical Pacific. In cold state years, change in the sea-air humidity difference has a direct contribution to surface latent heat flux anomalies over the western Pacific and central and eastern tropical Pacific, and the change in surface wind speed appears not to be a cause of identified surface latent heat flux anomalies. Moreover, the results show that the sea-air humidity difference contributes to tropical cyclone genesis in warm state years, but in cold state years, tropical cyclone genesis occurs mainly in regions of sea-air humidity difference decrease and surface wind speed increase." .

Past studies have documented various large-scale circulation aspects associated with monsoon-breaks, however the dynamical mechanisms responsible for anomalous precipitation enhancement over CEH foothills remain unclear. This problem is investigated using diagnostic analyses of observed and reanalysis products and high-resolution model simulations. The present findings show that the anomalous precipitation enhancement over the CEH foothills during monsoon-breaks emerges as a consequence of interactions between southward intruding mid-latitude westerly troughs and the South Asian monsoon circulation in its weak phase. These interactions facilitate intensification of mid-tropospheric cyclonic vorticity and strong ascending motion over the CEH foothills, so as to promote deep convection and concentrated rainfall activity over the region during monsoon-breaks. Mesoscale orographic effects additionally tend to amplify the vertical motions and precipitation over the CEH foothills as evidenced from the high-resolution model simulations. It is further noted from the model simulations that the coupling between precipitation and circulation during monsoon-breaks can produce nearly a threefold increase of total precipitation over the CEH foothills and neighborhood as opposed to active-monsoon conditions." .

Field measurements indicated that xylem sap in L. tridentata froze at temperatures below c. –5°C, and that this caused no measurable cavitation for minimum temperatures above –7°C. During the same period P. velutina cavitated almost completely. In the laboratory, we cooled stems of L. tridentata to temperatures ranging from –5 to –20°C, held them at temperature for 1 or 12 h, thawed the stems at a constant rate and measured cavitation by the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of stem segments. As observed in the field, freezing exotherms occurred at temperatures between –6.5 and –9°C and as long as temperatures were held above –11°C there was no change in hydraulic conductivity after thawing. However, when stems were cooled to between –11°C and –20°C, stem hydraulic conductivity decreased linearly with minimum temperature. Minimum temperatures between –16 and –20°C were sufficient to completely eliminate hydraulic conductance. Record (>20 year) minimum isotherms in this same range of temperatures corresponded closely with the northern limit of L. tridentata in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts." .

Solid phase of the porous medium is assumed to be linearly elastic, isotropic and the fractures are assumed to be distributed isotropically throughout the medium. It has been shown that there can exist four compressional waves and one rotational wave. The phase speeds of these waves are found to be affected by the presence of fractures, in general. Of the four compressional waves, one arises due to the presence of fractures in the medium and the remaining three are those encountered by Tuncay and Corapcioglu (J Appl Mech 64:313–319, 1997). Reflection and transmission phenomena at a plane interface between a uniform elastic half-space and a fractured porous half-space containing two immiscible fluids, are analyzed due to incidence of plane longitudinal/transverse wave from uniform elastic half-space. Variation of modulus of amplitude and energy ratios with the angle of incidence are computed numerically by taking the elastic half-space as granite and the fractured porous half-space as sandstone material containing non-viscous wetting and non-wetting fluid phases. The results obtained in case of porous half-space with fractures, are compared graphically with those in case of porous half-space without fractures. It is found that the presence of fractures in the porous half-space do affect the reflection/transmission of waves, which is responsible for raising the reflection and lowering the transmission coefficients." .

The leucocratic Tieftal gneisses are granitic, have a near eutectic melt composition and share some features of A-type granites, such as high Na2O+K2O(8.07 to 8.58wt%), Zr (379 to 554ppm) and Y (58 to 79ppm) contents. The REE-patterns are rather flat ((La/Yb)N=2.4 to 3.7), with distinct negative Eu anomalies. Single zircon evaporation dating of two samples and Sm-Nd dating of relict magmatic titanite resulted in ages of 487±7, 484±3 and 487±5Ma, respectively. The weighted mean of 485±3Ma is interpreted as the primary crystallization age of the Tieftal orthogneiss body. Rb-Sr whole rock dating results in a well defined regression line, corresponding to an age of 411±9Ma. This age clearly documents at least a partial resetting of the whole rock Rb-Sr system, which is most probably due to subsequent metamorphic overprint. The leucocratic Tieftal gneisses are isotopically rather primitive with an εNdCHUR485 Ma value of +1.7 and a calculated magmatic initial87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7047. These data suggest a major mantle contribution. Most probably, they originated through fractionation of the magmatic precursors of the accompanying tholeiitic metabasites. The more primitive isotopic composition of ÖCB metabasites and some late Archean/early Proterozoic and Cambrian inheritance in Tieftal gneiss zircons suggest some involvement of old crustal rocks, too. The amount of crustal contamination can be calculated to be in the range of 10 to 40%. The Tieftal gneisses and the accompanying metabasites are interpreted as remnants of igneous rocks related to an early Ordovician rifting and incipient formation of new oceanic crust, an event which can be traced throughout the central and western European Variscan and Alpine terranes." .

At Mount Etna, volcano aa morphologies are very common, whereas pahoehoe lavas are rare. The latter are locally named “cicirara” due to the presence of centimeter-sized plagioclase phenocrysts much more abundant than in aa lavas. The phenocryst content of “cicirara” lavas contrasts with the low viscosity generally associated with pahoehoe morphology. Therefore, to reconcile the discrepancy between textural and volcanic observations, we have studied the most primitive pahoehoe “cicirara” lava sampled until now. Two samples at 0.5 and 1 m from the bottom of the 2-m thick lava flow were investigated on the basis of their mineral compositional variations and textural features, i.e., size frequency and crystal size distribution (CSD). Results coupled with rheological models indicate that only large phenocrysts of plagioclase (>1 mm) and clinopyroxene have grown before eruption. Thermobarometric models and petrological computations based on the composition of plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocryst cores highlight that only a small amount (10–15 vol.%) of crystals equilibrated at 12 km of depth. Cumulative size frequency and CSD data also indicate that plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocryst rims grew heterogeneously and coalesced around their cores at depths <1 km, before eruption. In this view, the “cicirara” lava was erupted with a low crystalline content that favoured the formation of its pahoehoe surface; however, crystals with a size <1 mm (~75 vol.%) solidified at post-eruptive conditions. Our findings underline that the emplacement of high-viscosity aa or low-viscosity pahoehoe lavas is driven by the degree of undercooling imposed by the volatile exsolution rate in the shallowest portion of the Etnean plumbing system. A slow magma ascent rate promotes significant intratelluric degassing and widespread nucleation; consequently, the viscosity of the suspension significantly increases leading to an aa morphology. In contrast, pahoehoe “cicirara” lavas are associated with a rapid rise to the surface of poorly degassed, undercooled magmas." .

Clay minerals in the sapropels studied here are only slightly affected, or are not affected at all by diagenetic alteration. This permits the observation of primary differences.

The tridymite-hercynite rock consists of hercynite (40–50%), tridymite (35–45%), ilmenite (≈2%), and glass (10–20%). Mineral grains are smaller than 0.05 mm with a granular texture. Compared to “normal” igneous rocks, this tridymite-hercynite rock has higher FeO, Al2O3, and lower SiO2 CaO, MgO, and alkalis (Na2O + K2O). The origin of this type of xenolith is problematical. Based upon the available mineralogical and chemical data, three possible origins have been evaluated:(1)The product of an extreme tholeiitic fractionation under low oxidation conditions; but the major element geochemistry appears to negate this model.(2)The Fe-rich (Si-poor portion of silicate-immiscible liquids from an extremely fractionated residual tholeiite magma; however, the corresponding Si-rich end-member fraction is missing, and the composition of the tridymite-hercynite rock is different from that of any Si-poor melt phase of known immiscible silicate liquids.(3)The product of metamorphism, including partial to complete melting, of a sedimentary protolith. An Fe-Al-rich shale (quartz 5%, kaolinite 75%, hematite 20%) has the approximate composition of the tridymitehercynite rock. The trace-element abundances of the xenoliths suggest that the source rock for the Fe-Al-rich sedimentary protolith was an undifferentiated volcanic rock at the active continental margin." .

In this context, waste motor oil served as a source of petroleum hydrocarbons. Strain TISTR 8296 grew actively with waste motor oil at 0.5–2.0% (v/v) concentrations and also exhibited good biodegradation potential at this concentration range. Meanwhile, its growth and biodegradation capacity fell down with increasing oil concentration to 3.0 and 4.0%. Strain TISTR 8296 adapted quickly to pH changes, showing good growth ability and biodegradation capability at a pH range of 4.0–9.0 with an acidic pH of 4.0 and 5.0 appearing to decelerate its biodegradation efficiency. The addition of PO4 3− and NO3 − exerted a strong stimulatory effect on growth and biodegradation efficiency, while a slight promoting effect was observed for NO2 −. By contrast, amendment of NH4 + as well as heavy metals caused a substantial inhibitory effect on growth and biodegradation efficiency with NH4 + and Mn(II) appearing to show a weak suppressing effect. GC-MS analyses indicated that strain TISTR 8296 could transform and degrade both aliphatic and aromatic compounds." .

The pollen allergens from this tree are an important cause of allergic problems. Olea pollen may be relevant in relation to climate change, due to the fact that its flowering phenology is related to meteorological parameters. This study aims to investigate airborne Olea pollen data from a city on the SW Iberian Peninsula, to analyse the trends in these data and their relationships with meteorological parameters using time series analysis. Aerobiological sampling was conducted from 1994 to 2013 in Badajoz (SW Spain) using a 7-day Hirst-type volumetric sampler. The main Olea pollen season lasted an average of 34 days, from May 4th to June 7th. The model proposed to forecast airborne pollen concentrations, described by one equation. This expression is composed of two terms: the first term represents the resilience of the pollen concentration trend in the air according to the average concentration of the previous 10 days; the second term was obtained from considering the actual pollen concentration value, which is calculated based on the most representative meteorological variables multiplied by a fitting coefficient. Due to the allergenic characteristics of this pollen type, it should be necessary to forecast its short-term prevalence using a long record of data in a city with a Mediterranean climate. The model obtained provides a suitable level of confidence to forecast Olea airborne pollen concentration." .

With some exceptions, these abundances are similar to those reported for the spinifex-textured komatiite from the Barberton greenstone belt in South Africa. The values for some alteration-resistant element ratios — Ti/Zr, Ti/Y, Ti/Sc, Ti/V, Zr/Y, Zr/Sc, Sc/Y, V/Zr, and V/Sc — for chondrite and for spinifex-textured komatiites from Ghatti Hosahalli (India), Barberton (South Africa), Munro (Canada), and Yilgarn (Australia) reveal that, except for the Ti/Zr ratio for the Ghatti Hosahalli komatiite, the other ratios from the four terrains define a unique trend that is almost superimposed on the trend defined by these ratios for chondrite. This suggests that the processes of formation of komatiitic lavas from the four far-separated terrains were similar, and that, the source regions from which these lavas formed had a chondritic composition." .

A new study of the dominant mafic silicate minerals, in comparison with mafic silicates from more evolved granite phases, hybridized granite and mafic magmatic enclaves provide insights into the overall petrogenesis of the Wiborg batholith. All of the mafic silicate minerals are iron-rich, reflective of the whole rock compositions. Biotite is annitic, calcic amphibole is ferro-edenite to hastingsite, and subsolidus Fe-Mg amphibole is found as accessory grunerite. Temperatures derived from amphibole-plagioclase thermometry suggest crystallization at about ∼ 740 °C. Pressure estimates derived from Al in amphibole barometry range between 2.5 and 5.4 kilobars. This is noticeably higher than the previous estimates of 1 kbar for the Wiborg batholith. Oxygen fugacity estimates from biotite suggest low fO2 initial values and increase from FMQ to above NNO for late stage granite phases." .

The numerical computations have been focused on a conceptual model of Vulcano Island, where geophysical, geochemical, and seismic signals have experienced several episodes of remarkable changes likely linked to the hydrothermal activity. We design a range of numerical models of hydrothermal unrest and computed the associated deformation and stress field arising from rock-fluid interaction processes related to the thermo-poroelastic response of the medium. The effects of model parameters on deformation and flank stability are explored considering different multilayered crustal structures constrained by seismic tomography and stratigraphy investigations. Our findings highlight the significant role of model parameters on the response of the hydrothermal system and, consequently, on the amplitudes and the timescale of stress and strain fields. Even if no claim is made that the model strictly applies to the crisis episodes at Vulcano, the numerical results are in general agreement with the pattern of monitoring observations, characterized by an enhancing of gas emission and seismic activity without significant ground deformation. The conceptual model points to a pressurization and heating of the shallow hydrothermal system (1–0.25 km bsl) fed by fluid of magmatic origin. However, for the assumed values of model material and source parameters (rate of injection, fluid composition, and temperature), the pressure and temperature changes do not affect significantly the flank stability, which is mainly controlled by the gravitational force." .

It is strong enough to compensate for current speed, extending vertically up to the sea surface. The gas seepage often appears to be explosive to form craters and diapirs, although pockmarks are rare due to the redistribution of mobile palimpsest sands. In core-top seawater and sediments, the gases are characterized by high amounts of C2, homogenous δ13C1 values and a large difference (19.7‰ on average) between δ13C1 (−55.2 to −53.6‰ PDB) and δ13C2 (−36.8 to −32.5‰ PDB) values. The gases are considered to be generated with a smaller amount of C1 at the early thermal cracking stage of labile source materials, after which the C2 gas is enriched in 13C by diffusion or biological alternation at the generation or accumulation site. The homogenous δ13C1 values may be one of the geochemical characteristics of gases acquired at depth which are less altered in the case of rapid diffusive gas migration to the seafloor." .

This paper analyses the ability of 46 coupled climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 3 and 5 (CMIP5 and CMIP3). The performance of each climate model was assessed based on its skills in simulating the current seasonal cycles (monthly) of both maximum temperature and minimum temperature (Tmax, Tmin) over India. The performance measures such as coefficient of correlation (Skill_r), root mean square error (Skill_rmse), and the skill in simulating the observed probability density function (Skill_s) are mainly employed for evaluation of the simulated monthly seasonal cycle. A new metric called Skill_All which is an intersection of the above three metrics has been defined for the first time. A notable enhancement of Skill_All for CMIP5 vis-a-vis CMIP3 is observed. Further, three best CMIP5 models each for Tmax and Tmin were selected. The methodology employed in this study for model assessment is implemented for the first time for India, which establishes a robust foundation for the climate impact assessment study. The seasonal trends in Tmax and Tmin were analyzed over all the temperature homogenous regions of India for different time slots during the 20th century. Significant trends in Tmin can be seen during most of the seasons over the entire Indian region during last four decades. This establishes the signature of climate change over most parts of India." .

Two types of paragneisses have been distinguished: cordierite gneisses, which are characteristic of the Monotonous Group, and a cordierite-free variety. A typical feature of the cordierite gneisses is the occurrence of stromatic or nebulitic cordierite migmatites. Three stages of metamorphism have been identified in the paragneisses:1)The early stage is preserved as kyanite relics in cordierite gneisses and kyanitestaurolite relics in garnet-bearing paragneisses. A maximum temperature of 600°C is estimated for this stage.2)The P-T conditions of the metamorphic peak (T-peak) were determined in cordierite gneisses, cordierite migmatites and a garnet-bearing paragneiss at 720±30°C and Pmin=4.4±0.4kbar. Phase relations in the migmatites and compositional zoning of cordierite are consistent with high-temperature decompression. Dehydration melting (Thompson, 1982) took place during this stage and initiated the migmatization of the cordierite gneisses. Deformation of the cordierite migmatites near the tectonic boundary with the overlying Varied Group (“Granulitlamelle”,Fuchs andScharbert, 1979) shows that migmatization is pre- to syntectonic with respect to the emplacement of the Drosendorf Unit (Varied Group).3)Porphyroblasts of post-tectonic white mica crystallized mainly in the cordierite migmatites during the retrograde stage at pressures and temperatures of 3–5kbar and 650–700°C. There is no indication of a genetic relationship between the intrusion of the South Bohemian Pluton and the migmatization in the adjacent cordierite gneisses." .

Similar alkaline basalts are only rarely known in other volcanic fields of the world. These special basaltic magmas fed the eruptions of two closely located volcanic centres: the Bondoró-hegy and the Füzes-tó scoria cone. Their uncommon enrichment in diverse crystals produced unique rock textures and modified original magma compositions (13.1–14.2 wt.% MgO, 459–657 ppm Cr, and 455–564 ppm Ni contents). Detailed mineral-scale textural and chemical analyses revealed that the Bondoró-hegy and Füzes-tó alkaline basaltic magmas have a complex ascent history, and that most of their minerals (∼30 vol.% of the rocks) represent foreign crystals derived from different levels of the underlying lithosphere. The most abundant xenocrysts, olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and spinel, were incorporated from different regions and rock types of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Megacrysts of clinopyroxene and spinel could have originated from pegmatitic veins/sills which probably represent magmas crystallized near the crust–mantle boundary. Green clinopyroxene xenocrysts could have been derived from lower crustal mafic granulites. Minerals that crystallized in situ from the alkaline basaltic melts (olivine with Cr-spinel inclusions, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, and Fe–Ti oxides) are only represented by microphenocrysts and overgrowths on the foreign crystals. The vast amount of peridotitic (most common) and mafic granulitic materials indicates a highly effective interaction between the ascending magmas and wall rocks at lithospheric mantle and lower crustal levels. However, fragments from the middle and upper crust are absent from the studied basalts, suggesting a change in the style (and possibly rate) of magma ascent in the crust. These xenocryst- and xenolith-rich basalts yield divers tools for estimating magma ascent rate that is important for hazard forecasting in monogenetic volcanic fields. According to the estimated ascent rates, the Bondoró-hegy and Füzes-tó alkaline basaltic magmas could have reached the surface within hours to few days, similarly to the estimates for other eruptive centres in the Pannonian Basin which were fed by “normal” (crystal and xenoliths poor) alkaline basalts." .

We attempted to employ the improved elasticity method to evaluate the effects of climate factors (CF, especially temperature) on runoff change for Aksu River in the arid region of northwest China. Data from Aksu River in the arid region of northwest China were analyzed to investigate changes in annual runoff and CF during the period of 1960–2010. The key findings of this study indicated that the annual runoff had a significant (P < 0.01) increasing trend with a rate of 3.78 × 108 m3/decade, and the temperature and precipitation also exhibited significant rising trends, at a rate of 0.28 °C/decade (P < 0.01) and 15.11 mm/decade (P < 0.05), respectively, while PET showed a decreasing trend (22.66 mm/decade, P < 0.01). Step change point in runoff occurred in the year 1993. Thus, we employed the mean runoff and climate factors during the period 1960–1993 as the benchmark value to measure the change. In 1994–2010, mean runoff increased by 22 %. Results also revealed that temperature rising was the most important factor that increased runoff with contribution of 45 %, while precipitation and PET were responsible for 22 and 27 % of the runoff change, respectively, indicating that the runoff of increasing percentage only accounted for 6 % owing to human activities and other factors, and showed that climate variability was the main reason for the runoff change in Aksu River." .

Reefs lacking islands and short-lived (<20 years) transient islands are not included. The principal aim of the classification is to assess the spatial diversity of the geologic and geomorphic attributes of Pacific islands. It is intended to be valid at a regional scale and based on two attributes: five types of lithology (volcanic, limestone, composite, continental, surficial) and a distinction between high and low islands. These attributes yielded eight island types: volcanic high and low islands; limestone high and low islands; composite high and low islands; reef (including all unconsolidated) islands; and continental islands. Most common are reef islands (36 %) and volcanic high islands (31 %), whereas the least common are composite low islands (1 %). Continental islands, 18 of the 1779 islands examined, are not included in maps showing the distribution of island attributes and types. Rationale for the spatial distributions of the various island attributes is drawn from the available literature and canvassed in the text. With exception of the few continental islands, the distribution of island types is broadly interpretable from the proximity of island-forming processes. It is anticipated the classification will become the basis for more focused investigation of spatial variability of the climate and ocean setting as well as the biological attributes of Pacific islands. It may also be used in spatial assessments of second-order phenomena associated with the islands, such as their vulnerability to various disasters, coastal erosion, or ocean pollution as well as human populations, built infrastructure and natural resources." .

This complex records a 90–130-Ma-long evolution of magmatic inputs and differentiation above a subducting oceanic slab. Early c. 793 Ma-old metagabbros crystallised at lower crustal or uppermost mantle depths (25–30 km) and have geochemical characteristic of high-alumina basalts extracted from a depleted mantle source slightly enriched by slab-derived sedimentary components ((La/Sm)N < 1; εNd: +5.4–6.2; 87Sr/86Sr: 0.7027–0.7029). In response to crustal thickening, these mafic rocks were recrystallised into garnet-granulites (850–1,000°C; 10–12 kbar) and subject to local dehydration–melting reactions, forming trondhjemititic leucosomes with garnet–clinopyroxene–rutile residues. Slightly after the granulitic event, the arc root was subject to strong HT shearing during partial exhumation (detachment faults/rifting or thrusting), coeval with the emplacement of spinel- and garnet-pyroxenite dykes crystallised from a high-Mg andesitic parental magma. Quartz and hornblende-gabbros (700–660 Ma) with composition typical of hydrous volcanic rocks from mature arcs ((La/Sm)N: 0.9–1.8; εNd: +4.6 to +5.2; 87Sr/86Sr: 0.7028–0.7031) were subsequently emplaced at mid-arc crust levels (~15 km). Trace element and isotopic data indicate that magmas tapped a depleted mantle source significantly more enriched in oceanic sedimentary components (0.2%). Exhumation occurred either in two stages (700–660 and 623 Ma) or in one stage (623 Ma) with a final exhumation of the arc root along cold P-T path (550°C, 6–9 kbar; epidote–amphibolite and greenschist facies conditions) during the main Pan-African collision event (620–580 Ma). The composition of magmas forming the Cryogenian Amalaoulaou arc and the processes leading to intra-arc differentiation are strikingly comparable to those observed in the deep section of exposed Mezosoic oceanic arcs, namely the Kohistan and Talkeetna complex. This evolution of the Amalaoulaou oceanic arc and its accretion towards the West African craton belong to the life and closure of the Pharusian Ocean that eventually led to the formation of the Greater Gondwana supercontinent, a similar story having occurred on the other side of the Sahara with the Mozambique Ocean." .

The results indicated that the phenocrystic association crystallized at moderate temperatures (ca. 750° C), under high oxygen fugacities (> NNO) and total pressures (2.3–4.5 Kb, with a maximal density of points at about 3.5 Kb), and water pressures approximating total pressures. The groundmass Fe-Ti oxides equilibrated at lower temperatures and under relatively increasing oxygen fugacities, the variation of which is tentatively ascribed to the aerial emplacement of the nuée ardente materials. The phenocryst data imply that in the case studied the high fluid pressures characterizing the nuée ardente eruptions were not acquired at a shallow level because of the deep intratelluric stage of crystallization of these differentiated calcalkalic magmas." .

The regional climate model REMO simulated the climate change of the Barents Sea Region between 1961 and 2100 (Control and Climate Change run, CCC-Run). REMO on ~50 km horizontal resolution was driven by the transient ECHAM4/OPYC3 IPCC SRES B2 scenario. The output of the CCC-Run was applied to drive the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. The results of the vegetation model were used to repeat the CCC-Run with dynamic vegetation fields. The feedback effect of the modified vegetation on the climate change signal is investigated and discussed with focus on precipitation, temperature and snow cover. The effect of the offline coupled vegetation feedback run is much lower than the greenhouse gas effect." .

Only two of these (Siphonodendron and Lithostrotion) are reported to include more than one species. Most taxa show distinctive facies dependencies. Small solitary corals are found in shaly environments of the Oued Es-Sassi Formation. On the northern flank a coral patch reef formed on an oolitic shoal in the Koudiat Es-Senn Formation. Its core mainly consists of Lithostrotion vorticale colonies, whereas in its surroundings literally hundreds of specimens of Siphonophyllia samsonensis occur. Associated with these dominant taxa occur colonial and further large solitary taxa (Palaeosmilia, Dibunophyllum). Tizraia and Pareynia are restricted to microbial-dominated buildup facies. Their presence might be strongly controlled by the development of this buildup type, because further occurrences in Algeria, Morocco, and Belgium are all in the same facies. The coral fauna at Jerada is a typical Late Viséan assemblage for the Western European Province. The Eastern Moroccan Meseta may be an important pathway within the province for the connection between the Central Saharan basins and NW Europe. The biostratigraphic ages of the coral fauna partly contradict ages based on carbonate microfossils; the coral ages are slightly older and typical Brigantian coral taxa are absent." .

The xenoliths are mainly anhydrous spinel lherzolites and harzburgites and gradations between, with minor pyroxenites. Most types show protogranular textures, but transitional protogranular–porphyroclastic and equigranular lherzolites also exist. Different thermometers used in the estimates provide higher subsolidus equilibrium temperatures for harzburgites (1,062 ± 29°C) than for lherzolites (972 ± 89°C), although there is overlap; the lowest temperatures correspond to porphyroclastic lherzolites, whereas pyroxenites give the highest temperatures (up to 1,257°C). Maximum pressures for subsolidus equilibrium of peridotites are at 2.0–1.8 GPa. Later they followed adiabatic decompression and harzburgites registered lower pressures (1.02 ± 0.19 GPa) than lherzolites (1.41 ± 0.27 GPa). One pyroxenite gives values consistent with the spinel lherzolite field (1.08 GPa). The shallowest barometric data are in agreement with the highest local conductive geotherms, which implies that the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary is at 70–60 km minimum depth. Higher equilibrium temperatures for the harzburgites could be explained by the existence of mafic magma bodies or dykes at the lower crust–mantle boundary. Paleo-fO2 conditions during partial melting as inferred from the covariation between V and MgO concentrations are mainly between QFM−1 and QFM−2 in log units. However, most thermobarometric fO2 estimates are between QFM−1 and QFM+1, suggesting oxidation caused by later metasomatism during uplift and cooling." .

How runoff responds to the changing summer monsoon intensity is important both in theory and in water resources management. The earliest hydrological observations on the Yellow River started in 1919, and thus, runoff data are available only for the past 90 years. Using data of the summer monsoon intensity (SMI), the temporal variation of SMI since 1873 and the resultant variation in runoff are dealt with for the drainage area between Hekouzhen and Longmen, Yellow River basin. At the 128-year scale, the variation of SMI can be generalized as a trend of decreasing first, then increasing and then decreasing again. At the time scale of 50 years for which concurrent data are available, the temporal variations in both SMI and precipitation show some decreasing trend. At the time scale of 80 years for which concurrent data were available, the temporal variations in SMI and natural runoff also show a decreasing trend. For 5-year moving averages of these variables, the synchronous trend of variation is more obvious. This fact indicates that the variation in SMI results in the variations in precipitation and runoff in the study area. Based on data of SMI and natural runoff for the period from 1920 to 2000, a regression equation between the 5-year moving averages of SMI (SMI5m) and natural runoff (Q wn,5m) was established, which shows that 72% of the variation in Q wn,5m can be explained by the variation in SMI5m. Using this regression equation, Q wn,5m for the period from 1873 to 1919 was reconstructed. At the 128-year scale, the natural runoff from the study area shows a trend of decreasing first, then increasing and then decreasing again, in response to the similar variation in the summer monsoon intensity." .

Picophytoplankton (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes), bacterioplankton (inclusive of bacteria and Archaea), virioplankton and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were measured at five stations following the consistent wave-driven unidirectional mean flow path of seawater across the reef and into the lagoon. Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes and bacterioplankton were depleted to similar levels (~40% on average) over the fore reef, reef crest and reef flat (=‘active reef’), with negligible uptake occurring over the sandy bottom lagoon. Depletion of virioplankton also occurred but to more variable levels. Highest uptake rates, m, of picoplankton occurred over the reef crest, while uptake coefficients, S (independent of cell concentration), were similarly scaled over the reef zones, indicating no preferential uptake of any one group. Collectively, picophytoplankton, bacterioplankton and virioplankton accounted for the uptake of 29 mmol C m−2 day−1, with Synechococcus contributing the highest proportion of the removed C. Picoplankton and virioplankton accounted for 1–5 mmol N m−2 day−1 of the removed N, with bacterioplankton estimated to be a highly rich source of N. Results indicate the importance of ocean–reef interactions and the dependence of certain reef organisms on picoplanktonic supply for reef-level biogeochemistry processes." .

On the basis of petrographical and mineralogical studies, the granitoids were subdivided into three suites: Dinhquan, Deoca and Cana. Rocks of the Dinhquan suite are hornblende–biotite diorites, granodiorites and minor granites. The Cana suite encompasses mainly leucocratic biotite-bearing granites with scarce hornblende. The Deoca suite is made up of granodiorites, monzogranites and granites. Geochemically, the granitoids are of subalkaline affinity, belong to the high-K, calc-alkaline series, and most of them display typical features of I-type granites. This paper presents the new Rb–Sr mineral and U–Pb zircon and titanite age data for the granitoids, which establish the ages of the plutonic suites as: the Dinhquan at ~112–100 Ma, Cana at ~96–93 Ma and Deoca at ~92–88 Ma. These ages are significantly different from earlier publications, and indicate that the earliest magmatism in the Dalat zone began at ~112 Ma ago, that is ~30–50 Ma later than previously thought. Our geochronological data are also support the continuation of an Andean-type arc running from SE China via southern Vietnam to SW Borneo." .

Although the twigs had been washed with toluene and tetrahydrofuran prior to analysis, it was found that the amounts of eight elements (Al, Cr, Eu, Fe, La, Sc, Th and V) present were predominantly due to aerosol particles still being retained on the surface of the axes. The results of the remaining 15 elements (Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, Co, Cs, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Rb, Sr and Zn) were not or only slightly influenced by this effect and are considered to represent their inherent concentrations within the axes. With most of these latter 15 elements there are highly significant and linear correlations between the concentrations in the needles and in the axis, which testify to the great similarity of needles and axis of a twig. The axis/needles ratios are constant for every element (except K), but the individual elements show considerable differentiation, as evidenced by their ratios, which have values between 0.5 and 2.8. Inter-element correlations in the axes are mainly found within two groups of elements. With Na, Cl and Br these correlations are probably due to different pollution levels of the different sites, whereas with Mn, Co, Rb and Cs they are due to the pH of the soil. The activity of 137Cs from the Chernobyl fallout represents independent confirmation of the results obtained with the stable elements. With twigs sprouted before the deposition of the fallout, 137Cs acts as a tracer for aerosol particles, whereas it forms a tracer for the stable Cs inherent to the plant with twigs sprouted after the deposition." .

It is recognised as a process that can strongly influence local fault kinematics and strain patterns. The case study presented herein is dedicated to the tectonic analysis of the Freiburg–Bonndorf–Bodensee Fault Zone (FBBFZ) located at the external margin of the northern Alpine Molasse Basin and extending into the crystalline Black Forest Massif. The structure and kinematics of this crustal-scale fault zone are investigated by means of a regional analysis of locally mapped faults, kinematic analysis of outcrop-scale fractures and slip vector modelling. The exceptional possibility of analysing the fault zone exposed from basement to cover allowed for an evaluation of interaction between precursory structures and subsequent deformation features. The results of this study show that the crystalline basement structures exposed along the FBBFZ had a strong imprint on the map-scale fault pattern observable in the Mesozoic and Tertiary sequences. Kinematic analysis of outcrop-scale fracture systems in the latter units yields evidence for local multi-directional extension and strike-slip faulting during Miocene to recent times. While these observations may evoke the interpretation of a multistage palaeostress history along the FBBFZ, slip vector modelling of a very well exposed FBBFZ segment suggests that the various strain records can alternatively be explained by one single regional stress tensor and be related to superordinate deep-seated strike-slip deformation." .

The scheme predicts the mixing ratio of water vapor as well as the mixing ratios and number concentrations of cloud droplets, rain, ice, snow, and graupel. A new parameterization approach to simulate heterogeneous droplet activation was developed in this scheme. Furthermore, the improved CAMS scheme was coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF v3.1), which made it possible to simulate the microphysics of clouds and precipitation as well as the cloud-aerosol interactions in selected atmospheric condition. The rain event occurring on 27–28 December 2008 in eastern China was simulated using the CAMS scheme and three sophisticated microphysics schemes in the WRF model. Results showed that the simulated 36-h accumulated precipitations were generally agreed with observation data, and the CAMS scheme performed well in the southern area of the nested domain. The radar reflectivity, the averaged precipitation intensity, and the hydrometeor mixing ratios simulated by the CAMS scheme were generally consistent with those from other microphysics schemes. The hydrometeor number concentrations simulated by the CAMS scheme were also close to the experiential values in stratus clouds. The model results suggest that the CAMS scheme performs reasonably well in describing the microphysics of clouds and precipitation in the mesoscale WRF model." .

According to their geochemical signatures, P-rich (S-type) and P-poor (A-type) granites could be distinguished here. Both granite suites display high Ga/Al ratios (>2.6) and according to FeOtot./(FeOtot. + MgO) ratio can be classified as ferrous granites. Consequently, the both ratios cannot be used for discrimination S- and A-type granites. Both minerals are characterized by a variety of complex zircon-xenotime textures. They are usually strong hydrated and enriched in F. Zircon from P-rich granites displays a significant enrichment in P (up 0.24 apfu P), whereas zircon from P-poor granites has lower P and higher Y (up to 0.15 apfu Y). The xenotime-type substitution is the most important mechanism of isomorphic substitution in zircon in both granite suites. Zircon from both granite suites is typically enriched in Hf, especially unaltered zircon from P-rich granites (up to 8.2 wt. % HfO2). However in altered zircons the Hf/Zr ratio is higher in the P-poor granites. The Hf-rich zircon from unaltered P-rich granite crystallised from low temperature granite melt, whereas altered zircons crystallised during post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration (greisenization). Xenotime from P-poor granites displays a considerable enrichment in HREE (up to 40 mol. % HREEPO4) compared to xenotime from P-rich granites (up to 20 mol. % HREEPO4). Xenotime compositions from P-rich granites are influenced by brabantite-type substitution, whereas for xenotime from P-poor granites the huttonite-type substitution is dominant. Unusual enrichments in HREE is significant for xenotime from P-poor granites, especially in Yb (up to 0.17 apfu Yb) and Dy (up to 0.11 apfu)." .

The samples include infracrustal rocks from the metamorphic basement, metaigneous rocks and metasediments from the Byglandsfjorden supracrustal cover sequence, and metaigneous rocks which intruded the whole succession. The main crustal evolution took place from 1,550–1,020 Ma, beginning with the emplacement of juvenile tonalitic melts; the contribution of older crustal material increased with time. Around 1,320 Ma, further addition of juvenile material occurred, involving both mafic and felsic melts, metamorphism and deformation. Acid magmas with high FeO*/MgO were intruded at 1,215 Ma, coinciding with underplating elsewhere in South Norway. The period starting at 1,215 Ma is represented by supracrustal rocks, principally metarhyolites with minor mafic material and immature sediments of the Byglandsfjorden Group. The crust generation processes ended with the intrusion of diorites and granodiorites at 1,030 Ma, late in the Sveconorwegian orogeny. Regional processes of metamorphism and deformation (around 1,290 and 1,000 Ma) can be related to the assembly of Rodinia." .

About 60% of all petroleum source rocks comprise sediments of late Jurassic and early Cretaceous age with the origin of such black shales still under discussion. In order to better understand the factors that controlled black shale sedimentation, 78 samples were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils from two sections (Gorodische, Kashpir) of the Volga Basin (NE Russia). Calcareous nannofossils are ideal proxies for deciphering nutrient, temperature and salinity fluctuations. Additionally 58 samples from both sections were also analyzed for clay mineralogy, δ13Corg , TOC and CaCO3 composition. Both sections contain calcareous claystones and intercalated organic rich shales overlain by phosphorite beds. The presence of the calcareous nannofossil species Stephanolithion atmetros throughout both successions allows a biostratigraphic assignment to the S. atmetros Nannofossil Biozone (NJ 17), which corresponds to the Dorsoplanites panderi Ammonite Biozone of the Middle Volgian. The marlstones of the Kashpir section yield a well-preserved rich and diverse nannoflora, whereas all black shale beds are essentially barren of calcareous nannofossils. Only the uppermost black shale layers yield an impoverished assemblage of low diversity and abundance. Geochemical data suggest an early diagenetic nannofossil dissolution in the black shales of the Kashpir section. This is supported by the occurrence of coccoliths in black shale horizons of the Gorodische section. The assemblages in both sections are dominated by coccoliths of the Watznaueriaceae group (Watznaueria barnesae, Watznaueria fossacincta, Watznaueria britannica, Watznaueria communis), Biscutum constans and Zeugrhabdotus erectus. In Kashpir rare specimens of Crucibiscutum salebrosum occur in the higher part of the section. These taxa indicate boreal affinities. B. constans and Z. erectus are considered to be taxa indicative of a higher productive environment, while C. salebrosum is a cool-water species. From base to top of the Kashpir section, consecutive mass occurrences of different taxa/groups were observed: W. barnesae–W. fossacincta acme, W. britannica–W. communis acme, Z. erectus acme, B. constans acme (including sparse occurrences of C. salebrosum). The observed distribution patterns have been interpreted as characterizing a transition from a low productive, oligotrophic setting with high abundances of K-selected cosmopolitan species (Watznaueriaceae) and predominating marlstone sedimentation to a higher productive, mesotrophic setting. Cooler water temperatures marked by r-selection and acmes of opportunistic species (Z. erectus, B. constans) are coincident with the deposition of black shales and phosphorites in the higher part of the section. Interpretation of clay mineral distribution indicates that black shale deposition occurred under semi-arid hinterland climatic conditions concomitant with a sea level rise. This induced dysoxic conditions in the deeper parts of the Volga Basin, favoring the preservation of organic matter. The cause of the nutrient enrichment in the surface water is still unclear, but possible river water input from the continents does not seem to have been the controlling factor under a semi-arid climate. The occurrence of phosphorites in the upper part of both sections presumably indicates that enhanced productivity may be better explained by the upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom water and thereby causing the recycling of nutrients from oxidized phytoplankton back into the photic zone. This recycling effect finally may have led to an intensified phytoplankton growth which seemed to be a sufficient source for the enrichment of organic matter. This is well correlated with the increase in black shale horizons in the upper part of the Kashpir section." .

In addition, textural and mineralogical features indicate that the Gorgona komatiites may have crystallized from superheated liquids. Komatiitic rocks have MgO contents which range from 24 to 11 wt.% and plot on well-defined olivine (Fo90) control lines. Calculations show that potential evolved liquids (MgO<11 wt%) will be SiO2-poor. Komatiites, in this case, cannot be regarded as parental to the associated tholeiitic basalt sequence. On the basis of REE concentrations and Sr, Nd isotopic compositions, the associated basalts are found to be of two types. One type (K-tholeiite) is characterized by noticeably fractionated REE patterns and relatively primitive isotopic compositions similar to those of the komatiites. K-tholeiites, together with komatiites, are regarded as comprising a distinctive komatiitic suite. REE patterns within this suite show progressive depletion in the LREE from K-tholeiites to komatiites, and represent increasingly higher degrees of melting of the same mantle source region. The other type (T-tholeiite), representative of the bulk of the exposed basalt sequence, has flat REE patterns and relatively evolved isotopic compositions. This tholeiitic suite is clearly genetically unrelated to the komatiitic suite." .

Our field data, aerial image analysis, and 40Ar/39Ar chronology from Anaga basaltic shield volcano on Tenerife, Canary Islands, support a rift zone—flank instability relationship. A single rift zone dominated the early stage of the Anaga edifice (~6–4.5 Ma). Destabilization of the northern sector led to partial seaward collapse at about ~4.5 Ma, resulting in a giant landslide. The remnant highly fractured northern flank is part of the destabilized sector. A curved rift zone developed within and around this unstable sector between 4.5 and 3.5 Ma. Induced by the dilatation of the curved rift, a further rift-arm developed to the south, generating a three-armed rift system. This evolutionary sequence is supported by elastic dislocation models that illustrate how a curved rift zone accelerates flank instability on one side of a rift, and facilitates dike intrusions on the opposite side. Our study demonstrates a feedback relationship between flank instability and intrusive development, a scenario probably common in ocean island volcanoes. We therefore propose that ocean island rift zones represent geologically unsteady structures that migrate and reorganize in response to volcano flank instability." .

About 99 per cent of the rocks were regarded as basaltic, 1 per cent as rhyolitic and rocks of intermediate composition as nearly non-existent. Recent research has changed this picture. Central volcanoes producing acid and intermediate lava and tephra have played a considerable role both in the Tertiary and Quaternary. Contrary to the lava massproducing basalt volcanoes, fed by a deep-seated and rather uniform basalt magma source, the differentiated central volcanoes are normally fed by separated magma chambers at smaller depth, where differentiation takes place between the eruptions, resulting in intermediate and acid products which bridge the “immiscibility gap” between the basalts and the rhyolites. Eight to ten per cent of the postglacial lavas and tephras and about 25 per cent of the historical ones are acid or intermediate. Opinions still differ as to whether the existence of these rocks can be explained solely as the result of gravitational differentiation of parent basalt magma or has to be explained partly by a remelting of a continental layer beneath the plateau-basalts. There are, however, some rather strong geological evidences in favour of the existence of such a layer and they seem at the moment not to be contradicted by geophysical research. The Surtsey eruption has demonstrated the close relation between the craterrows, shieldvolcanoes and tablemountains and convincingly shown how greatly external circumstances may influence volcanic activity and the shape of a volcano. The eruption focused interest on the neovolcanic zone of Iceland as a supra marine part of the Mid-Atlantic rift-ridge zone, where volcanic activity has taken place under similar conditions as along its submarine parts, viz. under water (glacial meltwater) when the Pleistocene ice-sheets blanketed the volcanic activity. Similar morphological types of volcanoes can therefore be expected in both cases, viz. steepsided mounds and long steepsided ridges." .

Numerical analogue and computational results of actual multi-group data, and different iterative control processes, show that under a certain residual standard, there is obvious trade-off on the assignment of travel-time residuals between medium parameters and earthquakes parameters (especially the origin time and depth of earthquake), so the obtained solution is related to the selected initial values of medium parameters to some extent; but there are the basically same variation features on different results in the almost same area. That is the solution of surface layer has a close relation to the strata and landform. In Yinchuan basin there is obvious low velocity feature, and it coincides with the results of a man-made earthquake section crossing the region; tomographic patterns show that there are many low velocity regions in middle-lower crust, and it seems to have some connections between the positions of historical strong earthquakes and the low velocity region or the anomalous variations of velocity gradient." .

First, EOF analyses were performed on the outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data to characterize the convective activity variability in the tropical Indian Ocean and the western Pacific. The first EOF mode of the convective activity was highly correlated with the ENSO. The second EOF mode had an east-west dipole structure, and the third EOF mode had three convective activity centers. Two distinct teleconnection patterns were identified that were associated, respectively, with the second and third EOF modes. A global primitive equation model was used to investigate the physical mechanism that causes the global circulation anomalies. The model responses to anomalous tropical thermal forcings that mimic the EOF patterns matched the general features of the observed circulation anomalies well, and they were mainly controlled by linear processes. The importance of convective activities in the tropical Indian Ocean and western Pacific to the extended- and long-range forecasting capability in the extratropics is discussed." .

By employing the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), we find all the temperature records are long-term correlated, while the exponent α obtained from DFA varies from different districts of China due to different climate conditions, such as the southwest monsoon, subtropical high, northeast cold vortex, and the Tibetan plateau, etc. After we take the standard deviation into account, a new index χ = α × σ, which has been proposed recently, can be obtained.

The sensitivity of simulated precipitation to driving lateral boundary conditions (NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses) and ocean surface flux scheme (BATS and Zeng) is assessed for 5 monsoon seasons. The ability of the RegCM to simulate the spatial patterns and magnitude of monsoon precipitation is demonstrated, both in response to the prominent large scale circulations over the region and to the local forcing by the physiographical features of the Philippine islands. This provides encouraging indications concerning the development of a regional climate modeling system for the Philippine region. On the other hand, the model shows a substantial sensitivity to the analysis fields used for lateral boundary conditions as well as the ocean surface flux schemes. The use of ERA40 lateral boundary fields consistently yields greater precipitation amounts compared to the use of NCEP fields. Similarly, the BATS scheme consistently produces more precipitation compared to the Zeng scheme. As a result, different combinations of lateral boundary fields and surface ocean flux schemes provide a good simulation of precipitation amounts and spatial structure over the region. The response of simulated precipitation to using different forcing analysis fields is of the same order of magnitude as the response to using different surface flux parameterizations in the model. As a result it is difficult to unambiguously establish which of the model configurations is best performing." .

The goal of this study is to detect the variation of temperature and precipitation for different growth periods of maize and assess their impact on phenology. The daily meteorological data in the Midwest of Jilin Province during 1960–2014 were used in the study. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method was adopted to analyze the non-linear trend and fluctuation in temperature and precipitation, and the sensitivity of the length of the maize growth period to temperature and precipitation was analyzed by the wavelet cross-transformation method. The results show that the trends of temperature and precipitation change are non-linear for different growth periods of maize, and the average temperature in the sowing-jointing stage was different from that in the other growth stages, showing a slight decrease trend, while the variation amplitude of maximum temperature is smaller than that of the minimum temperature. This indicates that the temperature difference between day and night shows a gradually decreasing trend. Precipitation in the growth period also showed a decreasing non-linear trend, while the inter-annual variability with period of quasi-3-year and quasi-6-year dominated the variation of temperature and precipitation. The whole growth period was shortened by 10.7 days, and the sowing date was advanced by approximately 11 days. We also found that there was a significant resonance period among temperature, precipitation, and phenology. Overall, a negative correlation between phenology and temperature is evident, while a positive correlation with precipitation is exhibited. The results illustrate that the climate suitability for maize has reduced over the past decades." .

However, because of the heat generated by radioactive decays in the wastes, polyhalite may dehydrate, and the released water will dissolve its neighboring salt, potentially affecting the repository integrity. Thus, studying the thermal behavior of polyhalite is important. In this work, a polyhalite sample containing a small amount of halite was collected from the Salado formation at the WIPP site in Carlsbad, New Mexico. To determine its thermal behavior, in situ high-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction was conducted from room temperature to 1066 K with the sample powders sealed in a silica-glass capillary. At about 506 K, polyhalite started to decompose into water vapor, anhydrite (CaSO4) and two langbeinite-type phases, K2Ca x Mg2-x (SO4)3, with different Ca/Mg ratios. XRD peaks of the minor halite disappeared, presumably due to its dissolution by water vapor. With further increasing temperature, the two langbeinite solid solution phases displayed complex variations in crystallinity, composition and their molar ratio and then were combined into the single-phase triple salt, K2CaMg(SO4)3, at ~919 K. Rietveld analyses of the XRD data allowed determination of structural parameters of polyhalite and its decomposed anhydrite and langbeinite phases as a function of temperature. From the results, the thermal expansion coefficients of these phases have been derived, and the structural mechanisms of their thermal behavior been discussed." .

We document one such unit to investigate why it is so different from the interbedded welded ignimbrites. The newly recognised Deadeye Member of southern Idaho is a soil-bounded eruption-unit that comprises ashfall layers and a 4-m-thick ignimbrite that extends for >35 km. The ignimbrite is non-welded, lithic-clast poor and varies from massive to diffuse low-angle cross-bedded. It contains abundant angular clasts of non-vesicular black glass, and upper parts contain accretionary lapilli. The ashfall layers above it contain coated ash pellets and ash clumps, which record moist aggregation of fine ash. The magmas of the Deadeye eruption were closely similar in composition and temperature to those that generated the intensely welded rheomorphic ignimbrites of the central Snake River Plain. We infer that the marked contrast in physical appearance of the Deadeye ignimbrite compared to the other, more typical Snake-River-type welded ignimbrites was the result of emplacement at relatively low temperatures during an eruption in a lacustrine environment. Magmatic volatile-driven fragmentation of the rhyolitic magma was influenced by interaction with lake water that also led to cooling. The Deadeye Member is the first-recorded example of explosive silicic phreatomagmatism in the central Snake River Plain." .

The analysis was based on multi-year (1971–2000) crop model simulation runs using daily weather series under scenarios of increased temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) along with two scenarios of water management. Apart from this, sowing date as an adaptation option to offset the likely impacts of climate change was also considered. Increase in temperature resulted in yield declines in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid zone. But the humid zone followed a positive trend of gain in yield with rise in temperature up to 4°C. Within a water regime, increase in CO2 concentration from 375 to 550 and 700 ppm will exert positive effect on gain in wheat yield but this positive effect is significantly variable in different climatic zones under rainfed conditions than the full irrigation. The highest response was shown by arid zone followed by semi-arid, sub-humid and humid zones. But if the current baseline water regimes (i.e. full irrigation in arid and semi-arid zones and rainfed in sub-humid and humid zones) persist in future, the sub-humid zone will be most benefited in terms of significantly higher percent gain in yield by increasing CO2 level, mainly because of its rainfed water regime. Within a CO2 level the changes in water supply from rainfed to full irrigation shows an intense degree of responsiveness in terms of yield gain at 375 ppm CO2 level compared to 550 and 700 ppm. Arid and semi-arid zones were more responsive compared to sub-humid and humid zones. Rise in temperature reduced the length of crop life cycle in all areas, though at an accelerated rate in the humid zone. These results revealed that the climatic zones have shown a variable intensity of vulnerability to different scenarios of climate change and water management due to their inherent specific and spatial climatic features. In order to cope with the negative effects of climate change, alteration in sowing date towards cooler months will be an appropriate response by the farmers." .

The composite graben structure consists of three segments, each c. 100 km long and 30–40 km wide, but flares to c. 60 km near its southern and to c. 80 km near its northern termination. Normal faulting induced a total extension of 5–8 km of the 1–2 km thick Mesozoic sedimentary Franconian platform and underlying Variscan basement rocks. However, distribution of an up to 3.5 km thick sedimentary graben fill and cumulative displacements near Eastern and Western Main Border fault systems suggest that subsidence of the graben floor and shoulder uplift created strong cross-sectional asymmetries. Cumulative W-down displacements >3 km along strongly segmented transfer faults in the east contrast with E-down displacements <3 km and major monoclinal “block fields” in the west. Both location and asymmetry of the URG appear to be related to lithospheric shear zones that originated within the central parts of the Variscan orogen between c. 330 and 315 Ma. Following pervasive deformation, HT/LP regional metamorphism and emplacement of granodioritic-granitic plutons a c. 50-km-thick orogenic crust were thinned to an about 30-km-thick two-layered crust above a reconsolidated and relatively planar crust-mantle boundary (Moho). In the URG area extensional thinning of the crust appears to have occurred mainly along a composite NNE-striking and mainly W-down “East Rhine Detachment”, which is partly exposed along the Wehratal, Omerskopf, Otzberg and other mylonitic-cataclastic shear zones in the basement of the eastern graben shoulder. These shear zones probably extend into lower crustal levels, where they are revealed as gently W-dipping seismic reflectors beneath and west of the URG. Major W-down displacements probably account for the mapped abundance of high-grade metamorphic basement rocks on the eastern graben shoulder in contrast to the predominantly low-grade metamorphic to unmetamorphosed sedimentary-volcanic rocks exposed on the western shoulder. Although between c. 310 and 270 Ma NE-trending Permocarboniferous volcanic-sedimentary basins of the URG area subsided along upper crustal faults that mimic the trend of Variscan faults, initial broad lithospheric cooling from c. 270–200 Ma led to subsidence of a distinctly NNE- to SSW-oriented embayment that was probably underlain by thinner Palaeozoic crust in the area of the NNE-trending East Rhine Detachment. After re-emergence of the platform above sea level in late Mesozoic times, the deep-reaching W-dipping “extensional defects” of the East Rhine Detachment exerted a primary lithospheric scale control on both location and cross-sectional asymmetry of the Cenozoic graben structure. NE- and NW-striking, strongly altered and more shallow rooted Permocarboniferous or Mesozoic faults exerted secondary upper crustal controls on transfer faults and the accommodation zones near the terminations and segment boundaries of the URG. Deep crustal to upper lithospheric asymmetries continue to influence the neotectonic setting of the URG, such as westward rising earthquake hypocentres. Seismic activity along the URG appears to be part of a >600 km long zone that delimits the trailing edge of a SW-moving lithospheric block. In the URG area, NE–SW-oriented seismic anisotropy at sublithospheric depths of c. 60–80 km suggest active mantle flow in this direction as a possible driving force for the reactivation of pre-graben lithospheric shear zones." .

It is an important pathway for freshwater and sea-ice transport from the Arctic Ocean to the Labrador Sea and ultimately to the Atlantic Ocean. The narrow straits are often crudely represented in coupled sea-ice–ocean models, leading to a misrepresentation of transports through these straits. Unstructured meshes are an alternative in modelling this complex region, since they are able to capture the complex geometry of the CAA. This provides higher resolution in the flow field and allows for more accurate transports (but not necessarily better modelling). In this paper, a finite element sea-ice model of the Arctic region is described and used to estimate the sea-ice fluxes through the CAA. The model is a dynamic–thermodynamic sea-ice model with elastic–viscous–plastic rheology and is coupled to a slab ocean, where the temperature and salinity are restored to climatology, with no velocities and surface elevation. The model is spun-up from 1973 to 1978 with NCEP/NARR reanalysis data. From 1979 to 2007, the model is forced by NCEP/DoE reanalysis data. The large scale sea-ice characteristics show good agreement with observations. The total sea-ice area agrees very well with observations and shows a sensitivity to the Arctic oscillation (AO). For 1998–2002, we find estimates for the sea-ice volume and area fluxes through Admunsen Gulf, McClure Strait and the Queen Elizabeth Islands that compare well with observation and are slightly better than estimates from other models. For Nares Strait, we find that the fluxes are much lower than observed, due to the missing effect of topographic steering on the atmospheric forcing fields. The 1979–2007 fluxes show large seasonal and interannual variability driven primarily by variability in the ice velocity field and a sensitivity to the AO and other large-scale atmospheric variability, which suggests that accurate atmospheric forcing might be crucial to modelling the CAA." .

Several lines of evidences point to an initial lithosphere rupture, possibly induced by a rising mantle plume. The earliest synrift igneous products are represented by ultra-potassic dykes and alkaline lava flows of high LREE/HREE and low Zr/Nb–Y/Nb ratios. The dyke emplacements and the initiation of rifting were probably synchronous. They pass laterally and upwards (middle part of the Puncoviscana succession) into basalts of alkaline transitional character (OIB-like source). The distinctive chemical feature of these lavas are very similar to the source of oceanic island basalts; thus, they are thought to represent a magmatism associated with the rift and rift-drift transition stage. During this stage of rifting probably true oceanic crust was formed. The upper part of the Puncoviscana sequence, Late Precambrian/Lower Cambrian in age, comprises a thick and monotonous sequence of pillow lavas, massive basaltic flows and minor volcanic breccias and hyaloclastites. These lavas exhibit MORB trace element characteristics with high FeOt and TiO2, low K2O and P2O5, flat light REE spectra, little or no depletion in Nb and Ta. This volcanism consists of the major and latest effusive episode from the Puncoviscana basin which was slightly modified by subduction processes. The geodynamical model proposed for the generation of these volcanic rocks could have been developed in two stages. In the first stage the volcanic event is compatible with a progressive opening of a continental rift leading to formation of a mature oceanic basin. In contrast, the second stage shows the effects of a completed Wilson cycle including a primitive volcanic arc which continued until the accreted Cuyania-Arequipa-Belen-Antofalla (CABA) terrane against the proto-Gondwana western borderland of the Amazonian shield (∼535 Ma)." .

Analyses of daily discharge and water level records, and derived annual, seasonal and monthly series, showed that Zhengshui River flows had a significant increasing trend, with an abrupt change point in 1990. There was a significant decreasing water level trend with an abrupt change point in 1995. Human activities and precipitation contributed 53 and 47%, respectively, to increase in stream flow during 1991–2003. Anthropogenic activities such as sand dredging, dominated the decrease in water level during 1994–2003.

Faults interpreted from a high fold 3D seismic data imply a dominant normal faulting regime. It suggests that maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) is an intermediate principal stress in the basin. The magnitude of the horizontal stress is quantified by two methods: as a function of vertical stress and as a function of overpressure at depth. The scattering of SHmin values estimated from application of the Eaton (1969) method and Leak Off Test (LOT) data is indicative of the SHmin gradient varying with depth in the basin. We propose an inhomogeneous stress field and more than one source of stress in the region based on the result of multiple directions determined from the analysis of 32 borehole breakouts recorded in six wells. We suggest the occurrence of repeated earth tremors in the region is likely to be due to the reactivation of rifted continental crust linking the regional onshore faults along major lineaments." .

So that detailed risk assessments can be carried out, it is necessary to rank potential volcanic hazards and events in terms of risk. As it is often difficult to make accurate predictions regarding the characteristics of future eruptions, a method for ranking hazards and events has been developed that does not rely on precise values. Risk is calculated individually for each hazard from each source as the product of likelihood, extent and effect, based on the parameters’ order of magnitude. So that multiple events and outcomes can be considered, risk is further multiplied by the relative probability of the event occurring (probabilitye) and the relative importance of the outcome (importanceo). By adding the values obtained, total risk is calculated and a ranking can be carried out. This method was used to rank volcanic hazards and events that may impact the Auckland Region, New Zealand. Auckland is at risk from the Auckland volcanic field, Okataina volcanic centre, Taupo volcano, Tuhua volcano, Tongariro volcanic centre, and Mt. Taranaki volcano. Relative probabilities were determined for each event, with the highest given to Mt. Taranaki. Hazards considered were, for local events: tephra fall, scoria fall and ballistic impacts, lava flow, base surge and associated shock waves, tsunami, volcanic gases and acid rain, earthquakes and ground deformation, mudflows and mudfills, lightning and flooding; and for distal events: tephra fall, pyroclastic flows, poisonous gases and acid rain, mudflows and mudfills, climate variations and earthquakes. Hazards from each source were assigned values for likelihood, with the largest for tephra fall from all sources, earthquakes and ground deformation, lava flows, scoria fall and base surge for an Auckland eruption on land, and earthquakes and ground deformation from an Auckland eruption in the ocean. The largest values for extent were for tephra fall and climate variation from each of the distal centres. However, these parameters do not give a true indication of risk. In a companion paper the effect of each hazard is fully investigated and the risk ranking completed." .

The RP is a mostly massive fall deposit with an inversely graded base. Empirical models suggest a maximum eruption column height H T of 30.5–35 km with an associated peak mass discharge rate of 2.8–4.8 × 108 kg/s. Analytical calculations result in H T values of 33 ± 4 km (inversion of TEPHRA2 model on grain size data) corresponding to mass discharge ranging from 2.3 to 6.0 × 108 kg/s. Lake-core data allow extrapolation of the deposit thinning trend far beyond onland exposures. Empirical fitting of thickness data yields volume estimates between 3.2 and 5.8 km3 (corresponding to an erupted mass of 1.1–2.0 × 1012 kg), whereas analytical derivation yields an erupted mass of 1.1 × 1012 kg (inversion of TEPHRA2 model). Modelling and dispersal maps are consistent with nearly no-wind conditions during the eruption. The plume corner is estimated to have been ca. 11–12 km from the vent. After an opening phase with gradually increasing intensity, a high discharge rate was maintained throughout the eruption, without fountain collapse as is evidenced by a lack of pyroclastic density current deposits." .

(Contrib Mineral Petrol 167:1013, 2014a) proposed that “cataclasites,” “breccias” and “pseudotachylytes” of eclogites at Yangkou in the Chinese Sulu UHP metamorphic belt are formed by “a compression stress wave of earthquake.” They suggested that the intergranular coesite resulted from a rapid cooling from about 700 °C to below 375–400 °C and a “sudden pressure release of seismic wave” from 3.3 to 1.2 GPa in some hours. However, the earthquake-induced UHP metamorphism under fluid-deficient conditions, proposed by these authors, remains inconclusive and inconsistent with the available data from the UHP metamorphic belt. The coesite inclusions within garnet, zircon and omphacite, and intergranular coesite grains between these minerals can be preserved by the presence of the pressure vessel effect, the lack of fluid infiltration, and the presence of a low-temperature and nonhydrostatic deformation environment during rapid exhumation." .

The eruption produced 0.8 km3 of mainly volcanic glass with a basaltic icelandite composition (equivalent to 0.45 km3 of magma). Ice thickness above the 6-km-long volcanic fissure was initially 550–750 m. The eruption was mainly subglacial forming a 150–500 m high ridge; only 2–4% of the volcanic material was erupted subaerially. Monitoring of the formation of ice cauldrons above the vents provided data on ice melting, heat flux and indirectly on eruption rate. The heat flux was 5–6×105 W m-2 in the first 4 days. This high heat flux can only be explained by fragmentation of magma into volcanic glass. The pattern of ice melting during and after the eruption indicates that the efficiency of instantaneous heat exchange between magma and ice at the eruption site was 50–60%. If this is characteristic for magma fragmentation in subglacial eruptions, volcanic material and meltwater will in most cases take up more space than the ice melted in the eruption. Water accumulation would therefore cause buildup of basal water pressure and lead to rapid release of the meltwater. Continuous drainage of meltwater is therefore the most likely scenario in subglacial eruptions under temperate glaciers. Deformation and fracturing of ice played a significant role in the eruption and modified the subglacial water pressure. It is found that water pressure at a vent under a subsiding cauldron is substantially less than it would be during static loading by the overlying ice, since the load is partly compensated for by shear forces in the rapidly deforming ice. In addition to intensive crevassing due to subsidence at Gjálp, a long and straight crevasse formed over the southernmost part of the volcanic fissure on the first day of the eruption. It is suggested that the feeder dyke may have overshot the bedrock–ice interface, caused high deformation rates and fractured the ice up to the surface. The crevasse later modified the flow of meltwater, explaining surface flow of water past the highest part of the edifice. The dominance of magma fragmentation in the Gjálp eruption suggests that initial ice thickness greater than 600–700 m is required if effusive eruption of pillow lava is to be the main style of activity, at least in similar eruptions of high initial magma discharge." .

The aims of this study were to explain the hydrogeological characteristics of aquifers and evaluate the groundwater potentiality. The results revealed three types of aquifer: unconsolidated floodplain deposits aquifer (Qfd) and the consolidated Permo-Carboniferus metasedimentary (PCms) aquifer and granitic (Gr) aquifer. The main groundwater direction of the Qfd and PCms aquifers flow from the south-western to the north-eastern area. The groundwater potential, as assessed by potential surface analysis (PSA), using the rainfall, recharge, lithology, lineament density, slope, drainage density, depth to groundwater and water quality as thematic layers in a GIS system. Groundwater potentiality classes ranged from very high (in the Rai Mai Pattana area) to very low (in the Sam Praya area). The output groundwater potential map was congruent with the maximum yield data carried out by the Department of Groundwater Resources (DGR). The map declared that the Huay Sai area is commonly of moderate groundwater potentiality, where this category covers an area of 116.6 km2 (56.74% of the study area)." .

The accuracy of river runoff projection depends on the selected set of hydrological model parameters, emission scenario and global climate model. The aim of this article is to estimate the uncertainty of hydrological model parameters, to perform sensitivity analysis of the runoff projections, as well as the contribution analysis of uncertainty sources (model parameters, emission scenarios and global climate models) in forecasting Lithuanian river runoff. The impact of model parameters on the runoff modelling results was estimated using a sensitivity analysis for the selected hydrological periods (spring flood, winter and autumn flash floods, and low water). During spring flood the results of runoff modelling depended on the calibration parameters that describe snowmelt and soil moisture storage, while during the low water period—the parameter that determines river underground feeding was the most important. The estimation of climate change impact on hydrological processes in the Merkys and Neris river basins was accomplished through the combination of results from A1B, A2 and B1 emission scenarios and global climate models (ECHAM5 and HadCM3). The runoff projections of the thirty-year periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100) were conducted applying the HBV software. The uncertainties introduced by hydrological model parameters, emission scenarios and global climate models were presented according to the magnitude of the expected changes in Lithuanian rivers runoff. The emission scenarios had much greater influence on the runoff projection than the global climate models. The hydrological model parameters had less impact on the reliability of the modelling results." .

Very low Th/U values, relative abundance of Fe but a slight excess of K typically characterize these ultrafine impurities which are mineralogically dominated by smectite–illite and mica (sericite) together with goethite. In vertical section, these impurities are arranged like incremental series of light and dense bands. The combined method of natural gamma-ray spectrometric and magnetic susceptibility measurements (GRS–MS) together with background of major and trace element analyses provided first systematic insights into fine-scale variability of these impurities in a pile of pure carbonate platform beds, mostly in inner platform Amphipora limestone facies. These carbonates were deposited close to sea level but far from river mouths, and they represented a certain sort of a relatively “independent” medium that was primarily sensitive to climatically (and by rare events) controlled input of atmospheric dust. A remarkable similarity of MS stratigraphic patterns that reflect the quantity and quality of embedded impurities in very distant and paleogeographically separated Devonian basins might be seen as supporting this viewpoint. A long composite stratigraphic section of the Moravian Karst ranges from mid-Eifelian to end-Frasnian levels and yields a number of time characterizing GRS–MS variations that can potentially serve as templates for high-resolution stratigraphic correlations over long distances." .

The results showed that the total annual river runoff in the Dagujia River Basin decreased significantly from 1966 to 2004, and the rate of decrease was 48×106m3/10yr, which was higher than the mean value of most rivers in China. Multiple time scale characteristics existed, which accounted for different aspects of the changes in annual river runoff, and the major periods of the runoff time series were identified as about 28 years, 14 years and 4 years with decreasing levels of fluctuation. The river runoff evolution process was controlled by changes in precipitation to a certain extent, but it was also greatly influenced by human activities. Also, for different time periods and scales, the impacts of climate changes and human activities on annual river runoff evolution occurred at the same time. Changes in the annual river runoff were mainly associated with climate change before the 1980s and with human activities after 1981." .

We have used tephrochronological and stratigraphic dating of 175 separate eruptive units to estimate volumetric output and reconstruct eruption rates in the Askja region over the postglacial period. We have identified 14 tephra layers that can be used as time marker horizons in the near vicinity of Askja, including the Vatnaöldur (871 ± 2 AD) tephra which has not previously been reported in surface cover profiles in this region. Our improved tephrochronological resolution indicates that, over the past c. 1,500 years, Askja has been significantly more active than has previously been recognised. A minimum of 39 km3 of basaltic magma has been erupted at Askja since the area became ice-free at around 10.3 ka. The absence of the 7.2 ka Hekla 5 tephra from the Askja region suggests that all postglacial lavas now exposed at the surface are younger than 7.2 ka. Time-averaged magma discharge rates at Askja were highest between 7.2 and 4.3 ka. However, the available tephrochronological resolution is not sufficient to resolve any peak in volcanic activity following deglaciation." .

Water temperature and salinity at 500 m were relatively high from 1985 to 1990 and decreased continuously thereafter. Salinity at 800 m was lowest around 1993 and increased thereafter. Nutrients were highest between 1980 and 1985. After 1985, nutrients at 500 m were increasing. The range of variation in nutrients was large before 1985 and the magnitude increased with greater depths. Apparent oxygen utilization at 500 m depth was decreasing before 1990 and started to increase after 1992. Significant changes after 1990 at 500 m depth may be due to the upward trend of the upper boundary of Kuroshio intermediate water.

In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to explore spatiotemporal variations in SM and its responses to precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) in the Yellow River basin (YRB), a large water-limited basin in China. Results showed that model simulations performed well while drawing several important conclusions: (i) Annual P, ET, and SM exhibited a decreasing trend. On a seasonal scale, SM exhibited a negative trend with the exception of summer. On a monthly scale, SM was highest in September and lowest in June. Greater than half of the total area within the three precipitation gradients (PGs) exhibited a decline in SM, ranging between 53.16 and 74.63 %, indicating that YRB has been experiencing an increasingly severe drought period over the past 50 years. (ii) SM was positively correlated and more sensitive to P in descending order from arid regions, semi-arid regions, and semi-humid regions. SM was negatively correlated to ET in YRB but positively correlated to ET for each PG investigated. (iii) SM lagged behind P and ET by 0–3 months for YRB and all PGs, and time lags were relatively shorter in more arid areas.

The analysis toolkit (RCMET) is a Python-based toolkit that can be delivered as a cloud virtual machine, or as an installer package deployed using Python Buildout to users in order to allow for temporal and spatial regridding, metrics calculation (RMSE, bias, PDFs, etc.) and end-user visualization.

The samples examined contain the coexisting assemblage olivine, Ca-poor pyroxene, Ca-rich pyroxene and plagioclase. This enabled silica activities to be calculated from the following reactions: (Mg, Fe)2SiO4+SiO2⇆2(Mg, Fe)SiO3, CaAl2SiO6+SiO2⇆CaAl2Si2O8. Parallel curves of increasing silica activity with fractionation were established 0.20 log units apart. This represented a pressure of emplacement for the top of the layered zone in the Bethal area of 2.72±0.79 kbars. A value of 1.47±0.62 kbars was obtained for the Roossenekal area. These values are equivalent to 9.1±2.6 km and 4.9±2.1 km respectively, the latter figure being consistent with the minimum thickness of 4550 m of felsite and granophyre originally overlying the layered sequence and still preserved in the area west of Roossenekal." .

The present study focusses on a detailed time evolution of the P1 eruption (AD 1300) at Mt Pelée volcano (Martinique). After an initial dome-forming stage, a Plinian phase commenced. The P1 Plinian-style sequence is mostly a pumice fall deposit with an inversely graded base, interbedded with a surge deposit, and overlain by final flow/surge deposit. Field data on deposit dispersal, thickness, and grain-size distribution are used together with physical models to reconstruct the dynamical evolution of this eruption. We find that the mass eruption rate increased from 2×107 to 9×107 kg s − 1, producing a 19–22-km-high Plinian plume, initially stable but which ultimately collapsed to form a ~1.3-km-high fountain. Empirical models of deposit thinning suggest that the minimum volume of pyroclastic deposits is 0.15 km3, about 25 % that previously estimated. Published data on magmatic water contents in glass inclusions are used together with mass discharge rates to elucidate the mechanisms leading to column collapse. Conditions at the base of the column were close to the plume/fountain transition soon after the Pelean/Plinian-style transition due to the competing effects of increase in both gas content and mass discharge rate. After a short stage of partial collapse, the column underwent a total collapse due to an increasing discharge rate." .

Amphibolite-facies orthogneisses of the Orlica-Śnieżnik dome in the West Sudetes (Poland) show a local continuous transition from weakly deformed augen gneisses to finely laminated mylonites. Field evidence indicates that ductile shearing developed pre- or syntectonically to a migmatization event. Bulk-rock compositions of variably deformed samples yield no indications for deformation- and/or fluid-enhanced element mobility and redistribution. 87Rb–86Sr geochronology (biotite, phengite, whole rock) places time constraints on the deformation process and the post-orogenic cooling history. Phengite– and biotite–whole-rock pairs yield Rb–Sr ages of 340 to 334 Ma and 335 to 294 Ma, respectively, independent of the degree of deformation. The weighted mean of phengite–whole-rock pairs indicates an age of 337.4±2.3 Ma. Combining most of the biotite–whole-rock data yields a weighted mean age of 328.6±4.4 Ma. Because of their different closure temperatures for the Rb–Sr system, these differences are interpreted to date cooling after a thermal event. Direct dating of the deformation is not possible, but the cooling history record defines a minimum age for the development of ductile shearing and the last migmatization event. These time constraints provide evidence for the initiation of crustal collapse during or immediately following peak metamorphic conditions. The results of this study further document the importance of Variscan metamorphism in the Orlica-Śnieżnik dome." .

The Arrhenius parameters yield an activation energy (Q)=382±37 kJ/mol and pre-exponential factor (D0)=0.13 m2/s, and there is no measurable anisotropy. Calcium grain boundary diffusion rates were experimentally determined in natural (Solnhofen) limestone and hot-pressed calcite aggregates at 650° to 850° C and 0.1 to 100 MPa pressure. The Solnhofen limestone was first pre-annealed for 24 h at 700° C and 100 MPa confining pressure under anhydrous conditions to produce an equilibrium microstructure for the diffusion experiments. Values for the product of the grain boundary diffusion coefficient (D′) and the effective grain boundary diffusion width (δ) were determined from 42Ca concentration profiles measured with an ion microprobe. The results show that there is no measurable difference between D′δ values obtained for pre-annealed Solnhofen samples at 0.1 and 100 MPa or between hot-pressed calcite aggregates and pre-annealed Solnhofen samples. The temperature dependence for calcium grain boundary diffusion in Solnhofen samples annealed at 0.1 MPa is described by the Arrhenius parameters D′ 0δ=1.5×10−9 m3/s and Q=267±47 kJ/mol. Comparison of the results of this study with previously published data show that calcium is the slowest volume diffusing species in calcite. The calcium diffusivities measured in this study place constraints on several geological processes that involve diffusive mass transfer including diffusion-accommodated mechanisms in the deformation of calcite rocks." .

The aerobiological monitoring of fungal spores was performed using a Burkard volumetric spore traps. To establish predicting variables for daily and weakly spore counts, a stepwise multiple regression between spore concentrations and independent variables (meteorological parameters and lagged values from the series of spore concentrations: previous day or week concentration (Alt t − 1) and mean concentration of the same day or week in other years (C mean)) was made with data obtained during 2009–2011. Alternaria conidia are present throughout the year in the atmosphere of Tetouan, although they show important seasonal fluctuations. The highest levels of Alternaria spores were recorded during the spring and summer or autumn. Alternaria showed maximum daily values in April, May or October depending on year. When the spore variables of Alternaria, namely C mean and Alt t − 1, and meteorological parameters were included in the equation, the resulting R 2 satisfactorily predict future concentrations for 55.5 to 81.6 % during the main spore season and the pre-peak 2. In the predictive model using weekly values, the adjusted R 2 varied from 0.655 to 0.676. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the results from the expected values and the pre-peak spore data or weekly values for 2012, indicating that there were no significant differences between series compared. This test showed the C mean, Alt t − 1, frequency of the wind third quadrant, maximum wind speed and minimum relative humidity as the most efficient independent variables to forecast the overall trend of this spore in the air." .

The Damavand volcano is located to the east of Lar Valley, appearing in the heights of Alborz at the point of deviation in the structural strike of Alborz chain and along the faults during the quaternary period. The physiographic, landslide phenomenon, rock fall, valleys, water courses and alluvial fans in the Lar Valley were reviewed and studied according to aerial photographs, satellite images and field observations from the aspect of their susceptibility to the impact of faults. The results indicate that 80% of the peaks and high mountains in Lar Valley are created and influenced by the action of overthrust faults. Ninety percent of the land and rock sinking are located in the intermediate regions between the faults, and they are believed to be the results of fault impacts. Seven out of the nine cases of landslide in Lar are located on or in the margin of the faults depicting the latter’s influence. The floor ratios of eight valleys were calculated and it was determined that in addition to the impacts of faults on creating the valleys, the situation of most of these along the margins of the faults as well as seven valleys are influenced by faults. The slope of rivulets and auxiliary rivers and their angles in relation to each other and the main river were calculated. The results showed that seven rivulets were under the influence of faults. Fifty-nine percent of the alluvial fans in Lar Valley were greatly influenced by faults, whereas 49% were under their normal impact. The supposition in this study is that the results can be used to identify faults and their characteristics." .

The cores preserve a record of explosive eruptions, since ∼17,800 calibrated years before present (cal years BP), of the volcanoes of the southernmost Andean Southern Volcanic Zone (SSVZ). The suggested source volcanoes for 55 of these tephras include Hudson (32 events), Mentolat (10 events), and either Macá or Cay or some of the many minor monogenetic eruptive centers (MECs; 13 events) in the area. Only four of these eruptions had been previously identified in tephra outcrops in the region, indicating the value of lake cores for identifying smaller eruptions in tephrochronologic studies. The tephra records preserved in these lake cores, combined with those in marine cores, which extend these records back to 20,000 cal years BP, prior to the Last Glacial Maximum, suggest that no significant temporal change in the frequency of explosive eruptions was associated with deglaciation. Over this time period, Hudson volcano, one of the largest and longest lived volcanoes in the Southern Andes, has had >55 eruptions (four of them were very large) and has produced >45 km3 of pyroclastic material, making it also one of the most active volcanoes in the SVZ in terms of both frequency and volume of explosive eruptions." .

Wintertime haze days in China show robust interannual variations and significant increases over time. The SST anomalies over the North Atlantic from summer to the following winter exhibit a significant in-phase relationship with winter haze days on both decadal and interannual time scales, whereas the anomalous negative-positive SSTs from north to south over the South Atlantic from autumn to the following winter show a significant positive relationship with winter haze days on the interannual time scale. The anomalous warm SST over the North Atlantic, i.e., the positive phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), corresponds to the positive phase of the Arctic oscillation (AO). This result implies that a stable mean flow and strong westerly anomalies exist over north China. The anomalous dipole pattern in the South Atlantic results in the abnormal southerly airflow in the troposphere over eastern China. Neither the westerly anomalies over north China nor the southerly anomalies over eastern China, which are associated with the North Atlantic and South Atlantic SST anomalies, respectively, are conducive to occurrences of cold air. Consequently, the weakened cold airflow from north of eastern China suppresses the dispersion of pollutants over China and results in above-normal haze days." .

The spatial distribution of precipitation variability was significantly affected by topography and was zonal on all timescales. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used to analyze changes in the distributions. A precipitation concentration index was developed to categorize the variability of annual precipitation. Summer variability contributed less to annual variability than that of other seasons. Various months contributed to annual mean variability differently across the years. Overall, the variability of precipitation was shown to increase north of Xinjiang, especially in mountainous regions, where the increase was statistically significant (P = 0.05). South of Xinjiang, the variability increased only slightly, consistent with the distribution of precipitation." .

A retaining wall may fail in sliding or rotation. In the present study, rotational mode of failure is considered. A new approach to compute the rotational displacement of gravity retaining wall under seismic condition is proposed. Seismic forces are computed using pseudo-dynamic method. Dry backfill soil is considered. The present solution is for horizontal ground surface. In the computation of rotational displacement, the location of rotating wall and shift in the point of application of all the associated forces after each time step is included which was ignored in earlier studies. From the present analysis, it is found that the rotational displacement depends on the characteristics of the input motion. A non-dimensional term is used to quantify the effect of input motion on the rotational displacement. Shear strength properties of the backfill soil and geometry of the wall plays very crucial role in computation of rotational displacement." .

With the penetration of climate change impact, severity, areal extent, and frequency of drought are increasing, especially in Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin, which plays a key role in China’s agriculture production. Analyzing the regional temporal and spatial variability in the context of climate change could provide a basis for the evasion of disasters and risk. The maximum number of consecutive dry days was selected as the indicator to analyze the decadal variability of drought severity, areal extent, and spatial variability of drought frequency in different seasons in Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin. Based on these, temporal and spatial variability of two kinds of special extreme events—consecutive drought and heavy rain after drought—were studied. The results showed that: (1) Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin mainly experienced moderate drought and severe drought. Moderate drought mainly occurs in autumn. High-frequency region of moderate drought is located in the plain of Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin, and its area is approximately 22.7 % of Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin. Severe drought often occurs in spring with high-frequency region in the upstream of the Yellow River. The area of this high-frequency region is about 6 % of Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin. (2) During 1961~2011, the areal extent of summer severe drought, autumn severe drought, and extreme drought all showed increasing trend, in which the increasing trend of the autumn severe drought area in the Yellow River has reached the significance level α = 0.05.

These grains have a thin homogeneous rim and an oscillatory inner zone domain with or without a relict inherited core. Garnet, kyanite, and rutile inclusions were identified within only the rim domain of zircon grains, indicating that the rim had formed during peak granulite-facies metamorphism. U–Pb zircon data record three distinct age populations: 1,805 Ma (for the inherited core), ca. 500 Ma (oscillatory inner zone), as well as 24–25 Ma and ca. 18 Ma (for the metamorphic rim). These new precision ages suggest that the peak metamorphic age for the HP granulite is at ca. 24–25 Ma, and subsequent amphibolite-facies retrograde metamorphism occurred at ca. 18 Ma." .

Two circulation indices, covering the same period and showing west–east or south–north directions of transport of air masses, were calculated. Statistical methods were used in the study. The results show a significant positive trend in average annual air temperatures in almost the entire territory of Bulgaria with the exception of its eastern-northeastern part. The warming occurs mainly in March, June and July, with some stations having significant positive values also in January, May and August. The zonal index reveals an insignificant increase of western transport of air masses in the cold half of the year (October–April) and strengthening of the eastern transport in the rest of the year. The meridional index shows an increase of the northern transport of air masses over the entire year and this is particularly visible in March, June, August and September. Correlation coefficients indicate that atmospheric circulation has leading role in determination of air temperatures during the period from November to April. Western transport of air masses leads to higher temperatures in spring, autumn and winter and to lower temperatures in summer. The influence of ENSO on atmospheric circulation over Bulgaria is weak, with a time lag of 2 months. El Niño is associated with increased western and northern transport of air masses, while La Niña is associated with increased eastern and southern transport of air masses over southeastern Europe." .

These basalts occur as massive fault-bounded units interspersed with marine sedimentary rocks and limestones that are metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies in the Ordovician Mulgrave, Silurian Chillagoe and Devonian Hodgkinson formations, respectively. The petrogenetic and Sm–Nd isotope characteristics of these mafic volcanic rocks were investigated to constrain the tectonic setting in which they erupted. Major, trace and rare earth element analyses were carried out on samples from these formations and intrusive dolerites. The mafic rocks can be classified as basalts and basaltic andesites with distinct MORB characteristics. Furthermore, the basalts are characterized by a slight to moderate enrichment in Th and concomitant depletion in Nb, both of which become less pronounced with basalt evolution through time. These features are consistent with decreasing volcanic arc affinity of Silurian and Devonian MORB-type basalts in the Hodgkinson Province. Sm–Nd isotope characteristics of these basalts indicate a change in source region from dominantly sub-continental lithospheric mantle in the Silurian to asthenospheric input in the Devonian. Collectively, the geochemical and isotopic characteristics of the Hodgkinson Province basalts are interpreted to reflect deposition in an evolving back-arc basin setting. The onset of basin extension was initiated in the Silurian. Accelerated basin subsidence occurred throughout the Devonian and was halted by basin inversion in the Late Devonian. Basin evolution was controlled by an eastward stepping subduction zone outboard of the Australian Craton." .

To analyze the aerobiological sampling points, study periods from 13 years (1999–2011) to 19 years (1993–2011) were used. The forecasting models were constructed using partial least-squares regression, considering both the flowering start and full-flowering dates as dependent variables. The percentages of variance explained by the full-flowering models (mean 84 %) were greater than those explained by the flowering start models (mean 77 %). Moreover, given the time lag from the North African areas to the central Mediterranean areas in the main olive flowering dates, the regional full-flowering predictive models are proposed as the most useful to improve the knowledge of the influence of climate on the olive tree floral phenology. The meteorological parameters related to the previous autumn and both the winter and the spring seasons, and above all the temperatures, regulate the reproductive phenology of olive trees in the Mediterranean area. The mean anticipation of flowering start and full flowering for the future period from 2081 to 2100 was estimated at 10 and 12 days, respectively. One question can be raised: Will the olive trees located in the warmest areas be northward displaced or will they be able to adapt their physiology in response to the higher temperatures? The present study can be considered as an approach to design more detailed future bioclimate research." .

These ignimbrites belong to the Cerro Galán volcanic system, one of the largest calderas in the world, in the Puna plateau, NW Argentina. Temperature estimates for the 2.08-Ma Cerro Galán ignimbrite are retrieved from 40 sites in 14 localities (176 measured clasts), distributed at different distances from the caldera and different stratigraphic heights. Additionally, temperature estimates were obtained from 27 sample sites (125 measured clasts) from seven ignimbrite units forming the older Toconquis Group (5.60–4.51 Ma), mainly outcropping along a type section at Rio Las Pitas, Vega Real Grande. The paleomagnetic data obtained by progressive thermal demagnetization show that the clasts of the Cerro Galán ignimbrite have one single magnetic component, oriented close to the expected geomagnetic field at the time of emplacement. Results show therefore that most of the clasts acquired a new magnetization oriented parallel to the magnetic field at the moment of the ignimbrite deposition, suggesting that the clasts were heated up to or above the highest blocking temperature (T b) of the magnetic minerals (T b = 580°C for magnetite; T b = 600–630°C for hematite). We obtained similar emplacement temperature estimations for six out of the seven volcanic units belonging to the Toconquis Group, with the exception of one unit (Lower Merihuaca), where we found two distinct magnetic components. The estimation of emplacement temperatures in this latter case is constrained at 580–610°C, which are lower than the other ignimbrites. These estimations are also in agreement with the lowest pre-eruptive magma temperatures calculated for the same unit (i.e., 790°C; hornblende–plagioclase thermometer; Folkes et al. 2011b). We conclude that the Cerro Galán ignimbrite and Toconquis Group ignimbrites were emplaced at temperatures equal to or higher than 620°C, except for Lower Merihuaca unit emplaced at lower temperatures. The homogeneity of high temperatures from proximal to distal facies in the Cerro Galán ignimbrite provides constraints for the emplacement model, marked by a relatively low eruption column, low levels of turbulence, air entrainment, surface–water interaction, and a high level of topographic confinement, all ensuring minimal heat loss." .

The evolution of the Cimini complex includes three main close-in time phases: (1) intrusion of a shallow laccolith, rising along NW and NE trending faults and stagnating at the contact between the Mesozoic-Cenozoic and the Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentary units constituting the bedrock of the volcano; (2) emplacement of lava domes along radial and tangential fractures formed by the swelling induced by the laccolith growth; (3) ignimbrite eruptions and final effusion of olivine-latitic lavas. Domes are both of Pelean and low lava dome type and their morphology was controlled by the location on the inclined surface of the swelled area. Some domes show to have uplifted upper Pliocene thermally metamorphosed clay sediments, suggesting a cryptodome-like growth. Comparison of the top of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic units with the top of the upper Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentary complex, suggests that the laccolith emplaced in a graben of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary complex filled by the Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments uplifted by the shallow intrusion. Stress patterns acting on the Cimini area have been deduced analysing the drainage network and the morphotectonic lineaments. Rose diagrams show a large dispersion of the lineaments reflecting the local presence of radial and tangential fractures. The most frequent extensional NW and NE trending lineaments have regional significance and controlled the magma uprise leading to the laccolith emplacement." .

The results indicate that the diurnal variation of warm season rainfall is closely related to location of stations. The prevailing nocturnal rainfall peak in observations at routine stations can be largely attributed to the relatively lower location of the stations, which are mostly situated in valleys. The records at Seqilashan stations on hillsides revealed an evident diurnal afternoon peak of warm season rainfall, similar to that indicated by TRMM data. The different diurnal phases between valley and hillside stations are closely related to the orographically induced regional circulations caused by the complex topography over the Tibetan Plateau. The results of this study indicate that the prevailing nocturnal rainfall associated with the relatively lower location of routine observation stations can partially explain the diurnal rainfall variations between observation station records and TRMM data." .

It is characterized by an abundant variety of magmatic rocks and related ore deposits. Uralian Paleozoic magmatism is entirely subduction-related. It is proposed that the Uralian orogen represents a cold mobile belt in which the mantle temperature was 200 to 500 °C cooler than in the adjacent areas; a situation which is similar to the modern West Pacific Triangle Zone including Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and southern Asia. During the course of the geological evolution of the Uralian orogen, the nature of the magmatism has changed from basic rocks of indisputable mantle origin (460–390 Ma) to mantle-crust gabbro-granitic complexes (370–315 Ma) followed by pure crustal granite magmatism (290–250 Ma). This order in rock type and age reflects the evolution of Paleozoic magmatic complexes from the beginning of subduction to the final stages of the orogen development." .

A statistical closure for the synoptic eddy-to-low frequency flow feedback is constructed, based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) method with observational data. Applying this statistical closure to a barotropic model and a baroclinic 2½-layer model, we study the role of the synoptic eddy feedback in the midlatitude response to the tropical ISO forcing. Both observational and modeling studies show that the strongest synoptic eddy forcing appears at the Pacific and Atlantic storm-track regions, and the synoptic eddy exerts a positive feedback to the midlatitude low-frequency flow induced by tropical ISO forcing. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the possible role of midlatitude disturbance forcing in the ISO initiation at the equator. The signal of the midlatitude perturbations propagates southeastward in the form of a Rossby wave package. It may reach the equator within several days under either easterly or westerly basic flow regimes. The response at the equator has observed ISO-like structure and eastward propagation characteristics." .

Monthly, seasonal, and annual maps of the climate characteristics, including trend maps, are created for the Baltic Sea region. Time series of monthly and annually averaged temperature and precipitation sum are presented over the Baltic Sea and Estonian domains together with fitted linear trends and trend significance analysis. Then, comparison with an observational database is performed to assess the quality of the reanalysis database. Additionally, the time series are compared with official climate normals for the period of 1971–2000, as calculated by the Estonian Environment Agency (EtEA). Findings of other publications in the scientific literature dealing with the climate of similar time period for Estonia and the Baltic Sea region are discussed.

Here, we use U–Pb and in situ Hf isotope analysis on detrital zircon to determine its age and provenance. The youngest U–Pb dates constrain the maximum depositional age of the Mora Formation at 565 ± 11 Ma. Results indicate: (1) a dominant Ediacaran zircon population (33%; 565–633 Ma, Cadomian) within a spectrum of Neoproterozoic ages (40%; 636–996 Ma); and (2) smaller Mesoproterozoic (5%; 1004–1240 Ma), Palaeoproterozoic (11%; 1890–2476 Ma) and Archean (11%; 2519–3550 Ma) populations. Results here do not point to one specific cratonic source area; instead, detritus may have been derived from the West African craton and Amazonia, or even the concealed Iberian basement. The lack of 1.3–1.8 Ga grains suggests exclusion of the Sahara Craton as a major source, but this is not certain. This mixed composition favours a complex source history with reworking of detritus across terrane/craton boundaries. Hafnium isotope compositions indicate a range of crustal and juvenile sources, with initial εHf values between −15.8 and 11.1, and Hf model ages from 0.8 to 3.7 Ga. For Neoproterozoic zircons (80%), juvenile components (εHf(i) ~+10) may be related to Rodinia fragmentation and the onset of an active margin setting leading to the Cadomian orogeny. Palaeoproterozoic to Paleoarchean grains (20%) all have negative εHf values and Meso- to Eoarchean Hf model ages. This indicates an early (Archean) sialic crustal component for northwestern Gondwana." .

It is found that on the interannual timescale, the JA North China rainfall is associated with significant SST anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific, and the North China rainfall and SST anomaly in the equatorial eastern Pacific correspond to the similar variation of the upper-level westerly jet stream over East Asia.

Positive-fold tests and solely reversed polarities indicate that the characteristic remanent magnetization is likely to be primary. Early Permian tilt-corrected site mean declinations vary from 207°–167° indicating that the Brive basin experienced internal vertical-axis rotations. On the contrary, Late Permian paleomagnetic site means exhibit a circular Fisherian distribution showing no relative rotations. Detailed analyses of Permian paleomagnetic data from five contemporaneous basins of the French Massif Central reveal that these basins share the same equatorial paleolatitude with stable Europe throughout the Permian. However, in Early Permian, three of the five basins experienced differential rotations. The Saint-Affrique basin not only suffered internal deformation during the Early Permian, but the basin as a whole underwent a full-scale counterclockwise vertical-axis block rotation with respect to stable Europe. As a consequence, paleomagnetic data from similar late orogenic basins have to be thus carefully considered for establishment of Apparent Polar Wander paths." .

Its absorption of solar radiation leads to the temperature increase with height defining the tropopause and the stratosphere. Moreover, excluding water vapor, O3 is the third most important contributor (after CO2 and CH4) to the greenhouse radiative forcing. Thus, the total removal of O3 content in an Earth-like atmosphere may cause interesting response of the climate system that deserves further investigation. The present paper addresses this issue by means of a global climate model where the atmosphere is coupled with a passive ocean of a given depth. The model, after reaching the statistical equilibrium under present climate conditions, is perturbed by a sudden switch off of the O3 content. Results obtained for the new equilibrium suggest that the model gets in a colder state mainly because of the water vapor content decrease. Most of the cooling occurs in the Southern Hemisphere while in the Northern Hemisphere the ice cap melts quite consistently. This process appears to be governed by the northward cross-equatorial heat transports induced by changes in the general circulation." .

Therefore, paleogeographic reconstructions for such old geological times are difficult to constrain. Gaps on the sedimentary record and intense remagnetizations are the major problems that paleomagnetic studies come across. Recent geochronological results for dyke swarms that intrude several Proterozoic inliers of WAC in the Anti-Atlas Belt (southern Morocco) revealed ages between Paleoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic, opening for the first time a window of opportunity to conduct paleomagnetic studies and tentatively infer about the paleoposition of WAC during Proterozoic. On this scope we conducted a paleomagnetic study on seven Proterozoic dykes of the Iguerda inlier. The meaning of the obtained paleomagnetic directions was evaluated by rock magnetic and mineral analyses, complemented by petrographic observations. Our samples record the presence of a complex history of remagnetization, mostly assigned to several Phanerozoic thermal/chemical events, in particular to the late stages of Pan African orogeny (s.l.), to the Late Carboniferous Variscan orogeny, and even to more recent events. The recognized remagnetization processes are related to widespread metamorphic events under greenschist facies followed by low-temperature oxidation, both responsible for the formation of new magnetic phases, like magnetite and hematite. These events obliterated the primary (magmatic) thermo-remanent magnetization and promoted multiple remagnetizations of the dykes, thermally and chemically. For only one dyke the presence of primary magnetization is possible to infer, though not to confirm, and would place WAC at an equatorial position around 1750 Ma." .

The field data indicate that biotite derives from hornblende at decreasing metamorphism. A chemical equilibrium has been reached for Fe2+, Mg and Mn and approached, but not reached, for tetrahedral ions, Fe3+, Alvi and Ti. The disequilibrium is mainly dependent on biotite and is tentatively ascribed to the oxidizing conditions of the environment, at the time of biotite crystallization. The composition of biotite is thus partly related to that of hornblende and partly to the environment, while intracrystalline variations of hornblende are related to the chemical composition of the host rock and to varying metamorphic grade." .

Results indicated that TGD did not seem to exert a significant influence on streamflow occurring at three stations and changes in streamflow can be mainly attributed to streamflows of tributaries. However, a sharp decrease in the sediment load after the impoundment of TGD was observed. Clear water after the impoundment caused erosion of riverbed and resulted in more sediment at the Hankou station than at the Yichang station. No distinct changes in the annual and monthly maximum sediment loads were observed before and after the impoundment. Therefore, annual and monthly maximum sediment load changes should be subjected mainly to river hydraulics. This study has practical relevance for understanding the influence of large hydraulic structures on the hydrological processes of large rivers." .

This paper considers how society can proactively manage shoreline retreat in those locations where it is deemed the preferable policy. A three-part strategy is proposed: (1) reduce new development in the highest-risk areas; (2) adopt policies that allow for expected and orderly removal or modification of development as inundation occurs; and (3) take advantage of disasters to implement managed retreat approaches.

To capture variation water availability, it is necessary to have an analysis of changing trends in precipitation. This study, based on daily precipitation data from 47 representative stations in NCP records passed the homogeneity test, analyzed the trend and amplitude of variation in monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation, annual maximum continuous no-rain days, annual rain days, rainfall intensity, and rainfall extremes from 1960 to 2007, using the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test and Sen’s slope estimator. It was found that monthly precipitation in winter had a significant increasing trend in most parts, while monthly precipitation in July to September showed a decreasing trend in some parts of NCP. No significant changing trend was found for the annual, dry and wet season precipitation and rainfall extremes in the majority of NCP.A significant decreasing trend was detected for the maximum no-rain duration and annual rain days in the major part of NCP. It was concluded that the changing trend of precipitation in NCP had an apparent seasonal and regional pattern, i.e., precipitation showed an obvious increasing trend in winter, but a decreasing trend in the rainy season (July to September), and the changing trend was more apparent in the northern part than in the southern and middle parts. This implies that with global warming, seasonal variation of precipitation in NCP tends to decline with an increasing of precipitation in winter season, and a decreasing in rainy season, particularly in the sub-humid northern part." .

The successive growth increments of two distinct growth zones of the garnet porphyroblasts from the Wölz Complex indicate garnet growth in the temperature interval of 540°C to 560°C at pressures of 400 to 500 MPa during the Permian and temperatures ranging from 550°C to 570°C at pressures in the range of 700 to 800 MPa during the Cretaceous Eo-Alpine event. Based on diffusion modelling of secondary compositional zoning within the outermost portion of the first garnet growth zone constraints on the timing of the Permian and the Eo-Alpine metamorphic events are derived. We infer that the rocks remained in a temperature interval between 570°C and 610°C over about 10 to 20 Ma during the Permian, whereas the high temperature stage of the Eo-Alpine event only lasted for about 0.2 Ma. Although peak metamorphic temperatures never exceeded 620°C, the prolonged thermal annealing during the Permian produced several 100 µm wide alteration halos in the garnet porphyroblasts and partially erased their thermobarometric memory. Short diffusion profiles which evolved around late stage cracks within the first garnet growth zone constrain the crack formation to have occurred during cooling below about 450°C after the Eo-Alpine event." .

They are characterized by small-scale lateral and temporal facies changes that make intra-basin stratigraphic correlations at regional scale difficult. This study provides new U–Pb zircon ages as well as revised 40Ar/39Ar data of volcanic ash horizons in the Upper Freshwater Molasse sediments from southern Germany and Switzerland. In a first and preliminary attempt, we propose their possible correlation to other European tephra deposits. The U–Pb zircon data of one Swiss (Bischofszell) and seven southern German (Zahling, Hachelstuhl, Laimering, Unterneul, Krumbad, Ponholz) tuff horizons indicate eruption ages between roughly 13.0 and 15.5 Ma. The stratigraphic position of the Unterneul and Laimering tuffs, bracketing the ejecta of the Ries impact (Brockhorizon), suggests that the Ries impact occurred between 14.93 and 15.00 Ma, thus assigning the event to the reversed chron C5Bn1r (15.032–14.870 Ma) which is in accordance with paleomagnetic evidence. We combine our data with published ages of tuff horizons from Italy, Switzerland, Bavaria, Styria, Hungary, and Romania to derive a preliminary tephrochronological scheme for the Middle Miocene in Central Europe in the age window from 13.2 to 15.5 Ma. The scheme is based on the current state of knowledge that the Carpathian–Pannonian volcanic field was the only area in the region producing explosive calc-alkaline felsic volcanism. This preliminary scheme will require verification by more high-quality ages complemented by isotopic, geochemical and paleomagnetic data." .

It is seen that climatological snowfall and snowmelt amount varies in the Himalayan region from west to east and from month to month. Maximum snowmelt occurs at the elevation zone between 4500 and 5000 m. As the spring and summer approach and snowmelt begins, a large amount of snow melts in May. Strength and weaknesses of temperature-based snowmelt models have been analyzed for this region by computing the snowmelt factor or the degree-day factor (DDF). It is seen that average DDF in the Himalayas is more in April and less in July. During spring and summer months, melting rate is higher in the areas that have height above 2500 m. The region that lies between 4500 and 5000 m elevation zones contributes toward more snowmelt with higher melting rate. Snowmelt models have been developed to estimate interannual variations of monthly snowmelt amount using the DDF, observed SWE, and surface air temperature from reanalysis datasets. In order to further improve the estimate snowmelt, regression between observed and modeled snowmelt has been carried out and revised DDF values have been computed. It is found that both the models do not capture the interannual variability of snowmelt in April. The skill of the model is moderate in May and June, but the skill is relatively better in July. In order to explain this skill, interannual variability (IAV) of surface air temperature has been examined. Compared to July, in April, the IAV of temperature is large indicating that a climatological value of DDF is not sufficient to explain the snowmelt rate in April. Snow area and snow amount depletion curves over Himalayas indicate that in a small area at high altitude, snow is still observed with large SWE whereas over most of the region, all the snow has melted." .

It is found that the relationship between austral summer AMR and the following boreal summer IMR (denoted as the AMR-IMR relationship) is negative during 1900–1930 and 1960–1990, but weak positive during 1930–1960. This long-term change in the AMR-IMR relationship is more prominent than the change in the relationship between boreal summer IMR and the succeeding austral summer AMR (denoted as the IMR-AMR relationship). The impact of regional sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies north of Australia on the IMR to AMR transition has experienced obvious changes during the analysis period. The long-term change in the IMR-AMR relationship is attributed to the change in impacts of regional SST anomalies north of Australia and their coherence with equatorial Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean SST anomalies. It is found that the east-west SST anomaly gradient in the North Indian Ocean is an important factor in the IMR variations. The impact of the North Indian Ocean zonal SST anomaly gradient on the AMR to IMR transition has changed largely during the analysis period. This appears to be a major reason for the long-term change in the AMR-IMR relationship. The changes in the impacts of regional SST anomaly or SST anomaly gradient are associated with changes in the amplitude of regional SST anomalies that are likely due to the change in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related SST anomaly pattern." .

Our main interest was to determine the current global trends in marine biodiversity research in terms of which areas, ecosystems and functional or taxonomic groups are receiving the most attention from researchers, what countries are actively involved in research in this field, and what networks are being established internationally to foster marine biodiversity research. A total of 236 oral talks and 148 posters were presented at the conference. These were organized in 23 sessions with four major themes linked to marine biodiversity: patterns and processes, ecosystem functioning, changes over time, and conservation policies and societal benefits. Current research seems to be focused mainly on benthic communities, followed by plankton, and to a much lesser extent, sponges, meiobenthos and invertebrates in general. The most studied geographic areas are the Southern Ocean, the Mediterranean, the European Seas and the Antarctic region. Exploration is being carried out mostly in the deep sea and in coastal zones, and focused mainly on topics such as function, communities, distribution, ecology, and secondarily on genetics and climate related issues. The conference had good international representation. The UK, France and the US each contributed more than 50 abstracts; Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Canada, and the Netherlands contributed between 25 to 48 abstracts each. Nearly 40% of the papers and abstracts presented were contributed to or involved two or more countries, which indicates a solid foundation for international collaboration and establishing research networks. The importance of the event for both the scientific community and society at large was discussed including the passing of the Valencia Declaration, a plea for the protection of marine biodiversity." .

However, how such reductions will realistically enable marine access is not well understood, especially considering a range of climatic scenarios and ship types. We present 21st century projections of technical shipping accessibility for circumpolar and national scales, the international high seas, and three potential navigation routes. Projections of marine access are based on monthly and daily CCSM4 sea ice concentration and thickness simulations for 2011–2030, 2046–2065, and 2080–2099 under 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 W/m2 radiative forcing scenarios. Results suggest substantial areas of the Arctic will become newly accessible to Polar Class 3, Polar Class 6, and open-water vessels, rising from ~54 %, 36 %, and 23 %, respectively of the circumpolar International Maritime Organization Guidelines Boundary area in the late 20th century to ~95 %, 78 %, and 49 %, respectively by the late 21st century. Of the five Arctic Ocean coastal states, Russia experiences the greatest percentage access increases to its exclusive economic zone, followed by Greenland/Denmark, Norway, Canada and the U.S. Along the Northern Sea Route, July-October navigation season length averages ~120, 113, and 103 days for PC3, PC6, and OW vessels, respectively by late-century, with shorter seasons but substantial increases along the Northwest Passage and Trans-Polar Route. While Arctic navigation depends on other factors besides sea ice including economics, infrastructure, bathymetry, and weather, these projections are useful for strategic planning by governments, regulatory agencies, and the global maritime industry to assess spatial and temporal ranges of potential Arctic marine operations in the coming decades." .

In this study, summer precipitation, evaporation, and water vapor transport from 16 models that have participated in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for the Yellow River basin (a water-limited basin) and the Yangtze River basin (an energy-limited basin) over the period 1986–2005 are analyzed and evaluated. The results suggest that most models tend to overestimate precipitation in the Yellow River basin, whereas precipitation in the Yangtze River basin is generally well simulated. Models that overestimate precipitation in the Yellow River basin also simulate evaporation with large positive biases. For water vapor transport, models and reanalysis data concur that both basins are moisture sinks in summer. In addition, models that strongly overestimate precipitation in the Yellow River basin tend to produce strong water vapor convergence in that region, which is likely to be related to the situation that the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) simulated by these models strengthens and advances further westward and northward, resulting in stronger water vapor convergence in the Yellow River basin. Moreover, convective precipitation biases simulated by the models are also partially responsible for their total precipitation biases. Finally, summer precipitation and evaporation are negatively correlated in the Yangtze River basin, whereas the relation between these variables is weak in the Yellow River basin. In both basins, precipitation and water vapor convergence are positively correlated, which is well simulated by all models." .

Almost all countries of the world (that are not island states) share rivers, lakes, groundwater or wetlands. Indeed in many cases, rivers and lakes form the border between countries. Just as importantly, water bodies crossing within-country provincial or state boundaries, as in the case of the Murray-Darling Basin, can give rise to disagreements in the ways water is shared and used. Even at a local scale, water systems often run across the territories of different cultural or ethnic groups, where demands from livestock and arable farmers may conflict with the needs of communities or water intensive industries. In the case of the Murray-Darling Basin, the situation of multiple demands is intense. Not only is the basin the traditional food bowl for the Nation, it is also the source of water supplies for hundreds of municipalities and regional centres, as well as providing for the demands of the 1.3 million people who live outside the basin in the nearby city of Adelaide. As a result of the complexity of river basin management, the idea of Integrated Water Resources Management has been something that many governments (including Australia) have been committed to for many years, and indeed, Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin has long been held up as a key example for others to follow. Recent pressures within that basin however have given rise to a wide variety of disputes around the way water is allocated, and attempts to develop an effective integrated plan have not been as successful as previously hoped. In this paper, the challenges of managing transboundary basins are examined, putting the debate around the Murray-Darling Basin Plan into a global context." .

Plant-water relationships of single-leaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla) were investigated using hourly dendrometer and environmental data from May 2006 to October 2011 in the Great Basin Desert, one of the driest regions of North America. Average radial stem increments showed an annual range of variation below 1.0 mm, with a monotonic steep increase from May to July that yielded a stem enlargement of about 0.5 mm. Stem shrinkage up to 0.2 mm occurred in late summer, followed by an abrupt expansion of up to 0.5 mm in the fall, at the arrival of the new water year precipitation. Subsequent winter shrinkage and enlargement were less than 0.3 mm each. Based on 4 years with continuous data, diel cycles varied in both timing and amplitude between months and years. Phase shifts in circadian stem changes were observed between the growing season and the dormant one, with stem size being linked to precipitation more than to other water-related indices, such as relative humidity or soil moisture. During May–October, the amplitude of the phases of stem contraction, expansion, and increment was positively related to their duration in a nonlinear fashion. Changes in precipitation regime, which affected the diel phases especially when lasting more than 5–6 h, could substantially influence the dynamics of water depletion and replenishment in single-leaf pinyon pine." .

The resultant secondary minerals — which comprise up to ∼1 vol.% of the meteorites — provide information about the timing and nature of hydrous activity and atmospheric processes on Mars. We suggest that the most plausible models for secondary mineral formation involve the evaporation of low temperature (25 – 150 °C) brines. This is consistent with the simple mineralogy of these assemblages — Fe-Mg-Ca carbonates, anhydrite, gypsum, halite, clays — and the chemical fractionation of Ca-to Mg-rich carbonate in ALH84001 \"rosettes\". Longer-lived, and higher temperature, hydrothermal systems would have caused more silicate alteration than is seen and probably more complex mineral assemblages. Experimental and phase equilibria data on carbonate compositions similar to those present in the SNCs imply low temperatures of formation with cooling taking place over a short period of time (e.g. days). The ALH84001 carbonate also probably shows the effects of partial vapourisation and dehydration related to an impact event post-dating the initial precipitation. This shock event may have led to the formation of sulphide and some magnetite in the Fe-rich outer parts of the rosettes. Radiometric dating (K-Ar, Rb-Sr) of the secondary mineral assemblages in one of the nakhlites (Lafayette) suggests that they formed between 0 and 670 Myr, and certainly long after the crystallisation of the host igneous rocks. Crystallisation of ALH84001 carbonate took place 0.5 Gyr after the parent rock. These age ranges and the other research on these assemblages suggest that environmental conditions conducive to near-surface liquid water have been present on Mars periodically over the last ∼1 Gyr. This fluid activity cannot have been continuous over geological time because in that case much more silicate alteration would have taken place in the meteorite parent rocks and the soluble salts would probably not have been preserved. The secondary minerals could have been precipitated from brines with seawater-like composition, high bicarbonate contents and a weakly acidic nature. The co-existence of siderite (Fe-carbonate) and clays in the nakhlites suggests that the pCO2 level in equilibrium with the parent brine may have been 50 mbar or more. The brines could have originated as flood waters which percolated through the top few hundred meters of the crust, releasing cations from the surrounding parent rocks. The high sulphur and chlorine concentrations of the martian soil have most likely resulted from aeolian redistribution of such aqueously-deposited salts and from reaction of the martian surface with volcanic acid volatiles. The volume of carbonates in meteorites provides a minimum crustal abundance and is equivalent to 50–250 mbar of CO2 being trapped in the uppermost 200–1000 m of the martian crust. Large fractionations in δ18O between igneous silicate in the meteorites and the secondary minerals (≤30‰) require formation of the latter below temperatures at which silicate-carbonate equilibration could have taken place (∼400°C) and have been taken to suggest low temperatures (e.g. ≤150°C) of precipitation from a hydrous fluid." .

In this paper, we propose an explanation of the physical processes responsible for the timescale and the spatial pattern of the AMO. Our approach involves the analysis of solutions of a hierarchy of models. In the lowest member of the model hierarchy, which is an ocean-only model for flow in an idealized basin, the variability shows up as a multidecadal oscillatory mode which is able to destabilize the mean thermohaline circulation. In the highest member of the model hierarchy, which is the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory R30 climate model, multidecadal variability is found as a dominant statistical mode of variability. The connection between both results is established by tracing the spatial and temporal expression of the multidecadal mode through the model hierarchy while monitoring changes in specific quantities (mechanistic indicators) associated with its physics. The proposed explanation of the properties of the AMO is eventually based on the changes in the spatial patterns of variability through the model hierarchy." .

It is found that the domain of the Plateau monsoon is bounded by the latitude between 27° N and 37° N and the longitude between 60° E and 103° E. According to the annual relative precipitation, the Plateau monsoon can be divided into three sections: the Plateau winter monsoon (PWM) over Iran and Afghanistan, the Plateau summer monsoon (PSM) over the central Plateau, and the transiting zone of the Plateau monsoon (TPM) over the south, west, and east edges of the Plateau. In PWM and PSM, the monsoon climatology has a shorter rainy season with the mean annual rainfall of less than 800 mm. In TPM, it has a longer rainy season with the mean annual rainfall of more than 1800 mm. PWM experiences a single-peak monthly rainfall with the peak during January to March; PSM usually undergoes a multi-peak pattern with peaks in the warm season; TPM presents a double-peak pattern, with a strong peak in late spring to early summer and a secondary peak in autumn. The Plateau monsoon also characterizes an asymmetrical seasonal advance of the rain belt. In the east of the Plateau, the rain belt migrates in a south–north orientation under the impact of the tropical and subtropical systems’ oscillation. In the west of the Plateau, the rain belt advances in an east–west direction, which is mainly controlled by the regional Plateau monsoon." .

Outcrop and subsurface geological data reveal the presence of NE–SW faults, E–W faults and NW–SE faults. An older extensional event occurred along NW–SE faults and was followed by the main extensional event linked to the activity of NE–SW normal faults. The latter were active between 700 and 400 ka producing half-grabens filled by more than 5 km of Quaternary deposits. The stratigraphic signature of these tectonic events corresponds to a Lower Pleistocene marine unconformity-bounded unit overlain by Middle Pleistocene rocks belonging to a transgressive-regressive cycle. A crustal section of the Campania margin displays an asymmetric linked fault system characterized by a 10–12 km-deep main detachment level, listric normal faults and rollover anticlines. Structural and stratigraphic data document that the inception of volcanic activity at Vesuvius occurred at 400 ka, just after the main extensional event, and the volcano is located at the margin of a rollover anticline." .

The common accepted picture is that since the late 1990s, the increase in anthropogenic radiative forcings has been counterbalanced by other factors, e.g., a decrease in natural forcings, augmented ocean heat storage and negative phases of ocean–atmosphere-coupled oscillation patterns. Here, simple vector autoregressive models are used for forecasting the temperature hiatus in the period 2001–2014. This gives new insight into the problem of understanding the ocean contribution (in terms of heat uptake and atmosphere–ocean-coupled oscillations) to the appearance of this recent hiatus. In particular, considering data about the ocean heat content until a depth of 700 m and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation is necessary for correctly forecasting the hiatus, so catching both trend and interannual variability. Our models also show that the ocean heat uptake is substantially driven by the natural component of the total radiative forcing at a decadal time scale, confining the importance of the anthropogenic influences to a longer range warming of the ocean." .

We named this methodology “the radar polygon method” (RPM). In this approach, gages in the study area compete against each other to gain the grid cells of the radar precipitation field under its territory. The criterion of the competition between the gages is the similarity between the precipitation of the target grid cell and that of the gage location. We tested the applicability of RPM on four watersheds in Korean Peninsula in which 41 rain gage locations, used as the basis of polygon formation, exist. Even though RPM uses only the information regarding the spatial variability of rainfall extracted from the radar rainfall imageries without any geographical information, it obtains the polygon-like (or just polygon) shape of the governing territory for each of the gages in all four study watersheds. The difference between the radar polygon and the corresponding Thiessen polygon was especially notable for the areas where orography significantly affects the spatial variability of rainfall. Furthermore, the spatial variability of elevation within radar polygons was generally smaller than that within Thiessen polygons indicating that Radar polygon captures the topographic impact on rainfall that Thiessen polygon cannot. The major contribution of this study is that it suggested a novel field of using radar rainfall by providing an effective way of areal rainfall estimation which retains the simplicity of Thiessen polygon approach and is not affected by the relatively low accuracy of radar rainfall imagery." .

The majority of the diamonds are non-resorbed octahedral crystals, with moderately aggregated N (IaB < 50%, N < 300 ppm) and δ13C = −5 to −41‰. The diamonds belong to “eclogitic” (90% of the studied samples), “websteritic” (7%) and “peridotitic” (3%) assemblages. The Jericho diamonds differ from the majority of “eclogitic” diamonds worldwide in magnesian compositions of associated minerals and extremely light C isotopic compositions (δ13C = −24 to −41‰). We propose that metasomatism triggered by H2O fluids may have been involved in the diamond formation. Multiple episodes of the metasomatism and associated melt extraction of various ages are evident in Jericho eclogite xenoliths where primary garnet and clinopyroxene have been recrystallized to more magnesian minerals with higher contents of some incompatible trace elements and to hydrous secondary phases. The model is supported by the general similarity of mineral compositions in diamondiferous eclogites to those in diamond inclusions and to secondary magnesian garnet and clinopyroxene in recrystallized barren eclogites. The ultimate products of the metasomatism could be “websteritic” diamond assemblages sourced from magnesian eclogites." .

Four groups of elements are identified according to their mobility: inert (Ga, Ge, and Sr); partially mobilized into the altered rocks (Cs, Rb, Mo, Nb, Cd, and Pb); partially leached during alteration of the host rocks (Cu, Zn, Sn, Ag, and Ni); and transitional (I, Br, As, Sb, Se, and Te). It is shown that the movement of thermal fluids through the host rock alters both. The concentrations of Rb, Cu, Zn, and V in the solution could partly be due to leaching from the host rocks." .

With the incompressible approximation, reformulation of the evolution reveals that it is determined not only by the widely used cross-helicity h mvp=A p⋅v contributed by the vector potential A p of a reference potential field B p, where v is the fluid velocity, but by another cross-helicity h mvo=A o⋅v contributed by the vector potential A o of the open field B o in the region as well. Only under two conditions, (1) A p=A ⊥ (A ⊥ is the transverse component of A o), (2) v z=0 (v z is the longitudinal component of v) or A z=0 (A z is the longitudinal component of A o), can h mvo be merged into h mvp to give the pioneering dH R/dt equation shown in Equation (4) of Berger (1984). Results show that h mvo originates from v⋅∇h o (h o=A o⋅B o is the helicity density of the open field) and should also be considered in dealing with the development of relative helicity in active regions. Finally, the equation to calculate dH R/dt in active regions is synthesized and presented." .

Spectral information extraction from ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion data has great ability to assist geologists in all disciplines to map the distribution and detect the rock units exposed at the earth’s surface. The near coincidence of Earth Observing System (EOS)/Terra and Earth Observing One (EO-1) platforms allows acquiring ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion imagery of the same ground areas, resulting accurate information for geological mapping applications especially in the reconnaissance stages of hydrothermal copper and gold exploration, chromite, magnetite, massive sulfide and uranium ore deposits, mineral components of soils and structural interpretation at both regional and district scales. Shortwave length infrared and thermal infrared bands of ASTER have sufficient spectral resolution to map fundamental absorptions of hydroxyl mineral groups and silica and carbonate minerals for regional mapping purposes. Ferric-iron bearing minerals can be discriminated using six unique wavelength bands of ALI spanning the visible and near infrared. Hyperion visible and near infrared bands (0.4 to 1.0 μm) and shortwave infrared bands (0.9 to 2.5 μm) allowed to produce image maps of iron oxide minerals, hydroxyl-bearing minerals, sulfates and carbonates in association with hydrothermal alteration assemblages, respectively. The techniques and achievements reviewed in the present paper can further introduce the efficacy of ASTER, ALI, and Hyperion data for future mineral and lithological mapping and exploration of the porphyry copper, epithermal gold, chromite, magnetite, massive sulfide and uranium ore deposits especially in arid and semi-arid territory." .

Despite this, human dimensions work is in its infancy in mountain regions where we have limited understanding of who is vulnerable (or adaptable), to what stresses, and why. This study develops a baseline understanding of vulnerability to climate-related hydrological changes in the mountainous Khumbu region of eastern Nepal. Using a vulnerability approach, 80 interviews combining fixed and open-ended questions were conducted in four communities representing the geographic and livelihood variability of the region. The study identifies four region-wide vulnerabilities currently affecting residents: reduced water access for household uses, declining crop yields, reduced water access for meeting the high water demands of tourists, and reduced hydro-electricity generation. These vulnerabilities are widespread among the population but arrange spatially as a function of varying exposure-sensitivity to hydrological change, livelihood opportunities, and access to foreign financial assistance. Our findings indicate that precipitation change (not glacial change) is the greatest biophysical driver of vulnerability." .

Flood-risk rainfall is defined as rainfall with a high spatial average and encompasses rainfall which might lead to flash floods. We aim to compare eight multivariate density models for multi-site flood-risk rainfall. In particular, an accurate characterization of the spatial variability of flood-risk rainfall is crucial to help understand flash flood processes. Daily data from eight rain gauge stations at the Gardon at Anduze, a small Mediterranean catchment, are used in this work. Each multivariate density model is made of a combination of a marginal model and a dependence structure. Two marginal models are considered: the Gamma distribution (parametric) and the Log-Normal mixture (non-parametric). Four dependence structures are included in the comparison: Gaussian, Student t, Skew Normal and Skew t in increasing order of complexity. They possess a representative set of theoretical properties (symmetry/asymmetry and asymptotic dependence/independence). The multivariate models are compared in terms of three types of criteria: (1) separate evaluation of the goodness-of-fit of the margins and of the dependence structures, (2) model selection with a leave-one-out evaluation of the Anderson-Darling and Cramer-Von Mises statistics and (3) comparison in terms of two hydrologically interpretable quantities (return periods of the spatial average and conditional probabilities of exceedances). The key outcome of the comparison is that the Skew Normal with the Log-Normal mixture margins outperform significantly the other models. The asymmetry introduced by the Skew Normal is an added-value with respect to the Gaussian. Therefore, the Gaussian dependence structure, although widely used in the literature, is not recommended for the data in this study. In contrast, the asymptotically dependent models did not provide a significant improvement over the asymptotically independent ones." .

To clarify the formation of curvature of the zonal structures in the west of the convex form and further to discuss the tectonic evolution of central Honshu, we carried out a paleomagnetic study of dated (∼15 Ma) dike rocks of the Shitara basin. Samples were collected from 25 basalt dikes trending north-south with a nearly vertical intrusion surface. After stepwise alternating-field and thermal demagnetization, 24 site-mean directions were determined. Three dikes gave anomalous directions, probably resulting from instantaneous recording of a field transition or excursion. The other 21 site-means produced a mean direction, D = 9.7°, I = 54.5°, α95 = 5.2°, and a paleomagnetic pole at 82.3°N, 216.6°E, A95 = 6.2°. Although the reversal test is negative at the 5% significance level, the mean direction and pole are time-averaged ones in which the secular variation is averaged out. This was confirmed by studying the angular standard deviation of virtual geomagnetic poles. We conclude that the central Honshu curvature formed when the southwest Japan arc rotated clockwise between 17 and 15 Ma in relation to the opening of the Japan Sea, associated with differential rotation of the eastern part of the arc with respect to the central part. The differential rotation probably resulted from a sinistral shear on the eastern margin of the rotating arc. The formation of the curvature seems not to have borne on the collision of the Izu-Ogasawara arc with Honshu, although the collision probably caused large-scale clockwise rotation of the Kanto Mountains in the east of the northward-convex structure." .

The whole core indicated seven cold phases and eight warm phases. Obvious expression of low temperature event during Middle and Late Holocene, YD, H1, H2, H3 and H4 events, as well as the short cold phase during the middle last glacial period, implied that short shifts since SO kaBP would have been global significance. Sedimentation rate during cold phases is usually faster than that in warm stages, with the lowest rate in Holocene, which may be connected with rising sea level and principal axial of Kuroshio Current moving to west. Volcanic activities highly developed in Okinawa Trough during the Quaternary period, thus abundant volcanic glass and pumice were well preserved." .

Previous observations indicated that both current velocity and rock size were important determinants of the egg mass distribution of certain hydrobiosid caddis flies that lay their eggs in single masses beneath emergent rocks. These observations were tested experimentally in a temperate, upland Australian stream. Manipulations of current speed confirmed that females of Ulmerochorema sp. and the Taschorema complex deposited more eggs on rocks in elevated current speeds (>0.40 ms−1) whereas Apsilochorema sp. deposited more eggs on rocks in slow currents (<0.30 ms−1). This latter result did not coincide with previous observational data. The anomaly between observational and experimental data, however, was reconciled by the outcome of a further experiment that tested the influence of the emergent or 'landing pad' size of rocks as the abundance of Apsilochorema egg masses increased with landing pad size independent of the prevailing flow conditions. Landing pad size did not influence the abundance of egg masses of Taschorema or Ulmerochorema. Patterns of female visits to rocks indicated that taxa might distinguish between favoured egg-laying sites prior to landing on rocks. Large aggregations of adult male and female Ulmerochorema collected from rocks favoured for oviposition provide indirect evidence for mating induced swarming behaviour associated with oviposition site selection. This study provides a framework for more sophisticated questions relating to the influence of oviposition site selection on structuring populations of lotic macroinvertebrates." .

The velocity of sedimental cover is larger in hills of western Hubei in the western profiles, the total thickness is about 0–0.3 km. However, it becomes thick in southern part of Zigui basin and Zushui river valley, about 5.0 km and 4.0 km thick respectively. The sedimental cover is very thick in Jianghan plains in the eastern profiles, about 5–8 km, and the velocity is lower. The velocity of basemental plane is greater than 6.0 km/s over the whole region. An interface can be divided within the sedimental layer, it is about 3–4 km deep in Jianghan plains, while it approximates to surface in other regions. The profiles are cut by faults in many positions. Where the faults pass, the velocity isopleth varies sharply, and the velocity is obviously low. The basement layer is characterized by high velocity and low gradient, there exist 3 high-velocity anomalous zones within the layer, which are located at the west, south and east of Huangling Anticlinorium respectively. They are the upwelling materials of basalt magma with high velocity from deep crust. Perhaps, this process took place before formation of Huangling Anticlinorium. Its action produces the significant variation of basement plane depth and the correspondent development and action of faults." .

Ruapehu, in the central North Island of New Zealand, is one of the most lahar-prone volcanoes in the world. Since historic observations began in 1861 AD, more than 50 individual lahars have been recorded in the Whangaehu valley alone, the natural outlet to the summit Crater Lake. These lahars have been triggered by a variety of mechanisms, including explosive eruptions that displaced Crater Lake water over the outlet or ejected it onto the snow-clad summit area of the volcano; rain-remobilisation of tephra deposits on steep slopes; displacement over the outlet as a result of syn-eruptive changes in lake bathymetry; and lake break-outs from Crater Lake following impoundment of excess water behind temporary barriers of tephra and/or ice emplaced over the outlet. However, only 9 lahar deposits can be distinguished in the upper Whangaehu valley on sedimentological, stratigraphic, geomorphic and petrological grounds, and these are skewed towards either the largest or the most recent flows. In some cases magnitude can be reconstructed from deposit geometry, with the largest lahars producing the highest level terraces, the coarsest deposits, and crossing drainage divides into normally inactive channels. This under-representation of historic events reflects the low preservation potential of unconsolidated deposits in a steep alpine environment, and the overprinting and recycling effect of large magnitude lahars that rework material down to bedrock and effectively reset the stratigraphic record. Development of magnitude-frequency relationships for Ruapehu lahars therefore requires the identification of lahar deposits in proximal, medial and distal settings in order to ensure that the full range of events is represented." .

They range from Pleistocene to Holocene in age and exhibit a variable degree of erosion by the sea. Fundamental differences, irrespective of age, exist between two types: Type I cones have diameters of 1–1.5 km, rim heights of about 200 m and steep (27°) outer slopes. Deposits are plastered against nearby cliffs. Beds are thin, including layers of accretionary lapilli and less than 10 % lithic clasts. Numerous bomb sags, soft sediment deformation structures and gravity slides occur. On one of these cones mudflows formed small tunnels which resemble lava tubes, associated with channels sometimes having oversteepened walls. These cones reflect comparatively low energy conditions and probably resulted from extremely wet surges interspersed with mudflows and ballistic falls. Type II cones have smaller diameters (∼0.5 km) but widespread fallout/surge aprons. Rim heights are about 100 m and average slope angles are 18°. Bedding is massive with variable lapilli/matrix ratio and more than 10 % lithic clasts without bomb sags. These cones formed under drier, perhaps hotter and more violently explosive conditions than Type I, though not as energetic as the phreatomagmatic eruptions of terrestrial tuff rings. The two types of surtseyan eruptions are explained by invoking not only different water/magma ratios in the conduit but also different mechanisms of water/magma interaction. The slurry model of Kokelaar is favoured for Type I and a fuel-coolant model for Type II. The decisive factor is considered to be rate of effusion, with rim closure and exclusion of sea water playing a secondary role." .

It is suggested that the Moon may have fissioned from Mercury more than 4.4 billion years ago and may have been captured by the Earth no later than 3.2 billion years ago. A model for the origin of the Earth-Moon system that has been gaining favor recently visualizes a Marssize body impacting Earth and excavating enough material from the Earth to form the Moon (Newsome &Taylor, 1989). This giant impact not only would have sterilized the planet (Maher &Stevenson, 1988), obliterating any form of life that might have existed at the time, but also would have blown off the Earth's atmosphere (Kaula, 1990). As the story goes, Venus suffered no giant impact and conserved its CO2 atmosphere, whereas the loss of her CO2 atmosphere cooled the Earth's surface allowing the oceans to rain out (Kaula, 1990). It is widely believed that the different histories in the early evolution of their atmospheres set markedly different courses for the subsequent evolution of the two planets. I agree with this conclusion but disagree with the cause for the difference. If the giant impact really happened, it must have taken place not only after the Earth's accumulation was practically completed but also after a substantial core had formed (to account for the lesser density of the Moon). Venus has approximately 89 kg/cm2 of CO2 for a total of 4.11020kg. The Earth with a mass 1.226 greater than Venus, should have had 5.01020 kg of CO2. If entirely precipitated as carbonate, the Earth should now have 1.11021 kg of carbonate. A recent estimate (Hay, 1985) gives the total volume of carbonate rock on Earth as 276.1106 km3 which, for an average density of 2.83, corresponds to a mass of 7.81020 kg. This figure and the ratio limestone/shale/sandstone of 15/74/11 (Garrels &Mackenzie, 1971) leads to the carbonate inventory shown in Table 1." .

Rainfall is one such parameter governing the hydrological processes crucial to agriculture planning, afforestation and eco-system management. Therefore, it is essential to understand rainfall distribution and its variation in relevance to such activities. The present study is an attempt to gain in-depth understanding in this direction. The study area comprises of one coastal district and its adjoining areas in Karnataka State. Mean annual rainfall data of 93 rain gauge stations distributed over the study area for a period of 10–50 years are used for the study. In order to assess the variation of rainfall across the ghats, several bands were constructed parallel to the latitudes to facilitate the analysis. The statistical analyses conducted included cluster analysis and analysis of variance. The study revealed that there exist three distinct zones of rainfall regimes in the study area, namely, Coastal zone, Transition zone and Malanad zone. It is observed that, the maximum rainfall occurs on the windward side ahead of the geographical peak. Further, mean monthly rainfall distribution over the zones has been depicted to enable agricultural planning in the study area." .

This problem is tackled by spectral methods applied to a type of diffusion equation of groundwater flow, together with suitable coordinate transformations. Analytical (exact) solutions in terms of elementary functions are presented for one- and three-dimensional finite and infinite domains. Stability criteria are obtained for the solutions, in terms of a critical parameter, that turns out to involve the product of correlation scale and trend gradient. For the case of finite and symmetrical domains, additional provisions to insure the stability of numerical calculations of effective hydraulic conductivity are provided. Effective hydraulic conductivity is an important property, with potential applications in the calibrations of groundwater and transport numerical models." .

To investigate the impact of the orography and especially of the rifts, the regional climate model CCLM is used, covering the EARS with Lake Victoria in the centre of the model domain. CCLM is driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and applied with a double-nesting method resulting in a very high spatial resolution of 7 km. The resolution clearly shows the shoulders and rifts of the western and eastern branch of the EARS and the Rwenzoris within the western branch. To analyse the orographic influence on climate, a new technique of modifying the orography is used in this sensitivity study. The shoulders of the branches are lowered and the rifts are elevated, resulting in a smoothed orography structure with less altitude difference between the shoulders and rifts. The changes in 2 m-temperature are very local and associated with the changes in the orography. The vertically integrated moisture transport is characterised by less vortices, and its zonal component is increased over the branches. The resulting amount of precipitation is mainly decreased west of the western branch and increased in the rift of the western branch. In the eastern branch, however, the changes in the amount of precipitation are not significant. The changes in the precipitation and temperature patterns lead to a shift of biomes towards a vegetation coverage characterised by more humid conditions in the northern part of the model domain and more arid conditions in the South. Thus, the aridification found in the proxy data can be attributed to the orographic changes of the rifts only in the northern model domain." .

Cross-sections were sampled at multiple heights from 20 scarred shoots, 20 apparently intact shoots, along with cores taken from 20 reference trees outside the fire area. Thin sections were prepared from uphill and downhill locations on the circumference for up to 5 years preceding and following the event year. The thin sections were visually observed in order to identify a response to the known fire event preserved in the wood anatomical structure. Anatomical features were observed at the uphill and downhill locations on both scarred and intact (unscarred) cross-sections, and they occurred in a subset of the observed samples. The features observed in both scarred and intact cross-sections were an apparent increase in vessel density and a decrease in lumen area of the second row of earlywood vessels, along with tyloses formation in the first row of earlywood vessels. Furthermore, the scarred region exhibited a zone of delayed cambial death following the fire, and the onset of woundwood was often initiated later in the season or the following year. Using the type of features and their location around the circumference, we inferred that the observed features may have formed in response to local heating of the cambium, and likely formed in response to canopy damage." .

When the content of Lu is less, only X-ray diffractions (XRD) due to [Ni4Al(OH)10]NO3 are found. When the content is 2.89 wt% or more in the product, a series of low-intensity diffractions is identified, which can be indexed with a triclinic cell, space group P1¯ $$ P\\overline{1} $$. After the modification, the a lattice parameter for Ni-Al layered double hydroxide does not show any considerable changes, which means Lu3+ could not be incorporated into M(OH)2 (M=Ni, Al) layers because of its larger ion radius (85 pm). According to the observations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with low Lu content, single nanorods appear among the disks of [Ni4Al(OH)10]NO3 and turn into bundles with high Lu content. The modification of Lu prevents the structural transformation of the Ni-Al LDH into β-Ni(OH)2. It can be found that the transformation is stopped by 0.9 wt% Lu when being soaked in 7.0 mol L−1 potassium hydroxide (KOH) for 72 days at 60 °C, or by 1.29 wt% Lu after the 25th charging/discharging cycle at 60 °C in the same alkali solution. The modification also improves the high-temperature performances of the electrode.

IfC/MR 2 exceeds 0.400, the inferred density of the upper mantle must be greater than that of the lower mantle at similar conditions by at least 0.1 g cm−3 for any of the temperature profiles proposed for the lunar interior. The average mantle density lies between 3.4 and 3.5 g cm−3, though the density of the upper mantle may be greater. The suggested density inversion is gravitationally unstable, but the implied deviatoric stresses in the mantle need be no larger than those associated with lunar gravity anomalies. UsingC/MR 3=0.400 and the recent seismic evidence suggesting a thin, high density zone beneath the crust and a partially molten ‘core’, successful density models can be found for a range of temperature profiles. Temperature distributions as cool as several inferred from the lunar electrical conductivity profile would be excluded.

Through the calculations of equations from the companion paper, parameters representing land surface heterogeneity and suitable for the coupling models were found out. Three cases were simulated for heavy rainfalls during 36 hours, and the sensitivity of short—term weather modeling to the land surface heterogeneity was tested. Through the analysis of the simulations of the three heavy rainfalls, it was demonstrated that BIZ, compared with BOZ, could more realistically reflect the features of the land surface heterogeneity, therefore could more realistically reproduce the circulation and precipitation amount in the heavy rainfall processes of the three cases. This shows that even short—term weather is sensitive to the land surface heterogeneity, which is more obvious with time passing, and whose influence is more pronounced in the lower layer and gradually extends to the middle and upper layer. Through the analysis of these simulations with BIZ, it is suggested that the bulk effect of smaller—scale fluxes (i.e., the momentum, water vapor and sensible heat fluxes) near the significantly-heterogeneous land surface is to change the larger—scale (i.e., meso—scale) circulation, and then to influence the development of the low—level jets and precipitation. And also, the complexity of the land—atmosphere interaction was shown in these simulations." .

The mean CO2 flux calculated by sequential Gaussian simulation from the lake was 1,190 (March 2007), 730 (December 2007) and 1,134 g m−2 day−1 (April 2008) with total emission rates of 164 ± 9.5 (March 2007), 59 ± 2.5 (December 2007) and 109 ± 6.6 t day−1 (April 2008). The mean CO2 flux estimated from the entire crater floor area was 1,102 g m−2 day−1 for April 2008 with a total emission rate of 144 ± 5.9 t day−1. Significant change in CO2 flux was not detected during the period of survey, and the mapping of the CO2 flux highlighted lineaments reflecting the main local and regional tectonic patterns. The 3He/4He ratio (as high as 8.1 R A) for gases in the El Chichón crater is generally higher than those observed at the neighbouring Transmexican Volcanic Belt and the Central American Volcanic Arc. The CO2/3He ratios for the high 3He/4He gases tend to have the MORB-like values (1.41 × 109), and the CO2/3He ratios for the lower 3He/4He gases fall within the range for the arc-type gases. The high 3He/4He ratios, the MORB-like CO2/3He ratios for the high 3He/4He gases and high proportion of MORB-CO2 (M = 25 ±15%) at El Chichón indicate a greater depth for the generation of magma when compared to typical arc volcanoes." .

Subglacial eruptions represent a significant portion of the late Quaternary volcanic budget in Iceland. Individual features can have volumes up to ∼48 km3 and appear to be monogenetic. Subaqueous to subaerial transition zones provide minimum estimates of ice sheet thickness at the time of eruption, although water-magma interactions and fluctuating lake levels during eruption can lead to complex lithological sequences. New major and trace element data for 36 glacial and postglacial eruptive units, combined with observations of lava surface quality, passage zone heights, and 3He exposure ages of some glacial units, indicate a maximum in volcanic production in the WVZ during the last major ice retreat. Anomalously high volcanic production rates continue into the early postglacial period and coincide with significant incompatible element depletions and slightly higher CaO and SiO2 and lower FeO content at a given MgO. Subglacial units with strong incompatible element depletions also have lava surfaces that lack evidence of subsequent glaciation. These units likely formed after the onset of deglaciation, when rapidly melting ice sheets increased decompression rates in the underlying mantle, leading to anomalously high melting rates in the depleted upper mantle. This process also can explain the eruption of extremely depleted picritic lavas during the early postglacial period. These new observations indicate that the increased volcanic activity associated with glacial unloading peaked earlier than previously thought, before Iceland was completely ice free." .

Annual ring-width variations were similar among the three sites but variability was greatest at the low-forest border site. The statistical characters of the chronologies showed that mean sensitivity (MS) and standard deviation (SD) decreased with increasing elevation. In other words, the response of tree growth to environmental changes decreased with increasing altitude. To understand the differing response of trees at different elevations to the environmental changes, response function analysis was used to study the relationships between tree-ring widths and mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation from 1961 to 2000. The results showed that precipitation was the most important factor limiting tree radial growth in the arid central Tianshan Mountains, precipitation in August of the prior growth year played an important role on tree's radial growth across the entire altitudinal gradient even at the cold, high-elevation treeline site. It is expected that with increasing altitude air temperature decreased and precipitation increased, the importance of precipitation on tree growth decreased, and the response of tree growth to environmental changes decreased, too. This conclusion may be helpful to understand and research the relationship between climatic change and tree growth in arid and semiarid area." .

Data were collected from an inland chaparral site at 1,300 m elevation, 75 km from the coast. The annual depositions of NO-3−N and NH+4−N amounted to 96.3 and 56.0 mg m-2 ground area yr-1, respectively. The corresponding values for calcium and magnesium ions were 207.4 and 57.4 mg m-2 yr-1. The average pH of rainwater was 3.74 (range 3.37 to 4.75), thus documenting acid rain for an inland site in California, distant from urban sources of air contamination. An estimate of nitrogen gains and losses indicated that the time between recurrent chaparral fires should be about 60 years in order to maintain a balanced nitrogen budget." .

The researches of concern are glacial-variation studies, mainly of the 1970s, and tree-ring density analyses of the subalpine zone of the late 1970s, reported in 1982. The results indicate that, after a warm and dry epoch ending about 1800 or 1700, a cold period set in in the Alps, lasting to about 1470 BC. (All dates below are BC unless otherwise stated; datings determined by radiocarbon analyses are subject to a maximum possible error of + or − 100 yrs.) This cold phase was followed by an approximately 70 yrs long warm phase. But the most pronounced change occurred about 1400, when rather abruptly a second cold phase was ushered in, continuing until about 1230. This second cold phase is often referred to under the name ‘Löbben Phase’, which is considered to have been the coldest and longest-sustained cold period of the past 8000 yrs, colder than the recent Little Ice Age of the CE (= Christian Era). Its temperature level is estimated (by G. Patzelt) to have been 0.7 to 1 °C colder than the present level in the Alps. The rise of level of the Swiss lakes, including Lake Constance testify that the Löbben Phase was associated with an enhanced rainfall. In the 13th and the beginning of the 12th centuries major and violent migrations took place from central Europe, including Hungary, and the southeast of the continent toward the south and the southeast, including the Near East as far as the Nile Delta. In order to elucidate if the cold-wet phases of the Alps were cold-wet in central Europe, we have carried out air temperature correlations between an Alpine station Säntis (2500 m MSL) and Budapest, for 1921–70. The correlation coefficient is 0.70 for the annual temperatures and 0.82 for July–September of the same years. Since glaciers grow in cold-wet summers, the high correlation for the summer months means that central Europe must have been cold in most of the cold summers of the Alps. But, cold, and especially cold-wet summers are detrimental to agriculture. Presumably, partial or total crop failures must have been relatively frequent in central Europe forcing the people to take to migration. Archeological evidence from Hungary indicates that there were hardly any settlements left, compared with the previous centuries. Finally, we quote evidence to show that some of the groups of the Sea Peoples, who tried to invade the Nile Delta about 1190, were of European origin. They abandoned their ‘homeland’, presumably because of a turn of the climate to cooler and wetter conditions. It is noted that our interpretation of the causes of migrations of the 13th century and beginning of the 12th, is different from that put forward by Weiss (1982)." .

Also, strontium isotopes, and to a minor degree Fe, follow this trend. The main carriers of the magnetic susceptibility appear to be diagenetic Fe-carbonates, i.e., siderite, ferroan dolomite, and ankerite, which occur as cements in primary and secondary voids, as well as in fractures. In some layers, especially at the top of the succession there occurs additionally secondary Fe-chlorite and pyrite. The Fe-carbonates were formed during upward migration of a reducing, iron-bearing, petroliferous fluid that was depleted in 13C and carried radiogenic Sr. Similar geochemical covariance and/or correlations can be expected in other sedimentary successions affected by the migration of petroliferous formation fluids." .

They consist of varying amounts of olivine, melilite, phlogopite, nepheline, titanomagnetite and perovskite as major phases, accompanied by minor amounts of apatite, carbonate, spinel, glass and, rarely, monticellite. The rocks are mineralogically and geochemically broadly similar to olivine melilitites, differing in higher CO2 and modal phlogopite and carbonate contents. The ultramafic lamprophyres are MgO-rich (13.4–20.5 wt%) and SiO2-poor (32.8–37.2 wt%), indicative of a near-primary nature. Major and trace element features are consistent with minor fractionation of olivine and Cr-spinel from melts originating at depths of 130–140 km. Primary melts originated by melting of upper mantle peridotite which had been veined by phlogopite + carbonate + clinopyroxene-bearing assemblages less than 200 Ma before eruption. The presence of the veins and their time of formation is required to explain high incompatible trace element contents and growth of 87Sr/86Sr, leaving 143Nd/144Nd unaffected. The major element, compatible trace element, and most radiogenic isotope characteristics are derived from melting of the wall-rock peridotite. The depth of about 130 km is indicated by the presence of phlogopite rather than amphibole in the veins, by control of the REE pattern by residual garnet, by the high MgO content of the rocks, and by the expected intersection of the rift-flank geotherm with the solidus at this depth. The higher CO2 contents than are characteristic for olivine melilitites favoured the crystallization of melilite at crustal pressures, and suppressed the crystallization of clinopyroxene. The Beaver Lake ultramafic lamprophyres are a distal effect of the breakup of Gondwanaland, too distal to show a geochemical signature of the Kerguelen plume. Upward and outward movement of the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary beneath the Lambert-Amery rift led first to the production of phlogopite- and carbonate-rich veins, and later to the generation of the ultramafic lamprophyres themselves." .

The study area was the whole northern side of the Northern Apennines (latitude 44° N), including a timberline. The pattern was described on a scale of 1:25,000, using digitized phytosociological vegetation maps. The timberline elevation ranges from 1,200 to 1,825 m a.s.l., with the highest range at 1,525 to 1,725 m and a peak (13%) at 1,600–1,625 m. As suggested by the known beech thermal requirements, the following thermal parameters were considered: mean annual temperature, mean of the coldest month (January), mean of the warmest month (July); days with maximum temperatures >10°C and summer mean (June to September). The values were calculated using data for 1951–2002 from six weather stations. The present upper timberline (1,825 m) corresponds to the following: i) mean annual temperature of 4.5°C; ii) coldest month mean temperature of −2.3°C; iii) summer mean of 11.5°C; iv) warmest month mean temperature of 13°C; v) 139 days with maximum temperatures of 10°C or higher. The mean temperature of the warmest month corresponds to the July mean temperature in maritime mountains, such as the Appalachians and the New Zealand Alps (13°C). The geographical location of the Northern Apennines close to the Mediterranean Sea seems to indicate that such a conclusion is reliable. With reference to the elevation variability of the upper timberline, the multiple regression shows that the annual mean is the best explaining thermal parameter (P < 0.05). Our thermal data do not take into account the atmospheric phenomena that can affect the temperature lapse rate with altitude, such as the cloudiness of the chain, and site factors, such as wind-exposed topography and snow cover duration, which play a crucial role in the Northern Apennine local climate." .

This investigation reveals that its tectonic setting is similar to that of lamproites and orangeites (Group II kimberlite of southern Africa) and not that of a typical kimberlite. The petrography and mineralogy are comparable to lamproite and to some extent to orangeite, whereas the major element geochemistry is more akin to that of kimberlite. Trace element geochemistry is closer to that of lamproite but Nd isotope systematics are atypical of lamproite or orangeite. The inferred petrogenesis of the Majhgawan pipe is also similar to that of other such potassic ‘metasomatised mantle magmas’ without any strong affinity to a particular clan/group. It is demonstrated in this study that the Majhgawan pipe shares the petrological, geochemical and isotope characteristics of all three rock types. It is therefore suggested to constitute a transitional kimberlite–orangeite (Group II kimberlite)–lamproite rock. The existence of such transitional magmas in space and time in other cratons, outside India, is also highlighted. The name majhgawanite is proposed for this rock – keeping in mind the antiquity of the Majhgawan pipe, its intriguing petrological and geochemical characteristics and also on the basis of India’s legacy for introducing diamond to the world – to designate such mafic potassic-ultrapotassic transitional rock types so as to distinguish them from the classical kimberlite, lamproite or orangeite. It is concluded that the correlations between kimberlite petrography, geochemistry and isotopic types (viz., Group I and II), as established for kimberlites in southern Africa, need not be necessarily valid elsewhere. Hence, the recommendations of I.U.G.S. on classification of kimberlite, orangeite and lamproite are clearly inadequate when dealing with the transitional mafic potassic ultrapotassic rocks. It is further stressed that mineralogical, geochemical and isotopic aspects of mafic potassic-ultrapotassic rocks need to be considered in unison before assigning any name as the nomenclature of such exotic and rare alkaline rock types invariably implies economic and tectono-magmatic (regional) significance." .

We concentrate on the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean noting that there exists in this region a well-developed mean ITCZ. Furthermore, it is a region where there has been considerable discussion in the literature of whether easterly waves develop in situ or propagate westwards from the Atlantic Ocean. The region is typical of tropical regions where there is a strong cross-equatorial pressure gradient (CEPG): mean convection well removed from the equator but located equatorward of the maximum sea-surface temperature (SST) and minimum sea level pressure (MSLP). Further to the west, near the dateline where the CEPG is much smaller, convection is weaker and collocated with SST and MSLP extrema. It is argued that in regions of significant CEPG that the near-equatorial tropical system is inertially unstable and that the rectification of the instability for a given CEPG determines the location and intensity of the climatological ITCZ. Using simple theoretical arguments, we develop an expression for the mean latitude of the ITCZ as a function of the CEPG. We note on a day-by-day basis that the ITCZ is highly transient state with variability occurring on 3–8 day time scales. Transients with amplitudes about half of the mean ITCZ, propagate northwards from the near-equatorial southern hemisphere as anomalous meridional oscillations, eventually amplifying convection in the vicinity of the mean ITCZ. It is argued that in these longitudes of strong CEPG the mean ITCZ is continually inertially unstable with advections of anticylonic vorticity across the equator resulting in the creation of an oscillating divergence–convergence doublet. The low-level convergence produces convection and the resultant vortex tube stretching generates cyclonic vorticity which counteracts the northward advection of anticylonic vorticity. During a cycle, the mid-troposphere heating near 10ºN oscillates between 6 and 12 K/day at the inertial frequency of the latitude of the mean convection. As a result, there exists an anomalous and shallower, oscillating meridional circulation with a magnitude about 50% of the mean ITCZ associated with the stable state following the generation of anticylonic vorticity. Further, it is argued that the instabilities of the ITCZ are directly associated with in situ development of easterly waves which occur with the inertial period of the latitude of the mean ITCZ. The dynamical sequences and the genesis of easterly waves are absent in the regions further to the east where the CEPG is much weaker or absent altogether. In a companion study (Part II), numerical experiments are conducted to test the hypothesis raised in the present study." .

The catchment area is around 1495 km2 and it is located in the Pampean Plains. It was reduced to 678 km2 by the construction of the San Urbano channel in 1941 and reconditioned in 1977, which was built to avoid floods. The floods are related to some El Niño episodes, with high precipitation events. The lake has been previously studied from different approaches, mainly to understand hydrological and climatic variations, but more multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand its complex hydrological situation. Here we present the first paleomagnetic and rock magnetic studies made on a short sediment core collected from the lake in order to contribute to identifying paleoclimatic proxies and to present the first paleomagnetic results for the site. Rock magnetic analyses suggest that the well-preserved magnetic mineralogy is dominated by pseudo single-domain (titano)magnetite and/or maghemite. The results also indicate that a stable characteristic remanent magnetisation can be isolated and thus the directions of the geomagnetic field may be obtained, providing evidence for the use of this lake for paleomagnetic and paleoenvironmental studies. Changes in magnetic grain size and concentration of magnetic minerals suggest environmental variations and changes in the lake level, which are consistent with historical reports. The paleomagnetic results agree well with Cals3k.3 model for inclination and declination of the geomagnetic field except for the dry period probably due to the fact that the core was extracted near the shore." .

The simulation takes into consideration both primary deposition of the volcanic products and their secondary redistribution by geomorphic processes of erosion, transport, and redeposition. We hypothesize that the pre-eruption topography controlled both the intial volcanic deposition of PDCs and the subsequent processes redistributing material of the pumice fallout and PDC deposits, and thus significantly controlled the thickness of the final volcaniclastic deposits. The methodology applied is based on a reconstructed pre-AD 79 digital elevation model of the Sarno River plain, an extensive tephrostratigraphic dataset from about 1,200 core drillings and a predictive modeling technique. The two models produce contrasting spatial distribution patterns for both the AD 79 deposits from fallout plus their derivates, versus from PDCs and their derivatives. The contrast allows determination of the most important factors controlling the thickness of the AD 79 volcaniclastic deposits. This provides new insights into the process dynamics during and immediately after the AD 79 Plinian eruption including primary deposition, erosion, and redistribution." .

The samples have been dredged from the Vavilov (−1375 m water depth) and Ventotene seamounts (−2125 m water depth). The sponge-bearing strata correspond to the nannoplankton zone 21 (Emiliania huxleyi zone: Upper Pleistocene—Holocene). Various pathsways in the diagenetic alteration of the siliceous skeleton can be observed: In all cases the diagenetic history starts with sediment infill and lithification with high Mg-calcite (HMC) in the space between the spicules, where organic matter of the living sponge previously was present. In some cases the axial canal may be cemented by micritic HMC as well. The next stage is characterized by silica dissolution leading to moldic porosity. These molds may (1) remain open or (2) exhibit various kinds of manganese infillings and coatings. (3) The most conspicuous diagenetic stage is characterized by HMC cements growing within these molds. These submarine cements exhibit in some cases morphologies, predominantly known from the meteoric diagnetic environment. This HMC cement occurs also in molds with thin Mn-coatings outlining the former morphology of the spicules, as well as in molds where the axial canal has been filled by micritic HMC cement." .

In this paper, we focus on the chemical stratigraphy of the pre-intrusion crust, which can be inferred from the compositions of crustal-contaminated mafic plutonic rocks, restitic crustal material incorporated by the complex, and granitic rocks crystallized from anatectic melts. These data sources independently indicate that the crust was compositionally stratified prior to the intrusion of an 8-km-thick gabbroic to dioritic body known as the Mafic Complex, with mica and K-feldspar abundance decreasing with depth and increasing metamorphic grade. Reconsideration of published zircon age data suggest that the igneous evolution initiated with sporadic pulses at around 295 Ma, when mafic sills intruded deep granulites which provided a minor amount of depleted crustal contaminant, very poor in LIL elements. With accelerated rates of the intrusion, between 292 and 286 m.y, mafic magmas invaded significantly more fertile, amphibolite-facies paragneisses, resulting in increased contamination and generating hybrid rocks with distinct chemistry. At this point, increased anatexis produced a large amount of silicic hybrid melts that fed the incremental growth of upper-crustal plutons and volcanic activity, while the disaggregated restite was largely assimilated once ingested by the growing Mafic Complex. This “igneous climax” was coincident with an increasing rate of intrusion, when the upper Mafic Complex began growing according to the “gabbro glacier” model and, at about the same time, volcanic activity initiated. Cooling lasted millions of years. In the coupled magmatic evolution of the deep and upper crust, the Mafic Complex should be considered more as a large reservoir of heat rather than a source of upper-crustal magma, while the fertility of “under/intra-plated” crust plays a crucial role in governing the generation of large volumes of continental silicic magmas." .

Both datasets show similar interannual variability patterns in relation with known climate modes and reasonable phase agreement in key regions. Due to the scarcity of the observational dataset, we then largely rely on the model to describe the interannual MLD variations in more detail. MLD interannual variability is two to four times smaller than the seasonal cycle. A large fraction of MLD interannual variations is linked to large-scale climate modes, with the exception of coastal and subtropical regions where interannual signature of small-scale structures dominates. The Indian Ocean Dipole is responsible for most variations in the 10°N–10°S band, with positive phases being associated with a shallow MLD in the equatorial and south-eastern Indian Ocean and a deepening in the south-central Indian Ocean. The El Niño signature is rather weak, with moderate MLD shoaling in autumn in the eastern Arabian Sea. Stronger than usual monsoon jets are only associated with a very modest MLD deepening in the southern Arabian Sea in summer. Finally, positive Indian Ocean Subtropical Dipoles are associated with a MLD deepening between 15 and 30°S. Buoyancy fluxes generally appear to dominate MLD interannual variations except for IOD-induced signals in the south-central Indian Ocean in autumn, where wind stirring and Ekman pumping dominate." .

The Pb isotope ratios are also slightly lower in the absarokites than in the banakites (18.71 < 206Pb/204Pb < 18.77, 15.62 < 207Pb/204Pb < 15.63, 38.85 < 208Pb/204Pb < 38.91, and 18.77 < 206Pb/204Pb < 18.84, 15.62 < 207Pb/204Pb < 15.64, 38.94 < 208Pb/204Pb < 39.06, respectively). Overall, there is a clear tendency towards higher Sr, Pb and lower Nd isotope ratios with increasing degree of differentiation. This study suggests that the absarokites result from a low degree of partial melting (∼5%) of a highly metasomatized mantle source, which inherited its characteristics from an old subduction setting. The initiation of volcanic activity 1.8 Ma ago results from variations in the lithospheric thermal regime, probably related to lithospheric delamination as proposed for Anatolia (Pearce et al. 1990). The banakites are mainly generated by extensive fractional crystallisation (∼70%) of the absarokitic magma, with a limited amount (a few percents) of assimilation of an old crustal component, in the form of bulk assimilation or AFC processes, which both can explain the Sr, Nd and Pb isotope data." .

Factors such as increased alkalinity, oligotrophy, and reduced allochthonous deposition are of major importance. Thrombolitic microbialites are interpreted as biologically induced and therefore calcified in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding sea water. Corresponding with shallowing upward cycles, microbial mats which produce stromatolitic peloidal crusts become more important. Different biomarkers are introduced for the first time extracted and analyzed from spongiolitic limestones of Lower Kimmeridgian age from Southern Germany." .

Among these trondhjemitic bodies, the Pizzo Bottino trondhjemites form one of the largest, outcropping over about 6 km2 and up to 400 m thick. These rocks display concordant to discordant relationships with associated metamorphic rocks and are often cut by late-Hercynian leucogranitic dykes. The field, petrographic and geochemical features of these trondhjemites are consistent with an igneous origin. Petrographic and geochemical evidences suggest that the trondhjemitic character of the Pizzo Bottino rocks is due to an alkali metasomatism process involving cationic exchange of Na and Ca for K and consequent replacement of K-feldspar by oligoclase in the original granitoids. The major and trace element contents of the Pizzo Bottino trondhjemites are in fact comparable to those of the peraluminous late-Hercynian granitoids from the southern Calabrian-Peloritani Arc (CPA), when the elements directly involved in the alkali metasomatism process (Na, Ca, K, Sr, Ba, Rb) are not considered. The behaviour of REE elements, plus Th and U, also seems to be partially controlled by metasomatic processes, because their abundances vary with the K/Na ratio. Metasomatism seems to be the only viable mechanism involved in the genesis of the Pizzo Bottino trondhjemites. Other trondhjemite generation processes such as fractionation from basaltic parents and partial melting of metabasaltic or metasedimentary sources are ruled out on geological, petrographic and isotopic (Sr, Nd) grounds. Lastly, regional considerations place the metasomatic event during the late Hercynian, after the emplacement of the original granitoids and preceding the intrusion of the leucogranitic dykes, which are not affected by metasomatism." .

For structural investigations the Rietveld method was employed. Thermal expansion has been studied between 25 and 600 °C.

Single-crystals of the HT-polymorph were directly grown from the melt. Structural investigations based on single-crystal diffraction data of the quenched crystals performed at −100 °C showed orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pna21) with a = 12.7560(8) Å, b = 8.6930(4) Å, c = 9.8980(5) Å, V = 1097.57(10) Å3 and Z = 2.

However, in the apatite structure the corresponding three tricapped trigonal prisms are symmetry equivalent. Furthermore, the central fluorine atom of each cluster is coordinated by three next M-neighbors (FM3-triangles), whereas in the HT-polymorph a four-fold coordination is observed (FM4-tetrahedra)." .

The control experiment used pre-industrial greenhouse gas concentrations whereas the 2 × CO2 experiment used doubled CO2 levels. In the control experiment, the MLD simulated in the MRI model was shallower than that in the GFDL model. This resulted in the tropical Pacific’s mean sea surface temperature (SST) increasing at different rates under global warming in the two models. The deeper the mean MLD simulated in the control simulation, the lesser the warming rate of the mean SST simulated in the 2 × CO2 experiment. This demonstrates that the MLD is a key parameter for regulating the response of tropical mean SST to global warming. In particular, in the MRI model, increased stratification associated with global warming amplified wind-driven advection within the mixed layer, leading to greater ENSO variability. On the other hand, in the GFDL model, wind-driven currents were weak, which resulted in mixed-layer dynamics being less sensitive to global warming. The relationship between MLD and ENSO was also examined. Results indicated that the non-linearity between the MLD and ENSO is enhanced from the control run to the 2 × CO2 run in the MRI model, in contrast, the linear relationship between the MLD index and ENSO is unchanged despite an increase in CO2 concentrations in the GFDL model." .

Thermoluminescence (TL) behavior of the sediments has been studied through the measurements of both Natural Thermoluminescence (NTL) and Artificial Thermoluminescence (ATL). Correlation analysis has been carried out among the parameters obtained from both mineral and TL analyses to know the existing interrelations. The obtained correlations are discussed, and it is suggested that the NTL and ATL measurements of the sediments show the valuable information about the sedimentation process. Thus, we conclude that the TL is the easiest tool to find out the sedimentation of the river." .

Four case histories involving different aspects of dereliction and restoration are outlined. The first example considers two old colliery spoil heaps in South Yorkshire, England, which were restored, part of the site being developed for a bakery whilst the rest became a parkland. Such restoration work is essentially a large-scale exercise in earthmoving in order to achieve an acceptable contoured landform. After regrading, installation of drainage and harrowing, the spoil was treated with lime and covered with soil. Fertilizers were applied prior to seeding and planting. The next example describes an abandoned sand and gravel pit in West Yorkshire which was converted to a marina. The old workings were flooded and were separated by two berms into three large ponds. The berms were moved to form a lake with islands. Some regrading of the sides of the lake was necessary which involved cut- and -fill. Access was provided from the lake to an adjacent canal and the site was landscaped. The two remaining examples are from the heavily industrialized district of the Ruhr in Germany. Both were sites of former coal mining and associated industries and were contaminated as well as having old heavy foundation structures in the ground. The site investigations and rehabilitation of both areas are described." .

Lightning flashes have been observed by the lightning Imaging sensor on the board of Tropical Rainfall and Measuring Mission and humidity from modern-era retrospective-analysis for research and applications for the period of 2001–2012. In this study, the role of aerosol in lightning generation over the north-west sector of IGP has been revealed. It is found that lightning activity increases (decreases) with increasing aerosols during normal (deficient) monsoon rainfall years. However, lightning increases with increasing aerosol during deficient rainfall years when the average value of AOD is less than 0.88. We have found that during deficient rainfall years the moisture content of the atmosphere and cloud fraction is smaller than that during the years with normal or excess monsoon rainfall over the north-west IGP. Over the north-east Bay of Bengal and its adjoining region the variations of moisture and cloud fraction between the deficient and normal rainfall years are minimal. We have found that the occurrence of the lightning over this region is primarily due to its topography and localised circulation. The warm-dry air approaching from north-west converges with moist air emanating from the Bay of Bengal causing instability that creates an environment for deep convective cloud and lightning. The relationship between lightning and aerosol is stronger over the north-west sector of IGP than the north-east, whereas it is moderate over the central IGP. We conclude that aerosol is playing a major role in lightning activity over the north-west sector of IGP, but, local meteorological conditions such as convergences of dry and moist air is the principal cause of lightning over the north-east sector of IGP. In addition, atmospheric humidity also plays an important role in regulating the effect of aerosol on the microphysical properties of clouds over IGP region." .

Both discrimination plot and R-mode factor analysis indicate that vertical changes of major elements are mainly controlled by the sedimentation of nearby volcanic matter and the eolian dust input, whereas influences from marine biologic deposition and hydrothermal activity are minor. In particular, Al2O3 and K2O are representative of an eolian dust factor. The variation in the eolian dust factor score is characterized by the obviously glacial-interglacial periodicity and can be well compared with the paleotemperature record of the Antarctic ice core and the evolution of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) recorded in the Chinese loess sequence, and then offers a new proxy for the evolution history of eolian dust input into the study area that is controlled by the EAWM intensity and aridity in the continental source regions of atmospheric dust." .

The pore water profiles for gravity core GeoB 4417-7 showed a distinct sulfate–methane transition zone in which deep sulfate reduction occurs. Only a small sulfide peak could be observed at the reaction zone. Due to high amounts of iron minerals, the produced sulfide is instantaneously precipitated in form of iron sulfides. We present a simulation which starts from a steady state system with respect to pore water profiles for methane and sulfate. Furthermore, sulfide, iron, pH, pE, calcium and total inorganic carbon (TIC) were included in the simulation. The program calculated mineral equilibria to mackinawite, iron sulfides (more stable than mackinawite), iron hydroxides and calcite via saturation indices (SI) by a module incorporating the program PHREEQC (Parkhurst 1995). The measured sulfide and iron profiles are obtained in the simulation output by using a constant SI (=0) for mackinawite and calcite, while a depth dependent SI distribution is applied for the PHREEQC phases “Pyrite” and “Fe(OH)3(a)”, representing a composition and the kinetics of different iron sulfides and iron hydroxides. These SI distributions control the results of sulfide and iron pore water profiles, especially conserving the sulfide profile at the reaction zone during the simulation. The results suggest that phases of iron hydroxides are dissolved, mackinawite is precipitated within, and other iron sulfides are precipitated below the reaction zone. The chemical reactivity of iron hydroxides corresponds to the rate of sulfide production. The system H2O–CO2–CaCO3 is generally successfully maintained during the simulation. Deviations to the measured pH profile suggest that further processes are active which are not included in the simulation yet." .

The specific aim of the present study is to understand the temporal and spatial variations of the major climate variables in the region and discuss its relevance to regional climate variability and changes. In this case, we systematically analyze the major climate variables (maximum and minimum air temperature, relative humidity, and net solar radiation). To evaluate the different characteristics of the climate variables, Mann–Kendall method, two-phase regression scheme, and wavelet transform technique are used; each method has its own strength and weakness, and the results of the three methods complement each other. The results show that the annual and seasonal maximum temperatures are increasing significantly. The annual minimum temperature and minimum temperature in dry seasons are decreasing. The minimum temperature in rainy season is increasing with a smaller rate as compared with the increase of maximum temperature in the season. The difference between maximum and minimum temperature is increasing in all the seasons. Net solar radiation in the region shows a significant increasing trend in all seasons, which corresponds well with the changes of maximum temperature. Besides, significant decreasing trends can be identified for relative humidity in all the seasons." .

In order to investigate the impacts of anthropogenically-induced seasonal vegetation cover changes on regional climate in China, harmonic analysis is applied to 1982–2000 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVVHRR)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (ten day interval data). For two climatic divisions of South China, it is shown that the first harmonic term is in phase with air temperature, while the second and third harmonics are in phase with agricultural cultivation. The Penman-Monteith Equation and the Complementary Relationship Areal Evapotranspiration (CRAE) model suggest that monthly mean evapotranspiration is out of phase with temperature and precipitation in regions with significant second or third harmonics. Finally, seasonal vegetation cover changes associated with agricultural cultivation are identified: for cropped areas, the temperature and precipitation time series have a single maximum value, while the monthly evapotranspiration time series has a bimodal distribution. It is hypothesized that multi-cropping causes the land surface albedo to sharply increase during harvesting, thereby altering the energy distribution ratio and contributing to observed seasonal vegetation cover changes." .

The sulphur isotope patterns vary significantly among the ore horizons. This suggests a long lasting and polyphase mineralisation system. The sulphur isotope composition of barite corresponds to that of Carnian seawater (i.e. 16‰ δ34S). The δ34S values of the iron sulphides correspond to data from sedimentary iron sulphides. Pb and Zn sulphides are characterized by three normally distributed δ34S populations with mean values of −6 to −8‰, −13 to −18‰, and −25 to −29‰. Heavy sulphur (>−10‰ δ34S) indicates contribution of sulphide sulphur from epigenetic-hydrothermal fluids, whereas light sulphide sulphur (<−21‰ δ34S) was produced by sulphur – reducing bacteria. The intermediate population is explained by mixing of sulphur derived from these two sources. Other sources of local importance, however, can not be excluded. The isotope populations correspond only partly to the paragenetic ore stages. The sulphur isotope patterns in the APT deposits are regionally different. Data from other low-temperature sediment-hosted Pb–Zn deposits support the proposed interpretation. A comparison demonstrates that the sulphur isotope patterns of APT deposits correspond to patterns of the Irish type deposits, but are different to those of Mississippi Valley type deposits." .

However, an important concern will be raised over the uncertainty associated with watershed subdivision broadly applied in distributed/semi-distributed hydrological models since scale issues would significantly affect model performance, and thus, lead to dramatic variations in simulations. To fully understand the uncertainty associated with watershed subdivision level, however, is still a tough work confronting researchers because of complex modeling processes and high computation requirements. In this study, we analyzed this uncertainty within a formal Bayesian framework using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. In a case study using the semi-distributed land use-based runoff processes hydrologic model in the Xiangxi River watershed, results showed that the variation in the simulated discharges due to parameter uncertainty was much smaller than that due to parameter and model uncertainty under different watershed subdivision levels defined using aggregated simulation areas (ASAs). However, the posterior probability distribution of model parameters varied in response to subdivision levels, and four parameters (i.e. maximum infiltration rate, retention constant for slow store, maximum capacity for slow store, and retention constant for fast store) were identified with smaller uncertainty. Although the uncertainty in the simulated discharge due to parameter and model uncertainty varied little across subdivisions, the simulation uncertainty only due to parameter uncertainty was found to be reduced through increasing the subdivisions. In addition, the coarsest subdivision level (7 ASAs) was not sufficient for obtaining satisfying simulations in the Xiangxi River watershed, but inappreciable improvement was achieved through increasing the level among finer subdivisions. Moreover, it was demonstrated that increasing subdivision level would have no advantage of improving the reliability of hydrological simulations beyond the threshold (45 ASAs). The findings of this research may shed light on the design of operational hydrological forecasting in the Three Gorges Reservoir region with profound socio-economic implications." .

Reconstruction of the tectonic subsidence shows that the southern continental margin can be divided into three stages with variable subsidence rate. A delay of tectonic subsidence existed in both areas after a break-up, which was likely related to the major mantle convection during seafloor spreading, that was triggered by the secondary mantle convection below the continental margin, in addition to the variation in lithospheric thickness. Meanwhile, the stage with delayed subsidence rate differed along strikes. In the Reed Bank area, this stage is between 32–23.8 Ma, while in the Dangerous Grounds, it was much later (between 19–15.5 Ma). We believe the propagated rifting in the South China Sea dominated the changes of this delayed subsidence rate stage." .

We assess the size of the eruption by determining a bulk tephra volume in the range 42–57 × 106 m3, which supports a Volcanic Explosivity Index 3 event, consistent with calculated column height of 16–18 km above the vent and making it the strongest eruptive phase since the volcano’s magmatic reactivation in 1999. Isopachs west of the volcano are sub-bilobate in shape, while sieve and laser diffraction grain-size analyses of tephra samples reveal strongly bimodal distributions. Based on a new grain-size deconvolution algorithm and extended sampling area, we propose here a mechanism to account for the bimodal grain-size distribution. The deconvolution procedure allows us to identify two particle subpopulations in the deposit with distinct characteristics that indicate dissimilar transport-depositional processes. The log-normal coarse-grained subpopulation is typical of particles transported downwind by the main volcanic plume. The positively skewed, fine-grained subpopulation in the tephra fall layer shares close similarities with the elutriated co-pyroclastic flow ash cloud layers preserved on top of the scoria flow deposits. The area with the higher fine particle content in the tephra layer coincides with the downwind prolongation of the pyroclastic flow deposits. These results indicate that the bimodal distribution of grain size in the Tungurahua fall deposit results from synchronous deposition of lapilli from the main plume and fine ash elutriated from scoria flows emplaced on the western flank of the volcano. Our study also reveals that inappropriate grain-size data processing may produce misleading determination of eruptive type." .

We present structural, kinematic and strain data on the Kesebir–Kardamos dome in eastern Rhodope, which document early Tertiary extension. The dome consists of three superposed crustal units bounded by a low-angle NNE-dipping detachment on its northern flank in Bulgaria. The detachment separates footwall gneiss and migmatite in a lower unit from intermediate metamorphic and overlying upper sedimentary units in the hanging wall. The high-grade metamorphic rocks of the footwall have recorded isothermal decompression. Direct juxtaposition of the sedimentary unit onto footwall rocks is due to local extensional omission of the intermediate unit. Structural analysis and deformational/metamorphic relationships give evidence for several events. The earliest event corresponds to top-to-the SSE ductile shearing within the intermediate unit, interpreted as reflecting Mid-Late Cretaceous crustal thickening and nappe stacking. Late Cretaceous–Palaeocene/Eocene late-tectonic to post-tectonic granitoids that intruded into the intermediate unit between 70 and 53 Ma constrain at least pre-latest Late Cretaceous age for the crustal-stacking event. Subsequent extension-related deformation caused pervasive mylonitisation of the footwall, with top-to-the NNE ductile, then brittle shear. Ductile flow was dominated by non-coaxial deformation, indicated by quartz c-axis fabrics, but was nearly coaxial in the dome core. Latest events relate to brittle faulting that accommodated extension at shallow crustal levels on high-angle normal faults and additional movement along strike-slip faults. Radiometric and stratigraphic constraints bracket the ductile, then brittle, extensional events at the Kesebir–Kardamos dome between 55 and 35 Ma. Extension began in Paleocene–early Eocene time and displacement on the detachment led to unroofing of the intermediate unit, which supplied material for the syn-detachment deposits in supra-detachment basin. Subsequent cooling and exhumation of the footwall unit from beneath the detachment occurred between 42 and 37 Ma as indicated by mica cooling ages in footwall rocks, and extension proceeded at brittle levels with high-angle faulting constrained at 35 Ma by the age of hydrothermal adularia crystallized in open spaces created along the faults. This was followed by Late Eocene–Oligocene post-detachment overlap successions and volcanic activity. Crustal extension described herein is contemporaneous with the closure of the Vardar Ocean to the southwest. It has accommodated an earlier hinterland-directed unroofing of the Rhodope nappe complex, and may be pre-cursor of, and/or make a transition to the Aegean back-arc extension that further contributed to its exhumation during the Late Miocene. This study underlines the importance of crustal extension at the scale of the Rhodope massif, in particular, in the eastern Rhodope region, as it recognizes an early Tertiary extension that should be considered in future tectonic models of the Rhodope and north Aegean regions." .

As one of the European countries affected more by droughts in the last decades, it is important to assess how future precipitation regimes will change in order to study its impacts on water resources. Due to the coarse scale of global circulation models, it is often needed to downscale climate variables to the regional or local scale using statistical and/or dynamical techniques. In this study, we tested the use of a generalized linear model, as implemented in the program GLIMCLIM, to downscale precipitation for the center of Portugal where the Tagus basin is located. An analysis of the method performance is done as well as an evaluation of future precipitation trends and extremes for the twenty-first century. Additionally, we perform the first analysis of the evolution of droughts in climate change scenarios by the Standardized Precipitation Index in the study area. Results show that GLIMCLIM is able to capture the precipitation’s interannual variation and seasonality correctly. However, summer precipitation is considerably overestimated. Additionally, precipitation extremes are in general well recovered, but high daily rainfall may be overestimated, and dry spell lengths are not correctly recovered by the model. Downscaled projections show a reduction in precipitation between 19 and 28 % at the end of the century. Results indicate that precipitation extremes will decrease and the magnitude of droughts can increase up to three times in relation to the 1961–1990 period which can have strong ecological, social, and economic impacts." .

The xenoliths are anhydrous clinopyroxene-poor lherzolites and harzburgites, plus very rare websterites and olivine-websterites. Glassy pods having thin subhedral to euhedral microlites of olivine, clinopyroxene and spinel have been found in harzburgites and websterites. Clinopyroxene shows trace element variability, with values of (La/Yb)N ranging from sub-chondritic (0.01) to supra-chondritic (8.6). The Sr–Nd isotopic ratios of the clinopyroxenes fall mostly in the field of the European lithospheric mantle xenoliths (87Sr/86Sr from 0.70385 to 0.70568 and 143Nd/144Nd ranging from 0.512557 to 0.512953). The geochemical characteristics of the Sardinian xenoliths testify to the variable degrees of earlier partial melt extraction, followed by metasomatic modification by alkaline melts or fluids. Websterites are considered to represent small lenses or veins of cumulitic (i.e. magmatic) origin within the mantle peridotite." .

They are transient landscape features that move along a drainage line incising into soil, alluvium or colluvium disturbing the catchment both headwards and along its banks. It is important to understand gully initiation, development and evolution as while they are transient features they are drivers of landscape change and erode and transport considerable volumes of sediment through the channel network. There has been considerable research into understanding gully development with many numerical predictive models developed. Here a computer-based landscape evolution model (SIBERIA) is examined for its ability to predict gully development in a catchment undisturbed by European agricultural practices. The simulations demonstrate that the SIBERIA model is able to produce gullies in the same position that are qualitatively and quantitatively morphologically similar to field data. The modelling suggests that the whole catchment is at risk of gullying and is in accordance with the field data which demonstrated that the presence of gullies was extensive throughout the catchment. The model also produces erosion rates within that of independently measured field data." .

In Early Silurian times, a eustatic highstand enabled the sea to reach its maximum southward extent. The counterclockwise rotation of Gondwana during the Cambrian and Early Ordovician caused the northern Gondwana margin to shift from intertropical to southern polar latitudes in Ordovician times. Glacial and periglacial deposits are reported from many localities in Morocco, Algeria, Niger, Libya, Chad, Sudan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The Late Ordovician glaciation phase was followed by a period of a major glacioeustatic sea-level rise in the Early Silurian due to the retreat of the ice-cap. As a consequence of the decreasing water circulation in the basin centers (Central Arabia, Murzuk- and Ghadames basins), highly bituminous euxinic shales were deposited. These shales are considered to be the main source rock of Paleozoic oil and gas deposits in parts of Saudi Arabia, Libya and Algeria. The following regression in the southern parts of the Early Silurian sea was probably caused by a second glacial advance, which was mainly restricted to areas in Chad, Sudan and Niger. Evidence for glacial activity and fluvioglacial sedimentation is available from rocks overlying the basal Silurian shale in north-east Chad and north-west Sudan. The Early Silurian ice advance is considered to be responsible for the termination of euxinic shale deposition in the basin centers." .

These derivatives are written for different temperature indices, hurricanes, frost, snowfall and rainfall, and they are available for several cities. Our paper focuses on rainfall derivatives. In order to price this kind of derivatives, we have to model daily rainfall sequences at a specific location. For this purpose, we adopt a non-homogeneous parametric semi-Markov model to describe the rainfall occurrences, and a mixture of exponential distributions for rainfall amounts. The underlying Markov process has the obvious two states: dry and wet. In addition, dry and wet sequences are estimated by using best-fitting techniques. The model parameters are determined thanks to classical log-likelihood maximization. We finally price some rainfall contracts issued by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange through Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical applications and the parameter estimations are carried out using real data." .

Results show that the magnetic susceptibility and redness of the burnt sediments are remarkably higher than those of other areas on the same level: up to ~22 times for magnetic susceptibility and ~3 times for redness of those of the adjacent unburnt sediments. Fine-grained (superparamagnetic/stable single-domain) magnetite and hematite grains make dominant contributions to the distinctly high values of magnetic susceptibility and redness in the burnt sediments. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy results show that the burnt sediments contain more hematite than those of other areas and localities 2 and 3. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that the burnt sediments have been heated above 700 °C. Those changes in low-frequency magnetic susceptibility and redness are impossibly resulted from natural fires, thus most likely signaling the human activities of controlled use of fire. However, further work is needed to confirm whether or not these heat-affected sediments were produced in situ." .

Sampling was conducted in summer 2007 at stations distributed along transects in Hornsund, Isfjorden and Kongsfjorden. Variations in zooplankton standing stocks and community structures (assessing taxonomic diversity and zoogeographical affiliations) were analysed in relation to the environmental variables using multivariate techniques. The hydrographic conditions in Hornsund were influenced by the cold Arctic Water, whereas those in Isfjorden and especially in Kongsfjorden were, to a greater extent, under the influence of the warm Atlantic Water. High abundances of both meroplankton and holoplankton organisms were observed in Kongsfjorden, with high contributions of boreal and ubiquitous species (Calanus finmarchicus and Oithona similis, respectively). In Hornsund at the same time, the zooplankton consisted mainly of boreo-Arctic and Arctic species, the abundances of which were comparable along the West Spitsbergen Shelf. Our results indicate that the difference in hydrography had measurable effects on the zooplankton community in the study area. Furthermore, by comparing regions of contrasting oceanographic conditions, we present evidence as to how the zooplankton structure will change in the Arctic ecosystems if the warming trends continue to operate with the same dynamics. The advection of Atlantic waters to the Arctic seas may lead to changes in zooplankton structure, with increased abundance and contributions of boreal and small ubiquitous species. The ‘warmer Arctic fjords’ scenarios may also induce more rapid development of both holoplankton and meroplankton populations and, consequently, modify the trophic interactions in plankton communities." .

Using climatic data from 80 weather stations located throughout Extremadura, seven bioclimatic indices were calculated to estimate heat accumulation and potential water balance during the growing season and the thermal regime during the ripening of grapes. Differences in some climatic indices were found, and after a multivariate geographic analysis, four groups were delimited containing weather stations with similar climatic features, with variability between groups explained by heat accumulation and tempearture and thermal amplitude during the ripening season. Suitability for cultivation of grapevines without thermal restriction and temperate nights during the ripening period are the main characteristics of the weather stations studied, but spatial variability found in climatic potential denotes the importance of differentiating locations to properly relate the viticultural climate to grape quality factors and the style of wines produced. The climatic features of the four groups are very similar to those described in other viticultural regions, including those in close proximity to Extremadura and others worldwide, but few studies have used broad and updated temporal climate data for computing bioclimatic indices as in this case study. Finally, trends in climate indices were analysed. Results revealed that all groups have experienced warmer growing seasons, driven mainly by changes in minimum temperatures. This fact has numerous potential impacts, including changes in grapevine phenological timing, disruption of balanced composition in grapes (ultimately affecting wine characteristics), alterations in varieties grown and spatial changes in viable winegrape-growing zones." .

An ongoing production challenge in this region is the management of the impacts of heat stress during spring and summer. An increase in the frequency and severity of extreme temperature events due to climate change may result in additional heat stress and production losses. This paper assesses the changing nature of heat stress now, and into the future, using historical data and climate change projections for the region using the temperature humidity index (THI). Projected temperature and relative humidity changes from two global climate models (GCMs), CSIRO MK3.5 and CCR-MIROC-H, have been used to calculate THI values for 2025 and 2050, and summarized as mean occurrence of, and mean length of consecutive high heat stress periods. The future climate scenarios explored show that by 2025 an additional 12–15 days (compared to 1971 to 2000 baseline data) of moderate to severe heat stress are likely across much of the study region. By 2050, larger increases in severity and occurrence of heat stress are likely (i.e. an additional 31–42 moderate to severe heat stress days compared with baseline data). This increasing trend will have a negative impact on milk production among dairy cattle in the region. The results from this study provide useful insights on the trends in THI in the region. Dairy farmers and the dairy industry could use these results to devise and prioritise adaptation options to deal with projected increases in heat stress frequency and severity." .

Such conditions have been thought unique in the evolution of the Etnean volcano as well as in the Mediterranean region. However, a review study of available geophysical data and models, combined with geological records, petrographic and geochemical considerations, has led us to consider that a large area of about 28 km2 located in Val Calanna, on the eastern side of Valle del Bove, can be interpreted as the site of an old open conduit volcano. A dyke swarm outcrops in the area, whose deep alteration and fumarolization can be attributed to the sustained passage of volcanic gases over long periods. Radiometric dating yields an age of about 129 ka. This finding sheds new light on the evolution of Mount Etna volcano, indicating that the tectonic conditions leading to an open conduit volcano must also have been active in the past." .

They have many uses (e.g. grazing, dry land farming, wildlife habitat, recreation and mining). Generally vegetation is sparse and the principal plant species are adapted to erratic rainfall events. Rainfall use efficiency (RUE) is the quotient of annual primary production divided by annual rainfall i.e. the number of kilograms aerial dry matter produced by 1 ha in 1 year per millimetre of rain. It decreases with increasing aridity. Reasonably well managed arid and semi arid grazing lands are usually in the 3.0–6.0 value range. Available soil moisture is the principal determinant of productivity. The role and significance of the major parameters (rainfall, soil depth, slope and salinity, texture, cover, erosion etc) are considered. Available moisture can be predicted if the appropriate relative productivity indices (RPI) are used in a parametric way. The predictions can be used to classify land according to its capability to support plant growth. Equations have been derived which enable land to be classified on the basis of its potential productivity. Links between land capability and vegetation cover are given." .

The caldera formed when Tertiary basalts collapsed after prolonged explosion from a central vent area. The ensuing subsidence, which appears to have been cyclic, was accompanied by the deposition of andesitic volcanic material to form 5,000 to 7,000 feet of rhythmic tuffs, breccias and agglomerates partly under lacustrine conditions. The peripheral basalts were shattered during the stages of collapse forming a ring fault zone around the caldera. The depositional and subsidence stages were followed by an intrusive augite andesitic one from which extensive cone sheets formed in the caldera rocks. Radial and tangential dykes formed around the caldera in the peripheral basalts. After a time interval, the comparatively shallow central depression of the caldera received biotite andesitic pyroclastics and flows. Biotite andesite dykes followed a similar structural pattern to the augite andesitic ones. Finally, plug like bodies of porphyrite and monzonite intruded into the highly fractured zones, particularly the ring fault zone in the peripheral basalts. An important younger structural development with economic significance was the formation of a north-westerly shear system across the caldera. Flatly dipping structures formed in the peripheral basalts from the resettling of major blocks around the caldera. After the monzonite intrusions, epithermal mineralisers were liberated with economic amounts of gold in the form of telluride and auriferous pyrite. The mineralisers favoured the north-westerly shear system and, in the peripheral basalts, the accompanying flatly dipping structures. Thermal spring activity appears to mark the last phase of volcanicity." .

Processes were quantified using a mixed-layer salt budget. Model results correctly reproduced the mean, phase, and amplitude of observed seasonal near-surface salinity. The results indicated that on seasonal time scales, the mixed-layer salinity balance differed from one region to another. The surface salinity seasonal cycle was characterized by strong salinization during May for coastal areas north and south of the equator. Model results suggested that vertical mixing controls the mixed-layer salinity increase at the equator during May, while both vertical mixing and vertical advection contribute to the salinity increase in coastal regions. We also determined that freshening from horizontal advection and freshwater flux tended to balance the salinization effects of vertical diffusion and vertical advection during the seasonal cycle. On interannual time scales, based on the mixed-layer salinity balance and sensitivity experiments, we determined that for the northern and equatorial Gulf of Guinea, changes in near-surface salinity were largely due to changes in precipitation and winds. For the southern Gulf of Guinea, only wind changes were determined to be important for explaining near-surface salinity changes." .

Sandstone detrital mode and geochemical results refine previous geodynamic interpretations. Late Ordovician samples indicate a stable craton and recycled orogenic and, possible, extensional setting. The Early Carboniferous is interpreted to represent a compressional environment, followed by a Late Carboniferous molasse-type foreland basin, and a Permian extensional geodynamic setting. Contrasting geochemical patterns of post-Variscan and Permian sequences suggest a rift setting. Electron microprobe data of detrital white mica also indicate changes in the provenance. Compositional data reflect a shift from low- to medium-grade metamorphic (Ordovician) to high-grade metamorphic (Carboniferous) to low- to medium-grade metamorphic and plutonic source rocks (Permian). Additionally, our data show that various chemical discrimination diagrams do not include all possible ranges of sandstones, and that high contents of detrital mica and ultra-stable heavy minerals may cause misclassification. Consequently, we propose the use of multi-method approach for provenance studies, including the control of geochemical data by modal analysis and heavy mineral investigations." .

The analysis confirms that velocities measured by HF radars correspond to those observed by an ADCP at the effective depth z f = k −1, where k is wavenumber of the radio wave emitted by the radar. The radials provided by the radars were in a very good agreement with in situ measurements, with the relative errors of 1 and 9 % and root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.02 and 0.04 m/s for monostatic and bistatic radar, respectively. The total radar-based velocities appeared to be slightly underestimated in magnitude and somewhat biased in direction. At the end of the survey period, the difference in the surface current direction, based on HF radar and ADCP data, attained 10°. It was demonstrated that the surface boundary layer dynamics cannot be reconstructed successfully without taking into the account velocity variation with depth. A significant misalignment of ∼30° caused by the sea breeze was documented between the HF radar (HFR-derived) surface current and the background current. It was also found that the ocean response to a moderate wind forcing was confined to the 4-m-thick upper layer. The respective Ekman current attained the maximum value of 0.15 m/s, and the current rotation was found to be lagging the wind by approximately 40 min, with the current vector direction being 15–20° to the left of the wind. The range of velocity variability due to wind forcing was found comparable with the magnitude of the background current variability." .

Five facies are examined that either have characteristics consistent with coherent rocks in general (i.e. intrusive and extrusive non-fragmental rocks) or are mineralogically and texturally similar to kimberlite described as coherent (or apparent coherent). Three facies are interpreted as coherent on the basis of: (1) geological setting, (2) apparent-porphyritic texture, (3) sharp contacts with fragmental kimberlite, (4) relative abundance of elongate and unbroken olivine crystals and (5) paucity of country rock xenoliths, while the remaining two facies are interpreted as fragmental on the basis of: (1) the gradational contacts with demonstrably fragmental kimberlite, (2) relative abundance and range of sizes of country rock lithic clasts and (3) numerous broken olivine crystals. Comparisons are made with coherent and apparent-coherent kimberlite from the literature. Our three coherent facies are similar to literature reported coherent kimberlite dykes hosted in country rock (CKd) in terms of internal organisation, low abundance of country rock xenoliths, and apparent-porphyritic texture. Conversely, our two fragmental facies share attributes with previously described pipe-filling coherent and apparent-coherent kimberlite (CKpf) in terms of geometry, internal organisation and abundance of country rock xenoliths. We conclude that CKd and most CKpf, although similar in matrix/groundmass mineralogy and texture, can be distinguished on the basis of internal organisation, country rock lithic clast abundance, texture (e.g. apparent-porphyritic texture) and possibly olivine crystal shapes and suggest that fragmental kimberlite is more common than reported." .

By defining remnants or planèzes of the volcano flanks in DEM-derived images, the original edifice can be reconstructed. We propose a two-cone model with adjacent summit vents which were active in different times. The reconstructed cones were 4,460 and 4,350 m high a.s.l., corresponding to ∼2,160 and 2,050 m relative height, respectively. New 40Ar/39Ar data allow us to decipher the chronological details of the cone-building activity. We dated the Older and Younger Andesites of the volcano that, according to previous mapping, built the stage 2 and stage 3 stratocones, respectively. The new 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages yielded 589–556 ka for the Older and 514–505 ka for the Younger Andesites, supporting their distinct nature with a possible dormant period between. The obtained ages imply an intense final (≤100 ka long) cone-building activity, terminating ∼100 ka earlier than indicated by previous K-Ar ages. Moreover, 40Ar/39Ar dating constrains the formation of the Inner Basin, an elliptical depression in the center of the volcano initially created by flank collapse. A 530 ka age (with a ±58.4 ka 2σ error) for a post-depression dacite suggests that the collapse event is geochronologically indistinguishable from the termination of the andesitic cone-building activity. According to our DEM analysis, the original cone of San Francisco Mountain had a volume of about 80 km3. Of this volume, ∼7.5 km3 was removed by the flank collapse and subsequent glacial erosion, creating the present-day enlarged Inner Basin, and ∼2 km3 was removed from the outer valleys by erosion. Based on volumetric analysis and previous and new radiometric ages, the average long-term eruption rate of San Francisco Mountain was ∼0.2 km3/ka, which is a medium rate for long-lived stratovolcanoes. However, according to the new 40Ar/39Ar dates for the last ≤100 ka period, the final stratovolcanic activity was characterized by a greater ∼0.3 km3/ka rate." .

The MWSP is an interbasin water transfer project aimed at diverting water from the Melamchi River of the Indrawati River basin to Kathmandu Valley for drinking water purpose. Future temperature and precipitation of the basin were predicted using the outputs of two regional climate models (RCMs) and two general circulation models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios which were then used as inputs to Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict the water availability and evaluate the water diversion strategies in the future. The average temperature of the basin is projected to increase by 2.35 to 4.25 °C under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, by 2085s. The average precipitation in the basin is projected to increase by 6–18 % in the future. The annual water availability is projected to increase in the future; however, the variability is observed in monthly water availability in the basin. The water supply and demand scenarios of Kathmandu Valley was also examined by considering the population increase, unaccounted for water and water diversion from MWSP in the future.

Semidiurnal tides strongly affect diurnal tides; however, semidiurnal tides are essentially unaffected by diurnal tides. The semidiurnal and diurnal constituents interact with each other through non-linear interference, both destructive and constructive. Semidiurnal tides generate harmonics at nearly the diurnal frequency and higher vertical wavenumbers. In Ombai Strait, these harmonics are out of phase with the diurnal tides and interact destructively with the diurnal tides, effectively negating the diurnal response in some locations. However, this is not a general response, and interactions differ between locations. Energy is also transferred from both semidiurnal and diurnal tides to other frequencies across the spectrum, with more energy originating from semidiurnal tides. These energy transfers are not homogeneous, and the spectral responses differ between the Makassar and Ombai Straits, with the region east of Ombai showing a more active surface response compared to a more intense benthic response in Makassar. In deep water away from topography, velocity spectra generally follow the Garrett–Munk (GM) relation. However, in areas of internal tide generation, spectral density levels exceed GM levels, particularly between 4 and 8 cycles per day (cpd), indicating increased non-linear interactions and energy transfer through resonant interactions. The model indicates strong surface trapping of internal tides, with surface velocity spectra having significantly higher energy between 4 and 8 cpd even 100 km away from the prominent sill generating the internal tides." .

The ryholite contains phenocrysts of garnet, plagioclase and amphibole phases residing in a cryptocrystalline groundmass consisting of plagioclase, K-feldspar and quartz. Euhedral garnet phases range in size from 0.2 to 3.0 mm, have inclusions of ilmenite, rutile, apatite and zircon, and show no reaction/resorption microtextures. Electron microprobe analysis reveals that the garnet is homogeneous, lacks substantial chemical zoning and is dominantly almandine with subordinate pyrope, grossular, spessartine and andradite. The absence of inclusions of metamorphic minerals within garnet as well as the lack of included metamorphic rock fragments in the host rhyolite rule out a xenocrystic origin for the garnet. The garnet phases have low CaO content and variable MnO concentration, resembling those formed from S-type magma. The host rhyolite contains quartz, K-feldspar, and amphibole, has normative corundum, and is peraluminous. Inclusions within garnet as well as the chemistry of the garnet and the host rhyolite suggest that the garnet is a phenocryst phase crystallized from a deep-rooted (>25 km) crustal-derived peraluminous magma. It is likely that the peraluminous feature of the magma, inherited from partial melting of metapelitic source rocks, has favoured crystallization of garnet. Upon rising to higher levels, the garnet phases were in equilibrium with the host magma and thus were preserved as relatively large euhedral crystals in the Deh-Salm rhyolite." .

Observations of migration rates and overall impacts to these barrier islands are poorly understood since they do not respond in a traditional way, such as barrier rollover. This paper aims to verify how wave energy and potential longshore sediment transport trends have influenced the recent evolution of the Chandeleur Islands, by direct comparison with recent observations of migration and erosion trends. The Chandeleur Islands are characterized by a bidirectional transport system, with material moving from the central arc to the flanks. The longshore sediment transport along the barrier islands was calculated after propagation and transformation of waves to breaking (generated using observed winds), and through the use of a common longshore sediment transport formula. Seasonal variations in wind climate produced changes in the transport trends and gradients that agree with migration and rotation patterns observed for this barrier island system. Results suggest that wind dominance produces seasonal oscillations that cause an imbalance in the resulting transport gradients that over time are responsible for higher rates of transport in the northward direction. These results and data from other works verify the evolutionary model previously suggested, and qualitatively confirm the recent observations in asymmetric shoreline erosion." .

Comparison of pre- and post-eruption optical images reveals several fresh ground fissures, a new scoria cone near the summit, and that 5.9 ± 0.1 km2 of new lava covered about half of the island. Decorrelation in the InSAR images indicates that lava flowed both to the western and to the northeastern part of the island after the start of the eruption, while later lavas were mainly deposited near the summit and onto the north flank of the volcano. From the InSAR data, we also estimate that the average thickness of the lava flows is 3.8 m, resulting in a bulk volume of around 2.2 × 107 m3. We observe no volcano-wide pre- or post-eruption uplift, which suggests that the magma source may be deep. The co-eruption interferograms, on the other hand, reveal local and rather complex deformation. We use these observations to constrain a tensile dislocation model that represents the dike intrusion that fed the eruption. The model results show that the orientation of the dike is perpendicular to the Red Sea rift, implying that the local stresses within the volcanic edifice are decoupled from the regional stress field." .

The studied phosphate is of the Middle Eocene age that belongs to the Wadi Shallala Formation. It is equivalent to the phosphate deposits recorded in the lower part of the Umm Wual Formation in the Turayf region of Saudi Arabia and the Eocene Ratga Formation in the Ethna phosphate deposit west of Iraq. The phosphorites in the region are broadly similar in mineralogical composition and geochemical affinities. X-ray diffraction indicates the presence of francolite with variable amounts of calcite and quartz. Most samples consist of phosphate clasts embedded in carbonate and silica matrix and cement. P2O5 content is up to 32.3 % with an average equal to 18.6 %. The impurity is caused by the presence of variable amounts of SiO2 and CaO. The F% and F/P2O5 ratio in studied phosphates is lower compared with that in phosphates from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The geological and geochemical results were integrated for resource estimation. Three high-grade phosphate layers with ≥23 % P2O5 were considered in the calculations. The phosphate resource is classified as an inferred resource.

The present study offers an insight into the processes controlling the formation and evolution of the Gyra barrier beach (NW coast of the island of Lefkada) in the microtidal, tectonically very active Ionian Sea under the influence of regional climate change and human interference. Such investigations are sparse in the literature. Existing information regarding regional geology, sediment availability and human intervention is combined with the collection of geophysical data, field observations and simulations of nearshore hydro- and sediment dynamics, analysis of climatic variations with respect to offshore wind/wave patterns (including storminess), in situ measurements of recent morphometric changes (2006–2008) and historical shoreline changes (since the 1960s). The recent formation and evolution (mostly under retreat) of the Gyra barrier beach is shown to be the combined result of the regional seismotectonic setting, relative increase of sea level, coastal sediment transport patterns, as well as human impact (negative) on primarily terrestrial sediment influxes. The current erosional trend of the barrier beach is associated with a shift in the wind and wave direction (from SW to NW) of extreme storm events in the Ionian Sea since the 1980s. The regional climatic variations of the last decades are well correlated with the trend of the North Atlantic Oscillation." .

During the late Miocene, the Guadalquivir Basin and its satellite basin, the Ronda Basin, were under Atlantic cool-water influence. The aim of our study is to develop a sequence stratigraphic subdivision of the Ronda Basin fill and to provide models for the cool-water carbonates. The Upper Miocene of the Ronda Basin can be divided into three depositional sequences. Sequence 1 is early Tortonian, Sequence 2 late Tortonian to earliest Messinian, and Sequence 3 Messinian in age. The sediments were deposited in a ramp depositional system. Sequence 1 is dominated by conglomerates and marls. In Sequence 2 and Sequence 3, carbonate deposits dominate in the inner ramp whereas siliciclastics preferentially occur in the middle and outer ramp. Bryomol carbonate sediments occur in all sequences whereas rhodalgal carbonates are restricted to Sequence 3. In bays protected from siliciclastic influx, rhodalgal deposits formed under transgressive conditions. A bryomol factory occurs in zones of continuous siliciclastic supply. This distribution results from facies partitioning during the flooding of the Ronda Basin, which has a rugged and irregular relief. Embayments were protected from siliciclastic influx and provided regions with less hydraulic energy." .

The potash-rich volcanic rocks have relatively high (87Sr÷86Sr)i ratios (0.708715–0.711418) and distinctly negative εnd values (−11.47–−17.54), and are enriched in radiogenic lead (206Pb÷204Pb=17.341−17.622, 207Pb÷204Pb=15.525−15.538, 208Pb÷204Pb = 37.563−37.684).

Evidence suggests that the overwhelming majority of arc HAB are porphyritic lavas, enriched in Al2O3 either by protracted prior crystallization of olivine and clinopyroxene, or by plagioclase phenocryst accumulation in magmas of basaltic andesite to dacite composition. Experimentally-determined phase relationships of such plagioclase-enriched (non-liquid) compositions have little bearing on the petrogenesis of arc magmas, and do not rule out the possibility that arc HAB can be derived by fractionation of more primitive arc lavas. Although models invoking eclogite-melting can match typical arc HAB REE patterns, calculations indicate that the Ni and Cr contents of proposed Aleutian primary HAB are many times lower than such models predict. In contrast, Ni vs Sc and Cr vs Sc trends for arc HAB are readily explained by olivine (+Cr-sp) and clinopyroxene-dominated fractionation from more primitive arc magmas. GENMIX major element modelling of several HAB compositions as partial melts of MORB eclogite, using appropriate experimentally (26–34 kb)-determined garnet and omphacite compositions yields exceptionally poor matches, especially for CaO, Na2O, MgO and Al2O3. These mismatches are easily explained if the HAB are plagioclase-accumulative. Groundmasses of arc HAB are shown to vary from basaltic andesite to dacite in composition. Crystal fractionation driving liquid compositions toward dacite involves important plagioclase separation, resulting in development of significant negative Eu anomalies in more evolved lavas. Plagioclase accumulation in such evolved liquids tends to diminish or eliminate negative Eu anomalies. Therefore, the absence of positive Eu anomaly in a plagioclase-phyric HAB does not indicate that plagioclase has not accumulated in that lava. In addition, we show that plagioclase phenocrysts in arc HAB are not in equilibrium with the liquids in which they were carried (groundmass). Exceptional volumes of picrite and olivine basalt occur in the Solomons and Vanuatu arcs; the presence in lavas from these and other arcs (Aleutian, Tonga) of olivine phenocrysts to Fo94, finds no ready explanation in the primary eclogite-derived HAB model. We suggest that most lavas in intra-oceanic arcs are derived from parental magmas with >10% MgO; fractionation of olivine (+Cr-sp) and clinopyroxene drives liquids to basalt compositions with <7% MgO, but plagioclase nucleation is delayed by their low but significant (<1%?) H2O contents. Thus evolved liquid compositions in the basaltic andesite—andesite range may achieve relatively high Al2O3 contents (<17.5%). The majority of arc basalts, however, have Al2O3 contents in excess of 18%, reflecting plagioclase accumulation. We give new experimental data to show that HAB liquids may be generated by anhydrous, low-degree (<10%) partial melting of peridotite at P<18 kb. Relative to arc HAB, these experimental melts have notably higher Mg#(69–72) and are in equilibrium with olivine Fo87–89. Only further detailed trace element modelling will show if they might be parental magmas for some arc HAB." .

The reanalyses are those performed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction jointly with National Center for Atmospheric Research. This study investigates the skill of the reanalyses and ECHAM4 with regard to three climate regions of Indonesia, the annual and interannual variability of rainfall and its responses to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The study is conducted at two spectral resolutions, T42 and T106. The skill of rainfall simulations in Indonesia depends on the region, month and season, and the distribution of land and sea. Higher simulation skills are confined to years with ENSO events. With the exception of the northwest region of Indonesia, the rainfall from June (Molucca) and July (south Indonesia) to November is influenced by ENSO, and is more sensitive to El Niño than La Niña events. Observations show that the Moluccan region is more sensitive to ENSO, receives a longer ENSO impact and receives the earliest ENSO impact in June, which continues through to December. It is found that the reanalyses and the climate model simulate seasonal variability better than monthly variability. The seasonal skill is highest in June/July/August, followed by September/October/November, December/January/February and March/April/May. The correlations usually break down in April (for monthly analysis) or in the boreal spring (for seasonal analysis). This period seems to act as a persistent barrier to Indonesian rainfall predictability and skill. In general, the performance of ECHAM4 is poor, but in ENSO sensitive regions and during ENSO events, it is comparable to the reanalyses." .

The pressure–temperature-time trajectory and structural history of high-pressure rocks presently exposed in the Gran Paradiso massif provide constraints on the processes that caused their thermal evolution and exhumation. High-pressure metamorphism of the rocks is found to have culminated at temperatures around 525 °C and pressures of 12 to 14 kbar. After high-pressure metamorphism, the rocks cooled during initial decompression, while undergoing top-to-the-west shear on chlorite-bearing shear bands and larger scale shear zones. Biotite-bearing shear bands and larger shear zones related to top-to-the-east deformation affected the Gran Paradiso massif during reheating to temperatures of around 550 °C at 6 to 7 kbar. Further exhumation occurred at relatively high temperatures. A potentially viable explanation of the observed stage of reheating before final cooling and exhumation is breakoff of a subducting slab in the upper mantle, allowing advective heat transfer to the base of the crust.

The Sakri dyke has a mineralogy which strongly resembles a lamproite sensu stricto (viz.,Ti-rich phlogopite, Na-poor diopside, Fe-rich sanidine, ulvospinel trend and Sr-rich apatite). However, its bulk-rock major element geochemical characteristics (viz., extreme silica-undersaturated nature) resemble sensu lato kamafugite from Toro Ankole, Uganda, East African Rift, and Alto Paranaiba Province, Brazil. The Sakri dyke also displays certain compositional peculiarities (viz., high degree of evolution of mica composition from phlogopite to biotite, elevated titanium and aluminum in clinopyroxene and significantly lower bulk Mg#) when compared to the ultrapotassic rocks from various Indian cratons. 40Ar/39Ar dating gave a plateau age of 1045 ± 9 Ma which is broadly similar to that of other Mesoproterozoic (i) lamproites from the Bastar and Bundelkhand cratons, and (ii) kimberlites from the Eastern Dharwar craton. Initial bulk-rock Sr (0.705865–0.709024) and Nd (0.511063–0.511154) isotopic ratios reveal involvement of an ‘enriched’ source region with long-term incompatible element enrichment and a depleted mantle (TDM) Nd model age of 2.56 Ga straddling the Archaean-Proterozoic chronostratigraphic boundary. The bulk-rock incompatible trace element ratios (Ta/Yb, Th/Yb, Rb/Ba and Ce/Y) of the Sakri ultrapotassic dyke negate any significant influence of crustal contamination. Small-degree melting (1 to 1.5 %) of a mixed garnet-facies and spinel-facies phlogopite lherzolite can account for its observed REE concentrations. Whereas the emplacement of the Sakri ultrapotassic dyke is related to the amalgamation of the supercontinent of Rodinia, its overlapping geochemical characteristics of lamproite and kamafugite (also displayed by two other lamproites of the Nuapada field at Amlidadar and Parkom) are linked to the emplacement in a unique geological setting at the craton-mobile belt contact and hence of geodynamic significance." .

Cyclic variations with time scales ranging from 50 to 400 yr occur in oxygen isotope ratios derived from ice cores, tree-ring index series, pollen records and sea-ice extents. Century time scale cycles can also be identified in some biological and historical records and in long-term instrumental observations. In order to appreciate the century scale cycles in the context of climatic variability in general, a brief survey of all climatic time scales is presented. The traditional interpretation that decadal-to-century scale fluctuations in the climate system are externally forced, e.g. by variations in solar properties, is questioned. A different mechanism for these fluctuations is proposed on the basis of recent findings of numerical models of the ocean's thermohaline circulation. The results indicate that this oceanic circulation exhibits natural variability on the century time scale which produces oscillations in the ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux. Although global in extent, these fluctuations are largest in the Atlantic Ocean." .

Three dives were conducted on the central spreading center of the ‘King's Triple Junction’ (KTJ) in the northeastern part of the Lau Basin east of Niuafo'ou Island at approximately 15°S. The lavas from the KTJ can be divided into types I and II based on their similarities to N-MORB and the BABB magma type ofSinton andFryer (1987) respectively. One dive each was made on the Central Lau Spreading Center (CLSC) at 18°S and the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) at 19°S. Lavas sampled on the CLSC were associated with active hydrothermal sulphide chimneys occurring at the base of a collapsed caldera structure on the central volcanic axial high. Sampled lavas from both the CLSC and ELSC are all of type I geochemistry. The results of the ‘Keldysh’ 90 cruise are integrated with previous work to evaluate the geochemical characteristics of the Lau Basin crust as a whole and geochemical zonation models for back-arc basin development. An important part of this review of Lau Basin basalt geochemistry is the recognition of boninites and rocks of boninitic affinity which occur at off-ridge locations throughout the Lau Basin. These are suggested to erupt during the initial stages of development of new spreading ridges associated with episodes of ridge jump or the propagation of back-arc spreading ridges into arc crust. Hf-Th-Ta systematics of the Lau Basin lavas are used to identify unmodified mantle source compositions and possible subduction-related enriched components. Unmodified mantle source compositions range from D-, N-, and E-MORB to OIB. All Lau Basin lavas show some evidence of enrichment by a H2O ± LILE ± LREE-enriched component, a slab derived hydrous fluid.

In addition, geochronological and geochemical investigations were carried out. The oldest geological unit is a late Precambrian, hornblende-bearing diorite pluton with low-K composition and primitive isotope signatures. This diorite (U–Pb zircon age 554 ± 6 Ma) is most likely a remnant from a Peri-Gondwana island-arc or back-arc basin. About one-third of the map area is interpreted as an Upper Cretaceous magmatic arc consisting of a volcanic and a plutonic part. The plutonic part is represented by a suite of hornblende-bearing medium-K, I-type granitoids (minor diorite, mainly quartz–monzodiorite and granodiorite) dated at 92.8 ± 1.3 Ma (U–Pb zircon age). The volcanic part comprises medium-K andesite, dacite and tuffitic rocks and must be at least slightly older, because it is locally affected by contact metamorphism through the hornblende–granitoids. The Upper Cretaceous arc magmatism in the Arghash Massif is probably related to the northward subduction of the Sabzevar oceanic basin, which holds a back-arc position behind the main Neotethys subduction front. Small occurrences of pillow basalts and sediments (sandstone, conglomerate, limestone) tectonically intercalated in the older volcanic series may be relics of earlier Cretaceous or even pre-Cretaceous rocks. In the early Cenozoic, the Cretaceous magmatic arc was intruded by bodies of felsic, weakly peraluminous granite (U–Pb zircon age 55.4 ± 2.3 Ma). Another strong pulse of magmatism followed slightly later in the Eocene, producing large masses of andesitic to dacitic volcanic rocks. The geochemistry of this prominent Eocene volcanism is very distinct, with a high-K signature and trace element contents similar to shoshonitic series (high P, Zr, Cr, Sr and Ba). High Sr/Y ratios feature affinities to adakite magmas. The Eocene magmatism in the Arghash Massif is interpreted as related to thermal anomalies in crust and mantle that developed when the Sabzevar subduction system collapsed. The youngest magmatic activities in the Arghash Massif are lamprophyres and small intrusions of quartz–monzodiorite porphyries, which cut through all other rocks including an Oligocene–Miocene conglomerate cover series." .

Our geochronological results indicate that emplacement of these plutons was a continuous process during the late Carboniferous to early Permian, from 324 ± 6 to 274 ± 6 Ma, and lasted for at least 50 Ma. In this paper, the early Permian components with compositions from gabbro to granite within the intrusive complex were studied. The early Permian plutons exhibit calc-alkaline or high-K calc-alkaline, metaluminous geochemical features and highly variable SiO2 contents. They have no significant Eu anomaly in their REE patterns, and in primitive-mantle-normalized spidergrams they display depletion in Th, U, Nb, Ta, P and Ti, and enrichment in Ba, K, Pb and Sr. The granitoid bodies within these plutons display I-type and adakitic geochemical signatures. The early Permian rocks exhibit low whole-rock initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios from 0.70520 to 0.70615 and have negative whole-rock ε Nd(t) values ranging from −17.4 to −9.3 and zircon ε Hf(t) values of −23.2 to −10.5. The gabbros exhibit higher ε Nd(t) values from −11.1 to −9.3 and ε Hf(t) values from −16.5 to −10.5, and one granodiorite exhibits an even lower ε Nd(t) value of −17.4 and zircon ε Hf(t) values of −23.2 to −15.1. Geochemical, Sr–Nd and in situ zircon Hf isotopic compositions suggest that the hornblende gabbros were derived from a metasomatized lithospheric mantle, and the diorite and quartz diorite were generated from a gabbroic magma by fractional crystallization, coupled with differential assimilation of ancient lower crustal material. The granodiorite was likely derived from partial melting of ancient lower crust with involvement of some mantle components. Involvement of both lithospheric mantle and ancient lower crust in the generation of the early Permian plutons indicates strong crust–mantle interaction in the northern NCB. Petrological associations as well as geochemical and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic results show that the early Permian plutons were emplaced along an Andean-type active continental margin during southward subduction of the Palaeo-Asian oceanic plate beneath the NCB. Integration of our results with previously published data for late Carboniferous and late Permian to middle Triassic intrusions suggests that the continental arc on the northern margin of the NCB existed for at least 50 Ma during the late Palaeozoic, and final amalgamation of the Mongolian arc terranes with the northern NCB likely occurred during a period from ~270 to ~250 Ma, i.e, in the late Permian to earliest Triassic." .

Additionally, random initial errors in randomly selected areas were considered. Based on these four types of initial errors and areas, we designed and performed 16 experiments to investigate the impacts of locations and patterns of initial errors on the nonlinear developments of the errors, and to determine which type of initial errors and areas has the greatest impact on TC forecasts. Overall, results from the experiments indicate the following: (1) The impact of random errors introduced into the sensitive areas was greater than that of errors themselves fixed in the randomly selected areas. From the perspective of statistical analysis, and by comparison, the impact of random errors introduced into the CNOP target area was greatest. (2) The initial errors with CNOP, CSV, or FSV patterns were likely to grow faster than random errors. (3) The initial errors with CNOP patterns in the CNOP target areas had the greatest impacts on the final verification forecasts." .

The thermal evolution of the Penninic Rhenodanubian Flysch nappes, the Helvetic nappes, and the allochthonous part of the Alpine Molasse Basin is constrained by vitrinite reflectance measurements and apatite fission track dating and implemented in a tectonic evolution scheme. Within the Helvetic nappes, vitrinite reflectance increases regionally from north to south and stratigraphically from the Campanian–Maastrichtian Wang Formation to the Toarcian Mols Member. Apatite fission track ages from Penninic and Subalpine Molasse units are consistently younger than the deposition age. They indicate therefore a post-depositional thermal overprint exceeding approximately 120 °C, the upper temperature limit of the apatite partial annealing zone. 1D thermal modelling suggests that the Penninic nappes attained deepest burial between the latest Cretaceous and Early Palaeocene with the Penninic basal thrust being located at approximately 8 km in the north compared to approximately 12 km in the south. Deepest burial of the upper Helvetic nappe occurred between the latest Eocene and Early Miocene. Its base was buried down to approximately 10.5 km in the north compared to 11.5 km in the south. Exhumation of the entire nappe stack started in the Early to Middle Miocene. For both Penninic and Helvetic models, a heatflow minimum during the Cenozoic deformation (max. 27–32 mW/m2), followed by an increase from the Middle Miocene onwards (up to 60 mW/m2), was assumed." .

The drifts preserve a record of Labrador Current flow variations through the last glacial maximum. A high-resolution seismic profile and a transect of four cores were collected across Beothuk drift on the southeast side of Flemish Pass. Downcore and lateral trends in grain size and sedimentation rate provide evidence that, between 16 and 13 ka, sediment was partitioned across Beothuk drift and the adjacent Flemish Pass floor by a strong current flow but, from 29 to 16 ka, sedimentation was more of a blanketing style, represented by draped reflections interpreted as being due to a weaker current. The data poorly resolve the low sedimentation rates since 13 ka, but the modern Labrador Current in Flemish Pass is the strongest it has been in at least the past 29 ka. Pre-29 ka current flow is interpreted based on reflection architecture in seismic profiles. A prominent drift on the southwestern side of Flemish Pass formed above a mid-Miocene erosion surface, but was buried by a mass-transport deposit after the penultimate glacial maximum and after drift deposition switched to eastern Flemish Pass. These findings illustrate the temporal complexity of drift sedimentation and provide the first detailed proxy for Labrador Current flow since the last glacial maximum." .

However, quantitative analyses of the long-term relationships between climate change and human society have been limited by a lack of long-term high-resolution data that indicate socioeconomic processes. Here, based on 1,091 records extracted from 25 books on Chinese history and economic history written by leading contemporary scholars, an economic proxy series for China with decadal resolution is presented that encompasses the period from BC 220 to AD 1910. A method for semantic differential and integrating descriptions with multi-time resolution is developed. The statistical results show that warm and wet periods were associated with above-average economic performance, while cold and dry climatic scenarios greatly increased the possibility of economic crisis. Temperature was more influential than precipitation in explaining the long-term economic fluctuations, whereas precipitation displayed more significant effects on the short-term macro-economic cycle. It is proposed that the climatic effects on agrarian economic development were highly dependent on the social vulnerability, which is determined by particular social, economic and political backgrounds. From a deep time perspective, our study may provide new insight into the current intense arguments regarding the economic effects of global warming." .

During the 15 years from 2000 to 2015, Miyakejima volcano discharged 25.5 Mt of SO2, which required degassing of 3 km3 of basaltic magma. The SO2 emission rate peaked at 50 kt/day at the end of 2000 and quickly decreased to 5 kt/day by 2003. During the early degassing period, the volcanic gas composition was constant with the CO2/SO2 = 0.8 (mol ratio), H2O/SO2 = 35, HCl/SO2 = 0.08, and SO2/H2S = 15. The SO2 emission rate decreased gradually to 0.5 kt/day by 2012, and the gas composition also changed gradually to CO2/SO2 = 1.5, H2O/SO2 = 150, HCl/SO2 = 0.15, and SO2/H2S = 6. The compositional changes are not likely caused by changes in degassing pressure or volatile heterogeneity of a magma chamber but are likely attributed to an increase of hydrothermal scrubbing caused by large decrease of the volcanic gas emission rate, suggesting a supply of gases with constant composition during the 15 years. The intensive degassing was modeled based on degassing of a convecting magma conduit. The gradual SO2 emission rate that decrease without changes in volcanic gas composition is attributed to a reduction of diameter of the convecting magma conduit." .

Not only are they an important manifestation of desertification and land degradation, but they also have a whole suite of important environmental impacts, including possible rainfall suppression (Maley, 1982), fertilization of offshore areas, and disturbance to satellite communications. It is therefore important to ascertain whether their frequency and extent is changing. An increasing dust-storm incidence could be both a manifestation of and a contributor to global change. By analysing long-term meteorological records for a large number of areas (the Great Plains of the USA, the USSR, Morocco, The Arabian Gulf, Australia, the Sahel-Sudan zone of Africa, China, Mongolia and Mexico) certain conclusions can be drawn. The first of these is that there is no one global pattern of dust-storm frequency trend. Some stations (e.g. in the Sahel) show a clear upward trend of great severity, others show a downward trend (e.g. Mexico City), while others show a more cyclical pattern. In many cases it is evident that essentially natural processes (precipitation totals, snow cover, wind strength) determine the frequency of dust events in any one year. It has also been possible to show the importance of runs of drought years (e.g. in the High Plains in the 1930s, and in the Sahel zone of Africa in the 1970s and 1980s). Elsewhere, however, various human activities have been significant in determining dust-storm frequency variations: the introduction of centre-pivot irrigation in the High Plains, the abstraction of water from the Owens and Mono basins in California, the disruption of surfaces by construction activity and vehicle use (e.g. in Ulan Bator, Mongolia), and the deliberate stabilisation of susceptible surfaces (e.g. the Lake Texcoco scheme in Mexico)." .

The database covers half a century of Alpine glacier history (from 1954 to 2007), thus allowing to describe glacier changes on a relatively long time window. Further, the subset of Alpine glaciers chosen for the analysis are among the best known and studied of Italy, also comprising the widest Italian valley glacier. The analysis provided area surface changes as −19.43 km2 ± 1.2 %, approximately −40 %, from 1954 to 2007. Small glaciers contributed strongly to total area loss. The area change rate accelerated lately, with a surface reduction of approximately 8.7 % between 2003 and 2007, i.e. a mean area loss of approximately 0.693 km2/year. The mean yearly loss over the previous periods (1954–1981, 1981–2003 and 1990–2003) were 0.242, 0.436 and 0.476 km2/year, respectively. From a geodynamical perspective, the Ortles-Cevedale group is now experiencing transition from a glacial system to a paraglacial one. The areas where most recently the main shaping and driving factors were glaciers are now subject to the action of melting water, slope evolution and periglacial processes. We also investigated seasonal values of key climatic variables (1951–2007), namely, temperature, precipitation and snow cover in the area, to evaluate their potential effects upon glacier dynamics. We performed linear regression and Mann–Kendall tests to highlight significant non-stationarity and onset of trends of our target climate variables. We investigated the correlation between local weather variables, North Atlantic Oscillation anomalies and global thermal anomaly to highlight the link of local weather patterns against global weather. We further carried out correlation analysis of weather variables (with different lags) against glacier terminus fluctuations during 1951–2006 for the two most studied glaciers of the Ortles-Cevedale group to highlight the response of glaciers to climate variability. We found increased temperature and decreased precipitation and snow cover likely to have driven accelerated glacier’s shrinkage during the last three decades." .

The hydraulic head covariance functions for flows in a semi-confined aquifer bounded by a leaky layer above and an impervious stratum below are derived by assuming that the randomness forcing the head variation to originate from the hydraulic conductivity field of the aquifer. The head covariance functions are studied using two convenient forms of the logarithmic hydraulic conductivity process. The results demonstrate the significant reduction in the head variances and covariances due to the presence of a leaky layer. The hydraulic head correlation distance is also reduced greatly due to the presence of the leaky layer." .

The project comprises 2 parallel large-scale experimental manipulations -- artificial acidification at Sogndal and exclusion of acid rain at Risdalsheia. Treatment at Sogndal commenced April 1984 with the acidification of the snowpack by addition of H2SO4 (SOG2) and a 1:1 mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3 (SOG4). Preliminary results indicate rapid and significant response in runoff chemistry to the acid treatment; pH decreased (to as low as 4.1 during snowmelt in 1984); SO4, NO3, and labile Al increased. Response during snowmelt 1985 was modest relative to 1984. At Risdalsheia treatment began in June 1984 with the mounting of the transparent panels on the roofs at KIM catchment (treatment by deacidified rain) and EGIL catchment (control with ambient acid rain). Preliminary data for the first year indicate that most runoff samples from KIM contain much lower NO3 concentrations, about 20 to 30% lower SO4 levels and pH 0.1 to 0.3 units higher than runoff from EGIL catchment. The treatments continue in 1985–87. Project RAIN provides experimental evidence bearing on target loading, reversibility of acidification, and the processes linking acid deposition, soil acidification and freshwater acidification." .

In doing so, the response of calcareous dinoflagellates to Cenozoic climatic change has been addressed for the first time. Trends in species composition and distribution patterns of wall types indicate significant changes which correlate with major palaeoenvironmental modifications. A first major shift concerning the relative abundance of species and wall types occurred across the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary. The associations remained stable during the entire Paleocene and Eocene. Only in the late Eocene did a dramatic decrease in temperature cause a slight diversification. A second major shift in the abundance patterns occurred across the Eocene–Oligocene boundary. The early Miocene warming is possibly reflected in the distinct increase in relative abundance of one species. The assemblages of calcareous dinoflagellates evidently react to major climatic changes during the Cenozoic. These poorly investigated organisms may thus provide an important contribution to the understanding of earth's palaeoclimatic evolution." .

Radar data overcome the problem of sparseness of the rain gauge network, but are not reliable for the assessment of rain amounts. In this work we investigate how to calibrate radar measurements via rain gauge data and make spatial predictions for hourly rainfall, by means of Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. We use zero-inflated distributions for taking zero-measurements into account. Several models are compared both in terms of data fitting and predictive performances on a set of validation sites.

Up to now, the lack of index fossils in the Reuchenette Formation prevented a reliable correlation between both areas (its sediments are characterised by a prominent sparseness of index fossils). Now, seven recently in situ collected species of ammonites helped to establish a new sequence-stratigraphical frame for the platform sediments of the Reuchenette Formation in NW Switzerland. Based on biostratigraphical data, five third-order sedimentary sequences were assigned to the Late Oxfordian to Late Kimmeridgian. The upper three third-order sequences correspond to the Boreal sequences Kim3–5 of Hardenbol et al. (1998). The deduced large-scale sea-level fluctuations match those from other European regions (Spain, Russia). This biostratigraphically based sequence-stratigraphical frame is a prerequisite to refine correlations within a wider area covering the Swiss Jura and parts of adjacent France and Germany." .

The study is useful for early warning of negative effects associated with extreme rainfall anomalies across the country. It covers the period 1935–1992, using long and short rains data from 28 weather stations in Rwanda and ENSO events resourced from Glantz (2001). The mean standardized anomaly indices were calculated to investigate their associations with ENSO events. One-way analysis of variance was applied on the mean standardized anomaly index values per ENSO event to explore the spatial correlation of rainfall anomalies per ENSO event. A geographical information system was used to present spatially the variations in mean standardized anomaly indices per ENSO event. The results showed approximately three climatic periods, namely, dry period (1935–1960), semi-humid period (1961–1976) and wet period (1977–1992). Though positive and negative correlations were detected between extreme short rains anomalies and El Niño events, La Niña events were mostly linked to negative rainfall anomalies while El Niño events were associated with positive rainfall anomalies. The occurrence of El Niño and La Niña in the same year does not show any clear association with rainfall anomalies. However, the phenomenon was more linked with positive long rains anomalies and negative short rains anomalies. The normal years were largely linked with negative long rains anomalies and positive short rains anomalies, which is a pointer to the influence of other factors other than ENSO events. This makes projection of seasonal rainfall anomalies in the country by merely predicting ENSO events difficult." .

Studying land surface processes in this region will improve the understanding of regional climate formation and the feedback with global climate change. Satellite remote sensing provides an excellent opportunity to study land-atmosphere interactions at the regional scale. It is necessary to develop feasible and reasonable remote sensing-based methods to map surface energy fluxes for a specific study area. In this paper, previously published algorithms and empirical formulae were tested with Landsat 7 ETM+ data to derive the regional distributions of land surface reflectance, surface temperature, NDVI and land surface energy fluxes (net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux) over the upper Xilin River watershed in Inner Mongolia, China. A new land use/land cover classification was developed and applied for regionalization analysis. Validation of remote sensing derived surface reflectance, surface temperature, net radiation and sensible heat flux with field measurements shows differences of about 13, 4, 1, and 28%, respectively. This study provides valuable guidance for further investigation of the whole watershed." .

The model geometry consists of a sequence of different rectangular compartments of uniform depth, thus, accounting for width and depth variations in a stepwise manner. This schematization allows for a quick and transparent solution procedure. The solution, forced by incoming Kelvin waves at the open boundaries and satisfying the linear shallow water equations on the f plane with bottom friction, is in each compartment written as a superposition of eigenmodes, i.e. Kelvin and Poincaré waves. A collocation method is employed to satisfy boundary and matching conditions. First, the general resonance properties of a strongly simplified geometry with two compartments, representing the Northern North Sea and Southern Bight, are studied. Varying the forcing frequency while neglecting bottom friction reveals Kelvin and Poincaré resonance. These resonances continue to exist (but with lower amplification and a modified spatial structure) when adding the Dover Strait as a third compartment and separating the solutions due to forcing from either the north or the south only. Including bottom friction dampens the peaks. Next, comparison with tide observations along the North Sea coast shows remarkable agreement for both semi-diurnal and diurnal tides. This result is achieved with a more detailed geometry consisting of 12 compartments fitted to the coastline of the North Sea. Further simulations emphasize the importance of Dover Strait and bottom friction. Finally, it is found that a sea level rise of 1 m, uniformly applied to the entire North Sea, amplifies the M2-elevation amplitudes almost everywhere along the coast, with an increase of up to 8 cm in Dover Strait. Bed level changes of ±1 m, uniformly applied to the Southern Bight only, imply weaker changes, with changes in coastal M2-elevation amplitudes below 5 cm." .

The former group of parasites showed highest accumulation capacity for Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, Ni, and Zn while the latter group had high accumulation potential of As, Hg, Cd, Al, Pb, and Sr. The divergence in heavy-metal accumulation profiles of both nematodes is linked with the specificity of microhabitats, cuticle morphology, and interspecific competition.

Despite its load of suspended sediment, the fresh water rises to or stays at the sea surface forming turbid surface plumes, whereas the coarse-grained sediment forms bed load. On the Labrador Slope south of the Hudson Strait turbid plumes were supplied by meltwater from the Pleistocene ice sheet (LIS). Sediments with the seismic characteristics of plume deposits occur in a 200-km-long slope sector up to 130 km seawards from the strait. The widespread distribution of these deposits is attributed to entrainment of the surface plumes by the south-flowing Labrador Current and suppressed flocculation due to the high detrital carbonate-content of the suspended sediment. Deposits with typical characteristics of surface plume deposits have been recovered within 20 km from former ice margin south of or in front of outlets, but not north of outlets. They consist of 1 to 2-cm-thick alternations of fine sandy silt/coarse silt layers with finer-grained clayey silt/silty clay, and for brevity are called plumites." .

Economically adaptive water management for this climate scenario is compared to a similar scenario with the historical climate. The effects of population growth and land use alone are developed for comparison. Compared with the historic hydrology, optimized operations for the dry climate warming scenario raise water scarcity and total operation costs by $490 million/year with year 2050 demands. Actual costs might be somewhat higher where non-economic objectives prevail in water management. The paper examines the economical mix of adaptation, technologies, policies, and operational changes available to keep water supply impacts to such modest levels. Results from this screening model suggest promising alternatives and likely responses and impacts. Optimized operations of ground and surface water storage change significantly with climate. Dry-warm climate change increases the seasonal storage range of surface reservoirs and aquifers. Surface reservoir peak storage usually occurs about a month earlier under dry-warm climate change." .

In the Buda Hills, dolostone disintegration proceeded in four stages that correspond to a gradual decrease in particle size, that is, from the parent dolostone to (1) crackle breccia; via (2) mosaic breccia (diameter <2 cm); via (3) mosaic breccia blocks ‘floating’ in dolomite powder; to (4) dolomite powder (diameter 100–300 μm). Stable isotope ratios and trace element compositions of dolomite remained constant throughout these stages, and there are no indications of dissolution in most locations, suggesting that disintegration was predominantly a mechanical process. Combining these findings with the geological history of the region, and supported by a simple freezing/thawing experiment and pertinent experimental studies on weathering of building stones, it appears that powderization in the Buda Hills was caused by repeated freeze–thaw cycles during and/or after the Pleistocene glaciations. Subaerial exposure under cold climate conditions involves multiple freeze–thaw cycles that create mechanical stresses in the rock framework related to the opposing thermal expansion of rock and water that freezes and of ice that liquefies. This process is herewith called ‘cryogenic powderization’. Our data further suggest that the synergy of four factors promoted dolostone powderization in the Buda Hills: (1) tectonics, which created a pervasive fracture network; (2) intercrystalline porosity of the dolostone; (3) relatively high water saturation; and (4) subaerial exposure under cold climate conditions." .

Previous stratigraphic surveys suggested that people living in this area have probably abandoned their settlements (in the Bronze Age) or towns and villas (in the Roman period) for centuries after each major plinian eruption. New archaeological excavations on the northern slope of Vesuvius suggest a much more intriguing scenario. At Pollena Trocchia, an ongoing excavation has shown the superimposition of three different Roman structures, sandwiched between the deposits of the AD 79, AD 472, and AD 512 Vesuvius eruptions. Each of these eruptions more or less completely destroyed and buried the buildings under meters of volcanic products. Surprisingly, after a few years or decades, a new settlement was established exactly on the top of the buried one, indicating the immediate recovery of part of the devastated area. Our research documents the destruction of Roman buildings by volcanic eruptions over a period of five centuries (first to sixth century AD) and provides new insight into human behavior after major explosive eruptions." .

Four major tectonic events have been described in the studied area: a D1-early tectonic event, responsible of the E–W flat foliation which has been progressively transposed by a D2 tectonic event. A D2 event has developed heterogeneous simple shear in a dextral transpressive context with moderate to strong dipping NE–SW striking foliation; a D3 tectonic event has lead to a sinistral N–S ductile shear characterized by N- to ENE-striking foliation and E–W strike-slip shear corridors and a D4 tectonic event that developed N–S dextral ductile strike-slip deformation. The magnetic study of the pluton, based on the AMS parameters, reveals the coexistence of both paramagnetic (dominated by iron-bearing silicates; 54 % of sites) and ferromagnetic (due to the occurrence of PSD and MD grains of magnetite or other ferromagnetic minerals; 46 % of sites) behaviors. Magnetic foliation shows best poles at 55/82 for the whole pluton, 95/32 in BHG, and 273/83 in BG, and the magnetic lineation trends are mostly NNE–SSW with best lines at 210/8, 198/19, and 36/3, respectively. The trend of the magnetic lineation in BG indicates an S-shape trajectory, suggesting a sinistral sense of shear motion along discrete E–W corridors situated at the northern and southern ends. Kinematic indicators in BG point to a sinistral sense of shear, suggesting its emplacement during the D3 event. The close relationship between K 1 and K 3 points to a syn-kinematic emplacement and crystallization of the Misajé granitic pluton during the Pan-African event, and the tectonic evolution of the study area is considered to be coeval with the tectonic evolution of the trans-Saharan Pan-African belt of eastern Nigeria." .

There also tend to be warm anomalies in the boreal summer or fall during La Niña development years and cold anomalies in winter or spring following the La Niña events. The seasonal phase-locking of SST change in the EIO associated with El Niño/Southern Oscillation is linked to the variability of convection over the maritime continent, which induces an atmospheric Rossby wave over the EIO. Local air-sea interaction exerts different effects on SST anomalies, depending on the relationship between the Rossby wave and the mean flow related to the seasonal migration of the buffer zone, which shifts across the equator between summer and winter. The summer cold events start with cooling in the Timor Sea, together with increasing easterly flow along the equator. Negative SST anomalies develop near Sumatra, through the interaction between the atmospheric Rossby wave and the underneath sea surface. These SST anomalies are also contributed to by the increased upwelling of the mixed layer and the equatorward temperature advection in the boreal fall. As the buffer zone shifts across the equator towards boreal winter, the anomalous easterly flow tends to weaken the mean flow near the equator, and the EIO SST increases due to the reduction of latent heat flux from the sea surface. As a result, wintertime SST anomalies appear with a uniform and nearly basin-wide pattern beneath the easterly anomalies. These SST anomalies are also caused by the increase in solar radiation associated with the anticyclonic atmospheric Rossby wave over the EIO. Similarly, the physical processes of the summer warm events, which are followed by wintertime cold SST anomalies, can be explained by the changes in atmospheric and oceanic fields with opposite signs to those anomalies described above." .

Chromitite pods and lenses hosted in peridotitic mantle rocks show magmatic textures, post magmatic brecciation and ferritchromitisation. Electron microprobe analyses show two types of massive chromitite, with one group having high-Cr (Cr# 75–76), medium-Al (Al2O3 12.2–12.4 wt%) chromites (Sirohi-type) and the other group (Gamnom-type) having a wide range of compositions with generally lower Cr and higher Al (Cr# 65–71, Al2O3 15.7–19 wt%). Accessory chromites in peridotitic mantle rocks have consistently low Cr (Cr# 38–39) and high Al (Al2O3 34–35 wt%), whereas chromites in dunite pods have intermediate compositions (Cr# ~60; Al2O3 20.7–21.2 wt%). The chromite chemistry suggests moderate (20 %) partial melting of the tectonised mantle harzburgite. The estimated Al2O3melt, (FeO/MgO)melt and TiO2melt for the Sirohi-type chromites indicate boninitic parentage, whereas chromite compositions from the Gamnom area suggest mixed boninitic—island arc tholeiitic magmas.

Eyewitness chronologies, coupled with examination of very proximal exposures and historical records of distal deposit thickness, provide an unusual opportunity for study of Plinian and phreatoplinian eruption and plume dynamics. The ∼ 17 hour-long main eruption was characterized by abrupt and reversible shifts in eruption style, e.g., from ‘wet’ to ‘dry’ eruption conditions, and transitions from fall to flow activity. The main eruption began with a ‘dry’ subplinian phase (B), followed by a shift to a very powerful phreatoplinian ‘wet’ eruptive phase (C1). A shift from sustained ‘wet’ activity to the formation of ‘wet’ pyroclastic density currents followed with the C2 pyroclastic density currents, which became dryer with time. Severe ground shaking accompanied a migration in vent position and the onset of the intense ‘dry’ Plinian phase (D). Each of the fall units can be modeled using the segmented exponential thinning method (Bonadonna et al. 1998), and three to five segments have been recognized on a semilog plot of thickness vs. area1/2. The availability of very proximal and far-distal thickness data in addition to detailed observations taken during this eruption has enabled calculations of eruption parameters such as volumes, intensities and eruption column heights. This comprehensive dataset has been used here to assess the bias of volume calculations when proximal and distal data are missing, and to evaluate power-law and segmented exponential thinning methods using limited datasets." .

This study explores an alternative nonlinear approach, with a motivation to possibly achieve more cost-effective solutions for Bangladesh. It investigates the existence of nonlinear deterministic and chaotic dynamic behavior in the spatial pattern of arsenic contamination in the shallow wells (depth<150 m). The database comprises the nationwide arsenic survey completed in 1999 by the British Geological Survey (BGS) in collaboration with the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) of Bangladesh. Distinction is made in terms of regional geology (Pleistocene vs. Holocene deposits/Northwest vs. Southwest) to understand the geologic dependency. Identification of possible presence of nonlinear deterministic and chaotic patterns is made via the Grassberger-Procaccia correlation dimension algorithm. The analysis yields correlation dimension values ranging anywhere from 8 to 11 depending on the region, suggesting that the arsenic contamination in space, from a chaotic dynamic perspective, is a medium- to high-dimensional problem. The dimension results also indicate that the spatial dynamics of arsenic may be moderately sensitive to geology, with Pleistocene aquifers appearing to require a minimum of about two less dominant processes/variables for its description when compared to that required by the Holocene aquifers. Based on these results, a qualitative discussion is also cast on the potential opportunities offered by a nonlinear deterministic and chaotic dynamic approach towards improving cost-effectiveness in siting new safe wells." .

The recycled sediment volume demands a substantial palinspastic addition to the passive, northern margin of the Rheno-Hercynian basin. Detrital zircon ages from the Late Carboniferous foreland basin and their possible source rocks in the South Portuguese Zone permit the same interpretation. This suggests that synorogenic sedimentation in Portugal is related, like in Germany, to the closure of the Devonian-Carboniferous Rheno-Hercynian basin and not to the closure of the Ordovician–Silurian Rheic Ocean." .

There is, however, disagreement as to origin or lithology of the antecedent topography, particularly with respect to the siliciclastic or carbonate nature of the underlying topography and structural patterns. To help resolve these problems, published and unpublished information have been compiled to produce a structural fabric map of onshore and offshore Belize that includes a new geologic map of the country. The map, along with illustrated seismic lines, demonstrates the occurrence of a number of NNE-trending transpressional faults in which landward directed thrusting is consistently displayed along with tectonic inversion. Offshore wells in conjunction with the seismic lines document the inversion as post-Eocene, suggesting a similar age for transpressional fault movement. Presumably, the landward-directed thrusting reflects the opposing force of eastward-directed subduction along the western margin of Central America relative to the westward seafloor spreading of the Caribbean Cayman Ridge. The Belize faults show little current seismicity, but, nevertheless, the resulting structures have affected Quaternary carbonate deposition as evidenced on an illustrated seismic line by both seaward and landward (bi-directional) progradation of the reef margin from an underlying structural high. The structural influence on the development of Holocene antecedent topography is further suggested by the occurrence of a Bouguer gravity plateau in the same shelf area that marks the occurrence of the Belize lagoon rhomboid shelf atolls. The youngest documented lithology of 12 illustrated offshore exploration wells is Miocene carbonate. In some wells, the carbonate is interpreted as extending into the Pliocene and Holocene although no age diagnostic criteria are in evidence. In other wells, siliciclastics of unknown age and thickness are identified as overlying Neogene carbonates. The regional distribution and age of onshore limestones suggests that unroofing of the Cretaceous carbonate cap of the Maya Mountains siliciclastic sediment source did not occur until late in Neogene time, perhaps no earlier than late Pliocene. Consequently, the Maya Mountains could not have been a major offshore source of siliciclastics until the Quaternary. Information on the lithology of the immediately underlying pre-Holocene is provided by limited penetration core data and shallow resolution seismic lines. These show that antecedent Pleistocene limestones beneath the Holocene reefs were deposited around 130,000 b.p. (isotope stage 5e). The thickness of the overlying Holocene, shelf margin, reef-capped carbonates increases along depositional strike from a few meters in the north to more than 25 m in the south. In contrast, piston cores and seismic data from the southern shelf lagoon collectively document the occurrence of antecedent siliciclastic topography. The southward dip of both carbonate and siliciclastic antecedent surfaces is presumably a reflection of increasing southerly subsidence. Increasing antecedent erosional relief in the same direction reflects the pronounced southerly increase in paleo-rainfall that presumably paralleled that of present-day rainfall." .

This transition was preceded by a voluminous lava eruption in March 2006, a year of quiescence, resumption of natrocarbonatite eruptions in June 2007, and a volcano-tectonic earthquake swarm in July 2007. Despite the lack of ground-based monitoring, the evolution in OL eruption dynamics is documented based on the available field observations, ASTER and MODIS satellite images, and almost-daily photos provided by local pilots. Satellite data enabled identification of a phase of voluminous lava effusion in the 2 weeks prior to the onset of explosive eruptions. After the onset, the activity varied from 100 m high ash jets to 2–15 km high violent, steady or unsteady, eruption columns dispersing ash to 100 km distance. The explosive eruptions built up a ∼400 m wide, ∼75 m high intra-crater pyroclastic cone. Time series data for eruption column height show distinct peaks at the end of September 2007 and February 2008, the latter being associated with the first pyroclastic flows to be documented at OL. Chemical analyses of the erupted products, presented in a companion paper (Keller et al. 2010), show that the 2007–2008 explosive eruptions are associated with an undersaturated carbonated silicate melt. This new phase of explosive eruptions provides constraints on the factors causing the transition from natrocarbonatite effusive eruptions to explosive eruptions of carbonated nephelinite magma, observed repetitively in the last 100 years at OL." .

There is, however, increasing concern about the potential environmental impacts of shale gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing (fracking). In this study, we focussed on the potential impacts on regional water resources within the Baltic Basin in Poland, both in terms of quantity and quality. The future development of the shale play was modeled for the time period 2015–2030 using the LUISA modeling framework. We formulated two scenarios which took into account the large range in technology and resource requirements, as well as two additional scenarios based on the current legislation and the potential restrictions which could be put in place. According to these scenarios, between 0.03 and 0.86 % of the total water withdrawals for all sectors could be attributed to shale gas exploitation within the study area. A screening-level assessment of the potential impact of the chemicals commonly used in fracking was carried out and showed that due to their wide range of physicochemical properties, these chemicals may pose additional pressure on freshwater ecosystems. The legislation put in place also influenced the resulting environmental impacts of shale gas extraction. Especially important are the protection of vulnerable ground and surface water resources and the promotion of more water-efficient technologies." .

The model is configured over 30° E–120° E and 15° S–45° N at 30-km horizontal resolution with 23 vertical levels. Six 10-year (1991–2000) simulations are conducted with the combinations of two land surface schemes (BATS, CLM3.5) and three cumulus convection schemes (Kuo, Grell, MIT). The simulated annual and seasonal climatology of surface temperature and precipitation are compared with CRU observations. The interannual variability of these two parameters is also analyzed. The results indicate that the model simulated climatology is sensitive to the convection as well as land surface parameterization. The analysis of surface temperature (precipitation) climatology indicates that the model with CLM produces warmer (dryer) climatology, particularly over India. The warmer (dryer) climatology is due to the higher sensible heat flux (lower evapotranspiration) in CLM. The model with MIT convection scheme simulated wetter and warmer climatology (higher precipitation and temperature) with smaller Bowen ratio over southern India compared to that with the Grell and Kuo schemes. This indicates that a land surface scheme produces warmer but drier climatology with sensible heating contributing to warming where as a convection scheme warmer but wetter climatology with latent heat contributing to warming. The climatology of surface temperature over India is better simulated by the model with BATS land surface model in combination with MIT convection scheme while the precipitation climatology is better simulated with BATS land surface model in combination with Grell convection scheme. Overall, the modeling system with the combination of Grell convection and BATS land surface scheme provides better climate simulation over the Indian region." .

Nevertheless, no reliable models have been put forward to predict the dynamics of HFMD cases based on short-term weather variations. The present study aimed to examine the association between weather factors and HFMD, and to explore the accuracy of seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model with local weather conditions in forecasting HFMD. Weather and HFMD data from 2009 to 2014 in Huainan, China, were used. Poisson regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to examine the relationship between weather factors and HFMD. The forecasting model for HFMD was performed by using the SARIMA model. The results showed that temperature rise was significantly associated with an elevated risk of HFMD. Yet, no correlations between relative humidity, barometric pressure and rainfall, and HFMD were observed. SARIMA models with temperature variable fitted HFMD data better than the model without it (sR 2 increased, while the BIC decreased), and the SARIMA (0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 0)52 offered the best fit for HFMD data. In addition, compared with females and nursery children, males and scattered children may be more suitable for using SARIMA model to predict the number of HFMD cases and it has high precision. In conclusion, high temperature could increase the risk of contracting HFMD. SARIMA model with temperature variable can effectively improve its forecast accuracy, which can provide valuable information for the policy makers and public health to construct a best-fitting model and optimize HFMD prevention." .

The brittle to ductile transition in dry ganister occurs at about 600 MPa at room temperature. At lower pressures shear oriented grain boundary cracks form both pre and post peak strength, loosening the microstructure to the point at which axial transgranular cracks develop. Fault zone localization then occurs. At high pressures fault localization is suppressed by friction, and cataclastic flow occurs by the formation of ultracataclasite shear zones around each grain boundary, Rhomb shaped, relatively intact grain cores survive to high (greater than 20%) strains. Hardening mechanisms responsible for the ductility are discussed. It is shown that natural zones of intense cataclasis (fault zones) often develop microstructures comparable with those seen in these experiments, but the less intense cataclastic flow often associated with folding of rocks at high crustal levels in the external zones of orogenic belts is not comparable inasmuch as grain-scale catalaclasis does not normally occur. It is emphasised that finite strain microstructural similarity does not necessarily point to comparable deformation paths and stress history." .

The influence of aquifer property correlation on multiphase fluid migration, entrapment and recovery was explored by incorporating correlated and uncorrelated porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-Sat) parameter fields in a cross-sectional numerical multiphase flow model. Comparison of two-dimensional entrapped organic saturation distributions for a simulated tetrachloroethylene (PCE) spill in ensembles of aquifer realizations suggests that the degree of spatial correlation in Pc-Sat parameters exerts a controlling influence on dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) spreading and redistribution in saturated aquifers. The predicted evolution of DNAPL source zones and resultant remediation efficiency under surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) also appear to be strongly influenced by the spatial correlation of aquifer parameters and multiphase flow constitutive relationships. Results for a limited number of realizations selected from each ensemble showed that removal of 60% to 99% of entrapped PCE could reduce dissolved contaminant concentration and mass flux by approximately two orders of magnitude under natural gradient conditions. Aqueous phase contaminant mass flux did not vary uniformly as a function of % DNAPL removed, however, and notable differences in behavior were observed for models incorporating correlated versus uncorrelated Pc-Sat and permeability fields. Although these results must be confirmed through analysis of additional realizations, it is likely that similar or larger differences between correlated and uncorrelated system behavior will be observed in aquifers with greater spatially variability than that of the nonuniform, homogeneous sand aquifer studied here." .

Furthermore, we analysed the existing glacier records in the Cordillera Blanca since the last glacial maximum to understand the evolution of glaciers in this region over a few centuries. There was a rise in the snowline altitude of glaciers in this region since the late 1990s with a few small glacier advances. Historical to the present El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) records were also analysed to understand whether there was a teleconnection between the glacier fluctuations in the region and the phase changes of ENSO and PDO. We also assessed the variations in three important climatic parameters that influence the glacier retreat—temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity—over a few decades. We calculated the anomalies as well as the seasonal changes in these variables since the mid-twentieth century. There was an increase in temperature during this period, and the decrease in precipitation was not so prominent compared with the temperature rise. There was an exceptionally higher increase in relative humidity since the early 2000s, which is relatively higher than that expected due to the observed rate of warming, and this increase in humidity is believed to be the reason behind the unprecedented rise in the snowline altitudes since the beginning of the twenty-first century." .

The physical mechanism behind these impacts was explored. Two geographic regions over [65°E–95°E, 35°S–25°S] and [90°E–110°E, 20°S–5°S] were defined as the western pole region and the eastern pole region, respectively, for the GG summer precipitation (PGG)-related South Indian Ocean dipole SSTA pattern (R-SIODP). The difference between springtime SST anomalies averaged over the western pole region and that averaged over the eastern pole region was defined as the R-SIODP index. The correlation between the spring R-SIODP index and GG summer precipitation can reach up to 0.52. In the spring of positive R-SIODP anomaly, southerly winds over the western pole of the R-SIODP weaken, whereas the southeast trade winds over the eastern pole strengthen. By means of the wind-evaporation-SST feedback mechanism, the enhanced southeast trade winds can weaken the evaporation over the western pole of the R-SIODP and enhance the evaporation over the eastern pole. This results in a sustained positive SSTA in the western pole of the R-SIODP and a sustained negative SSTA in the eastern pole, whereby the distribution of the SSTAs maintains until summer. The SST dipole abnormally enhances the cross-equatorial airflow near 105°E, which intensifies the anomalous anti-cyclonic circulation over South China Sea at 850 hPa and simultaneously results in abnormal enhancement of water vapour transport to GG. Additionally, the SST dipole promotes abnormal divergence in the lower troposphere and abnormal convergence in the upper troposphere over the maritime continent (MC) region. Moreover, the low-level convergence in GG is enhanced, which results in abnormal enhancement of ascending motion in the GG that is conducive to positive summer rainfall anomaly in this region. In this study, the spring R-SIODP index, the SST to the east of Australia and to the east of southern Africa, and the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) index were used to construct a statistical prediction model for the inter-annual variability of the GG summer rainfall anomaly. This model can well predict the accuracy of the inter-annual variation of GG summer rainfall." .

The enclaves have similar mineralogy and may be divided into clinopyroxene-bearing and clinopyroxene-free hornblendites and both of them show cumulate textures: pargasitic amphibole and clinopyroxene are cumulus and anorthitic plagioclase is intercumulus. The accumulation might have occurred in the magma chamber, minor clinopyroxene enclosed in amphibole was earlier crystallized, followed by a large amount of amphibole, and the residual melt trapped between cumulate crystals finally formed the intercumulus plagioclase. Probably, such a crystallization process could produce layered cumulates: lower part is dominated by clinopyroxene-bearing hornblendite and upper part is composed of clinopyroxene-free one. The enclaves have similar geochemistry and imply a hydrous basaltic parental magma enriched Rb, Ba, Th and other large-ion lithophile elements. The generation of the parental magma might be related to the subduction of Paleo-Pacific plate beneath eastern Eurasian continent at that time. Estimated crystallization pressure, P-wave velocity, and density for the cumulate hornblendite enclaves are generally in agreement with the values of the local crust–mantle transition zone, suggesting that these cumulates may have the origin in the transition from the lower crust to upper mantle in arc and back-arc settings." .

Banded iron formation is interlayered with high-Mg basalts at Windarling and precipitated during episodes of volcanic quiescence. Trace element content and the rare earth element (REE) ratios Y/Ho (42 to 45), Sm/Yb (1.5), together with positive La and Gd anomalies in ‘least-altered’ hematite–magnetite–metachert–BIF indicate the precipitation from Archean seawater that was fertilised by hydrothermal vent fluids with a basaltic HREE-Y signature. Hypogene iron ore in sub-greenschist facies metamorphosed BIF formed during three distinct stages: ore stage 1 was a syn- to post-metamorphic, syn-D1, Fe–Ca–Mg–Ni–Co–P–REE metasomatism that produced local Ni–REE-rich Fe–dolomite–magnetite alteration in BIF. Hydrothermal alteration was induced by hot fluid flow controlled by brittle–ductile reactivation of BIF-basalt margins and crosscutting D1 faults. The Ni–Co-rich content of dolomite and a shift in REE ratios in carbonate-altered BIF towards Archean mafic rock signature (Y/Ho to 31 to 40, Sm/Yb to 1 to 2 and Gd/Gd* to 1.2 to 1.4) suggest that high-Mg basalts in the Windarling Range were the primary source of introduced metals. During ore stage 2, a syn-deformational and likely acidic and oxidised fluid flow along BIF-basalt margins and within D1 faults leached carbonate and precipitated lepidoblastic and anhedral/granoblastic hematite. High-grade magnetite–hematite ore is formed during this stage. Ore stage 3 hydrothermal specular hematite (spcH)–Fe–dolomite–quartz alteration was controlled by a late-orogenic, brittle, compressional/transpressional stage (D4; the regional-scale shear-zone-related D3 is not preserved in Windarling). This minor event remobilised iron oxides, carbonate and quartz to form veins and breccia but did not generate significant volumes of iron ore. Ore stage 4 involved Mesozoic(?) to recent supergene oxidation and hydration in a weathering environment reaching down to depths of ∼100 to maximum 200 m below surface. Supergene ore formation involved goethite replacement of dolomite and quartz as well as martitisation. Important ‘ground preparation’ for supergene modification and upgrade were mainly the formation of steep D1 to D4 structures, steep BIF/basalt margins and particularly the syn-D1 to syn-D2 carbonate alteration of BIF that is most susceptible to supergene dissolution. The Windarling deposits are structurally controlled, supergene-modified hydrothermal iron ore systems that share comparable physical, chemical and ore-forming characteristics to other iron ore deposits in the Yilgarn Craton (e.g. Koolyanobbing, Beebyn in the Weld Range, Mt. Gibson). However, the remarkable variety in pre-, syn- and post-deformational ore textures (relative to D1 and D2) has not been described elsewhere in the Yilgarn and are similar to the ore deposits in high-strain zones, such as of Brazil (Quadrilátero Ferrífero or Iron Quadrangle) and Nigeria. The overall similarity of alteration stages, i.e. the sequence of hydrothermal carbonate introduction and hypogene leaching, with other greenstone belt-hosted iron ore deposits supports the interpretation that syn-orogenic BIF alteration and upgrade was crucial in the formation of hypogene–supergene iron ore deposits in the Yilgarn Craton and possibly in other Archean/Paleoproterozoic greenstone belt settings worldwide." .

Etna. Apatite occurs both as microphenocrysts and as inclusions in olivine crystals, even in the most Mg-rich ones (Fo82). In addition phenocrysts and groundmass are composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine and magnetite. Apatite is fluor-apatite, with rather homogeneous major element (measured by electron microprobe, EMP) and REE (measured by laser-ablation microprobe, LAM, and by secondary ion mass spectrometer, SIMS) contents. REE are enriched when compared to the whole rock, with contents in olivine-hosted apatite lower than or the same as those of the microphenocryst cores; these in turn show lower REE values than their edges. Distribution coefficients, calculated from LAM data of microphenocryst edges and whole rock analyses, are higher for LREE (8–12) than for HREE (5–4). In the SiO2 vs. P2O5 diagram melt inclusions and whole rock samples define a trend that is consistent with continuous apatite extraction from a “high P” basalt magma. Finally, whole rock data show LREE/HREE (La/Lu)n enrichment ratios from hawaiites to mugearites (=1.14), consistent with apatite fractionation, lower than those documented for lavas of the “low P” type (enrichment ratio = 1.34–1.37), where conditions for apatite saturation were not established." .

Using the outputs of 15 general circulation models (GCMs) under three SRES scenarios of A1B, A2 and B1, the projected annual and seasonal precipitation (P) and cardinal temperatures (T) were analyzed for five climatic zones in Iran. In addition, the probable effects of climate change on cereal production were studied using AquaCrop model. Data obtained from the GCMs were downscaled using LARS-WG for 52 synoptic stations up to 2100. An uncertainty analysis was done for the projected P and T associated to GCMs and SRES scenarios. Based on station observations, LARS-WG was capable enough for simulating both P and T for all the climatic zones. The majority of GCMs as well as the median of the ensemble for each scenario project positive P and T changes. In all the climatic zones, wet seasons have a higher P increase than dry seasons, with the highest increase (27.9–83.3%) corresponding to hyper-arid and arid regions. A few GCMs project a P reduction mainly in Mediterranean and hyper-humid climatic regions. The highest increase (11.2–44.5%) in minimum T occurred in Mediterranean climatic regions followed by semi-arid regions in which a concurrent increase in maximum T (2.9–14.6%) occurred. The largest uncertainty in P and cardinal T projection occurred in rainy seasons as well as in hyper-humid regions. The AquaCrop simulation results revealed that the increased cardinal T under global warming will cause 0–28.5% increase in cereal water requirement as well as 0–15% reduction in crop yield leading to 0–30% reduction in water use efficiency in 95% of the country." .

The eruption started with a Plinian phase that was followed by a series of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) associated with the collapse of the Plinian column and the caldera. The glass compositions of the deposits span a wide geochemical range, but the Plinian fallout and PDCs associated with column collapse, the Lower Pumice Flow, only erupted the most evolved compositions. The later PDCs, the Breccia Museo and Upper Pumice Flow, erupted during and after caldera collapse, tap a less evolved component, and intermediate compositions that represent mixing between the end-members. The range of glass compositions in the Campanian Ignimbrite deposits from sites across the central and eastern Mediterranean Sea allow us to trace the dispersal of the different phases of this caldera-forming eruption. We map the fallout from the Plinian column and the plumes of fine material associated with the PDCs (co-PDCs) across the entire dispersal area. This cannot be done using the usual grain-size methods as deposits in these distal regions do not retain characteristics that allow attribution to either the Plinian or co-PDC phases. The glass compositions of the tephra at ultra-distal sites (>1500 km from the vent) match those of the uppermost PDC units, suggesting that most of the ultra-distal dispersal was associated with the late co-PDC plume that was generated during caldera collapse." .

The Obatogamau Formation constitutes the lower part of the Roy Group, which is composed of two cycles of tholeiitic-to-calc-alkaline volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, siliciclastic and chemical sedimentary rocks, and layered mafic-to-ultramafic sills. In this study, we report major and trace element results, and Nd, Sr, Pb and O isotope data for anorthosites, leucogabbros, gabbros and mafic dykes from the Doré Lake Complex and spatially associated basalts and gabbros of the Obatogamau Formation to assess their petrogenetic origin and geodynamic setting. Field and petrographic observations indicate that the Doré Lake Complex and associated volcanic rocks underwent extensive metamorphic alteration under greenschist facies conditions, resulting in widespread epidotization (20–40%) and chloritization (10–40%) of many rock types. Plagioclase recrystallized mainly to anorthite and albite endmembers, erasing intermediate compositions. Metamorphic alteration also led to the mobilization of many elements (e.g., LILE and transition metals) and to significant disturbance of the Rb–Sr and U–Pb isotope systems, resulting in 1935 ± 150 and 3326 ± 270 Ma errorchron ages, respectively. The Sm–Nd isotope system was less disturbed, yielding an errorchron age of 2624 ± 160 Ma. On many binary major and trace element diagrams, the least altered anorthosites and leucogabbros, and the gabbros and mafic dykes of the Doré Lake Complex plot in separate fields, signifying the presence of two distinct magma types in the complex. The gabbros and mafic dykes in the Doré Lake Complex share the geochemical characteristics of tholeiitic basalts and gabbros in the Obatogamau Formation, suggesting a possible genetic link between the two rock associations. Initial εNd (+2.6 to +5.0) and δ18O (+6.1 to +7.9‰) values for the Doré Lake Complex and gabbros of the Obatogamau Formation (εNd = +2.8 to +4.0; δ18O = +7.3 to 8.0‰) are consistent with depleted mantle sources. All rock types in the Doré Lake Complex and the Roy Group share the trace element characteristics of modern arc magmas, suggesting a suprasubduction zone setting for these two lithological associations. On the basis of regional geology and geochemical data, we suggest that the Doré Lake Complex and the Obatogamau Formation represent a dismembered fragment of a suture zone, like many Phanerozoic ophiolites, resulting from closure of a back-arc basin between 2703 and 2690 Ma." .

A thorough laboratory investigation of mechanical and flow behaviors is crucial for understanding the complex response of coalbeds to CO2 injection-enhanced coalbed methane recovery (CO2-ECBM) operation. In this work, systematic experiments were carried out on cylindrical coal core specimens under different uniform confining stresses. The coal deformation caused by variations in effective stress as well as the sorption-induced matrix swelling/shrinkage was monitored. The competitive gas sorption characteristics and permeability evolution during the process of methane displacement by CO2 were also investigated. The measured volumetric strain results indicate that sorption-induced strain is the dominant factor in the coal deformation. The relationship between the volumetric strain and the adsorbed gas volume has been revealed to be a linear function. Experimental results obtained under different stress conditions suggest that higher confining stress suppresses the increase in both volumetric strain and the adsorbed gas volume. Furthermore, both methane displacement and CO2 injection are reduced when applying higher confining stresses. In addition, the permeability enhancement is heavily suppressed at higher confining stress. At a certain confining stress, a characteristic “U-shaped” trend of permeability is presented as a function of decreasing pore pressure. This study contributes to the understanding of coal deformation and its impact on permeability evolution under uniformly stressed condition, which has practical significance for CO2 sequestration and CO2-ECBM operation in the Qinshui basin." .

Therefore, assessment of impact of temperature scenarios on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is essential for irrigation management in Kangsabati command (West Bengal). In the present study, impact of the projected temperatures on ETc was studied under climate change scenarios. Further, the performance of the bias correction and spatial downscaling (BCSD) technique was compared with the two well-known downscaling techniques, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR) and Kernel regression (KR), for the projections of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures for four stations, namely, Purulia, Bankura, Jhargram, and Kharagpur. In National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and General Circulation Model (GCM), 14 predictors were used in MLR and KR techniques, whereas maximum and minimum surface air temperature predictor of CanESM2 GCM was used in BCSD technique. The comparison results indicated that the performance of the BCSD technique was better than the MLR and KR techniques. Therefore, the BCSD technique was used to project the future temperatures of study locations with three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios for the period of 2006–2100.

Between mwp 1B and about 6 cal ka, many of the complex coastal ecosystems which ring the world’s oceans began to form. Here we report data for rhenium, carbon isotopes, total organic carbon, and fossil oysters from Chesapeake Bay which span the transition from fresh to brackish water conditions in the bay in the mid-Holocene. These data constrain sea-level change and resulting environmental change in the bay. They indicate that the transition was rapid, and that it was produced by (1) a third pulse of rapid eustatic sea-level rise, or (2) a geometry of the prehistoric Chesapeake Bay basin which predisposed it to a nonlinear response to a steadily rising sea level. Similar nonlinear changes in vulnerable coastal environments are likely to take place in the future due to polar warming, regardless of the timing or rate of sea-level rise." .

We present here results of analogue model studies of the auroral electrojet with an Earth model simulating the Arctic Ocean and inland conductivity structures in northern Fennoscandia. The main elements of the analogue model used were salt water simulating the host rock, an aluminium plate corresponding to the ocean and graphite pieces producing the inland highly conducting anomalies. The electrojet was a time-harmonic line current flowing at a (simulated) height of 100 km above northern Fennoscandia. The period simulated was 9 min. The analogue model results confirmed the well-known rapid increase of the vertical field when the coast is approached from the continent. The increase of the horizontal field due to induced ocean currents was demonstrated above the ocean, as well as the essentially negligible effect of these currents on the horizontal field on the continent. The behaviour of the magnetic field is explained with a simple two-dimensional thin-sheet model. The range, or the adjustment distance, of the ocean effect inland was found to be some hundreds of kilometers, which also agrees with earlier results of the Siebert-Kertz separation of IMAGE magnetometer data. The modelled inland anomalies evidently had too large conductivities, but on the other hand, their influence decayed on scales of only some tens of kilometers. Analogue model results, thin-sheet calculations, and field observations show that the induction effect on the horizontal magnetic field B x near the electrojet is negligible. On the other hand, the vertical component B z is clearly affected by induced currents in the ocean. Evidence of this is the shift of the zero point of B z 0-1° southwards from the maximum of B x . The importance of these results are discussed, emphasizing the determination of ionospheric currents." .

The first palaeomagnetic data of South America indicated that the continent remained stationary in similar present-day latitudes during most of the Mesozoic and even the Palaeozoic. However, new palaeomagnetic data suggest that such a scenario is not likely, at least for the Jurassic. In order to test the stationary versus the dynamic-continent model, we studied the Jurassic apparent polar wander paths of the major continents, that is, Eurasia, Africa and North America that all in all show the same shape and chronology of the tracks with respect to those from South America. We thus present a master path that could be useful for the Jurassic Pangea. One of the most remarkable features observed in the path is the change in pole positions at ~197 Ma (Early Jurassic), which denotes the cessation of the counter-clockwise rotation of Pangea and commencement of a clockwise rotation that brought about changes in palaeolatitude and orientation until the end of the Early Jurassic (185 Ma). Here, we analyse a number of phenomena that could have triggered the polar shift between 197 and 185 Ma and conclude that true polar wander is the most likely. In order to do this, we used Morgan’s (Tectonophysics 94:123–139, 1983) grid of hotspots and performed “absolute” palaeogeographical reconstructions of Pangea for the Late Triassic and Jurassic. The palaeolatitudes changes that we observe from our palaeomagnetic data are very well sustained by diverse palaeoclimatic proxies derived from geological and palaeoecological data at this time of both the southern and northern hemispheres." .

Simulations of nine RCMs from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) were analyzed for the study. All the simulations cover 12 years (1996–2008). Using the 95th percentile of daily rainfall as the threshold of extreme events and the simultaneous occurrence of extreme events over 50 % of the East Coast as widespread extreme events (WERE), we compared the characteristics of simulated WERE with observations (GPCP and TRMM) and with the reanalysis (ERAINT) that forced the simulations. Most RCMs perform well in simulating the seasonal variation of WEREs over the East Coast but perform poorly in simulating the interannual variability. Based on their rainfall synoptic patterns over Southern Africa, the WEREs in the East Coast can be generally classified into four groups. The first group connects the WEREs with tropical rainfall activities over the subcontinent. The second group links WEREs with frontal rainfall south of the subcontinent. The third group links the WEREs with both tropical and temperate rainfall activities while the fourth group represents isolated WEREs. The RCMs show different capabilities in simulating the frequency of WERE in each group, some perform better than ERAINT while some perform worse. Results of this study could provide information on the usability of RCMs in downscaling the impact of climate change on widespread extreme rainfall events over South Africa." .

While the VVP’s two historically active volcanoes, Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo, have built scoria cones and lava flows in the adjacent lava fields, several small phreatomagmatic eruptive centers lie along Lake Kivu’s northern shoreline, highlighting the potential for explosive magma-water interaction. Their presence in the densely urbanized Sake-Goma-Gisenyi area necessitates an assessment of their eruptive mechanisms and chronology. Some of these eruptive centers possess multiple vents, and depositional contacts suggest distinct eruptive phases within a single structure. Depositional facies range from polymict tuff breccia to tuff and loose lapilli, often impacted by blocks and volcanic bombs. Along with the presence of dilute pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits, indicators of magma-water interaction include the presence of fine palagonitized ash, ash aggregates, cross-bedding, and ballistic impact sags. We estimate that at least 15 phreatomagmatic eruptions occurred in the Holocene, during which Lake Kivu rose to its current water level. Radiocarbon dates of five paleosols in the top of volcanic tuff deposits range between ∼2500 and ∼150 cal. year bp and suggest centennial- to millennial-scale recurrence of phreatomagmatic activity. A vast part of the currently urbanized zone on the northern shoreline of Lake Kivu was most likely impacted by products from phreatomagmatic activity, including PDC events, during the Late Holocene, highlighting the need to consider explosive magma-water interaction as a potential scenario in future risk assessments." .

The application to the Baltic Sea indicates that the value can amount to approximately 600 billions of SEK (1 Euro = 9.01 SEK, June 3, 2012), which corresponds to 1.9 % of the Baltic Sea region’s total gross domestic product. The largest gains are obtained by Poland because this country faces the largest financial burdens of meeting targets." .

The results range from 1.05 Ma to 3.9 ka, whereas prior published K–Ar and 14C ages range from 620 to 2 ka. The formation of the Serra das Fontes shield volcano started at minimum 1.05 Ma, and the magmatic system was active for ca. 600 ky, as suggested by the formation of the gabbro xenolith by magmatic differentiation. Evolved magmas making up the Serra das Fontes–Serra Branca composite volcano were generated at ca. 450 ka. After a period of ca. 110 ky of volcanic inactivity and erosion of volcanic edifices, volcanism was reactivated with the formation of the Vitória Unit NW platform. Later, the development of the Vulcão Central Unit started with the formation of monogenetic cones located to the south of the Serra das Fontes–Serra Branca–Vitória Unit. This volcanism became progressively more evolved and was concentrated in a main eruptive center, forming the Vulcão Central stratovolcano with an age older than 50 ka. The caldera related to this stratovolcano is older than 47 ka and was followed by effusion of basaltic magmas into the caldera, resulting in the formation of a lava lake, which ultimately spilled over the caldera rim at ca. 11 ka. The most recent eruptions on Graciosa formed two small pyroclastic cones within the caldera and the Pico do Timão cone within the Vitória Unit at ca 3.9 ka." .

These included reflection seismic and refraction seismic lines crossing the Harz in NNE-SSW direction east of Clausthal-Zellerfeld. To complement this data magnetotelluric recordings were acquired in the same area, and a detailed gravity survey covered mainly the northern Harz margin. The investigations were directed primarily to test any evidence for overthrusting along the Harz margin with the possibility of less-consolidated sediments bearing hydrocarbon potential below the more-consolidated Harz sediments of mainly Lower Carboniferous or older age. The reflection seismic lines show mainly discontinuous reflections in several bands, but no single predominant reflection, similar e.g. to that of the Aachen — Faille du Midi overthrust in the western Rhenish Massif has been observed. As a main result of the refraction line the existence of a refracting horizon at a depth of less than 1 km in the NE (between Altenau and Bad Harzburg) has been shown dipping about 3 to 4 degrees to the SW to a depth of about 2500 m (near Herzberg) and continuing further to the south. The refraction velocity of 6250 m/s together with its geological setting favour an interpretation which associates this horizon with the top of the granitic intrusion of the Brocken pluton. It appears to underly the Harz and its southern foreland in great areal extent. No evidence for significant seismic inversion layers has been observed. The results of the magnetotelluric investigations are best explained by unconsolidated and electrically conductive sediments of the northern Harz foreland reaching south below the Harz paleozoic only about 2 km from the northern Harz margin. This agrees with the gravity field of the northern Harz margin which shows that the main increase of the Bouguer anomaly is within a zone of a few kilometers south of the boundary between mesozoic foreland sediments and the Harz paleozoic at the surface. Moreover, many tectonic details of the foreland and the internal tectonic units of the Harz show up on the map of the Bouguer anomaly." .

A key feature to unravel these issues is a detailed seismic image of the crust. A part of the data recorded by the hydrocarbon industry in the late 1970s and 1980s in the North German Basin were released to the public recently. The seismic reflection data were recorded down to 15 s two-way travel time. The mean Common Midpoint fold of about 20 is relatively low compared to contemporary seismic acquisitions. The processing of the 1980s focussed on the sedimentary structures to explore the hydrocarbon potential of this area. We applied the Common Reflection Surface stack technique to the data sets, which is well suited for low-fold data. The reprocessing was focussed on the imaging of the subsedimentary crustal range. The reprocessed images show enhanced reflections, especially in the mid and lower crustal part. Also, the image of the salt structures in the graben area was improved. Furthermore, the reprocessed images indicate an almost flat Moho topography in the area of the Glückstadt Graben and an additional lower crustal structure, which can be correlated with a high-density body found in recent gravity modeling studies." .

An accurate representation of the space–time structure of the event that might occur is, therefore, essential when atmospheric and hydrological models are coupled in order to achieve successful streamflow predictions for medium-sized catchments. Even though the scale compatibility between atmospheric and hydrological models no longer seems to represent a serious problem for a direct one-way coupling, the quality and the reliability of deterministic quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are often unsatisfactory in driving hydrological models. This is because uncertainties in QPFs are, nowadays, still considerable at the scales of interest for hydrological purposes. In this work, different configurations of the non-hydrostatic meteorological model Lokal Modell (LM) have been tested for four rain events, with the aim of improving the description of the phenomena related to the precipitation. Then, LM QPFs have been coupled with the distributed rainfall–runoff model TOPKAPI, in order to assess the results in terms of discharge forecast over the Reno river basin, a medium-sized catchment in northern Italy. The coupling of atmospheric and hydrological models offers a complementary tool to evaluate the meteorological model performance. In addition, an empirical approach is proposed in order to take into account the spatial uncertainty affecting the precipitation forecast. The methodology is based on an ensemble of future rainfall scenarios, which is built by shifting in eight different directions the precipitation patterns forecasted by LM. An ensemble of discharge forecasts is then generated by feeding the hydrological model with these rain time series, thus, enabling a probabilistic approach for flood management. This empirical methodology has been tested for the same four events. Moreover, a statistical analysis has been performed on the discharge predictions driven by the operational version of LM for the autumn seasons in the years 2003–2005, with the aim of assessing systematic model deficiencies. In particular, this investigation aims to define, in terms of the number of LM grid points, the spatial shift more suitable for taking into account the spatial uncertainty of the precipitation forecast, and to establish which shift directions would improve the forecast over the area of interest. The results show that the very-high-resolution (2.8-km) configuration of LM, where an explicit description of the deep precipitating convection is adopted, improves the rainfall forecast considerably, both in terms of the total amount and the timing. Furthermore, the south, west and south-west shift-adjusted scenarios turn out to be useful in improving the discharge forecast for the Reno river basin when the main error source which affects the LM forecast is the spatial localisation of the precipitation field." .

Schulze (Violaceae) are dispersed at different times in different years ((March to June) and are exposed to the irregular rainfall of the dry season in some years. Fluctuations in soil moisture in the dry season represent suboptimal conditions for germination and seedling survival. There are no mechanisms to prevent germination prior to the arrival of consistent rains in the wet season. Among three natural cohorts of seeds followed in two years, the cohort experiencing the longest time from sowing to consistent rains had the highest germination, but it also had the longest time lag from sowing to, beginning of germination, longest germination period, and lowest survival of seedlings 3 months after sowing. Seeds were also induced experimentally to germinate under 14 different moisture patterns. The patterns encompassed 1) varying lengths of moisture before a dry period, 2) inconsistent moisture, and 3) varying lengths of dryness prior to any moisture. Mortality of seeds by fungal infection occurred if the wet period was delayed. But germination was less affected by fluctuations than was seedling survival. Length of the first wet period and frequency of occurrence of the wet period both affected germination levels. Survival and development of seedlings was influenced by the number of days exposed to dry conditions and by the stage of development at the beginning of the dry period. Young seedlings suffered attrition due to drought stress, and older seedlings died from fungal attack. Results from field and experimental sowing of seeds both indicate that this perennial species has minimal defense against germination when conditions are suboptimal for seedling survival. Undoubtedly there is more recruitment in some years than in others." .

The downscaling technique is used for generating synthetic TCs based on TC formation, TC track, and TC intensity models. Results suggest that the downscaling technique can well simulate the spatial distribution of TC activity during the two types of El Niño years and their differences. It is found that the observed changes in TC tracks during the two types of El Niño years are mainly due to the combined effects of changes in TC formation locations and large-scale steering flows. Further examinations have shown that changes in large-scale steering flows play a more important role than changes in TC formation locations. These results are in accordance with the cyclonic circulation anomaly found during the Modoki El Niño years compared to that during the canonical El Niño years. Numerical simulations further suggest that changes in TC tracks between the two types of El Niño years appear to be the most important factor affecting the TC intensity change. Compared to that during the Modoki El Niño years, TC formation is enhanced in the south quadrant of the WNP basin and more TCs take a northwestward track during the canonical El Niño years, leading to a longer TC lifespan and greater TC intensity." .

Because of low mobility of heavy metals in floodplain soils and improvements of water quality, these pollutants will remain in place, and can gradually become covered with less contaminated sediments. Bioturbators, especially earthworms, can play an important role in the mixing and surfacing of contaminated substrate. Surfaced substrate can be redistributed by recurrent flooding events, even to areas outside the floodplain. The question remained to what extent bioturbation by small mammals contributes to the redistribution of heavy metals from river sediments in floodplains. Extensive fieldwork on bioturbators such as voles, moles and earthworms and their distribution patterns, as well as on sediment deposition and bioturbation, was conducted at the ‘Afferdensche en Deestsche Waarden’ floodplain over the years 2001–2003. Field data were combined with data of experiments in field enclosures and substrate columns to calculate the amounts of sediment and heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd) redistributed during the floods as well as on an annual basis. Moles and voles surfaced considerable amounts of substrate and heavy metals, but not as much as earthworms which contribute a substantial proportion of the total deposition and redistribution during floods. Although the impact of moles and voles on the redistribution during floods was only locally important, on an annual basis the bioturbation activity of especially moles in floodplains cannot be neglected. The annual amounts of substrate and heavy metals surfaced by all investigated bioturbators were even larger than the total amounts of substrate and heavy metals deposited during floods." .

This causes a large decrease in the same charge transfer bands attributed to Fe3+ that can be enhanced by heating the same rocks in air at 500°C. This data is interpreted as evidence that the Fe3+ was not in equilibrium in the melt but was produced by cosmic radiation subsequent to the rock formation. The decrease of the Fe3+ charge-transfer bands is accompanied by decrease in intensity of spin-allowed Fe2+ bands attributed toM 1 sites in the pyroxene in rock 12018. This decrease in the Fe2+ bands is attributed to decrease in the Fe2+ → Fe3+ charge-transfer intensification of these Fe2+ spin-allowed transitions when radiation-produced Fe3+ is partially-reduced by the low-temperature heating. The reaction of Fe3+ on heating to 200-225°C is probably Fe3+ + Ti3+ → Fe2+ + Ti4+. This is the reverse of the reaction caused by cosmic ray bombardment of the rock on the lunar surface. Possible tetrahedrally coordinated Fe3+ is present in the meteoritic and lunar augites as suggested by comparison of their spectra to that of terrestrial augite high in Fe3+. This would have been present in the original melt and is distinct from radiation produced Fe3+ in theM-sites. The polarized absorption spectra of single crystal pigeonite and augite from rock 12021 before heating, and augite from 12018 after heating are compared to that of meteoritic titanaugite in the Angra dos Reis meteorite and terrestrial titanaugite from Maui, Hawaii. The absorption spectrum of meteoritic hypersthene (Tatahouine) is also included for comparison to the pigeonite." .

In particular, it has been shown that intraseasonal variations in wintertime Alaska surface air temperature (SAT) is linked with variations in cross-shore surface wind and that this mechanism is driven by a train of Rossby waves originating in the tropics due to MJO forcing. We show, using long station records of Alaska SAT and an independent reconstruction of the MJO index over the twentieth century, that the MJO–SAT connection in Alaska has undergone significant multidecadal variability over the last century. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation appears to explain some of the observed multidecadal variability but fails to capture a large proportion of it. We identify four distinct periods between the years 1910 and 2000 that exhibit either a weak, moderate or strong MJO–SAT connection. The nature of our method ensures that the detected multidecadal variability is due to changes in the teleconnection mechanism and not due to changes in the strength of the MJO index. Finally, we speculate on the mechanism which may bring about such multidecadal variations in the teleconnection mechanism." .

Volcán de Colima’s eruptive cycles of lava dome growth and explosions have been thoroughly monitored during the period 1998–2010 and provide a remarkable opportunity for deepening our understanding of the underlying processes responsible for the evolution of magma properties. Here, we integrate direct observation with analytical and experimental data to: (1) constrain the configuration of the shallow plumbing system and its influence on eruptive activity, (2) describe the rheological behaviour of the magma and (3) assess the conditions that lead to fragmentation and, ultimately, to explosive eruptions. The configuration of the shallow plumbing system was inferred from direct observation of extrusion sites and porosity of the erupted products. During the ongoing eruptive phase, magma was never extruded from a central vent: Both explosive and effusive activities were restricted to discrete vents inside the crater. Extensive field-based density measurements on 500 blocks in pyroclastic flow deposits reveal a bimodality of porosity at values of 12 and 26 vol.%. The least porous rocks tend to be altered, whereas the more porous rocks are pristine. This bimodal distribution, combined with the lack of a central vent, suggests the presence of a central, dense, altered plug, the fragments of which are entrained during explosive eruptions. During effusive periods, the plug appears to deflect the ascent of magma at a shallow depth and, consequently, the site of lava extrusion. The rheological properties and deformation-induced seismogenic behaviour of the magmas were investigated using a uniaxial deformation apparatus instrumented with acoustic sensors. The homogeneity in the physicochemical properties of the erupted magma permits the description of a flow law at eruptive temperature and strain rate conditions. The crystal-rich magma of Volcán de Colima exhibits a shear thinning rheology and becomes increasingly brittle at higher strain rates. Complete failure of magma can be predicted using the material failure forecast method, which integrates the acceleration of released acoustic energy throughout the deformation. Rapid decompression experiments of samples pressurised with argon were performed to assess the fragmentation conditions under which explosive eruptions progress. In the absence of gas loss due to permeable flow, the pore pressure required to fragment volcanic products is inversely proportional to the porosity. At Volcán de Colima, a rapid decompression of >6 MPa is required to fragment magma averaging 26 vol.% pores and to thereby instigate an explosive eruption. Analysis of ballistic impacts (4–6 km away from the vent) from recent explosive eruptions further requires decompression as great as 20 MPa, which is sufficient to disrupt the more porous material as well as a fraction of the denser plug. The continuing growth of a lava dome and of a larger, more impermeable plug could have consequences for the stability of the edifice and development of stronger and more erratic explosive activity at Volcán de Colima." .

It can be noted, that the results for the three indices are distributed quite differently. Furthermore, they respond quite differently to modifications in the input conditions. All of them show particular limitations and shortcomings that have to be considered and discussed.

Of these, picrite, monchiquite, nephelinite and phonolite have been studied here. Whole rock and mineral geochemical data indicate that monchiquites evolved from a picritic primary magma by olivine+ magnetite fractionation and subsequent steps involving magma mixing at crustal levels. None of these processes or assimilation/magma mixing of wall rocks or other plutonic rocks within the complex can entirely explain the geochemical and Nd–Sr-isotopic characteristics of the monchiquites (i.e. a covariant alignment between (87Sr/86Sr)370=0.70367, (143Nd/144Nd)370=0.51237 and (87Sr/86Sr)370=0.70400, (143Nd/144Nd)370=0.51225 representing the end points of the array). This signature points to isotopic heterogeneities of the mantle source of the dyke-producing magma. The four mantle components (i.e. depleted mantle, lower mantle plume component, EMI-like component and EMII-like component) must occur in different proportions on a small scale in order to explain the isotopic variations of the dyke rocks. The EMII-like component might be incorporated into the source area of the primary magma by carbonatitic fluids involving subducted crustal material. The most likely model to explain the small-scale isotopic heterogeneity is plume activity. The results of this study do not provide any support to a cogenetic origin (e.g. fractionation or liquid immiscibility) for carbonatite and monchiquite or other alkali-silicate dyke rocks occurring in spatial proximity. Instead, we propose that both, carbonatite and picrite/monchiquite, originated by low-degree partial melting of peridotite. Textural observations, mineralogical data, and C and O isotopic compositions suggest incorporation of calcite from carbonatite in monchiquite and the occurrence of late-stage carbothermal fluids." .

It is a one-layer model of Hansen type with grid resolution of 0.5° on the longitude and 0.25° on the latitude. The open boundary of the model is in the Danish Straits. At the boundary water elevations are computed from a regression model containing the hydrostatic approximation. Also tidal effects are included in the open boundary elevations. The wind stress is calculated from atmospheric pressures given by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The pressures are in 150 km grid, from which they are interpolated using bicubic splines down into the grid size of the circulation model. The effect of different wind stress models is discussed in connection with the two computed periods December 1975 and 1 to 17 September 1977." .

Correlation coefficients of the moving averages of monthly rainfall with annual rainfall showed significant correlations between the decline in the annual rainfall with decreased rainfall in August. Analysis of daily rainfall data for rainy season parameters of interest to agriculture suggested that from 1965 there was a significant decrease in the amount of rainfall and in the number of rainy days in the months of July and August, resulting in a decreased volume of rainfall for each rainstorm. In comparison to the period 1945–64, major shifts have occurred in the average dates of onset and ending of rains during 1965–88. The length of the growing season was reduced by 5–20 days across different locations in Niger. The standard deviation for the onset and ending of the rains as well as the length of the growing season has increased, implying that cropping has become more risky. Water balance calculations also demonstrated that the probability of rainfall exceeding potential evapotranspiration decreased during the growing season. The implications of these changes for agriculture in Niger are discussed using field data." .

The deposit exhibits a matrix facies containing up to 16 wt% of clays. However, the stratigraphic relationship of the deposit with respect to the Canguahua Formation, a widespread indurated volcaniclastic material in the Ecuadorian inter-Andean Valley, and the deposit alteration mineralogy differ depending on location. Thus, two different deposits are identified. The Río Granobles debris flow deposit (~1 km3) is characterised by the alteration mineral assemblage smectite + jarosite, and sulphur isotopic analyses point to a supergene hydrothermal alteration environment. This deposit probably derives from a debris avalanche initiated before 14–21 ka by collapse of a hydrothermally altered rock mass from the volcano summit. In contrast, the alteration mineralogy of the second debris flow deposit, which may itself comprise more than one unit, is dominated by halloysite + smectite and relates to a shallower and more recent (<13 ky) mass movement of high-altitude (>3200 m) volcanic soils. Our study reinforces the significance of hydrothermal alteration in weakening volcano flanks and in favouring rapid transformation of a volcanic debris avalanche into a clay-rich debris flow. It also demonstrates that mineralogical analysis provides crucial information for resolving the origin of a debris flow deposit in volcanic terrains. Finally, we posit that slope instability, promoted by ongoing subglacial hydrothermal alteration, remains a significant hazard at Cayambe Volcanic Complex." .

Here, we present the results of research based on X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman microprobe spectrum, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses, Scanning transmission X-ray microscope (STXM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses to further understand the weathering of orpiment- and realgar-bearing tailings from the Shimen realgar deposit, the largest realgar deposit in Asia. These analyses indicate that four different types of As-bearing secondary minerals are present in the tailings, including arsenic oxides, arsenates, As-gypsum, and As–Fe minerals, and that arsenic in the tailings is present in +3 and +5 valence states. The precipitation of arsenates is attributed to the interaction between As-enriched run-off waters and carbonate minerals. The Ca-arsenates in the tailings are dominantly weilite and pharmacolite, both of which have Ca/As atomic ratios of 1. In addition, SO4 2−/HAsO4 2− substitution in gypsum is another important mechanism of arsenic precipitation." .

It has two main objectives: (1) comparison between two climatological periods (2001–2010 and 1971–2000) and (2) trend analysis of climate variables. Time series of meteorological and rain gauge stations from Central Brazil have been organized in a databank, which contains tools for homogeneity tests. From that, 4 temperature and 55 precipitation time series were sufficient homogeneous, while 1 temperature and 5 precipitation time series were identified as inhomogeneous. Reliable spatial distribution was produced using proper interpolation method. Trends and significance levels were calculated by Rapp’s estimator of slope and Mann–Kendall test, respectively. The most important results of the comparisons and trend analysis in the last four decades are: (1) marked increase in annual and seasonal mean surface air temperature, (2) evident decreases of accumulated rainfall in winter and autumn, and (3) apparent increase of precipitation amounts in the rainy season." .

Although important, these data are available for few volcanoes because they have traditionally been difficult to obtain and are usually measured on gas samples collected from fumaroles. We present new field measurements of bulk plume composition and stable isotopes (δ13CCO2 and δ18OH2O+CO2) carried out at three northern Chilean volcanoes using MultiGAS and isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy. Carbon and oxygen in magmatic gas plumes of Lastarria and Isluga volcanoes have δ13C in CO2 of +0.76‰ to +0.77‰ (VPDB), similar to slab carbonate; and δ18O in the H2O + CO2 system ranging from +12.2‰ to +20.7‰ (VSMOW), suggesting significant contributions from altered slab pore water and carbonate. The hydrothermal plume at Tacora has lower δ13CCO2 of −3.2‰ and δ18OH2O+CO2 of +7.0‰, reflecting various scrubbing, kinetic fractionation, and contamination processes. We show the isotopic characterization of volcanic gases in the field to be a practical complement to traditional sampling methods, with the potential to remove sampling bias that is a risk when only a few samples from accessible fumaroles are used to characterize a given volcano’s volatile output. Our results indicate that there is a previously unrecognized, relatively heavy isotopic signature to bulk volcanic gas plumes in the Central Andes, which can be attributed to a strong influence from components of the subducting slab, but may also reflect some local crustal contamination. The techniques we describe open new avenues for quantifying the roles that subduction zones and arc volcanoes play in the global carbon cycle." .

Evapotranspiration during recharge increased solute concentrations by factors of ∼5–50 in deep palaeowaters, while higher degrees of evapotranspiration have occurred in shallow, modern groundwater. Aquifer sediments (loess) contain approximately 15 weight% calcite; trends in groundwater HCO3 concentrations and δ13C values (ranging from −16.4 to −8.2‰) indicate that carbonate weathering is a significant source of DIC. Groundwater 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7110–0.7162, median of 0.7116) are similar to those in both loess carbonate (0.7109–0.7116) and local rainfall (0.7112), and are significantly lower than Sr in aquifer silicates (0.7184–0.7251). Despite evidence for substantial carbonate dissolution, groundwater is generally Ca-poor (< 10% of total cations) and Na-rich, due to cation exchange. Saturation with respect to carbonate minerals occurs during or soon after recharge (all calcite and dolomite saturation indices are positive). Subsequent carbonate dissolution in the deep aquifer must occur as a second-stage process, in response to Ca loss (by ion exchange) and/or via incongruent dissolution of dolomite and impure calcite. The latter is consistent with positive correlations between δ13C values and Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios (r 2 = 0.32 and 0.34)." .

The pollen and spores from the Late Miocene strata of a borehole in Lop Nur were analyzed with a view to interpreting the paleoenvironmental evolution of Lop Nur. Main types of pollen such as Chenopodiaceae, Nitraria, Ephedra and Artemisia reflect an arid climate. By collating the palynological data in this area as recorded in other literature and by applying the method of Coexistence Analysis, we have obtained the paleoclimatic parameters from Late Miocene to Holocene in Lop Nur. These suggest that temperatures increased from the Late Miocene (10.2°C) to the Pliocene (13.4°C), decreased from Pliocene to Pleistocene (4.7°C), and were more stable from Holocene (12.1°C) until now (11.5°C). The precipitation was stable (about 900 mm) from Late Miocene to Early Pleistocene, then decreased markedly (to about 300 mm) in Middle and Late Pleistocene, and reached its lowest value (17.4 mm) in the Holocene. The changes in paleoclimate at Lop Nur provide new evidence for understanding the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau." .

In the present work we conducted a structural analysis of the rocks below the surface of the gravitational slide of Tazo (La Gomera, Canary Islands) and determined the epigenetic processes involved in the filling of the amphitheatre. We also inferred the possible triggering phenomena related to the Tazo landslide. The rocks located below the surface of the gravitational slide of Tazo -i.e., the basaltic lava flows, sills and dikes of the Lower Old Edifice and the submarine volcanic rocks, gabbros, pyroxenites and dikes of the Basal Complex of La Gomera- are strongly deformed close to this sliding surface. The lava flows and dikes of the Lower Old Edifice are folded, with fault breccias and gouges, and locally foliated, defining the sliding surface. The dikes of the Basal Complex are also folded, and the gabbros and pyroxenites are affected by a large number of small faults. In the Basal Complex, the sliding surface is defined by a foliated granular gouge. In the damage zone, the Basal Complex rocks show an incipient fracture cleavage. The sliding amphitheatre has been filled by the debris avalanche or cohesive debris flow generated within the slide, as well as by later debris flows, hyperconcentrated flows, sheet flows, and by interspersed lava flows from the Upper Old Edifice. We suggest here that the collapse of the north-western flank of the Lower Old Edifice at Tazo could in part have been triggered by continuous magma injection, associated with the emplacement of dikes in a rift zone with an ENE-WSW direction, enhanced by the mechanical weakness of the Basal Complex unit, which was affected by hydrothermal metamorphism under greenschist facies conditions and by the displacement along the Montaña de Alcalá and Guillama normal faults, which are deeply entrenched in the altered rocks of the Basal Complex." .

Additionally, solar activity occasionally falls into a prolonged quiet phase (grand solar minimum), as represented by the Maunder Minimum in the 17th century, when sunspots were almost absent for 70 years and the length of the Schwabe cycle increased to 14 years. To examine the consistency of the cycle length characteristics during the grand solar minima, the carbon-14 contents in single-year tree rings were measured using an accelerator mass spectrometer as an index of the solar variability during the grand solar minimum of the 4th century BC. The signal of the Schwabe cycle was detected with a statistical confidence level of higher than 95 % by wavelet analysis. This is the oldest evidence for the Schwabe cycle at the present time, and the cycle length is considered to have increased to approximately 16 years during the grand solar minimum of the 4th century BC. This result confirms the association between the increase of the Schwabe cycle length and the weakening of solar activity, and indicates the possible prolonged absence of sunspots in the 4th century BC as during the Maunder Minimum. Theoretical implications from solar dynamo theory are discussed in order to identify the trigger of prolonged sunspot absence. A possible association between the long-term solar variation around the 4th century BC and terrestrial cooling in this period is also discussed." .

The latter isograd corresponds approximately to the thermal maximum of the alpidic metamorphism in the central part of this area. An estimate of P, T, X fluid conditions can be obtained from phase relations among muscovite, biotite, chlorite, margarite, tremolite, zoisite, anorthite, quartz, calcite, and dolomite in the system K2O-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O-CO2 which approximates the composition of marls. Calculations based on various experimental and thermodynamic data have been made with emphasis on phase relations pertinent to a group of carbonate rocks with very low Fe and Na contents in non-opaque minerals. Significant and opposite deviations from the phase relations for stochiometric end member mineral compositions are due to the substitutions F-OH and Mg+Si-2Al. Consistency of observed and calculated phase relations is favoured by high F-contents. For the majority of carbonate rocks in the high metamorphic zone, maximum temperatures around 550° C, minimum pressures of 4–6 kb, and relatively low XCO2 values within the stability field of zoisite and of biotite+calcite+quartz are indicated." .

The last ten time series are used as a prediction set to check the predictive ability of the candidate model produced by a training sample using autoregressive integrated moving average modeling techniques. The model is used to forecast future recurrence rates that, in turn, are used to develop a continuous mean function of the volcanic process, which is not only required to evaluate the probability of site disruption by volcanic activity but accommodates a long period of compliance. At the model validation stage, our candidate model forecasts a mean number of 6.196 eruptions for the prediction set which accounts for seven volcanic events of the 33 post-12-Ma eruptions at the YM site. For a full-scaled forecasting, our fitted model predicts a waning volcanism producing only 3.296 new eruptions in the next million years. We then present the site disruption probability as the chance that a new eruption will occur in the “hazard area” based on a model developed for licensing commercial space launch and reentry operations in the space transportation industry. The results of the site disruption probability and sensitivity analysis are summarized with a numerical table generated from a simple equation sufficient for practical use. We also produce three-dimensional plots to visualize the nonlinearity of the intensity function associated with the underlying model of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process and emphasize that the interpretation of site disruption probability should always be accompanied by a compliance period." .

The influence of the Sveconorwegian orogeny (1200–900 Ma) is restricted to the region south of Moldefjord-Romsdalen. A series of anorthosites and related intrusives are present, possibly derived from the now-lost western margin of the Baltic craton that may have been emplaced in the WGR as an allochthonous unit before the Ordovician. The Caledonian development is split into two orogenic phases, the Finnmarkian (Cambrian — Early Ordovician) and the Scandian (Late Ordovician/Early Silurian — Devonian). The lower tectonic units west of the Trondheim Trough may be Finnmarkian nappes ; they were part of the lower plate during the Scandian continental collision. The Blåhö nappe is correlated with dismembered eclogite bodies along the coast. A regional change of nappe transport direction from 090 to 135 marks the initiation of an orogen-parallel sinistral shear component around 425 Ma. The change caused the development of a complex sinistral strike-slip system in the Trondheim region consisting of the Möre-Tröndelag Fault Zone and the Gränse contact. The latter cut the crust underneath the already emplaced Trondheim Nappe Complex, thus triggering the intrusion of the Fongen-Hyllingen igneous complex, and initiating subsidence of the Trondheim Trough, and was subsequently turned from a strike-slip zone into an extensional fault. Minor southward transport of the Trondheim Nappe Complex rejuvenated some thrusts between the Lower and the Middle Allochthon. A seismic reflector underneath the WGR is interpreted to be a blind thrust which subcrops into the Faltungsgraben. During Middle Devonian orogenic collapse, detachment faulting brought higher units, now eroded elsewhere, down to the present outcrop level, such as the Bergen and Dalsfjord nappe and the Old Red basins." .

A six hidden states HMM was selected based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and every hidden state has distinct rainfall characteristics. Three of the states were found to correspond by wet conditions; while the remaining three states were found to correspond to dry conditions. The six hidden states were found to correspond with the associated atmospheric composites. The relationships between El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Pacific Ocean are found regarding interannual variability. The wet (dry) states were found to be well correlated with a Niño 3.4 index which was used to characterize the intensity of an ENSO event.

Marked rain deficits have coincided with increased water runoff, meaning less water availability for the vegetation. Conversely, changes in vegetation cover have had strong repercussions on the hydrologic cycle. To study these phenomena, the coupling of two explicit, process-based models, of catchment hydrology and of mixed vegetation cover, respectively, has been undertaken and applied to a 2 km2 site in Niger. Some of the first significant results are presented herein. Some are consistent with intuitive judgments that can be made in the absence of a coupled model, others are much less so and show that representation through model coupling of hydrosphere/biosphere interactions is essential to produce more reliable analyses and projections. In particular, it is found that the relation of biomass productivity to rainfall under this dry, water-limited climate is not as straightforward as one would expect, more specifically, that its main control may not be the total season rainfall." .

This indicated an active role of saccus vasculosus in osmoregulation. Autoradiographic analysis of brains from injected fish that had received a saccus vasculosus homogenate from sea water adapted specimens, in which the coronet cells of saccus vasculosus had previously been labelled with 3H-glucoseamine, revealed actual incorporation of labelled material into brain cells, especially in the hypothalamic region. The intracellular distribution of labelled material in the coronet cells of rainbow trout labelled with 3H-glucoseamine strongly indicates that such material represents a secretory product; it is therefore probable that the observed incorporation of label into brain cells of injected fish actually reflects normal processing of material secreted from the coronet cells. In the scanning electron microscope, the inside wall of the third brain ventricle of the rainbow trout was in many areas found to be covered with cilia. These apparently serve to keep liquor in circulation. The observation, both in injected and control animals, of free globules among these cilia supports the idea of an intra-ventricular transport of detached coronet cell material to the infundibular recess, as indicated by the autoradiographic analysis." .

This work reveals the evolution process of the seafloor, which is divided into 49 accretion areas and 6 accretion periods.

ENSO affects the regional climatic regime in SW Europe, thus tree performance in the Iberian Peninsula could be affected by recent ENSO dynamics. We established four Quercus robur chronologies of earlywood and latewood widths in the NW Iberian Peninsula. The relationship between tree growth and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the atmospheric expression of ENSO, showed that only latewood growth was correlated negatively with the SOI of the previous summer–autumn–winter. This relationship was non-stationary, with significant correlations only during the period 1952–1980; and also non-linear, with enhanced latewood growth only in La Niña years, i.e. years with a negative SOI index for the previous autumn. Non-linear relationship between latewood and SOI indicates an asymmetric influence of ENSO on tree performance, biassed towards negative SOI phases. During La Niña years, climate in the study area was warmer and wetter than during positive years, but only for 1952–1980. Winter temperatures became the most limiting factor for latewood growth since 1980, when mean regional temperatures increased by 1°C in comparison to previous periods. As a result, higher winter respiration rates, and the extension of the growing season, would probably cause an additional consumption of stored carbohydrates. The influence of ENSO and winter temperatures proved to be of great importance for tree growth, even at lower altitudes and under mild Atlantic climate in the NW Iberian Peninsula." .

The pre-existing mineral assemblages are remnants of low pressure high temperature metamorphism of Permian age. The garnet reaction rims grew during the Cretaceous eclogite facies overprint. Reaction rim growth involved transfer of Fe and Mg components from the garnet-biotite interface to the garnet-feldspar interface and transfer of the Ca component in the opposite direction. The garnets show complex, asymmetrical chemical zoning, which reflects the relative contributions of short circuit diffusion along grain boundaries within the polycrystalline garnet reaction rims and volume diffusion through the grain interiors on bulk mass transfer. It is demonstrated by numerical modelling that the spacing of the grain boundaries, i.e. the grain size of the garnet in the reaction rim is a first order control on its internal chemical zoning." .

The luminescence of all detrital and diagenetic minerals such as quartz, feldspar, phyllosilicates, carbonates, apatites, zircons etc. can now be quantitatively characterized by spectroscopy. For siliciclastic sediments, the potential for provenance studies has been explored because varying conditions at the time of formation (e.g. of quartz and zircons) might be encoded within the CL and therefore provide fingerprints for particular grain populations. Different cement generations allow a cement stratigraphy to be established and the deconvolution of the diagenetic history of carbonate and clastic sediments. CL investigations of carbonate, apatite and – with some limitations – siliceous biogenic skeletons provide evidence of growth zonation (ontogenetic cyclicities and changes in spatial distribution) and diagenesis (intra-skeleton cementation and recrystallization). However, further research using CL is required to fully understand detrital components, primary and secondary mineralization in sedimentary deposits and biogenic materials. We present here an, admittedly incomplete, overview of these developments." .

The Afyon Zone contains widespread metavolcanic rocks, which are dominated by rhyolite, dacite, and trachyandesite. They form a distinct volcanic succession, which is separated from the underlying Silurian–Lower Carboniferous metacarbonates and meta-siliciclastics by a regional unconformity. Trachyandesitic metavolcanics are made up of massive lava flows, pyroclastics and epiclastics, less frequently, domes and dikes, which were developed on a deeply eroded subaerial landmass. U/Pb and Pb/Pb zircon geochronology yielded Lower Triassic (~250 Ma) ages, which are interpreted as extrusion age of trachyandesitic volcanics.

The REY distribution patterns indicate that the light REY is enriched and show a well-pronounced Eu minimum. The fractionation of individual light-REY is higher than that of the heavy-REY. The REY distribution through the K2 coal seam shows that the top and bottom portion of the coal seam have a lower content of REY than the middle portion.

The REY distributions through the coal seam, SEM-EDX data and the correlation analysis between ash yields and the concentrations have revealed that the REY mainly occurs in the organic matter. The K2 coal is a potential rare-metal resource due to its high REY contents, and the coal ash could be regarded as a new and promising raw material for recovery of REY as a by-product." .

Errors of both the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) simulation and the tree-ring reconstruction were considered to optimize the combination of the two elements. Variance matching was used to reconstruct the surface temperature series. The model simulation provided the background field, and the error covariance matrix was estimated statistically using samples from the simulation results with a running 31-year window for each grid. Thus, the merging process could continue with a time-varying gain matrix. This merging method (MM) was tested using two types of experiment, and the results indicated that the standard deviation of errors was about 0.4 °C lower than the tree-ring reconstructions and about 0.5 °C lower than the model simulation. Because of internal variabilities and uncertainties in the external forcing data, the simulated decadal warm–cool periods were readjusted by the MM such that the decadal variability was more reliable (e.g., the 1940–1960s cooling). During the two centuries (1601–1800 AD) of the preindustrial period, the MM results revealed a compromised spatial pattern of the linear trend of surface temperature, which is in accordance with the phase transition of the Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Compared with pure CCSM4 simulations, it was demonstrated that the MM brought a significant improvement to the decadal variability of the gridded temperature via the merging of temperature-sensitive tree-ring records." .

Italy), a continuous section through a former lower continental crust is exposed (Schenk 1984, 1985). These granulite facies rocks have not been penetratively deformed during their uplift to higher crustal levels. Therefore, they allow to study the structural state of the lower continental crust. Most rockforming minerals, among them ortho- and clinopyroxene and cordierite, show recrystallization structures. Quarz basal subgrain boundaries are developed in lower levels of the lower crust and disappear toward higher levels. In addition to dimensional orientations of the rockforming minerals, the preferred crystallographic orientations of plagioclases, cordierite, amphibole, pyroxenes and, rarely, quartz reflect the strain orientation of the prograde high-T deformation. During this deformation, the stretching direction was constant NNE-SSW throughout the exposed lower crustal section. Shear indicators are rare. This points to the fact that deformation has been homogeneous and coaxial flattening. There is only a small variation in orientation and strength of textures throughout the exposed lower crust. Therefore, neighbouring layers of different composition rather than different deformation might serve as seismic reflectors in the former lower crust." .

The conditions of basin development in the eastern part of the CVP have been elucidated by using sedimentological and geomorphological approaches. The prevailing tectonic regime, its extent and causes are also discussed. Sedimentological analysis supported by geomorphological observations revealed a major NE-trending probably normal, border fault and its several synthetics. This tectonic element constitutes the SE margin of the basin and divided the CVP from the Tauride range during Middle Miocene to Pliocene. The basin fill in the study area comprises gravelly alluvial fans near the border fault, while fluvial clastics and lacustrine carbonates dominate towards the centre. Some pyroclastic rocks and lava flows are also made part of the fill. The southeastern basin margin is characterized morphologically by a number of uplifted basement blocks, probably associated with synthetic faults, and some deeply incised canyons in the footwall. These canyons were subsequently filled with a Mid-Pliocene ignimbrite sheet, and represent the sediment supply conduits to the basin. The cessation of filling in the basin was determined by strike-slip faults that uplifted and detached the basin about 2.6 Ma. This date also marks the onset of the neotectonic period in the region. The overall extensional tectonic regime inferred for the eastern CVP appears coeval with events recognised in the southern basins, i.e. Adana and Mut Basins and the eastern Mediterranean. Some physical connections between these basins also have been demonstrated. It is suggested that the CVP and the southern basins were all created during a phase of extension resulting from continued northward subduction of the African plate beneath the Eurasia during the Late Cenozoic." .

Valles caldera in New Mexico and Lake City caldera in Colorado are well-studied resurgent structures which provide three crucial clues for understanding the resurgence process. (1) Within the limits of 40Ar/39Ar dating techniques, resurgence and hydrothermal alteration at both calderas occurred very quickly after the caldera-forming eruptions (tens of thousands of years or less). (2) Immediately before and during resurgence, dacite magma was intruded and/or erupted into each system; this magma is chemically distinct from rhyolite magma which was resident in each system. (3) At least 1 km of structural uplift occurred along regional and subsidence faults which were closely associated with shallow intrusions or lava domes of dacite magma. These observations demonstrate that resurgence at these two volcanoes is temporally linked to caldera subsidence, with the upward migration of dacite magma as the driver of resurgence. Recharge of dacite magma occurs as a response to loss of lithostatic load during the caldera-forming eruption. Flow of dacite into the shallow magmatic system is facilitated by regional fault systems which provide pathways for magma ascent. Once the dacite enters the system, it is able to heat, remobilize, and mingle with residual crystal-rich rhyolite remaining in the shallow magma chamber. Dacite and remobilized rhyolite rise buoyantly to form laccoliths by lifting the chamber roof and producing surface resurgent uplift. The resurgent deformation caused by magma ascent fractures the chamber roof, increasing its structural permeability and allowing both rhyolite and dacite magmas to intrude and/or erupt together. This sequence of events also promotes the development of magmatic–hydrothermal systems and ore deposits. Injection of dacite magma into the shallow rhyolite magma chamber provides a source of heat and magmatic volatiles, while resurgent deformation and fracturing increase the permeability of the system. These changes allow magmatic volatiles to rise and meteoric fluids to percolate downward, favouring the development of hydrothermal convection cells which are driven by hot magma. The end result is a vigorous hydrothermal system which is driven by magma recharge." .

This study was initiated since the impact of stylolites in defining critical geomechanical, fluid flow and petophysical properties is not well-known. A total of nine carbonate samples from Turkey and seven from Malaysia were used in this study. The carbonate rocks have varied composition and have heterogeneous distribution of certain components such as stylolites, fractures and algal remains. Fabric, presence of stylolites as well as fractures have a controlling effect on the stress response and the contractional strain of carbonates from Malaysia and Turkey. The formation of stylolites and the location of the stylolites are independent of the rock fabric and the applied stress. Faces with stylolites showed a high degree of variability in terms of thermal conductivity when estimated at various points. Samples from Malaysia that consisted of stylolites generally had low thermal conductivity values compared with the non-stylolitic faces. The current study indicates that the stylolites present in these rocks have the potential to increase the permeability of the carbonate rock. It is even more interesting to note that in the region immediately bordering the stylolites, is occupied by fractured calcite crystals. However, the varied surface roughness indicates that the boundary conditions which define fluid flow in porous media would be very different within this stylolitic region." .

Using in situ zircon dating and Hf isotopic analysis by LA-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively, a detrital zircon of ∼4040 Ma age was found in sedimentary sequences from the Aermantai ophiolitic mélange, East Junggar. This is the oldest age record in the East Junggar terrane, and also marks the first zircon locality in the CAOB with an age older than 4.0 Ga, which is attributed to the Hadean crust. The ∼4040 Ma detrital zircon has an ɛHf(t) value of −5.2 and a two-stage Hf modal age of 4474 Ma, suggesting the presence of very old (Hadean) crustal material in the source area. Beside peak ages of 446 Ma, we found four age groups of 3.6-3.1 Ga, 2.53–2.37 Ga, 1.14–0.89 Ga and 0.47–0.42 Ga from 141 effective measuring points. The age of 426±4 Ma for the five youngest detrital zircons defines the lower limit of the deposition time of sedimentary sequencess in the Aermantai ophiolitic mélange. The 0.47–0.42 Ga zircons exhibit 176Hf/177Hf ratios of 0.282156 to 0.282850, corresponding to variable ɛ Hf(t) values from −9.3 to 12.0 and Hf model ages from 2011 to 646 Ma. These characteristics are similar to those of the early Paleozoic igneous and gneissic zircons from the Altai, but significantly different from those of the East Junggar. Based on the material structures of felspathic greywacke, the morphology, internal texture and age distributions of dated detrital zircons, in combination with a study of the regional geological data, it is suggested that the sedimentary sequences in the Aermantai ophiolitic mélange was deposited in the Late Silurian, with the main provenance from the Altai Orogen in the north. This indicates that the early Paleozoic ocean represented by the Aermantai ophiolitic mélange was readily closed during the Late Silurian, and the northern edge of the East Junggar terrane was accreted to the Altai Orogen. The joint of them then served as a marginal orogen in the southern edge of the Siberia Paleocontinent." .

Output from a global climate model (GISS) was used to modify the weather data base to account for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The simulations predict that, after climate change, epilimnetic temperatures will be higher but increase less than air temperature, hypolimnetic temperatures in seasonally stratified dimictic lakes will be largely unchanged or even lower than at present, evaporative water loss will be increased by as much as 300 mm for the season, onset of stratification will occur earlier and overturn later in the season, and overall lake stability will become greater in spring and summer." .

This analysis was performed using climate data obtained with the use of the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM). We calibrated the SDSM using the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis dataset for the SDSM input and daily time series of temperature and CLD from 10 surface data points (SDP) in Shikoku. Subsequently, we validated the SDSM outputs, specifically, TMIN, TMAX, and CLD, obtained with the use of the NCEP reanalysis dataset and general circulation model (GCM) data against the SDP. The GCM data used in the validation procedure were those from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3) for the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 scenarios and from the third generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM3) for the SRES A2 and A1B scenarios. Finally, the validated SDSM was run to study the effect of future changes in CLD on TMIN and TMAX. Our analysis showed that (1) the negative linear fit between changes in TMAX and those in CLD was statistically significant in winter while the relationship between the two changes was not evident in summer, (2) the dependency of future changes in TMAX and TMIN on future changes in CLD were more evident in winter than in other seasons with the present SDSM, (3) the diurnal temperature range (DTR) decreased in the southern part of Shikoku in summer in all the SDSM projections while DTR increased in the northern part of Shikoku in the same season in these projections, (4) the dependencies of changes in DTR on changes in CLD were unclear in summer and winter.

The annual values in the series 1760–1957 are used to compute the temporal variability of accumulation. The procedure to estimate the errors in the identification of annual layers is discussed, and the significance of these errors in the analysis of the series is examined. The variability of the 198 annual accumulation values is slightly less than that of precipitation series obtained at two stations, one at high latitude and one at high elevation. A variance analysis of the South Pole series indicates that there is, with a high degree of probability, an increase in the rate of snow accumulation with time not due to chance, from approximately 5.4 g·cm−2·yr−1 in the first 66 years (1760–1825) to approximately 7.5 g·cm−2·yr−1 in the last 66 years of the series. The area of the region for which there is a positive secular change in the rate of accumulation during the last 200 years remains unknown. The serial correlation computed for time lags from one to twelve years shows that significant periodicities do not exist in this series. The identification of annual layers in five isolated sets comprising from 4 to 8 layers each and included in the period 1536±42–1760±13 suggests that the mean accumulation for the period circa 1550–1750 is approximately the same as that determined in the 1760–1957 series." .

Thus, areas with severe erosion such as the Loess Plateau in China are particularly vulnerable to highly concentrated precipitation events due to climate change. In this study, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns in the concentration of rainfall in the Middle Yellow River (MYR) from the last 56 years (1958–2013). We used daily and monthly precipitation data from 26 meteorological stations in the study area to calculate the precipitation concentration index (PCI) and the concentration index (CI). The southern and northern parts of the MYR were characterized by a lower CI with a decreasing trend, while the middle parts had a higher CI with an increasing trend. High PCI values occurred in the southern MYR, while lower PCIs with a more homogenous rainfall distribution were found mainly in the northern parts of the MYR. The annual PCI and CI exhibited positive trends at most stations, although only a minority of stations had significant trends (P < 0.05). At seasonal scales, CI exhibited significantly increasing trends in winter at most stations, while a few stations had significant trends in the other three seasons. These findings provide important reference information to facilitate ecological restoration and farming operations in the study region." .

The measured subsidence rates, as well as a comparison between densities of paleodolines computed in randomly selected scan-lines and density of active dolines computed in maps, suggest that present-day subsidence in favourable areas is more intense than that of Pleistocene times. According to diachronic maps drawn from (a) different aerial photographs taken after 1946 and (b) field surveys on deformations in urbanized areas, subsidence behaved as a nearly steady process while the whole area was used for agriculture. In contrast, rapid changes (through periods of several tens of years) have occurred in urbanized areas, in which dolines expand their boundaries through small marginal collapses, shifting sharply their sinking centres to neighbouring sites. These rapid changes do not have an equivalent in observed paleodolines." .

The aim of the investigation was to improve the understanding of the thermal evolution of the basin and its influence on possible petroleum systems. The 2D model of the subsurface is based on one seismic line and data from two exploration wells. Both wells TD’ed in Triassic sediments. The updoming of the Ringkøbing-Fyn High began during Late Carboniferous–Early Permian. At the end of the Permian the Horn Graben became active due to regional extension. The subsequent sedimentation history from Triassic to date is well recorded by well reports. A matter of debate has been whether or not significant amounts of Pre-Permian sediments exist in this area of the North Sea. Since organic material rich Paleozoic sediments serve as source rocks in widespread areas of North Germany and the southern North Sea it would be of great importance to know whether the same deposits exist in the Horn Graben. Nielsen et al. (Bull Geol Soc Denmark Copenhagen 45:1–10, 1998) introduced a model, which shows Paleozoic sediments covering the basement at a maximum depth of 6.5 km. Assuming, Paleozoic sediments are underlying the Permian salt deposits there should be an active petroleum system present. The 2D model includes the Paleozoic source rock and tries to explain why two exploration wells have not found petroleum." .

The temperature profiles derived from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) along with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis are used to investigate the gravity wave (GW) variations during these SSW events. Some phenomena are characterized and possible mechanisms are discussed. The GW variations during both types of SSW events shared some similarities. During the warming events, enhanced zonal mean GW amplitudes are detected. The enhancements of GW amplitudes first appeared at higher altitudes and then progressed downward during the major warming events. The downward progressions correspond well with the height variations of the zonal wind reversal, and the enhancements seem to occur at the same time with the wind reversal. The spatial variations of GWs showed evident correlation to the polar vortex. Generally, GWs were enhanced at the edge of the polar vortex where the background wind was strong, whereas the areas with the largest GW amplitudes did not always correspond with those with the strongest background wind. The differences during the two types of SSW are also noticeable. In the 2008 major event, the magnitudes of the zonal mean GW enhancements during the downward progression were relatively stable, whereas in the 2009 major event, a clear reduction was detected as the GW enhancement was progressing downward. Also, the recovery time of the polar vortex was longer in 2009. These differences indicate that different types of SSWs may have different impacts on the GW." .

Zoning in the spinels is thought to be the result of a combination of exsolution, postdepositional diffusion and replacement processes. Multiphase, globular silicate inclusions — mainly biotite and amphibole, also orthopyroxene, serpentine and chlorite — are present in euhedral, largely homogeneous chromian spinels which occur in a matrix of poikilitic amphibole. The enclosed minerals have similar compositions to the minerals in the host rock. These silicate inclusions are interpreted as being due to a late magmatic introduction of a hydrous K-Ca-rich melt phase, contaminated by wall-rock interaction, into a semi-solidified olivine (± pyroxenes) cumulate. The composition of the chromian spinel may be used as an indicator for sulfide mineralization conditions (Johan 1979). The data reported in this paper are compatible with Johan's model." .

Vulcanian eruptions at Suwanosejima for the period from October 2009 to 2011 are often preceded by a sudden cessation of continuous tremor associated with continuous ash emissions. The amplitude of continuous tremor decreases within about 10 s, and tilt signal starts to show uplift of the active crater. Then, the pause of continuous tremor and uplift continue for about 1–2 min, and tilt amplitudes reach a few tens of nanoradians at a distance of 400 m from the active crater. As the pause time of continuous tremor before explosion becomes longer, the maximum amplitude of explosion earthquake and uplift signal become larger. Vulcanian eruptions are also observed during periods without continuous tremor. In these cases, tilt signals capture uplifts of the active crater for about 10 min before explosions and reach a few tens of nanoradians. Cessations of volcanic gas emissions are observed before some explosions during periods without continuous tremor (Mori et al. 2011). These observations suggest that pressurization in the shallow conduit is caused by an accumulation of volcanic gases and ash through the formation of ‘cap’ in the conduit, possibly composed of stiffened magma due to degassing, cooling, rheological changes, or other mechanisms." .

During the core retrieval process, soupy and mousse-like fabrics are produced in the gas hydrate-bearing sediments due to changes in pressure and temperature conditions. Therefore, the identification of soupy and mousse-like fabrics can be used as a proxy for the presence of gas hydrate in addition to other evidence, such as pore water freshening or anomalously cool temperature. We present here grain-size results, mineralogical composition and magnetic susceptibility data of soupy and mousse-like samples from the southern Hydrate Ridge (Cascadia accretionary complex) acquired during Leg 204 of the Ocean Drilling Program. In order to study the relationship between sedimentary texture and the presence of gas hydrates, we have compared these results with the main textural and compositional data available from the same area. Most of the disturbed analyzed samples from the summit and the western flank of southern Hydrate Ridge show a mean grain size coarser than the average mean grain size of the hemipelagic samples from the same area. The depositional features of the sediments are not recognised due to disturbance. However, their granulometric statistical parameters and distribution curves, and magnetic susceptibility logs indicate that they correspond to a turbidite facies. These results suggest that gas hydrates in the southern Hydrate Ridge could form preferentially in coarser grain-size layers that could act as conduits feeding gas from below the BSR. Two samples from the uppermost metres near the seafloor at the summit of the southern Hydrate Ridge show a finer mean grain-size value than the average of hemipelagic samples. They were located where the highest amount of gas hydrates was detected, suggesting that in this area the availability of methane gas was high enough to generate gas hydrates, even within low-permeability layers. The mineralogical composition of the soupy and mousse-like sediments does not show any specific characteristic with respect to the other samples from the southern Hydrate Ridge." .

Previous studies have shown that mid-latitude variability such as blocking is sensitive to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and to variations in tropical precipitation. Climate models exhibit a wide range of skill in representing blocking, with all models having deficiencies in certain respects. In addition, coupled climate models often exhibit significant biases in both tropical precipitation and tropical and extratropical SSTs. This suggests that tropical systematic biases in coupled climate models may influence the representation of blocking and its sensitivity to climate change. We examine the relationship between winter north Pacific blocking and tropical precipitation and tropical SSTs through the use of idealised SST anomaly experiments. We find that interannual variations in convection over the Maritime Continent and eastern equatorial Pacific regions both influence the central and eastern Pacific winter blocking frequency. In addition, systematic underestimation of tropical rainfall over the Maritime Continent region in climate models can lead to underestimation of time-mean winter Pacific blocking. Finally, the sign, magnitude and variability of tropical SST biases in a coupled model, and their associated effects on tropical precipitation, could influence its representation of northern hemisphere blocking, and thus affect its ability to represent this mode of remotely-forced mid-latitude variability. These results have important implications for model development." .

These are the products of subaerial and submarine arc volcanism and closely associated turbidite sedimentation. The Takitimu oceanic arc/basin setting formed a dynamic closed sedimentary system in which large volumes of volcaniclastic material generated at the arc was rapidly redeposited in marine basins flanking the eruptive centres. Volcanism probably included (1) moderate- to deep-water extrusion of lava and deposition of hyaloclastite, (2) extrusive and explosive eruptions from shallow marine to marginally emergent volcanoes in or on the margin of the basin, and (3) Plinian and phreato-Plinian eruptions from more distant subaerial vents along the arc. Much of the newly erupted material was rapidly transported to the adjacent marine basin by debris flows, slumping and sliding. Hemipelagic sedimentation predominated on the outer margin of the basin, infrequently interrupted by deposition of ash from the most explosive arc volcanism and the arrival of extremely dilute turbidites. Turbidite sedimentation prevailed in the remainder of the basin, producing a thick prograding volcaniclastic apron adjacent to the arc. The volcaniclastic strata closely resemble classic turbidite deposits, and show similar lateral facies variations to submarine fan deposits. Study of such sequences provides insight into poorly understood processes in modern arc-related basins." .

The features of three flood basalt flow fields from the Columbia River Basalt Group are presented, including the Palouse Falls flow field, a small (8,890 km2, ∼190 km3) unit by common flood basalt proportions, and visualized in three dimensions. The architecture of the Palouse Falls flow field is compared to the complex Ginkgo and more extensive Sand Hollow flow fields to investigate the degree to which simple emplacement models represent the style, as well as the spatial and temporal developments, of flow fields. Evidence from each flow field supports emplacement by inflation as the predominant mechanism producing thick lobes. Inflation enables existing lobes to transmit lava to form new lobes, thus extending the advance and spread of lava flow fields. Minimum emplacement timescales calculated for each flow field are 19.3 years for Palouse Falls, 8.3 years for Ginkgo, and 16.9 years for Sand Hollow. Simple flow fields can be traced from vent to distal areas and an emplacement sequence visualized, but those with multiple-layered lobes present a degree of complexity that make lava pathways and emplacement sequences more difficult to identify." .

Its nature and age of initiation is controversial. In the Nubra valley, Ladakh, India, a Karakoram range granite is thrust over Cretaceous magmatic arc rocks and this thrust is cut by a western strand of the Karakoram fault zone. Three different lithologies from this granite gave weighted mean zircon U/Pb ages of 12.92±0.77 Ma, 12.41±0.43 Ma, and 11.72±0.31 Ma. The ages indicate a relatively short intrusive history of about 1 Ma for the phases: the geochemistry is practically identical to the Pangong leucogranites in the same tectonic block. The Karakoram fault zone in this area is thus less than ~12 Ma old which supports a post middle Miocene (Serravallian) age of Karakoram fault initiation in this area." .

These cone successions and other rhyolitic volcanics of the Bunga Beds are associated with turbidite and other deep-water massflow sedimentary rocks. The two cone successions have a generally similar stratigraphy. At the base, flow-banded, variably autobrecciated and quench-fragmented rhyolite, representing an intrusive to extrusive dome, is overlain by rhyolitesediment breccia, representing extrusion of the dome through the deep-water sediment pile and resedimentation down its flanks. In the northern cone succession an overlying, succession of bedded pumiceous crystal-rich to crystal-poor tuffs represents the onset of pyroclastic activity and growth of a tuff cone. An overyling debris flow deposit represents degradation of part of the cone. The topmost unit, a stratified pumice succession, is thought to represent another cone-building eruptive phase, and is separated from the underlying strata by a major slide surface. The southern cone succession contains less tuff and abundant pumice, and is also terminated by a debris-flow deposit, indicating cone degradation. A modern analogue for the inferred eruptive style and sequence is the 1953–1957 rhyolite eruption that formed the Tuluman Island lava-tuff cone complex in the Bismarck Sea. The eruptions were often cyclical consisting of an initial inferred submarine-lava-forming stage, passing into a pumicecone-forming stage, in some cases a subaeriallava-forming stage, and a final stage, following the cessation of volcanism, during which the cones collapsed gravitationally or were destroyed by wave erosion. Using observations from both the Tuluman Island eruptions and the preserved stratigraphies of the Devonian tuff cones, a dynamic model is proposed for the formation of subaqueous rhyolitic dome-top tuff and pumice cones." .

SRAWM can not only handle conventional stochastic variations in objective functions or constraints, but also tackle objective and subjective (i.e., risk performance of the decision maker) fuzziness through rough-approximation model based on measure Me. The developed model would be applied to a real case study of an irrigation district (ID) in Kaidu-kongque River Basin, China, which is encountering challenges in economic development and a serious environmental crisis (e.g., drought, water deficit, land deterioration, stalinization, soil erosion and water pollution) synchronously. Simulation technical (i.e., support vector regression) is put into SRAWM framework to reflect dynamic prediction of water demand in the future. Results of optimized irrigation area, water allocation, water deficit, pollution reduction, water and soil erosion and system benefit under various water-environmental policies (corresponding to various ecological effects) are obtained. Tradeoffs between ecological and irrigative water usages can facilitate the local decision makers rectifying the current irrigation patterns and ecological protection polices. Moreover, compromises between systemic benefit and failure risk can help policymakers to generate a robust risk-control plan under uncertainties. These detections are beneficial to achieve conjunctive goals of socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability in such an arid IS." .

We focus our study on 20 CMEs which were observed remotely by the Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard the other STEREO spacecraft up to large heliocentric distances. We compare the predictions of the Fixed-Φ and Harmonic Mean (HM) fitting methods, which only differ by the assumed geometry of the CME. It is possible to use these techniques to determine from remote-sensing observations the CME direction of propagation, arrival time and final speed which are compared to in-situ measurements. We find evidence that for large viewing angles, the HM fitting method predicts the CME direction better. However, this may be due to the fact that only wide CMEs can be successfully observed when the CME propagates more than 100∘ from the observing spacecraft. Overall eight CMEs, originating from behind the limb as seen by one of the STEREO spacecraft can be tracked and their arrival time at the other STEREO spacecraft can be successfully predicted. This includes CMEs, such as the events on 4 December 2009 and 9 April 2010, which were viewed 130∘ away from their direction of propagation. Therefore, we predict that some Earth-directed CMEs will be observed by the HIs until early 2013, when the separation between Earth and one of the STEREO spacecraft will be similar to the separation of the two STEREO spacecraft in 2009 – 2010." .

An unconventional idea that earthquakes can be predicted is proposed, based on the mechanics of the double block system (DBS). The central point of the mechanics of DBS lies in the measurement of the forces acting on the surface separating the two blocks, the relation of which should obey Newton’s laws (referred to as Newton’s forces). A Newton’s force monitoring system (NFMS), consisting of in situ measurement, remote sensing and indoor monitoring, has been developed. The key instrument of the NFMS is the constant-resistance and large-deformation (CRLD) bolt incorporated with a negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) structure, referred to as CRLD bolt or NPR bolt, because of its unconventional performance that makes measurement of the Newton’s forces possible in seismically-active faults. The basic analytical and experimental work on formulating the DBS and NPR cable is outlined. The methods and techniques of the NFMS are presented. The validity of the mechanics of DBS and the applicability of the NRMS were verified by indoor experiments on Wenchuan and Longmen mountain active faults. Among many successful applications of NFMS to forecasting landslides, one field case in Nanfen open pit iron mines is presented; four field cases of the application of NFMS in registering the activities of the seismically active faults are also presented." .

This paper presents an analysis of observed changes and future projections for meteorological drought for four different time scales (1 month, and 3, 6 and 12 months) in the Beijiang River basin, South China, on the basis of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Observed changes in meteorological drought were analysed at 24 meteorological stations from 1969 to 2011. Future meteorological drought was projected based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, as projected by the regional climate model RegCM4.0. The statistical significance of the meteorological drought trends was checked with the Mann–Kendall method. The results show that drought has become more intense and more frequent in most parts of the study region during the past 43 years, mainly owing to a decrease in precipitation. Furthermore, long-term dryness is expected to be more pronounced than short-term dryness. Validation of the model simulation indicates that RegCM4.0 provides a good simulation of the characteristic values of SPEIs. During the twenty first century, significant drying trends are projected for most parts of the study region, especially in the southern part of the basin. Furthermore, the drying trends for RCP8.5 (or for long time scales) are more pronounced than for RCP4.5 (or for short time scales). Compared to the baseline period 1971–2000, the frequency of drought for RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) tends to increase (decrease) in 2021–2050 and decrease (increase) in 2051–2080. The results of this paper will be helpful for efficient water resources management in the Beijiang River basin under climate warming." .

In consideration of the critical condition of soil erosion induced by rainfall in Guangdong Province of southern China, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in rainfall erosivity based on daily rainfall data observed at 25 meteorological stations during the period of 1960–2011. The methods of global spatial autocorrelation, kriging interpolation, Mann–Kendall test, and continuous wavelet transform were used. Results revealed that the annual rainfall erosivity in Guangdong Province, which spatially varied with the maximum level observed in June, was classified as high erosivity with two peaks that occur in spring and summer. In the direction of south–north, mean annual rainfall erosivity, which showed significant relationships with mean annual rainfall and latitude, gradually decreased with the high values mainly distributed in the coastal area and the low values mainly occurring in the lowlands of northwestern Guangdong. Meanwhile, a significant positive spatial autocorrelation which implied a clustered pattern was observed for annual rainfall erosivity. The spatial distribution of seasonal rainfall erosivity exhibited clustering tendencies, except spring erosivity with Moran’s I and Z values of 0.1 and 1.04, respectively. The spatial distribution of monthly rainfall erosivity presented clustered patterns in January–March and July–October as well as random patterns in the remaining months. The temporal trend of mean rainfall erosivity in Guangdong Province showed no statistically significant trend at the annual, seasonal, and monthly scales. However, at each station, 1 out of 25 stations exhibited a statistically significant trend at the annual scale; 4 stations located around the Pearl River Delta presented significant trends in summer at the seasonal scale; significant trends were observed in March (increasing trends at 3 stations), June (increasing trends at 4 stations located in the Beijiang River Basin), and October (decreasing trends at 4 stations) at the monthly scale. In accordance with the mean annual rainfall over Guangdong Province, the mean annual rainfall erosivity showed two significant periodicities of 3–6 and 10–12 years at a confidence level of 95 %. In conclusion, the results of this study provide insights into the spatiotemporal variation in rainfall erosivity in Guangdong Province and support for agrolandscape planning and water and soil conservation efforts in this region." .

The earthquake source represented by a randomly oriented force or a seismic moment tensor is placed on an arbitrary boundary of a layered anisotropic medium. The theory of the matrix propagator in a homogeneous anisotropic medium by introducing a “wave propagator” is presented. It is shown that the matrix propagator can be represented by a “wave propagator” in each layer for anisotropic layered medium. The matrix propagator P(z, z 0=0) acts on the free surface of the layered medium and generates stress-displacement vector at depth z. The displacement field on the free surface of an anisotropic medium is obtained from the received system of equations considering the radiation condition and that the free surface is stressless. The new method determining source time function in anisotropic medium for three different types of seismic source is validated." .

However, the prediction of hydrologic responses to changes in storm direction is a difficult task that requires meteorological simulations and extensive computation. It is also difficult to identify the center of rotation of a storm affecting a basin of interest. Therefore, we propose a simple approach of rotating the basin position relative to the storm within the rainfall–runoff simulation model instead of changing the pathway of the storm, which we term the basin rotation method (BRM). The proposed BRM was tested on four major typhoon events in South Korea. The results illustrated that the original basin orientation (i.e., before it was rotated) exhibits earlier and higher peak discharge and earlier recession compared to the basin after rotation. We conclude that the proposed method (BRM) is a viable alternative for use in assessing the directional influence of moving storms on floods caused by historical rather than hypothetical storm events." .

A large-scale channel-shoal system has historically existed in the outer Tieshan Bay. A navigation waterway is initiated by cutting and dredging a mid-channel shoal to supply coal to a power plant on the middle coast of the Tieshan Bay. Dredging of the access channel to the Tieshan Port was conducted in two stages followed by land reclamation. It is thus of practical meaning to explore how the channel-shoal system will evolve in long term afterwards. This study uses the process-based finite-volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) to investigate long-term (centennial) morphological evolution of the channel-shoal system. After well calibration of hydrodynamics and sediment transport, the model forecasts morphodynamic evolution in hundred years. The simulations show that continuous erosion in tidal channels and accretion over shoals and intertidal flats occur. However, the cutting and access channels will be subjected to long-term siltation. A secondary channel indicating the reorientation of the access channel will emerge, and a localized channel-ridge system at the junction of the major channels will be formed. The overall erosion/accretion pattern demonstrates the combined effect of bottom friction and advective sediment transport processes to be responsible for the channel-shoal formation. Dredging of the tidal channels will stimulate the stability of the channel-shoal pattern. It suggests that the navigation waterway should be set up following the long-term morphological evolution of the channel-shoal system at a design stage and maintenance dredging volume might thus be minimized." .

In this context, the main objective of this study is to analyze the improvements resulting from the land use and land cover map update in numerical simulations performed using the Regional Climate Model system version 4 (RegCM4), as well as the seasonal variations of physical parameters used by the Biosphere Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS). In general, the update of the South America 2007 land use and land cover map, used by the BATS, improved the simulation of precipitation by 10 %, increasing the mean temporal correlation coefficient, compared to observed data, from 0.84 to 0.92 (significant at p < 0.05, Student’s t test). Correspondingly, the simulations performed with adjustments in maximum fractional vegetation cover, in visible and shortwave infrared reflectance, and in the leaf area index, showed a good agreement for maximum and minimum temperature, with values closer to observed data. The changes in physical parameters and land use updating in BATS/RegCM4 reduced overestimation of simulated precipitation from 19 to 7 % (significant at p < 0.05, Student’s t test). Regarding evapotranspiration and precipitation, the most significant differences due to land use updating were located (1) in the Amazon deforestation arc; (2) around the Brazil-Bolivia border (in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands); (3) in the Northeast region of Brazil; (4) in northwestern Paraguay; and (5) in the River Plate Basin, in Argentina. Moreover, the main precipitation differences between sensitivity and control experiments occurred during the rainy months in central-north South America (October to March). These were associated with a displacement in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) positioning, presenting a spatial pattern of alternated areas with higher and lower precipitation rates. These important differences occur due to the replacement of tropical rainforest for pasture and agriculture and the replacement of agricultural areas for pasture, scrubland, and deciduous forest." .

In the three decades (1979–2008), there were a total of 118 cyclones reported in which 96 formed in the region chosen (0–15oN, 60oE–100oE) for the study. Although the percentage of MJO days inducing cyclogenesis is small, it is found that tropical cyclone genesis preferentially occurred during the convective phase of MJO. This accounted for 44 cyclones of the total 54 cyclones (i.e., 81.5%) formed under MJO amplitude 1 and above. The study has shown that, when the enhanced convection of MJO is over the maritime continent and the adjoining eastern Indian Ocean, it creates the highest favorable environment for cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal. During this phase, westerlies at 850 hPa are strong in the equatorial region south of Bay of Bengal creating strong cyclonic vorticity in the lower troposphere along with the low vertical wind shear." .

After this break in regime, the fall patterns locked into a remarkably stable state. It is interesting that this case confirms a more general statistical result from previous completely independent episodes. The hypothesis suggested to explain this strong change and its subsequent persistence draws upon air-sea interactions over the North Pacific and resulting downstream influences." .

We present a method for modeling tephra thickness with less subjectivity than is the case with hand-drawn isopachs, the current, most frequently used method. The algorithm separates the thickness of a tephra fall deposit into a trend and local variations and models them separately using segmented linear regression and ordinary kriging. The distance to the source vent and downwind distance are used to characterize the trend model. The algorithm is applied to thickness datasets for the Fogo Member A and North Mono Bed 1 tephras. Simulations on subsets of data and cross-validation are implemented to test the effectiveness of the algorithm in the construction of the trend model and the model of local variations. The results indicate that model isopach maps and volume estimations are consistent with previous studies and point to some inconsistencies in hand-drawn maps and their interpretation. The most striking feature noticed in hand-drawn mapping is a lack of adherence to the data in drawing isopachs locally. Since the model assumes a stable wind field, divergences from the predicted decrease in thickness with distance are readily noticed. Hence, wind direction, although weak in the case of Fogo A, was not unidirectional during deposition. A combination of the isopach algorithm with a new, data transformation can be used to estimate the extent of fall deposits. A limitation of the algorithm is that one must estimate “by hand” the wind direction based on the thickness data." .

The HSZ has experienced several strong (M ≥ 7.0) earthquakes in historical times with the largest one being the 365 AD, M w = 8.4 earthquake, the largest known ever occurred in the Mediterranean region. The 2013 main shock occurred in close proximity with the 365 event, on an interplate thrust fault at a depth of 26 km, onto the coupled part of the overriding and descending plates. GCMT solution shows a slightly oblique (rake = 130°) thrust faulting with downdip compression on a nearly horizontal (dip = 3°) northeast-dipping fault plane with strike (340°) parallel to the subduction front, with the compression axis being oriented in the direction of plate convergence. The subduction interface can be more clearly resolved with the integration of aftershock locations and CMT solution. For this scope, the aftershocks were relocated after obtaining a v p/v s ratio equal to 1.76, a one-dimensional velocity model and time delays that approximate the velocity structure of the study area, and the employment of double-difference technique for both phase pick data and cross-correlation differential times. The first-day relocated seismicity, alike aftershocks in the first 2 months, shows activation of an area at the upper part of the descending slab, with most activity being concentrated between 13 and 27 km, where the main shock is also encompassed. Aftershocks are rare near to the main shock, implying homogeneous slip on a large patch of the rupture plane. Based on the aftershock distribution, the size of the activated area estimated is about 24 km long and 17 km wide. Coulomb stress changes resolved for transpressive motion reveal negligible off-fault aftershock triggering, evidencing a comparatively stable regime in the downdip part of the slab or different fault mechanism." .

Gambier Volcanic Complex in the Newer Volcanics Province, Australia is an extremely complex monogenetic, volcanic system that preserves at least 14 eruption points aligned along a fissure system. The complex stratigraphy can be subdivided into six main facies that record alternations between magmatic and phreatomagmatic eruption styles in a random manner. The facies are (1) coherent to vesicular fragmental alkali basalt (effusive/Hawaiian spatter and lava flows); (2) massive scoriaceous fine lapilli with coarse ash (Strombolian fallout); (3) bedded scoriaceous fine lapilli tuff (violent Strombolian fallout); (4) thin–medium bedded, undulating very fine lapilli in coarse ash (dry phreatomagmatic surge-modified fallout); (5) palagonite-altered, cross-bedded, medium lapilli to fine ash (wet phreatomagmatic base surges); and (6) massive, palagonite-altered, very poorly sorted tuff breccia and lapilli tuff (phreato-Vulcanian pyroclastic flows). Since most deposits are lithified, to quantify the grain size distributions (GSDs), image analysis was performed. The facies are distinct based on their GSDs and the fine ash to coarse+fine ash ratios. These provide insights into the fragmentation intensities and water–magma interaction efficiencies for each facies. The eruption chronology indicates a random spatial and temporal sequence of occurrence of eruption styles, except for a “magmatic horizon” of effusive activity occurring at both ends of the volcanic complex simultaneously. The eruption foci are located along NW–SE trending lineaments, indicating that the complex was fed by multiple dykes following the subsurface structures related to the Tartwaup Fault System. Possible factors causing vent migration along these dykes and changes in eruption styles include differences in magma ascent rates, viscosity, crystallinity, degassing and magma discharge rate, as well as hydrological parameters." .

At all locations spinel lherzolite is the predominant xenolith type and thus our sample contains nine spinel lherzolites and only one harzburgite (from the richest location, Kapfenstein, sample Ka 167). All the rocks have protogranular to protogranular — porphyroclastic transitional textures. Mineral compositions are typical for fertile upper mantle rocks with 0.89 〈mg〉 0.92 for silicates and 0.10 〈cr〉 0.12 for spinel (0.18 for the harzburgite). The minerals are equilibrated with respect to major, minor and trace elements, except for clinopyroxenes in the sample from Tobaj (To 100) and one sample from Fehring (Feh 002) which have variable incompatible trace element contents. Trace element abundances are highest in clinopyroxene (3–4 × primitive mantle rare earth element — REEs — abundances) followed by orthopyroxene (about 0.5 × mantle REEs) and olivine (0.0005–0.05 × mantle REEs). Abundances of trace elements in all phases are usually correlated with their compatibility. The most incompatible elements (e.g., U, Th, Nb, Ta, La, Ce) are depleted with respect to the more compatible elements in three samples from Fehring and two from Kapfenstein. The remaining samples are enriched in either U, or U and Th, or the most incompatible REEs as compared to Nb and Ta which are usually depleted with respect to less incompatible elements. Clinopyroxenes of the sample from Tobaj (To 100) and one sample from Fehring (Feh 002) have variable U, Th, Nb and Ta contents. In sample Feh 002 this variation is accompanied by a correlated variation of the light REE contents and their abundances are also correlated with the closeness to the surface. The enrichments in U and Th are, however, not accompanied by any significant enrichment in Nb and Ta, the concentrations of which stay at low levels. The non-equilibrium trace element distribution in Clnopyroxenes suggests that the metasomatic events took place shortly before the rocks were delivered to the Earth's surface. Thus, metasomatism and volcanic activity seem to be related and a consequence of the rising diapir underneath the Pannonian Basin. Several metasomatic events probably related to fluids dominated by CO2, water, or both were taking place. However, the intensity of that activity was generally low, as was the tectonic activity in the border zone of the Pannonian Basin. Only harzburgite Ka 167 provides evidence for some elevated activity of depletion and enrichment processes comparable to what has been found in the central region of the basin." .

The section crosses the Weddell Sea cyclonic gyre from Kapp Norvegia to the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula. The concepts of geostrophy, conservation of planetary vorticity and hydrostatics are combined with advective balances of active and passive properties to provide a dynamically consistent circulation pattern. Our variational assimilation scheme allows the calculation of three-dimensional velocities in the section plane. Current speeds are small except along the coasts where they reach up to 12 cm/s. We diagnose a gyre transport of 34 Sverdrup which is associated with a poleward heat transport of 28 × 1012 W corresponding to an average heat flux of 15 Wm−2 in the Weddell Sea south of the transect. This exceeds the estimated local flux on the transect of 2 Wm−2. As the transect is located mostly in the open ocean, we conclude that the shelf areas contribute significantly to the ocean-atmosphere exchange and are consequently key areas for the contribution of the Weddell Sea to global ocean ventilation. Conversion of water masses occuring south of the section transform 6.6 ± 1.1 Sv of the inflowing warm deep water into approximately equal amounts of Weddell Sea deep water and Weddell Sea bottom water. The volume transport of surface water equals in the in-and outflow. This means that almost all newly formed surface water is involved in the deep and bottom water formation. Comparison with the results obtained by pure velocity interpolation combined with a hydrographic data subset indicates major differences in the derived salt transports and the water mass conversion of the surface water. The differences can be explained by deviations in the structure of the upper ocean currents to which shelf areas contribute significantly. Additionally a rigorous variance analysis is performed. When only hydrographic data are used for the inversion both the gyre transport and the poleward heat transport are substantially lower. They amount to less than 40% of our best estimate while the standard deviations of both quantities are 6.5 Sv and 37 × 1012 W, respectively. With the help of long-term current meter measurements these errors can be reduced to 2 Sv and 8 × 1012 W. Our result underlines the importance of velocity data or equivalent information that helps to estimate the absolute velocities." .

In-situ trace element compositions and Pb-Pb ages have been analyzed by LAM-ICP-MS. The sector and the planar zone domains show typical trace element characteristics of granulite zircon (low Th, U, Th/U, total REEs, clear negative Eu anomalies, relatively depleted HREE and small differential degree between MREE and HREE, etc.), indicating that they formed during granulite-facies metamorphism. The protolith zircons have trace element characteristics of crustal zircon (high Th, U, Th/U, total REEs and enriched HREEs, etc.). 12 analyzed spots on granulite-facies domains give a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of (2154±26) Ma (MSWD = 3.8), which is the best estimated age of granulite-facies metamorphism of this sample. The weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 5 analyzed spots on protolith zircon domains is (2714 ± 22) Ma (MSWD = 1.4), which represents the protolith forming time. The discovery of ca. 3.4 Ga inherited zircon indicates that there are Palaeoarchean continental materials in this area. The interpretation of formation conditions and the ages of zircons can be constrained by simultaneous in-situ analysis of trace elements and ages." .

This study examines ability of an ensemble of 12 regional climate model (RCM) simulations to reproduce observed links between these circulation indices and precipitation, as well as how these links may change in the late twenty-first century. We focus on the winter season and differences in precipitation amounts on the highest and lowest 25 % of days according to a given index. The relationships are evaluated against the E-OBS data set for 1961–1990. The observed pattern of differences in precipitation between positive and negative phases is generally similar for MO and NAO, which relates to the high correlation between these indices. Most regional climate models (RCMs) simulate links between the circulation indices and precipitation over most of the Mediterranean area reasonably well, especially for the MO and WeMO indices. The RCM with the largest deficiencies in reproducing the links is HadRM for all indices. The spatial patterns of differences in daily precipitation under positive and negative phases of the circulation indices for the future scenario (2070–2099) are similar to those for the control climate for all indices. This suggests that NAO, MO and WeMO are likely to play similar roles in affecting precipitation in the Mediterranean also in the future. However, increased NAO and decreased WeMO index, projected in most examined RCMs for the late twenty-first century in winter, may affect overall precipitation patterns." .

One of the requirements to access reliable drought monitoring is long-term and continuous high-resolution precipitation data. Different climatic and global databases are being developed and made available in real time or near real time by different agencies and centers; however, for this purpose, these databases must be evaluated regionally and in different local climates. In this paper, a near real-time global climate model, a data assimilation system, and two gridded gauge-based datasets over Iran are evaluated. The ground truth data include 50 gauges from the period of 1980 to 2010. Drought analysis was carried out by means of the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) at 2-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month timescales. Although the results show spatial variations, overall the two gauge-based datasets perform better than the models. In addition, the results are more reliable for the western portion of the Zagros Range and the eastern region of the country. The analysis of the onsets of the 6-month moderate drought with at least 3 months’ persistence indicates that all datasets have a better performance over the western portion of the Zagros Range, but display poor performance over the coast of the Caspian Sea. Base on the results of this study, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset is a preferred alternative for drought analysis in the region when gauge-based datasets are not available." .

Drau, Carinthia. They are associated with muscovite, albite, smoky quartz, cassiterite, and microscopic uranmicrolite, zircon and uraninite. An assemblage of secondary uranium minerals is also present, generated by extensive alteration and leaching of the uranmicrolite and zircon. Textures of the ferrotantalite-ferrotapiolite intergrowths suggest considerable recrystallization that obliterated most of their primary features; neither coprecipitation nor exsolution can be recognized with certainty. Despite intersecting tielines indicating disequilibrium, the ferrotantalite and ferrotapiolite compositions show very restricted ranges (Mn/(Mn + Fe) 0.08–0.11, Ta/(Ta + Nb) 0.53–0.57 for ferrotantalite, and 0.01–0.04, 0.84–0.89 for ferrotapiolite, respectively), particularly in comparison with compositions from other localities featuring primary textures. A degree of compositional equilibration could have been attained during recrystallization. This process may also explain the high level of structural order characterizing both minerals; they are considerably disordered in other localities. Extensive deformation typical of pegmatites in the southern Ostalpen in general, and specifically of the Spittal pegmatite, is probably responsible for the recrystallization phenomena in the Ta, Nb, Sn-bearing mineral assemblage." .

The area is composed of two different blocks separated by the Toledo Shear Zone (TSZ). The northern block is a granulite facies anatectic terrane. The southern block is composed of greenschist facies Paleozoic sediments intruded by a late Hercynian granitic pluton. A total of 13 samples have been recovered for AFT analysis. AFT ages in both blocks cluster around 189–221 Ma, with mean confined track lengths between 11.4 μm and 12.4 μm. Modeling of the AFT data indicates that the thermal history is broadly similar in both blocks, which constrains the main movement of the TSZ, as essentially before the Upper Permian. AFT ages in the TSZ cluster around 124–164 Ma, and the track lengths vary between 11.4 μm and 12.4 μm. These data reveal that the fault must have been affected by a later thermal overprint as AFT ages are significantly younger than those of the footwall and hangingwall blocks. This differential thermal resetting is likely related to the advection of localized hydrothermal fluids that are responsible for the widespread Pb–Zn mineralization along the TSZ. These results give an example of resetting AFT data by hydrothermal events. The long-term evolution suggests a lack of important Alpine tectonism in the Montes de Toledo block, in clear contrast to other nearby Hercynian areas such as the Sierra de Guadarrama, where the important effect of Alpine tectonism has almost totally erased the previous thermal signal in the AFT system." .

Samples were analyzed for SO4 2-, NO3 -, Cl-,Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH4 + in addition to pH. The source of some ionic components in the bulk deposition such as K+ and Ca2+ were found to be the terrestrial regions, as expected. The (non-sea Cl-)/Cl- ratio of 0.05 suggests that the very large portion of Cl- in the bulkdeposition was of marine origin. The ratio of (non-sea SO4 2-)/SO4 2- varied between 0.86 and 0.99,indicating that the main source of sulfate was not the sea. It is found that the sulfate and calcium concentrations were highest in summer and lowest in fall. The analysis of bulk deposition also indicated that nearly 24% of the events were acidic (pH < 5.6). During sub-event wet deposition collectedon the same site pH decreased continually, and during the passageof cold front concentrations of Cl-, SO4 2- and NO3 - increased." .

Based on annual maximum rainfall (AM) and peaks over threshold rainfall series at 30 meteorological stations during 1960–2011 in the Huai River Basin (HRB), spatio-temporal characteristics of extreme rainfall are analyzed through regional frequency analysis method using L-moments. The accuracy and uncertainty analysis of quantile estimations are also carried out, and the regional and at-site frequency analyses are compared. Results indicate the following: (1) During 1960–2011, AM precipitation at 20 stations in the HRB shows an increasing trend, while at the other 10 stations, it shows a decreasing trend. And both the increased and decreased trends are not significant. (2) The HRB can be categorized into three homogeneous regions via cluster analysis. For both at-site and regional frequency analyses, the root mean square error values increase with the increase in return periods. The estimations are reliable enough for the return periods of less than 100 years. The quantile estimates of large return period from regional frequency analysis are more accurate and have smaller uncertainty than those from at-site frequency analysis. (3) Extreme precipitation in the HRB concentrates in the upstream of the Huai River and YiShuSi water system in the east of the HRB. Generally, the area with extreme precipitation, especially the upper reaches of the Huai River and Yimeng Mountain areas, also has large standard variations of extreme precipitation, which will increase the risk of natural hazards." .

Results show widespread significant warming trends for all the temperature extremes except for the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and the lowest daily maximum temperature in each year (TXn) during 1961–2010. When regionally averaged, a significant warming trend is detected for all the indices except for DTR and TXn in the past 50 years. Compared with the entire LPR, a significant warming trend is detected for all the indices except for DTR and TXn over the southeast sub-region of LPR; while it is observed for all the indices over the northwest. The trends for these indices are generally stronger in the northwest than in the southeast in the past 50 years. In contrast, for precipitation indices, only a small percentage of areas show significant drying or wetting trends and, when regionally averaged, none of them displays significant trends during the past 50 years. On the sub-regional scale, however, a larger percentage of areas show significant drying trends for precipitation indices generally over the southeast relative to the entire LPR, and noticeably, the sub-regional average heavy precipitation (R10mm) and wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT) display significant decreasing trends during the past 50 years; whereas only a slightly larger percentage of areas show significant wetting trends for these indices over the northwest compared with the entire LPR, and when sub-regionally averaged, none of the indices have significant trends during the past 50 years." .

Since abandonment approximately 2,000 years b.p., this delta complex has undergone subsidence and ravinement as the shoreline has transgressed across it. High-resolution seismic-reflection, sidescan-sonar, and bathymetry data show that seafloor erosion is influenced by locally variable shallow stratigraphy. The data reveal two general populations of shallow erosional depressions, either linear or subcircular in shape. Linear depressions occur primarily where sandy distributary-channel deposits are exposed on the seafloor. The subcircular pits are concentrated in areas where delta-front deposits crop out, and occasional seismic blanking indicates that gas is present. The difference in erosional patterns suggests that delta-front and distributary-channel deposits respond uniquely to wave and current energy expended on the inner shelf, particularly during stormy periods. Linear depressions may be the result of the sandy distributary-channel deposits eroding more readily by waves and coastal currents than the surrounding delta-front deposits. Pits may develop as gas discharge or liquefaction occurs within fine-grained delta-front deposits, causing seafloor collapse. These detailed observations suggest that ravinement of this inner shelf surface may be ongoing, is controlled by the underlying stratigraphy, and has varied morphologic expression." .
