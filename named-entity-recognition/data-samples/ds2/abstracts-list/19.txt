We have recorded the sites at which dances take place in large ten-frame hives and in two-frame observation hives. We find that dancing bees are most commonly found on particular combs in large hives and in particular areas on the combs in the observation hives. Although the site where dances take place may change from day to day, dancers will keep to the same site during the foraging period in any one day. Furthermore, if an established dance site is artificially relocated in the hive during the day, dancers seek these sites out before commencing their dances. We conclude that the dance sites are labelled in some way and so promote the congregation of both dancers and dance followers at the same site." .

While the need for research inquiry is now commonly accepted and advocated, traditional scientific methods (quantitative—experimental designs involving statistical procedures) are sometimes viewed as inappropriate to a process oriented form such as DMT. With the burgeoning of the social sciences, other alternatives have evolved including amplification of scientific methods and, importantly, phenomenologic models (namely, qualitative—interpretative, content oriented—research). The latter substantially augments the possibilities of investigative research in the healing arts. This paper highlights the two distinctive investigative paradigms (i.e., scientific and phenomenologic), examining them in relation to the spectrum of alternatives applicable to dance/movement and other creative arts therapies. The conceptual and methodological frameworks of the respective models are explained and compared, including examples of how and under what conditions the approaches are typically employed. Likewise, common research issues (e.g., validity and reliability) are identified and discussed. Finally, these contrasting approaches are presented as potentially mutually enhancing rather than mutually exclusive models of research inquiry." .

Are the markets for film and television software really dominated by American productions? What are the key factors in international trade and competitiveness? Which elements explain American success in audiovisual production? Are the European trade barriers, such as television quotas and subsidies, effective with respect to cultural or economic objectives?" .

These “robo-journalism” articles synthesize information from firms’ press releases, analyst reports, and stock performance and are widely disseminated by major news outlets a few hours after the earnings release. The articles are available for thousands of firms on a quarterly basis, many of which previously received little or no media attention. We use AP’s staggered implementation of robo-journalism to examine the effects of media synthesis and dissemination, in a setting where the articles are devoid of private information and are largely exogenous to the firm’s earnings news and disclosure choices. We find compelling evidence that automated articles increase firms’ trading volume and liquidity. The effects are most likely driven by retail traders. We find no evidence that the articles improve or impede the speed of price discovery. Our study provides novel evidence on the impact of pure synthesis and dissemination of public information in capital markets and initial insights into the implications of automated journalism for market efficiency." .

The advent of interactive digital television opens up many new possibilities for the structure and presentation of drama and the way in which people may engage with it. However, the design of interactive, computer-based environments requires theoretical and practical bases that are largely new to the dramatic arts. This paper describes research which is exploring the convergence of ideas and design models from a range of traditional sources including HCl, psychology, the performing arts and media production for this new media form. It starts by reevaluating two traditional dramatic paradigms, Stanislavski's Realism and Brecht's objectivity, and contrasts them with Boal's spect-actor paradigm in which audiences become direct participants in the drama. Although existing technology cannot enable a faithful computer based implementation of the spect-actor paradigm, the model may be approachable in various ways and thus provides a useful goal for designers of interactive drama. The realities of designing and producing interactive drama are illustrated with a practical example. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the work for the design of interactive drama." .

The viscous liquid film obtained from H3PO4+HEDP solution possesses very good film-forming characteristics.

The representation proposed is compared with the Kozeny-Carman formula. It is shown that in general, as distinct from the widely accepted representation of the Carman constant in the form of a product of the form factor and tortuosity, this constant is equal to a combination of three coefficients, namely the form factor, the tortuosity, and the structure coefficient. The presence of the latter is due to the fact that in periodic capillary models the porosity is not equal to the surface porosity. It is shown that the Carman constant, the form factor, and the structure coefficient are not universal and their intervals of variation are calculated. The results obtained make it possible to explain and interpret numerous experimental data on the determination of the Carman constant in various porous media." .

Biographical and autobiographical reports from film makers document antidotal descriptions of the use of dream in creative aspects of screen writing, acting and directing film. However, no systematic or analytic approach has been used in the attempt to document dream utilization in film making. Film makers attending the Sundance Film Institute Screenwriter and Director Labs from 1995-7 were asked to complete a previously validated questionnaire regarding dream recall and incorporation into a spectrum of awake behaviors. Compared to a previous general population study, all responses to questions assessing reported dream effects on awake behaviors and recall were significantly higher for the film makers. An in-group study of film makers found that reported dream recall and effects on waking behavior for the Creative group (Directors, Screen writers, Actors) were significantly higher than for the Working group (Crew). Responses from the Professional Group (Producers, Editors and Cinematographers) were intermediate. Within the Creative Group, reported specific dream effects on behavior varied significantly with creative role." .

Understanding the factors that contribute to media framing of pharmaceutical pollution may lead to a better understanding of the management and governance of this issue, including why these pollutants are generally unregulated at this time. This study conducted a content analysis of 405 newspaper articles (81 had substantive information on the topic) from 2007 to 2014, using the search terms “water” and “pharmaceuticals” in the Chicago Tribune, Denver Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. We sought to analyze the factors that contributed to the news media presentation of pharmaceutical pollution in the United States, including the presentation of the risks/safety and solutions by various actors. We found that the primary issues in the news media were uncertainty regarding public health and harm to the environment. The primary solutions recommended within the news media were implementing additional water treatment technologies, taking unused pharmaceuticals to predetermined sites for disposal (take-back programs), and trash disposal of unused pharmaceuticals. Water utilities and scientists presented improved water treatment technology, government actors presented take-back programs, and pharmaceutical representatives, while sparsely involved in the news media, presented trash disposal as their primary solutions. To advance the understanding of the management of pharmaceutical pollution, this article offers further insight into the debate and potential solutions within the news media presentation of this complex scientific topic." .

This study examines coverage of anthropogenic climate change in United States (U.S.) network television news – ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News – and focuses on the application of the journalistic norm of ‘balance’ in coverage from 1995 through 2004. This study also examines CNN WorldView, CNN Wolf Blitzer Reports and CNN NewsNight as illustrations of cable news coverage. Through quantitative content analysis, results show that 70% of U.S. television news segments have provided ‘balanced’ coverage regarding anthropogenic contributions to climate change vis-à-vis natural radiative forcing, and there has been a significant difference between this television coverage and scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change from 1996 through 2004. Thus, by way of the institutionalized journalistic norm of balanced reporting, United States television news coverage has perpetrated an informational bias by significantly diverging from the consensus view in climate science that humans contribute to climate change. Troubles in translating this consensus in climate science have led to the appearance of amplified uncertainty and debate, also then permeating public and policy discourse." .

The result of calculation reproduces the experimentally observed features, i.e., the oscillatory dependence of the scattering intensity on the thickness and the enhancement of the scattering intensity for very thin films. The enhancement is reproduced only when the dipole-dipole interaction between the particle and the substrate is included in the calculation. Using the method we propose, the scattering intensity can be calculated for an arbitrary size and shape of particle on an arbitrary thickness of film." .

The wrinkling instabilities of a stretched rectangular thin film subjected to in-plane bending are investigated within the framework of the linearised Donnell-von Kármán bifurcation equation for thin plates. One of our principal objectives is to assess the role played by the finite bending stiffness of the film on the linear wrinkling mechanism. To this end, we employ a non-homogeneous linear pre-bifurcation solution and cast the corresponding eigenvalue problem as a singularly-perturbed differential equation with variable coefficients. Numerical simulations of this problem reveal the existence of two different regimes for the behaviour of the lowest eigenvalue. Based on this observation, a WKB analysis is carried out in order to capture the dependence of the critical wrinkling load on the wavelength of the localised oscillatory buckling pattern and the stiffness of the elastic film. The validity of the analytical results is corroborated by independent numerical computations of the eigenvalues using the method of compound matrices." .

It is suggested on the basis of these profiles that a high level of sensation seeking can lead to a liking for heavy metal music, because the music provides such high-intensity sensation. However, fans become part of thesubculture of heavy metal music only to the extent that their high sensation seeking is combined with alienation. Although all three people profiled enjoyed the high sensation qualities of the music, their involvement in the subculture varied according to the depth of their alienation. Jack, deeply alienated, was deeply committed to the subculture. Brian's alienation was moderate, and his involvement in the subculture was moderate as well. Marvin was not alienated in the least, and was essentially outside the subculture." .

Clients were shown the tape and asked to rank order which segments they liked the most, second most and least. Vitalization was the most liked healing process, Exercise the second and Music last.

This paper contributes to this research gap by reporting on a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of how childcare is represented in 801 newspaper texts from six Australian newspapers. As a foundational paper of a broader study investigating public and political influences on parents’ childcare choices, the paper details the use and utility of corpus linguistic tools for exploring the discourse construction of childcare in a large corpus of media texts. It also highlights the value of analysing media corpora via media ownership, focusing on the two dominant Australian media organisations, Fairfax and News Corp. Analyses reveal similarities but also key differences in the representation of childcare in Fairfax and News Corp newspapers. In Australia, print media still sets the daily media agenda and reflects the dominant discourse constructions surrounding major public issues. Accordingly, the beliefs, practices and decision-making of current and potential parent users of formal childcare may be differentially influenced depending not just on their (direct or indirect) access to print media, but by the format (tabloid or broadsheet) and thus ownership (Fairfax or News Corp)." .

The magnetoresistance and resistance of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions are not related to the width of the nanoconstrictions. Instead the resistance of the local nano-region in the middle of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstriction has only a minor role compared to that of the two microscale thin film ferromagnetic electrodes, which contribute the majority of the measured resistance. The magnetoresistances of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions and a 0.2 cm × 0.8 cm thin ferromagnetic film deposited under the same conditions were also compared; the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions have higher magnetoresistances than the thin ferromagnetic film, which implies that the measured magnetoresistance of the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions comes mainly from the local nano-region in their centers. In conclusion, the measured magnetoresistance of the whole sample is similar to the anisotropic magnetoresistance, because the resistance of the two microscale thin film ferromagnetic electrodes is much higher than that of the local nano-region in the middle of the samples. Comparing the experimental results for the thin film ferromagnetic nanoconstrictions and the thin ferromagnetic film reveals that the magnetoresistance of the local nano-region in the middle of the sample is much higher than that of the two microscale thin film ferromagnetic electrodes attached to it." .

Understanding the dissemination process of online news has important implications for policy making, crisis management, and brand imaging. As the frequency of news reprinting between two news portals expresses the social relationship between them, the topological properties of complex networks of news portals indicate the dynamic patterns of online news dissemination. This research is the first study that examines patterns and organizational structure of online news networks based on historical data collected from more than one thousand Chinese news portals. Main findings reveal that information can spread widely and rapidly through online news portals. Specifically, some major news portals exchange information with each other frequently and they exchange information with small news portals directly, implying that hot-spot events, even they are first reported by a small news portal, can be re-posted by many major news portals in a short time and then spread over the Internet quickly. The dense connections between many major news portals ensure that the spread will not be influenced greatly by the refusal to report typical events of a small part of major news portals." .

And sequences of media reports constitute the power of the news media to influence corporate practices. In this paper, we focus on the micro-foundations of news reports to elaborate how an atmosphere of negative news reports following an initial exposure of corporate pollution activity can help stop such activity through their impact on corporate managers. We extend our understanding of the corporate governance effect of news media by considering two new aspects of reports—one, the proportion of words in negative reports relative to the total number of words in all reports; and two, the geographical origin of news media. We suggest that the more negative the media coverage, and the more local this coverage, the greater the impact on corporations. Our study of news media reports from more than 600 newspaper sources on disciplining pollution activities of listed Chinese firms from 2004 to 2012 provides strong support for our hypotheses. These findings have valuable implications for the handling of pollution issues in transitional economies via the power of news words." .

We measured the level of abstraction of 635 news images from widely circulated US newspapers using a novel and replicable coding scheme which we derived from existing construal level literature and communication research. The results show, contrary to expectations, that climate change has been visually portrayed as a relatively concrete rather than abstract issue and has been mostly portrayed with a high level of specificity. In particular, USA Today visually covered the issue as most concrete, followed by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Human-themed images were the most concrete images as compared to nature-themed and industry-themed images. Findings regarding the level of abstraction of news images, though not necessarily representing audiences’ perceptions, clearly indicate that construal level aspects in the news images provide another novel way of understanding and interpreting climate change imagery in the US media." .

Standards have been set by the Dicom committee, and CD's are rapidly appearing instead of angiogram film. Core labs. are geared to perform CD interpretation as well as film during this transition phase. Attempts are made to network multiple labs. and maintain the same kind of flow encountered in an analog lab. Labour and material costs seem to be cheaper for cineless labs. The future will see faster and deeper storage and commercially available means to network hospitals. This technology may be the forerunner of the digital patient record." .

We present a new type of temperature driven spin reorientation transition (SRT) in thin films. It can occur when the lattice and the shape anisotropy favor different easy directions of the magnetization. Due to different temperature dependencies of the two contributions the effective anisotropy may change its sign and thus the direction of the magnetization as a function of temperature may change. Contrary to the well-known reorientation transition caused by competing surface and bulk anisotropy contributions the reorientation that we discuss is also found in film systems with a uniform lattice anisotropy. The results of our theoretical model study may have experimental relevance for film systems with positive lattice anisotropy, as e.g. thin iron films grown on copper." .

However, media companies should supply high quality news if quality yields sufficiently greater revenues. Quality journalism may not increase audience either because of a lemons problem or because consumers do not value the product dimensions that journalists do.

This paper will show that for Kompas, the biggest national newspaper in Indonesia, rasa – a central element in Javanese value, has been the basis of their self-censorship. Whereas other media use “universal” standard journalism as a basis for news selection and news production, Kompas elaborates rasa in their day-to-day practice of news making process. While presenting how rasa has been brought into practice within Kompas newsroom in the recent times, this article also argues that this kind of journalism practice can be traced back to the authoritarian period of the New Order regime. This paper argues that even though rasa is a cultural entity, underlying its manifestation into practice is actually picturing the hidden political and economic interest of Kompas journalists as minority group in Indonesia. This study bridges the gap within Indonesian media theories, which separate the political economy factors and the cultural factors as the main forces influencing media operation." .

The simplest case is that in which the liquid is lifted by means of a plane vertical plate emerging from the liquid. In part I the “single-lift” process is treated where the thickness of the film lifted by the plate is a function of location on the plate and time. Results of experiments reported in literature and of our own experiments are correlated and compared with theory. Part II deals with the “continuous-lift” process in which the liquid is continuously lifted, e.g. by an endless belt and removed at some height above the bath, thus forming a most primitive type of pump. In the stationary state the flux lifted and film thickness are constant. Theory for this case is incomplete and experiments have been carried out in order to determine what flux and film thickness can be expected under certain conditions." .

We build on an abstract data type presented in Wigginset al. (1989), usingconstituents, which are structurally significant groupings of musical events. We suggest that a division into such groupings can be musically meaningful, and that it can be more flexible than similar approaches. We demonstrate our representation system at work in both analysis and composition, with output from computer programs. We conclude that it is possible and useful to represent music in a way independent of the particular style, tonal system, etc., of the music itself." .

Based on her dance training with Mary Wigman, and her own personal experiences in Jungian psychoanalysis, she developed a rich and detailed movement bridge to inner experience, including unconscious, preverbal, direct sensation, dreams, and interpersonal dynamics. The core of the movement experience she explored is the sensation of both moving, and being moved at the same moment, activated with attention, allowing and following the authentic movement impulse. She had a gift for translating inner experience into suggestions that furthered her students’ explorations. The recollection of my work with Mary, which occurred between 1975 and 1978 in San Francisco, California, is supported by personal audio recordings, from which all quotes are taken, unless otherwise noted." .

It is shown that, when the walls of a slit are of different natures, the pressure tensor depends not only on the opening angle of the wedge-shaped slit, bus also on the position of the interface between the solids in contact outside of the slit. As a consequence, the symmetry of the spatial dependence of the tensor components with respect to the median plane is violated." .

This is an exploratory content analysis of news reporting (in Korean and English) on Australia in key Korean digital news media providers and distributors over a six-month-period during which certain key events occurred that drew Korean news media attention to Australia. The research aims to address the fundamental question: what forms and patterns of representation of Australia are present in South Korean online news media? It is designed in large part to understand how Australia is present as a theme in Korean online news, and how this theme is contextualized by associated topics, such as trade, security, or tourism. The quantitative analysis is augmented using a qualitative method: a series of key informant interviews conducted with editors and journalists responsible for the production and prioritization of news. Further, it is interpreted by locating the research in the context of the Australia-South Korea relationship. We summarize the complexities that arise when analyzing large amounts of textual content, especially from two very different languages, discuss the opportunities that arise from mixed methods—by combining big data (breadth) with contextual analysis (depth) and offer suggestions for aspiring researchers." .

By introducing a method based on spatiotemporal motion templates, the platform facilitates to train basic step models from sequentially repeated dance figures performed by a dance teacher. Movements are captured with an optical motion capture system. The teachers' models can be visualized from a first-person perspective to instruct students how to perform the specific dance steps in the correct manner. Moreover, recognition algorithms-based on a template matching method-can determine the quality of a student's performance in real time by means of multimodal monitoring techniques. The results of an evaluation study suggest that the Dance-the-Music is effective in helping dance students to master the basics of dance figures." .

Reaction temperature and pH had the most significant influence on the rate and the degree of hydrolysis, whereas Aerosol-OT concentration had the least influence on those parameters. The initial rate was most influenced by the interactive effect of pH with all other variables, whereas the degree of hydrolysis was the most influenced by the interactive effect of reaction temperature with other variables. Lowerlevel variable combinations were favorable over higher-level variable combinations to TAG hydrolysis in reverse micellar media. Regression models, developed for the initial rate and the degree of hydrolysis as a function of reaction variables, accounted for up to 96% of the variation in the two responses. The optimum reaction condition ranges were determined based on maximization of both the rate and the degree of hydrolysis. The differences in the physicochemical characteristics of substrates had no significant effect on the optimum condition ranges. However, the noticeable differences were observed for these ranges between the systems withRhizopus javanicus andCandida cylindracea lipases.

He suggests that this is a result of the coincidence of favourable environmental factors with the presence of creative individuals. It is possible that the simultaneous development of movement observation in the USA and in the UK in the sixties and early seventies constituted, on a small scale, such a phenomena. In the USA Martha Davis, Albert Scheflen, Judith Kestenberg, Alan Lomax, Forrestine Paulay, Irmgard Bartenieff, among others, and in the UK Rudolf Laban, Lisa Ullman, Warren Lamb, Walli Meier, Pamela Ramsden, Vi Bruce, Mary Wilkinson, Veronica Sherborne, Valerie Preston-Dunlop and of course Marion North, to name a few, were engaged in the study of observation of dance and movement. The development of this field was further encouraged by Irmgard Bartenieff's travels to the UK in the 1950's for further study with Laban, and Marion's trips to New York City to teach. In the early 1970s, invited by Bonnie Bird, then working at the Bureau, Marion presented a number of workshops at the Dance Notation Bureau where Irmgard Bartenieff was teaching. These workshops were originally offered only to Irmgard's students, but were eventually opened to the public. There was a great interest and many of the participants had an advanced level of training and experience. “These people were doing outstanding work in the States, and there were many creative discussions on the different interpretations and clarifications of Laban's work”. Marion participated directly in the early development of dance movement therapy in the USA through her teaching and research. Dr. North's contribution to dance movement therapy has been significant in her roles as a dance educator and administrator as well as in her work as a researcher in movement observation. In 1985, Marion served as a panel member inLooking Ahead, Planning Together, the Creative Arts in Therapy as an Integral Part of Treatment for the 90's, a symposium sponsored by Hahnemann University in Philadelphia. At this time she met Dianne Dulicai, then the Course Coordinator for the Hahnemann Dance Movement Therapy program. Marion was impressed with Dianne, and they began planning the establishment of the first MA course in Dance Movement Therapy to be offered in the UK at the Laban Centre. By bringing Master's level training in dance movement therapy to the UK, Marion has made a significant contribution to the continuing progress of the profession. Students who have trained at the Centre return to their homelands to practice their skills. Laban Centre graduates are currently practising in the UK, the Orient, Europe, Central America, South America, Africa, Australia and the USA. This paper is offered in commemoration of Dr. North's 20 year contribution to the profession of Dance Movement Therapy in the UK, the United States, and throughout the world." .

This market has grown substantially and still possesses potential for further development. However, China’s unique institutional context presents challenges. By examining an expanded range of potential signals, two of which have not previously been examined in the literature, namely imported films and enhanced format film formats such as 3D and IMAX, we develop a conceptual framework and argue that signaling theory needs to be combined with institutional context. Similar to findings for film industries in other countries, we find quality and reputational signals including budget, star power, sequels, and online consumer reviews to be important in China. However, unique results are also revealed. Chinese consumers react to an innovativeness signal in that they are specifically attracted to enhanced format films. Film award nominations and prizes are insignificant reputational signals. Once other signals are taken into account, imported films on average do not perform as well as domestic films. We link these findings to China’s unique institutional setting and offer important implications for management, recognizing the challenges to film companies of competing in an increasingly globalized market. This paper is also of relevance to policymakers given their continued efforts in shaping the development of China’s film industry." .

As new media platforms develop, it is important to understand how different news media represents emerging stem cell technologies and the role these play in public discussions. We conducted a comparative analysis of newspaper and sports websites coverage of one recent high profile case: Gordie Howe’s stem cell treatment in Mexico. Using qualitative coding methods, we analyzed news articles and readers’ comments from Canadian and US newspapers and sports websites. Results indicate that the efficacy of stem cell treatments is often assumed in news coverage and readers’ comments indicate a public with a wide array of beliefs and perspectives on stem cells and their clinical efficacy. Media coverage that presents uncritical perspectives on unproven stem cell therapies may create patient expectations, may have an affect on policy discussions, and help to feed the marketing of unproven therapies. However, news coverage that provides more balanced or critical coverage of unproven stem cell treatments may also inspire more critical discussion, as reflected in readers’ comments." .

Since the tetraktys is the most important symbol of the Pythagorean school and system, its prominence in the form and decoration of the Capitol Theatre, Melbourne (Australia), suggests that this building was designed in the Pythagorean spirit. The tetraktys encodes the fundamental proportions or harmonies of the musical scale (1:2, 2:3, 3:4) and so one would expect to find these same proportions used in the form and decoration of the Capitol as well as evidence of relevant musical thought and inspiration in the writings of its designers, Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin. Graham Pont explains the significance of the tetraktys in the Pythagorean tradition, identifies the Capitol as a “secular temple” in form and ethos, and indicates possible contemporary influences on the theatre’s remarkable motif of the “Crystal Tetraktys” and other symbolism." .

Experimentally, this constraint is the shape of the soapy water in a soap film experiment. In this context, soap films which are probable area minimizers for rectangular n-prisms are described. By allowing area minimizers which arise as deformations of higher genus surfaces, we are able to discover previously unknown soap films spanning rectangular n-prisms with large aspect ratios and n ≥ 5. For n = 3, 4, 5, we show that the central film contracts to a point as the aspect ratio of the prism increases. We also prove that the area of the central hexagon for a soap film spanning a tall 6-prism approaches zero like (height)−4 as the height approaches infinity, provided we fix the length of the hexagon base. Finally, we prove that, if the aspect ratio is large enough, the soap film produced experimentally spanning a 4-prism has films which look planar but in reality are non-planar." .

Two previous studies, both conducted in the United States, found a positive correlation between media reporting and citations. Only one of these studies was able to conclude that the correlation was caused by a real “publicity effect” rather than by the media highlighting papers that are intrinsically destined to have greater scientific impact (called the ‘earmark’ hypothesis). This study assessed the relative importance of the publicity effect outside the US, by comparing studies published in 2008 and 2009 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that had been featured in newspapers in Italy and the United Kingdom. Newspapers in the two countries covered a similar range of topics, and tended to over-represent local (national) research. Compared to studies not appearing in any of the newspapers considered, those featured in British newspapers had around 63 % more citations, whilst in Italian newspapers 16 %. The proportion of citations from Italian authors, however, was significantly increased by newspapers, particularly by those in Italian. The equivalent effect on citations from the UK was smaller and only marginally significant. Studies accompanied by a press release did not receive, overall, significantly more citations. In sum, results suggest that the publicity effect is strongest for English-speaking media, whilst non-English reporting has mostly a local influence. These effects might represent a confounding factor in citation-based research assessment and might contribute to the many biases known to affect the scientific literature." .

Nematodes were abundant reaching densities up to 900 cm−2 of media surface. Numbers decreased down the bed and species composition displayed spatial differences with bed depth. Eight orders of nematode were represented, members of the sub-family Diplogasterinae and Rhabditinae were particularly common. A seasonal pattern of abundance was clearly apparent; two peaks occurred, one in May and a second during the winter months. Lowest numbers corresponded with periods of highest temperature. The demise of the nematodes in the spring was related to the sloughing of the surface film on the media." .

Because of the changing availability of the number of newspapers in Nexis/Lexis, two sets of time are examined: from January 1991 to May 2004 and from January 1985 to May 2004. Our results suggest that American newspapers tend to give more positive coverage to the same economic news when Democrats are in the White House than when Republicans are; a similar though smaller effect is found for Democratic control of Congress. Our results reject the claim that “reader diversity is a powerful force toward accuracy.” When all types of news are pooled into a single analysis, our results are significant. However, the results vary greatly depending upon which types of economic data are being reported. When newspapers are examined individually the only support that Republicans appear to obtain is from the president’s home state newspapers during his term. This is true for the Houston Chronicle under both Bushes and the Los Angeles Times during the Reagan administration. Contrary to rational expectations, media coverage affects people’s perceptions of the economy." .

By bringing together scientists, engineers and artists, “Images of Nature” aims to convey the significance of new understandings of nature in images and tangible artifacts (e.g., data visualization, functional devices, generative and kinetic installations) for the public. It is our hope that this project will be the starting point for a flexible network connecting science, engineering and the arts on Purdue’s West Lafayette campus to enrich STEM education and provide a local model for STE(A)M (STEM disciplines plus Art), which emphasizes creativity and innovation; critical thinking and problem solving; flexibility and adaptability; cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration in the context of our changing natural environment." .

These strategies are attractive to customers, perhaps spelling the difference between pirating and legally purchasing music; they allow “custom pricing” to capture more of the consumer surplus, and just as importantly, they contribute to developing new artists for long-term viability of the music industry. The many ways to bundle include exact firm-selected bundles, category bundling, customer-selected bundles, and mixing these with individual products. Each of these approaches has specific advantages for different market segments, making up for generally lower prices in the competitive online world. Multi-part pricing affords additional opportunities to capture more of the consumer surplus. These ideas are especially relevant to online music because of the ease of packaging products, the low cost of reproducing music on demand, the reduced friction of consumer/firm interaction, the low cost of monitoring complex behavior, and the enhanced measurement of performance. In the online world, content offerings are revitalized when offered as bundles or service packages." .

This study aims to describe news coverage of tobacco control related issues in Chinese newspapers from 2000 to 2010. MethodsAll 1149 articles related to tobacco control were extracted from the Database of Chinese Important Newspapers and content analyzed for the period Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2010. The changing pattern of tobacco control topic, article type, viewpoint, and article origin, and their relationship were analysed. ResultsNews coverage of tobacco control related issues increased significantly (p < 0.01) from 2000 to 2010, with news coverage being relatively intensive in May and June (p < 0.01), around World No Tobacco Day. 24.9% (n = 286) of all articles focused on secondhand smoke, 25.3% (n = 291) warned about the dangers of active smoking, and 10.0% (n = 115) focused on prevention and cessation programs and campaigns. Tobacco control topics varied significantly between national vs city/regional newspapers (χ 2 = 24.09, p = 0.002) and article types (χ 2 = 193.35, p < 0.001). Articles in national newspapers had more coverage of the dangers of tobacco and on enforcing bans on tobacco-advertising. News stories centered around monitoring tobacco use and smoke free activity, while editorials focused on enforcing bans on tobacco-advertising, youth access and programs and campaigns. Letters to editors focused on the dangers of smoking, raising tax, and smoking cessation. More articles (50.4%) took an anti-tobacco position (compared with 10.5% which were pro-smoking), with the amount of negative coverage growing significantly across the decade. National articles tended to lean toward anti-tobacco, however, local articles tended mix of pro-tobacco and neutral/balance positions. Editorials seemed to be more anti-tobacco oriented, but letters to the editor tended to show a mix of anti-tobacco and pro-tobacco positions. ConclusionChinese newspapers are giving increasing attention to tobacco control, but coverage remains lower than in the USA and Australia. Health workers need to give higher priority to efforts to increase news coverage beyond the present concentration around World No Tobacco Day and to develop strategies for making tobacco control issues more newsworthy to both national and local news outlets." .

The initiation of a registry procedure was the organization’s first attempt to identify and set forth standards for clinical training. This task was often difficult due to three important factors: (1) the lack of in-depth training opportunities during the early years of the association; (2) the desire and motivation of the ADTA to establish a professional identity; and (3) the lack of a clearly defined body of knowledge. The emergence of graduate programs in dance therapy has positively affected the quality of training, lent credibility to the profession, and facilitated the discovery and exploration of a body of knowledge. This paper traces the historical development of dance therapy training in the ADTA." .

Musical expression is commonly associated with artistry and achievement in music, yet research on pedagogy for teaching musical expression to wind instrumentalists is limited. The purpose of this study is to use perspectives from professional wind instrumentalists and conductors to explore how musical expression on wind instruments is demonstrated and measured. The qualitative tradition of the Delphi method, with three rounds of data collection, provided the structure for answering the research questions. The importance of effectively communicating musical interpretation through performance was a recurring theme within the data collection as well as the literature review. Findings suggest that a performer’s abilities both to appropriately analyze the music and then to successfully communicate his or her interpretation of the music to a listener are critical for achieving artistry in musical expression. The study may provide valuable insight for a deeper understanding of pedagogical strategies needed for teaching musical expression to wind instrumentalists." .

UK news media tended to be the most “scary” and Spanish ones the most “robust”. Articles quoting public perceptions, non-governmental environmental organisations and politicians tended to emphasize the risks of GMOs; those quoting scientists tended to downplay the risks and describe their potential benefits.

In particular, we look at how the 1900 solar eclipse, a hot topic throughout Europe, was reported by the capital newspaper, and how news on seismology were conveyed in the period 1907–1910 in the newspaper published in Azores, an archipelago with a significant seismic and volcanic activity. We argue that the importance conceded to these scientific news was related to their overwhelming features, that their dissimilar presentation stemmed from their local relevance allied to their different nature, predictable in the case of eclipses, and unpredictable in the case of earthquakes, and that behind these two instances of science journalism laid an attempt by the scientific and political communities to gain the support of the general public to such an extent that these two specific instances of science journalism transcended their usual features to become successful forms of expository science." .

Binary mixtures of ultra-thin films are subject to both height and concentration fluctuations, either of which, under the appropriate conditions, can become unstable. We investigate a simple general thermodynamic model which shows that, due to the constraint imposed upon coupling between these fluctuations, a thin-film binary mixture will be less stable than if either height or concentration fluctuations are considered in isolation. We investigate the height dependence of the stability condition, discuss equilibrium conditions when higher-order contributions to the free energy are negligible, and predict the scaling behaviour." .

We then test the hypotheses derived from the model on a dataset consisting of a survey of 710 artists representative of the whole population of French professional musicians. The results are consistent with our model in so far as: (i) those artists with a recording contract who do more live performances are more tolerant of piracy; and (ii) self-released artists are less tolerant of piracy, and that their attitude is therefore closer to that of record companies." .

Interviews were transcribed, coded, and organized into 16 themes nested within 5 categories. The results showed a natural therapeutic fit between DMT and EFP, including the innate ability of horses to co-facilitate body-centered, movement-oriented, therapeutic processes. The results also suggested that combining DMT and EFP can increase therapeutic possibilities, including levels of client and therapist embodiment and creative expression, opportunities for contact and touch, and the depth and breadth of the therapeutic relationship. Finally, the results described some of the tools and techniques currently being used in DMT–EFP sessions and highlighted factors necessary to be successful in this endeavor. This study is intended to provide a foundation for further research and writing about combining DMT and EFP." .

Many metaphysicians have wanted a view which fits with folk intuitions, yet there is little agreement about what the folk intuit. I provide a range of empirical evidence which suggests that the folk operate with a teleological view of persistence: the folk tend to intuit that a material object survives alterations when its function is preserved. Given that the folk operate with a teleological view of persistence, I argue for a debunking explanation of folk intuitions, concluding that metaphysicians should dismiss folk intuitions as tied into a benighted view of nature." .

These structural characteristics, so frustrating to many new readers of hypertext, can also be found in popular and experimental films. In particular, Godfrey Reggio's (1983) documentary Koyaanisqatsi provides a good starting point for merging hypertext and film theory. Koyaanisqatsi not only broke new ground for documentary film; its structure also resembles Landow's model for an axial hypertext. At the same time, techniques pioneered by Landow, Joyce, Guyer, and others involved in creating and critiquing hypertext can be used to examine film. Having students look closely at Koyaanisqatsi's composition allows them to become amateur cinematographers, who now possess software for breaking a film down and examining its composition, montage, transitions, subliminal messages, and motifs – a process that may then be applied to hypertext." .

Lukacs-Bloch-Adorno stood in a complex but unclarified relation to the avant-garde; their failure to clarify this relation constitutes a limitation on their sociology of music. One wishes for a new Max Weber to put their broad statements to some kind of historical test. However, the condition of music today calls for a different kind of sociology than they produced; the fragmentation of music into a multiplicity of styles and audiences, the cornucopia of choices that make available almost all musics from all eras throughout the world, the specialization and fragmentation of audiences for the classics, for avant-garde experiments, for folk music, ethnic musics, for rock, punk, and whatever else, the co-existence of more than one style of composition, all require a sociology of music that is not encompassed by a single philosophical approach." .

The relation between news and timing, however, does not appear to be strictly monotonic. Furthermore, we find that unexpected earnings explain 4% or less of the variation in timing. Finally, we assess whether abnormal returns behave in a manner that is consistent with a good news early, bad news late relation." .

As a consequence, there are multiple steps in the differential resistance, each step corresponding to a different pattern of filamentary flow. This results in a strong history dependence of the depinning current and current voltage characteristics. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments on amorphous Mo77Ge23 thin films." .

So far there has been no method for determining the film structure from experimental data and the problem has been usually solved by trial and error." .

State anxiety was assessed before and after a 3-mo. education programme, using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The target group followed a class in modern dance. Control group were (1) a physical education group to control for the effects of exercise, (2) a music group to control for aesthetic sensitivity training, and (3) a mathematics group. Several concomitant variables were measured: age, sex, attitude towards dance, and previous experience in sport, dance, and relaxation. Dance training significantly reduced anxiety, but no control activities did so. Examination of the concomitant variables showed that the result could not be accounted for by any obvious artifacts." .

The meanings of ballroom dancing and its benefits are explored for 60 elderly Brazilians through participant observation and questionnaires. This study adds to the growing number of dance projects and research for older people, responding in part to evidence that dance is a form of therapy for its valuable means in augmenting mental, emotional and physical well-being and to counteract social isolation. The dance project took place through the Third Age Club, which was founded by The Viçosa County’s Social Assistance Department and the Federal University of Viçosa. At the end of one year taking the ballroom dance classes, the senior citizens were asked to answer a questionnaire in order to provide subjective information on the meanings of ballroom dancing and its benefits for them. The outcome of this inquiry was analyzed under a qualitative approach, phenomenological hermeneutics. Five major categories of therapeutic meanings of ballroom dancing for participants are: ballroom dancing is fun; it brings health benefits; it brings back good dancing memories; it allows participants to establish cultural connections to the larger Brazilian dancing culture; it provides opportunities for socializing. The article ends with reflective analysis of the researchers’ observations and field notes by suggesting that the ballroom dancing classes created a culture of inclusion that embraced both understanding and acceptance among senior citizens, which in turn might improve their quality of life." .

In this paper, authentic movement is described, and three aspects are discussed and related to the theory and practice of dance therapy: inner listening, withnessing and process orientation. This work is based on fifteen years of experience with authentic movement in the Santa Barbara authentic movement group. Clinical examples are drawn from Cottage Hospital's psychiatric unit, Sanctuary House (a residential treatment program), and the author's private practice. It is concluded that the study of authentic movement can make a meaningful contribution to the training and continuing education of dance therapists." .

Patients and methodsTwo hundred patients with chronic and/or advanced illnesses were prospectively evaluated. The effects of music therapy on these patients are reported. Visual analog scales, the Happy/Sad Faces Assessment Tool, and a behavior scale recorded pre- and post-music therapy scores on standardized data collection forms. A computerized database was used to collect and analyze the data. ResultsUtilizing the Wilcoxon signed rank test and a paired t test, music therapy improved anxiety, body movement, facial expression, mood, pain, shortness of breath, and verbalizations. Sessions with family members were also evaluated, and music therapy improved families’ facial expressions, mood, and verbalizations. All improvements were statistically significant (P<0.001). Most patients and families had a positive subjective and objective response to music therapy. Objective data were obtained for a large number of patients with advanced disease. ConclusionsThis is a significant addition to the quantitative literature on music therapy in this unique patient population. Our results suggest that music therapy is invaluable in palliative medicine." .

Positions of a series of lines in back reflection region are used as input data for the computer evaluation, which are a linear function of the Bragg angle (or its complement) so that in the case of film measurement the diameter of the camera, and in the case of diffractometer measurement, the zero setting of the goniometer need not be determined independently. The method is illustrated in detail for back reflection film measurements in a cylinder camera. The method is aimed at making easy the applied accurate lattice parameter measurements." .

Across two studies, male and female college students (N = 232 and 199) were primed to think about the seasons and indicate their music preference from Rentfrow and Gosling’s (2003) music classification scheme. Participants were predicted to prefer reflexive and complex music when primed with fall/winter and energetic and rhythmic and upbeat and conventional music when primed with spring/summer. Study 1 had participants read winter or summer season scenarios and Study 2 had participants write their own fall, winter, spring, or summer seasonal experiences. Overall, results were consistent with predictions for the reflexive and complex and energetic and rhythmic classifications, indicating an environmental influence of musical preferences." .

This highlights a significant and intriguing gap in the field given that there is sufficient evidence that touch may be commonly used in DMT. This qualitative research study is based on interviews with three experienced dance/movement therapists regarding their applications of and choices surrounding the use of touch in their DMT sessions. The study is intended to be an initial exploration into how the issue of touch is approached and used in the DMT session. Several incipient themes are identified and discussed, and the need for more research and involvement by the DMT field is emphasized." .

A second related problem consists in studying whether a weighted game has a minimum integer realization. In this paper we simultaneously analyze both problems by using linear programming. For less than 9 voters, we find that there are 154 weighted games without minimum integer realization, but all of them have minimum normalized realization. Isbell in 1958 was the first to find a weighted game without a minimum normalized realization, he needed to consider 12 voters to construct a game with such a property. The main result of this work proves the existence of weighted games with this property with less than 12 voters." .

As one of a growing number of Latin American artists committed to combating the “institutionalized forgetfulness” of human rights violations throughout the hemisphere, Hernández-Salazar deploys geographically-rich photographic installations to help his society remember its difficult past. The installations, known as Street Angel, are like ghosts haunting the graves of the murdered, fortresses of the powerful, bastions of the complicit. By shedding light on these ghostly angels, this article reveals the important role of photography, as a crucial vehicle of memory, in bearing witness to the unimaginable horrors that consumed much of the twentieth century, as well as that technology’s limitations. It also shows how remembrances of those atrocities depend on urban space for their grounding, articulation, and maintenance. Finally, by probing the artistic impulse and political sensibility that created Guatemala City’s angels of memory, it makes the case that, in the combustible political climate of post-war Central America, the work of remembering the past is not an antiquarian exercise: the labor of memory is a fundamental component of building a just society." .

We exploit a nonlinear evolution equation describing the long-wave spatiotemporal dynamics of the film thickness derived in our earlier work and studied there for small-amplitude initial conditions. In this case, the existence of a critical curve separating between the domains of ruptured and contiguous states in the forcing amplitude–frequency space was shown. We find that near-rupture configurations of the film may be healed by applying harmonic forcing of the substrate with a sufficiently large forcing amplitude. We also reveal that for large forcing delay times the critical forcing amplitude is determined from a constant value of a linear combination of the maximal velocity and acceleration imparted by the forcing on the system when the rest of the problem parameters remains fixed. In the long-range limit, the dynamics of healed films reproduces the long-time dynamics of the films evolving from small-amplitude initial conditions for the same parameter set. It is found that local axial movement of the satellite drop in the near-rupture zone leads to a substantial slow-down of an increase in the critical amplitude in the intermediate range of the forcing delay time when the forcing frequency is fixed." .

The news media provide significant health information to the American public. Although the public turns to and trusts local television news, news about cancer has not been systematically examined. Methods. In this content analysis, we examined 40,112 news stories aired in the 3rd, 25th, 87th, and 150th sized market in the country, all located in the Midwest. Results. In total, 386 stories focused on cancer. News stories about cancer were short and occurred less than once for every 30 minutes of news. The amount of news coverage of specific cancer sites was not consistent with cancer incidence rates. Similarly, the demography of cancer patients featured in the news differed from that in real life. Few stories provided follow-up information. The average story required a 10th-grade education to be understood. Differences across markets were not systematically related to market size. Conclusions. Cancer coverage was scattered and abbreviated. For both cancer practitioners as well as the general public, local television news cannot be counted on as a primary vehicle for cancer information." .

The liquid sheet produced at a high impact velocity was mainly concerned. Also more features and insights of the sheet were numerically studied using the coupled level set and volume of fluid method, considering effects of four non-dimensional parameters: Reynolds number, Weber number, dimensionless film thickness and drop–film curvature ratio. Results reveal that splashing can be suppressed by decreasing Reynolds number and Weber number. An increase in both the dimensionless film thickness and the film–drop curvature ratio is adverse to splashing onset. In addition, these four parameters can also greatly affect the geometrical shape and diameter of the sheet. In the second part, the air gap generated in the sheet–film contact neck region was investigated. It was noted that gas and liquid vortices produced near the liquid film surface render the film liquid to sink to form the air gap. Meanwhile, liquid accumulates inside the liquid sheet base gradually. Analysis in the velocity field suggests that the very thin preexisting film should be responsible for the vortex generation and the curvature ratio has minor effects on it, which is confirmed quantitatively as well." .

When the manager's information is such that there is no affirmative duty to disclose under Rule 10b-5, previous research has shown that the manager will withhold his information if it is sufficiently unfavorable and will disclose it otherwise. When the manager's information is such that there exists an affirmative duty to disclose under Rule 10b-5, it is shown here that the manager will release either good news or news that is sufficiently bad. Further, the good news disclosures are expected to be more precise than those that reflect unfavorable information. It is also demonstrated that the probability of a disclosure will increase with both the precision of the manager's information and the variability of his firm's earnings." .

Dance/movement therapists are equipped with specific techniques, deep body knowledge and a philosophical frame to enable them to skillfully work with individuals who feel disconnected from their bodies as a result of the physical degeneration often accompanying one’s transition to death. This research, steeped in the experiences of those confronting death, demonstrates the innate qualities of dance/movement therapy deemed useful to individuals moving into the final stages of life as well as to the entire field of palliative care." .

For clinical evaluation, 18 criteria were selected. These included overall assessment of the area of coverage, clarity of dental structures, clarity of bony outlines, specific anatomic details such as the maxillary sinus floor, mandibular canal and mandibular condyle, and region-by-region assessment of the dentition. Observers acted independently using identical optimal viewing conditions. Film and digital radiographs were evaluated separately. A five interval Likert rating scale was used. Digital images were rated superior to the conventional film radiographs for 14 criteria. Film radiographs marginally outperformed digital images for three criteria. For one criterion (periodontal bone status) the two modalities showed no difference in terms of the mean ratings. It was concluded that digital images are clinically equivalent to conventional film/screen images for panoramic dental radiography." .

Conditional on actual events, changes in reported conflict intensity could influence tourists because alternative sources of information are costly; this explanation is consistent with a rational choice model. However, television news could influence tourist behavior because of its emotional impact, or because it causes the conflict to be brought to mind more readily, increasing the subjective probability of conflict events. We find that tourists respond to variations in actual Israeli casualties and reported Palestinian casualties; both effects are large. Reports of Israeli casualties and unreported Palestinian casualties have no significant impact on tourist flows. These asymmetries are consistent with asymmetric information costs within a rational choice framework, but are more difficult to square with the alternative explanations for media influence." .

The first part explores the process by which information passes from the scientist or forecaster, through the media filter, to the public. As part of this filter preference, omission, selection of data, source, quote and story, as well as placement of the same information within an individual piece or within the newspaper itself, can serve to distort the message. The result is the introduction of bias and slant—that is, the message becomes distorted so as to favor one side of the argument against another as it passes through the filter. Bias can be used to support spin or agenda setting, so that a particular emphasis becomes placed on the story which exerts an influence on the reader’s judgment. The net result of the filter components is either a negative (contrary) or positive (supportive) frame. Tabloidization of the news has also resulted in the use of strong, evocative, exaggerated words, headlines and images to support a frame. I illustrate these various elements of the media filter using coverage of the air space closure due to the April 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland). Using the British press coverage of this event it is not difficult to find examples of all media filter elements, application of which resulted in bias against the forecast and forecaster. These actors then became named and blamed. Within this logic, it becomes only too easy for forecasters and scientists to be framed in a negative way through blame culture. The result is that forecast is framed in such a way so as to cause the forecaster to be blamed for all losses associated with the loss-causing event. Within the social amplification of risk framework (SARF), this can amplify a negative impression of the risk, the event and the response. However, actions can be taken to avoid such an outcome. These actions revolve around use of words and quotes that cannot easily be exaggerated or turned into “sledgehammer” or blaming headlines, while tracking the media for developing frames so as to guide future communications." .

The press primarily framed the events as a single problem of global interaction: an issue of ‘freedom of speech’ opposed to ‘religious sensitivity.’ Much of the coverage permitted, within limits, a plurality of voices. Drawing on a case study of stories about the ‘cartoon controversy’ in the Boston Globe, I argue that U.S. journalism is organized by a logic of objectivity that seeks to produce a ‘perspectiveless perspective on all perspectives’ (Bourdieu, On television. New York: The New Press, 1998), showing voices on ‘both sides,’ simultaneously masked and contributed to the press’s reifying a series of events into a single global ‘event,’ one that reflected a clash of Western and Islamic values." .

The temperature is constant and the control parameter is the solvent vapor pressure above the film (i.e. the activity). Several experimental protocols have been used, starting from a high activity where the film is swollen and rubbery and then aging the film at different activities below the glass transition. Desorption and resorption curves have been compared for the different protocols, in particular in terms of the softening time, i.e. the time needed by the sample to recover an equilibrium state at high activity. Non-trivial behaviors have been observed, especially at small activities (deep quench). A model is proposed, extending the Leibler-Sekimoto approach to take into account the structural relaxation in the glassy state, using the Tool formalism. This model well captures some of the observed phenomena, but fails in describing the specific kinetics observed when aging is followed by a short but deep quench." .

The research was conducted at a child care center on an urban university campus in the southeastern USA. The research employed a participatory design and used a qualitative, reflexive approach to include the child’s voice, ideas, and understandings of their play through the use of child-created, digital images. Four forms of digital imagery were evident: performance imagery in which an image or scene was orchestrated; live action imagery in which a playful experience was created so that the photographer or videographer would appear on film; documentary imagery in which the camera became a tool to capture or describe an everyday image or event; and mobile image audiencing in which the original photographer or videographer was unintentionally captured in the digital record or intentionally recorded by other children as the original artist paused to review, edit, or display their work to others. Children displayed a sophisticated understanding of how they could construct or co-construct knowledge, culture, and identity through the use of digital media. This research provides insight into children’s spontaneous play and their roles as creators and consumers of digital media and imagery." .

Natural disasters thus provide an environment that makes visible the general processes relevant to that link. Based on agenda-setting theory, stakeholder theory, and impression-management theory, we propose that corporations that are highly visible in the news media are more likely to engage in CPR and donate more money. We also propose that companies with reputations for irresponsibility or vulnerability strengthen that tendency. Data from Chinese firms after the Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008, and the corresponding empirical results support our hypotheses.

Music interpretation is necessary to generate a musically acceptable performance. We have been constructing a rule-based music interpretation system that generates sophisticated performance from a printed music score. The whole performance data are given by the product of expression of each dynamic mark explicitly drawn in the score and expression of analyzed motives. This paper describes the function of learning how to play music, which is the most important process in music interpretation. The target to be learned are expression rules and grouping strategy; expression rules are used in order to convert dynamic marks and motives into concrete performance data, and grouping strategy is used in order to extract motives from note sequence. They are learned from the given virtuoso performance. The delicate control of attack-timing, duration and strength of notes are extracted by the music transcription function. The performance rules are learned by investigating how the same or similar musical primitives are played in the performance. As for the grouping strategy, the system analyzes how the player grouped music, and registers dominant note-sequences to extract motives." .

It provides a theme analysis of content of 234 gambling stories printed in the top two daily newspapers in Nova Scotia. The findings of our content analysis indicate that pro-gambling corporate and political newspaper sources waged a successful media campaign and constructed a powerful public rhetoric in support of new gambling products, services, and institutions. The media, for their part, gave visibility and form to these structured messages. They helped create expectations about gambling and economics and gambling and government. Law and order, and moral and medical discourses about gambling, we discovered, were minor representations in the news coverage, although moral narratives were a pervasive secondary theme in much of the reporting. At bottom, the press produced a “politics of truth” about gambling that was both an external exercise of power and an internal organizational production." .

Yet, we do not thoroughly understand the consequences of this unpopularity for mass political behavior. While several existing studies find that media trust moderates media effects, they do not examine the consequences of this for voting. This paper explores those consequences by analyzing voting behavior in the 2004 presidential election. It finds, consistent with most theories of persuasion and with studies of media effects in other contexts, that media distrust leads voters to discount campaign news and increasingly rely on their partisan predispositions as cues. This suggests that increasing aggregate levels of media distrust are an important source of greater partisan voting." .

This article presents a general modeling approach based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the prediction of squeeze-film damping on resonators in the free-molecule regime. The generality of the approach is demonstrated in its capability of simulating resonators of any shape and with any accommodation coefficient. The approach is validated using both the analytical results of the free-space damping and the experimental data of the squeeze-film damping on a clamped–clamped plate resonator oscillating at its first flexure mode. The effect of oscillation modes on the quality factor of the resonator has also been studied and semi-analytical approximate models for the squeeze-film damping with diffuse collisions have been developed." .

The distribution of citations of individual papers approximates to a power-law [S. Redner, Eur. Phys. J. B 4, 131 (1998)], while lifetime total citations of the 1120 most-cited physicists follows a stretched exponential [J. Laherrère, D. Sornette, Eur. Phys. J. B 2, 525 (1998)]. Here, I examine the distribution of success in popular music, a field of creativity that has social structures very different from those of physics, and which is generally held to be controlled primarily by fashion. For this study, the lifetime total success of bands was measured by the total number of weeks they were in the weekly `top 75' list of best-selling recordings. Like the lifetime success of physicists reported by Laherrere and Sornette, the success of the 6107 bands that appeared in the UK `top 75' from 1950 until 2000 follows a stretched exponential of the form P(x)dx = c(x c - 1/x 0 c)exp[- (x/x 0)c]dx; for the music data, c = 0.5 and x 0 = 9.37." .

As a first step, the conventional parallel, angular and combined parallel and angular misalignments are modelled using Lagrange multipliers. The static equilibrium position of the journal within the bearing is determined using an iterative nonlinear static finite element analysis. The present work proposes a method for computing the displacement-dependent stiffness terms from the experimental static load-displacement data. Finally, the orbit of the rotor around the static equilibrium is determined using a time-integration scheme." .

The S-boxes exhibit good cryptographic properties such as high nonlinearity, low differential uniformity and high algebraic degree. The method involves the use of a trinomial power function as the initial S-box. The elements in the S-box are then permuted using the bee waggle dance algorithm. The S-boxes produced using this method are found to compare reasonably well with other existing S-boxes constructed using alternative heuristic methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to construct cryptographically strong S-boxes using the bee waggle dance algorithm." .

A single film (typical of a film in a foam) moving in a confined geometry (i.e. confined between closely spaced top and bottom plates) is analysed via the viscous froth model. In the first instance the film is considered to be straight (as viewed from above the top plate) but is not flat. Instead it is curved (with a circular arc cross-section) in the direction across the confining plates. This curvature leads to a maximal possible steady propagation velocity for the film, which is characterised by the curved film meeting the top and bottom plates tangentially. Next the film is considered to propagate in a channel (i.e. between top and bottom plates and sidewalls, with the sidewall separation exceeding that of the top and bottom plates). The film is now curved along as well as across the top and bottom plates. Curvature along the plates arises from viscous drag forces on the channel sidewall boundaries. The maximum steady propagation velocity is unchanged, but can now also be associated with films meeting channel sidewalls tangentially, a situation which should be readily observable if the film is viewed from above the top plate. Observed from above, however, the film need not appear as an arc of a circle. Instead the film may be relatively straight along much of its length, with curvature pushed into boundary layers at the sidewalls." .

There is an orchestra, the musicians, whose tones and notes must flow, complement and harmonize with one another. There is a main theme. As the music builds variations on the theme are played, and new themes and subthemes are introduced. The basinett responds to the strings, the bass emphasizes the mood of the violin, while the french horn adds a new melody. The subtlety and evenness of flow, the seeming simplicity of the piece, the rich interleaving of subdevelopments, variations, tangents, and recapitulations, are what make a piece of music great. Coherent communication is much the same. It looks easy. It flows. It seems effortless. In reality, of course, it is rich and complex, in both form and content. As in music, conversants may begin a conversation slowly, tentatively, with some simple (or complex) topic in mind. Slowly the momentum builds, the connections surface, and the themes become defined. As in music, these themes are then elaborated upon in various ways. Topic elaborations often spawn their own variations. New themes and subthemes are introduced. All the while, as in music, original themes reappear and are interwoven with the new ones. The twists and turns of the conversation seem to occur effortlessly. In music, there is usually one composer in control of which instrument plays next; one composer who is in charge of what the instrument will say. There is a single coordinator of theme introductions, developments, variations, and interweavings. The composition is done off-line and usually involves editing and re-editing for flaws. In discourse, however, we have on-line development with multiple parties responsible for flow coordination. All parties have to organize their own turns, themes, and variations, in addition to their being able to integrate these items into co-conversants'. In their book, “Understanding Computers and Cognition,” Winograd and Flores (1987) cite the following from Gadamer (Winograd and Flores, 1987, p. 32): It is not so much our judgments as it is our prejudices that constitute our being ... the historicity of our existence entails that prejudices, in the literal sense of the word, constitute the initial directedness of our whole ability to experience. Prejudices are biases of our openness to the world. They are simply conditions whereby we experience something — whereby what we encounter says something to us.

Archive-based artwork does not always contain or display its archival source. However, in some cases the archives themselves—rather than the information or evidence they hold—are utilised to form part or all of the work. This is particularly true where visual and audiovisual records are used creatively. The archival record is thus interpreted and re-created, giving rise to potential tensions and discord. Focusing on the film archive—and in particular on documentary film originally created and collected for the purpose of recording and accountability—the paper addresses this act of creative interpretation and re-creation. Firstly, it considers the use of archives in the creation and/or destabilisation of national identity and collective memory. Specifically, it examines the re-use of visual evidence of the Holocaust and its aftermath. Among others, it discusses the work of artist Eyal Sivan, whose use of archival material from the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann has caused great controversy. Secondly, Walter Benjamin’s concept of aura and its application to archives is used to highlight the conflict that such forms of creative engagement may bring to the archival arena and to questions concerning the role and responsibility of the archivist as access provider or gate keeper." .

The liquid exudes from 1580 holes distributed uniformly over the lower plate surface. An advantage of the system is that there are no moving parts, but it is important to evaluate the device using Newtonian liquids in order to compare the load bearing capacity with that predicted by equations developed for orthodox squeeze film systems. Liquid maldistribution is shown to be a problem which may be solved in various ways, one of which is to ensure that the pressure drop through the plate is high relative to that in the squeeze film. Results obtained using Newtonian liquids make satisfactory comparison with theoretical predictions, though liquid inertia probably makes a lower contribution to load bearing than is the case for an orthodox squeeze film. Liquid maldistribution is allowed for on a theoretical basis or corrected by the use of a distributor plate placed below the perforated surface. Preliminary tests using viscoelastic solutions (based on polyacrylamide of high molecular weight) suggest that the load bearing properties of the squeeze film are significantly enhanced. A load 600 per cent greater than the theoretical load is obtained in one case, the suggestion being made that this is due to stress of viscoelastic origin." .

For example, oceans, deserts, mountains, etc. cannot be fully understood and experienced by all people in the world. However, there is one landscape that is likely available to all cultures—outer space. By investigating this panorama that is accessible all over the globe, geography can gain insight into landscape interpretation. Film is an ideal medium for this endeavor. Unlike most film landscape interpretation that concentrates on landscape as a text or a way of seeing, I argue that three understandings of landscape, landscape as mediated by technology, landscape as a way of seeing, and landscape as engagement, all interact with one another to create cinematic outer space.

The purpose is not only to improve mechanical properties and lower the impact sensitivity of traditional aluminized explosives, but also to reduce environmental pollution in the aluminum particle production process. The pressure-time curves of the aluminum film explosive and RDX are measured in underwater explosion experiments. The peak pressure, impulse, shock wave energy, and bubble energy are obtained by analyzing the curves. The results of the study indicate that the peak pressure of the aluminum film explosive is lower than that of RDX. However, the aluminum film explosive maintains a high pressure for a longer period of time.

Sometimes, though, the media distort reality. The current study focuses on the media exaggeration of the threat posed by nonsexual HIV-related assaults. Although such assaults are widely perceived as serious threats, the likelihood of HIV being transmitted through a biting, spitting, or needlestick incident is quite small. Based on news accounts culled from 17 of the largest newspapers in the United States, the findings illustrate how headlines rely upon sensational language, negative stereotyping of offenders, and the cloak of “neutral and objective” court decisions to articulate a sense of order and morality while simultaneously exaggerating the threat people with HIV pose to the general public." .

BackgroundThe anxiolytic and analgesic effects of music have been described in previous trials. Some authors have suggested to evaluate whether patient-selected music is more effective than the music selected by the physician in reducing anxiety and stress levels. Methods and resultsAfter randomization 100 patients (group A) were allowed to choose between classical music, relaxing modern music, smooth jazz, and no music. One hundred patients (group B) were randomized directly to one of these therapies (n = 25 each). Complete data were available for 197 patients (65 ± 10 years; 134 male). Using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) all patients in group B who listened to music showed a significantly higher decrease of their anxiety level (STAI-State difference pre-post of 16.8 ± 10.2) compared to group A (13.3 ± 11.1; p = 0.0176). Patients without music (6.2 ± 6.7) had a significantly weaker reduction of anxiety compared to all music-listeners (14.9 ± 10.7, p < 0.0001). ConclusionsThe positive effects of music in the cath lab support previous reports. Surprisingly, the hypothesis that the patient’s choice of preferred music might yield higher benefits than a randomized assignment could be dismissed." .

This study targeted news reports in major newspapers regarding an incident of mass nosocomial Serratia infection that occurred at one clinic. The trends in the total number of articles and total number of characters contained in the articles were congruent, with a peak on the day after the incident was disclosed and a rapid decrease thereafter. The numbers of articles and characters that appeared during the first 3 days corresponded to 45 and 51% of those that appeared during the entire study period. On day 9, it was published that Serratia liquefaciens propagated on medical instruments, and both the number of articles and the number of characters increased by approximately 40% in comparison to those published on the day after the initial report of the incident. The individual articles were deemed to be medically accurate; however, the main problem was that only part of the specific medical issue had been emphasized because of a poor balance in the number of news reports on this topic." .

However its sound intensity has never been carefully measured. In this paper the sound power measurements of Gaohu were performed in a reverberation chamber according to the Chinese national standard. Two qualified musicians performed on their own instruments. The mean sound power levels and the dynamic ranges of Gaohu were investigated by four channel acoustic measuring equipments when single notes, music scale and melodies were performed under pp, mp, f and ff dynamics. Great differences were found when Gaohu performed single notes, while the sound power levels were quite close when music scale were performed under f dynamic to those when melodies were performed under normal dynamic mark, the sound power levels of Gaohu when music scale was performed under f dynamics were suggested as the typical and representative value of the sound intensities of Gaohu instrument." .

Surprisingly, I observed no significant correlations between the Dark Triad and “liberal” judgments. In order to determine whether these results were an artifact of the particular issues I selected, I ran a follow-up study testing the Dark Triad against conservative and liberal judgments on 15 additional moral issues. The new issues examined include illegal immigration, abortion, the teaching of “intelligent design” in public schools, the use of waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques” in the war on terrorism, laws defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and environmentalism. 1154 participants (680 male, 472 female; median age 29), recruited online through Amazon Mechanical Turk, completed three surveys: a 15-item Moral Intuition Survey (MIS), the 28-item Short Dark Triad personality inventory, and a five-item demographic survey. The results strongly reinforce my earlier findings. Twenty-two significant correlations were observed between “conservative” judgments and the Dark Triad (all of which were significant past a Bonferonni-corrected significance threshold of p = .0008), compared to seven significant correlations between Dark Triad and “liberal” judgments (only one of which was significant past p = .0008). This article concludes by developing a novel research proposal for determining whether the results of my two studies are “bad news” for conservatives or liberals." .

Many analytical models for predicting SFD on the microplate vibrating in a tilting motion have been well established in the past. However, most of the previous works focused on the rectangular torsion microplates. There are few analytical models for the SFD on the circular microplate vibrating in the tilting motion. Only one model was developed by Xia et al. (Microfluid Nanofluid 19:585–593, 2015). However, the gas in the air gap was treated as an incompressible gas in their model, and the perforation effect was not considered. This paper first studies the SFD on a non-perforated circular microplate vibrating in the tilting motion. The effects of both gas compressibility and rarefaction are considered in a modified Reynolds equation. The air pressure under the circular microplate is approximated by using Bessel series. A more accurate analytical expression for the damping and spring constants has been developed. Then, the model for the non-perforated microplates is extended to include the perforation effect. The present models are validated by comparison of the numerical results obtained by finite element method over a wide range of frequency and perforation ratios." .

The cathodic photocurrents are interpreted in terms of the Gaertner-Butler model on the basis of the theory of the semiconductor|solution interface. The (i ph hν)2/n vs. hν plots taken from the photocurrent spectra show two linearities for n=1 in the wavelength range from 460 nm to 490 nm and for n=4 in the wavelength range λ > 490 nm. The band gaps of the PBT film were determined to be 2.05 ± 0.05 eV for n=1 and 1.55 ± 0.05 eV for n=4. The flat-band potential is 0.33 V (vs SCE).

The data indicate a substantial bias in terms of the amounts of negative and positive reports, compared with the actual development of unemployment. Moreover, the media tend to place negative unemployment reports more prominently than positive ones. The estimates suggest that the bias is not the consequence of journalists asymmetrically interpreting the official unemployment numbers. Instead, it is associated with the exploitation of often non-economic information and structural influences in the process of news production." .

In contrast to fractionated brachytherapy treatments, where the effect of incorrect positioning of the source in one treatment fraction can be diminished by correcting the position in subsequent fractions, the I-125 seed implant is permanent, making correct positioning of the seeds in the prostate essential. The seeds are inserted into the prostate using needles. Correct configuration of seeds in the needles is essential in order to deliver the planned treatment. A comparison of an autoradiograph obtained by exposing film to the seed-loaded needles with the patient treatment plan is a valuable quality assurance tool. However, the time required to sufficiently expose Kodak XOMAT V film, currently used in this department is significant. This technical note presents the use of Kodak CR film for acquisition of the radiograph. The digital radiograph can be acquired significantly faster, has superior signal-to-noise ratio and contrast and has the usual benefits of digital film, e.g. a processing time which is shorter than that required for non-digital film, the possibility of image manipulation, possibility of paper printing and electronic storage." .

First we take a closer look at how journalists (re)framed six official press releases in 75 news reports. It turns out that journalists do not regularly adopt the success frame that the Public Prosecution uses in its press releases. Furthermore, the role of the Public Prosecution Service or the police is downplayed. The moral message that “crime should not pay” receives no coverage in news reports. Second, we analyze how the news reports generated 276 online comments. We distinguish three ways in which online commenters respond to news reports; they (1) appreciate, (2) downplay or (3) condemn the authorities’ success. Commenters are particularly likely to downplay or condemn the police’s success. When a news report focuses on ‘underground bankers’, commenters often express a negative opinion about the effort to curb money laundering. It also appears that readers did not always understand the use of a term like underground banking." .

The qualitative analysis of a news videotape begins with choosing analytical units that meet one's theoretical goals but which do not do violence to the nature of the content at hand. After a transcription of the verbal content is done, patterns in the script and in journalist-news source interactions can be identified. The analyst then listens for “tunes” in news speech which may, for instance, convey humor or skepticism. Television news relies on a visual symbolic code consisting of objects that suggest the topic at hand, of conventions for camera angle and distance, and of journalists' facial expressions. A complete qualitative analysis of the news message produces an exhaustive data matrix showing the juxtaposition of all message elements. This becomes the foundation for a rigorous, wholistic “account of accounts.”" .

These fields are generated by the global description of cosmological models with two interactive fluids in the dark sector and under certain conditions they correspond to usual k-essences. The formalism is applied to the cases of constant potential and of inverse square potential and also we develop the purely exotik version for the modified holographic Ricci type (MHR) of dark energy, where the equations of state are not constant. With the kinetic function $$F=1+mx$$ F=1+mx and the inverse square potential we recover, through the interaction term, the identification between k-essences and quintessences of an exponential potential, already known for Friedmann–Robertson–Walker and Bianchi type I geometries. Worked examples are shown that include the self-interacting MHR and also models with crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL)." .

The analysis of this artwork reveals the modes of politicization open to artists—holding different types of position in the film industry and diversely positioned in terms of their own careers—in this particular professional sphere. This case study contrasts both with the experiences of activist filmmakers in the 1960–1970s, in the USA as well as in France, and with the explicitly political, if not partisan, posture taken in a number of contemporary documentary films regarding Iraq. The paper first depicts the ambivalent type of involvement built through the participants’ discourses and activities around this movie. They refer to a civic duty fulfilled through their contribution to the making of the film but, at the same time, they remain extremely cautious, restrictive and minimal in the way they publicly acknowledge its connection to any “political message.” In so doing, they paradoxically define an “a-political engaged art.” The second section of the study analyzes the professional logics and rules driving the protagonists, resulting in such naming and framing mechanisms. The participants work to reshape the political events referred to in the movie according to the formats and limits required by the film world, in order to avoid the risk of transgressing the specialized norms and codes used to evaluate the quality of an artwork. The conditions of appropriate actions are thus defined at the crossroads between political dynamics and professional constraints." .

Perceived ease of use and workflow of each device is collected via a technologist opinion survey. Productivity is measured as the rate of patient throughput from normalized timing studies. The overall speed of service is calculated from the time of examination ordering as stamped in the radiology information system (RIS), to the time of image availability on the picture archiving and communication system (PACS), to the time of interpretation rendered (from the RIS). A cost comparison is discussed in terms of potential productivity gains and device expenditures. Comparative results of a screen-film (analog) dedicated chest unit versus a CR reader and a DR dedicated chest unit show a higher patient throughput for the digital systems. A mean of 8.2 patients were moved through the analog chest room per hour, versus 9.2 patients per hour using the CR system and 10.7 patients per hour with the DR system. This represents a 12% increase in patient throughput for CR over screen-film; a 30% increase in patient throughput for DR over screen-film, which is statistically significant; and a 16% increase in patient throughput for DR over CR, which is not statistically significant. Measured time to image availability for interpretation is much faster for both CR and DR versus screen-film, with the mean minutes to image availability calculated as 29.2 ± 14.3 min for screen-film, 6.7 ± 1.5 min for CR, and 5.7 ± 2.5 min for DR. This represents an improved time to image availability of 77% for CR over screen-film, 80% for DR over screen-film, and 15% for DR over CR. These results are statistically significant (P <.0001) for both CR over screen-film and DR over screen-film but not statistically significant for DR over CR. A comparison of the digital technology costs illustrates that the high cost of DR may not be justifiable unless a facility has a steady high patient volume to run the device at or near 100% productivity. Both CR and DR can improve workflow and productivity over analog screen-film in a PACS for delivery of projection radiography services in an outpatient environment. Cost justification for DR over CR appears to be tied predominantly to high patient volume and continuous rather than sporadic use patterns." .

It is not likely that this situation will change for some time. It is apparent that there is a wide variety of computer applications being tested in music research and equally apparent that there is only limited collaboration and limited effort at devising common procedures. It is to be hoped that the future will see the acceptance of one music representation as a lingua franca; the development of widely usable programs with a central clearing house for such programs; and the development of data banks of encoded music scores, thematic indices of various repertories, and other information useful to the music researcher." .

His assassination provoked an international outcry, which ended the 30-year presence of Syria and led to the withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon. This paper explores the different representations of Syria in news reports following the investigation into Hariri’s murder. The main aim is to examine the efficacy of Halliday’s systems of THEME and INFORMATION in detecting ideological representations in the news. By ideological representations, we refer to the socially-shared meanings, beliefs and opinions expressed by mainstream news media regarding the portrayal of Syria and its link to the attacks in Lebanon. This paper, which is an extract from my doctoral thesis, is the first attempt to adopt Halliday’s functional model of Theme-Rheme in Arabic and apply his understanding of the clause as a message to English and Arabic news reports. The analysis compares and contrasts the thematic and information structures in 14 reports (7 in English and 7 in Arabic), which were published between 25 and 27 September 2006 by mainstream online news media, including Al-Jazeera and the British Broadcasting Corporation. The news sources provide English and Arabic versions allowing for a comparable analysis of structure, content and style. The results of the analysis confirm that Halliday’s systems of THEME and INFORMATION are effective tools to unlock the meaning-potential in Arabic clauses and detect underlying ideologies in English and Arabic news reports." .

This empowerment persists in various reinventions of the culture within the United States and worldwide. The present study examines whether evidence exists in research to support the value of esteem, resilience, growth, community and change as empowering dimensions outlined in the individual and community empowerment framework. Research questions ask: (1) Does youth self-expression in rap music created within music therapy sessions reflect framework dimensions? (2) Does content in commercially recognizable rap music reflect framework dimensions? (3) How well does the framework align with a model of empowerment-based positive youth development? First, data collected to examine the validity of the framework were reviewed. Next, two peer-reviewed research studies published after articulation of the original framework, were examined to investigate commonality between themes and framework dimensions. One study was in a music therapy context and another explored themes in commercial Hip-Hop recordings. Original framework data supports theorizing that rap music content actually comprises developmental narratives (Travis and Deepak, 2011; Travis and Bowman, 2012). Data in the present study further suggest that these developmental narratives are relevant for Hip-Hop in every day music engagement, in therapeutic self-expression, and within commercially available musical content. Framework dimensions also aligned with a conceptual model of positive youth development that allows specification of intervention pathways and empirically testable outcomes for Hip-Hop integrated change strategies. Results suggest that rap music is a discourse in lifespan development. Rap music’s developmental narratives may be used by practitioners, parents and researchers. The narratives exist within a framework and model that (a) provides a template for better understanding these narratives and (b) positions this understanding for use as a tool to promote and research positive change strategies for individuals and the communities that they value." .

Subjects then returned on the following day, practiced controlling heart rate again (or sat quietly, for subjects in the control condition), and then viewed the stressful film again. Heart-rate results indicated that subjects in both feedback groups manifested tonic decreases in heart rate from the first viewing of the film to the second, whereas subjects in both of the no-feedback groups manifested no changes in heart rate between viewings, and subjects in the control condition manifested increases in heart rate between viewings. However, all five groups of subjects displayed phasic increases in heart rate during specific stressors in the film during both viewings. The tonic changes in heart rate noted between viewings of the film for the feedback groups were not accompanied by parallel changes in electrodermal activity or respiration rate. Self-report ratings of subjects' beliefs about ability to control heart rate were significantly correlated with the tonic changes in heart rate that were noted between viewings of the stressful film." .

Studies of Canadian media have shown that news coverage often emphasizes and hypes certain aspects of high profile health debates. We hypothesized that in Canadian media coverage of access to healthcare issues about therapies and technologies including for rare diseases, the media would be largely sympathetic towards patients, thus adding to public debate that largely favors increased access to healthcare—even in the face of equivocal evidence regarding efficacy. MethodsIn order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a content analysis of 530 news articles about access to health therapies and technologies from 15 major Canadian newspapers over a 10-year period. Articles were analyzed for the perspectives presented in the articles and the types of reasons or arguments presented either for or against the particular access issue portrayed in the news articles. ResultsWe found that news media coverage was largely sympathetic towards increasing healthcare funding and ease of access to healthcare (77.4 %). Rare diseases and orphan drugs were the most common issues raised (22.6 %). Patients perspectives were often highlighted in articles (42.3 %). 96.8 % of articles discussed why access to healthcare needs to increase, and discussion that questioned increased access was only included in 33.6 % articles. ConclusionWe found that news media favors a patient access ethos, which may contribute to a difficult policy-making environment." .

As studies of this nature increase, the development of a simple replicable descriptive system for observing and analyzing group dance therapy can be evolved. Information gleaned from the findings can serve to examine validate or refute existing theories and open the doors for the beginning of a researched body of knowledge concerning dance therapy groups." .

The findings demonstrate that the MWCNT-PC film possesses good performance for the electrochemical oxidation of dopamine. Namely, the fabricated MWCNT-PC film having a detection limit and sensitivity of 4.06 μM and 0.823 A M−1 cm−2, respectively, seems to have greater detection ability towards dopamine/dopamine-o-quinone compared to other novel electrodes reported in the literature.

This article addresses how the diversity of ethnic dance styles may have therapeutic implications and what social or psychological functions these dance forms fulfill in their unique cultures. This article also provides both historic and present-day illustrations of the impact of cultural forms on therapy. Similarities were apparent in the use of traditional folkdances, particularly those in circle formations and the cross-cultural experience of simple, repetitive communal movements that are at the foundation of dance/movement therapy sessions worldwide. Diversity was demonstrated in the description of the origins (both from nature and human sources) of each culture’s unique dance and in the distinctive, descriptive stories that “tell the tale” of every folk form." .

He may have expected music to display fundamental patterns in the natural world and thriving human relationships, tasks that could be compromised by irregular and relatively complicated music like that of Zheng and Wei. He was also convinced that Zheng and Wei music would motivate undisciplined behavior in listeners. A third consideration may have been that even if some benefits of participation would derive from music that included innovations, traditional forms should be preferred because they would further bonds between generations and encourage a sense of community by emphasizing shared inheritance. Confucius seems unaware that innovation can help keep musical traditions alive, but he may have recognized that well-known music facilitates kinds of engagement that novel music cannot. Such engagement was key to what Confucius sought from music and would be reason enough for his judgment." .

Little is known about doctors’ formative experiences in giving bad news, what guidance they receive, or what lessons they learn in the process. OBJECTIVE: To learn the circumstances in which medical residents first delivered bad news to patients or families, the nature of their experience, and their opinions about how best to develop the needed skills. DESIGN: Confidential mailed survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: All medicine house officers at 2 urban, university-based residency programs in Boston. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Details of medical residents’ first clearly remembered experiences of giving bad news to a patient or family member; year in training; familiarity with the patient; information about any planning prior to, observation of, or discussion after their first experience; and the usefulness of such discussions. We also asked general questions about delivering bad news, such as how often this was done, as well as asking for opinions about actual and desired training. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine of two hundred thirteen surveys (61%) were returned. Most (73%) trainees first delivered bad news while a medical student or intern. For this first experience, most (61%) knew the patient for just hours or days. Only 59% engaged in any planning for the encounter. An attending physician was present in 6 (5%) instances, and a more-senior trainee in 14 (11%) others. Sixty-five percent of subjects debriefed with at least 1 other person after the encounter, frequently with a lesser-trained physician or a member of their own family. Debriefing focused on the reaction of those who were given the bad news and the reaction of the trainee. When there were discussions with more-senior physicians, before or after the encounter, these were judged to be helpful approximately 80% of the time. Most subjects had given bad news between 5 and 20 times, yet 10% had never been observed doing so. Only 81 of 128 (63%) had ever observed an attending delivering bad news, but those who did found it helpful 96% of the time. On 7-point scales, subjects rated the importance of skills in delivering bad news highly, (mean 6.8), believed such skill can be improved (mean 6.6), and thought that more guidance should be offered to them during such activity (mean 5.8). CONCLUSION: Medical students and residents frequently deliver bad news to patients and families. This responsibility begins early in training. In spite of their inexperience, many do not appear to receive adequate guidance or support during their earliest formative experiences." .

This material produces a stain on the application of pressure due to the rupture of microscopic bubbles releasing a liquid which, in turn, causes patches of color to be formed; a greater pressure produces a darker stain. These stains are often converted into digital images and manipulated to produce false-color pressuremaps, an approach which is beyond the simple methods of analysis suggested by the manufacturer. Due to the granular nature of Fuji film stains, the two user-defined variables which will determine the accuracy of any pressure-map are: (a) the size of the sample-area used to capture data from the original stain during the digitization process and (b) the number of pressure-intervals identified on each map; the chosen values should match the spatial and pressure resolutions of the film. Despite the importance of these factors, the literature presents a bewildering array of values, particularly for the number of pressure-intervals, with no validation of those chosen; consequently, little guidance is provided for other potential users of Fuji film. This paper discusses the relationship between sample-area and pressure-interval and introduces a method for examining their effect on the resulting pressure-maps. The results obtained using ‘Super Low’ grade Fuji film suggest that the authors of some previously reported methods may have been overambitious in their choice of sample-area and pressure-intervals. Finally, a series of suggested values of sample-area size and pressure-intervals are provided." .

Alongside the formation of “subaltern counterpublics” (Fraser), alternative media outlets sometimes develop. There, members of alternative publics debate their interests and strategize about how to be heard in wider, mass-mediated public arenas. I address the normative implications of this non-unitary, multiple-publics model for news journalism, analyzing how current conventions in mainstream news journalism (e.g., “balance” defined as “airing two extremes”) can restrict public debate and impoverish the public policy pedagogy on offer. I illustrate my arguments with a case study of media coverage of the creation and implementation of a social justice curriculum in British Columbia, Canada." .

A brief history of dance/movement therapy focuses on those aspects of dance that inspired the development of dance/movement therapy, and the socio-economic and political circumstances which nurtured its growth. Influences from the socio-economic and political climate of the 70's and 80's, and influences from within the dance/movement therapy profession are discussed as they relate to the current state of the field. A progression from movement alone to full-out self-expressive dance is postulated as a means to fuller therapeutic growth. The structural elements of a dance/movement therapy session are considered in relation to evoking the spirit of the dance in individuals and groups. Finally, the spirit of the dance is underscored as dance/movement therapy's unique contribution to the field of mental health." .

Of particular interest is whether audiences effectively perceive bias in opinionated news programs, and the extent to which there are partisan differences in these perceptions. Results from a series of three online experiments produce evidence for a relative hostile media phenomenon in the context of opinionated news. Although, overall, audiences perceive more story and host bias in opinionated news than in non-opinionated news, these perceptions—particularly perceptions of the host—vary as a function of partisan agreement with the news content. Specifically, issue partisans appear to have a “bias against bias,” whereby they perceive less bias in opinionated news with which they are predisposed to agree than non-partisans and especially partisans on the other side of the issue." .

Multimodal Environments (MEs) are systems capable of establishing creative, multimodal user interaction by exhibiting real-time adaptive behaviour. In a typical scenario, one or more users are immersed in an environment allowing them to communicate by means of full-body movement, singing or playing. Users get feedback from the environment in real time in terms of sound, music, visual media, and actuators, i.e. movement of semi-autonomous mobile systems including mobile scenography, on-stage robots behaving as actors or players, possibly equipped with music and multimedia output. MEs are therefore a sort of extension of augmented reality environments. From another viewpoint, an ME can be seen as a sort of prolongation of the human mind and senses. From an artificial intelligence perspective, an ME consists of a population of physical and as software agents capable of changing their reactions and their social interaction over time. For example, a gesture of the user(s) can mean different things in different situations, and can produce changes in the agents populating the ME. The paradigm adopted for movement recognition is that of a human observer of the dance, where the focus of attention changes according to the evolution of the dance itself and of the music produced. MEs are therefore agents able to observe the user, extract “gesture gestalts”, and change their state, including artificial emotions, over time. MEs open new niches of application, many still to be discovered, including music, dance, theatre, interactive arts, entertainment, interactive exhibitions and museal installations, information atelier, edutainment, training, industrial applications and cognitive rehabilitation (e.g. for autism). The environment can be a theatre, a museum, a discotheque, a school classroom, a rehabilitation centre for patients with a variety of sensory/motor and cognitive impairments, etc. The ME concept generalizes the bio-feedback methods which already have found widespread applications. The paper introduces MEs, then a flexible ME architecture, with a special focus on the modeling of the emotional component of the agents forming an ME. Description of four applications we recently developed, currently used in several real testbeds, conclude the paper." .

With a special planar design for the resistor we achieve the necassary low value of resistance of some 10−5Ω. The resistor remains normal conducting in the whole temperature range investigated, despite the proximity effect. The characteristic parameters of the RSQUID show negligible tmeperature dependence. An integrated RSQUID could revive noise thermometry in the mK range because of its higher signal to noise ratio and the advantages of simple read out electronics and easy handling compared to the bulk devices used up till now." .

Previous studies have shown that Nd:YAG laser irradiation is capable of promoting morphological and chemical changes of the dentin surface, indicating the possibility of an alteration of its radiographic image. Dentin of 2-mm-thick mid-coronal sections from 68 extracted posterior teeth was irradiated for 30 s by a Nd:YAG laser (λ=1,064 nm) on one half of its surface area. The other half was left as a control. The irradiation parameters were: 80 mJ/pulse, 0.8 W, 10 Hz, with a 320-μm flexible quartz optic fiber in contact mode. The 68 samples were radiographed with a 70-kV X-ray setup. The focus–film distance was established as 30 cm and there was no distance between the object and the film. The X-ray exposure time was set as 0.16 s and the radiographic film used was an F-speed dental film. The obtained radiographic images were submitted to a densitometric analysis. The images analyzed showed that there were statistically significant differences between the density of the irradiated dentin images and the non-irradiated dentin images. The image density data showed that the irradiated dentin radiographic images were 6.36% more radiopaque than the non-irradiated dentin images. The Nd:YAG laser irradiation of dentin is able to alter its radiographic image, producing more radiopaque images of the irradiated dentin." .

It has been demonstrated that the fluorescence emission of the film is sensitive to the presence of trace amount of nitroaromatic compound (NAC) vapors. As discovered in the present work, the response selectivity of the pyrene-functionalized film depends on the length of the spacer, the vapor pressure of a given NAC, and the quencher size. The film shows faster response to those quenchers which have higher vapor pressure and smaller size. Compared to the film with shorter spacers, the present film with longer flexible spacers shows a slower response to the NACs, but higher selectivity to the quencher size. Additionally, the detection limits to common explosives in vapor phase, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), are 7.14×10−12 and 5.49×10−11 g·mL−1, respectively. Further examinations indicated that the sensing process is fully reversible, and the vapors of those common interference such as benzene, toluene, ethanol, and perfume have little effect upon the sensing performances of the film." .

Most of the corollas in the patch of Justicia had been pierced by nectar-robbers. A consequence of this damage, together with local microclimate effects, was flower-to-flower variation in the amount and accessibility of nectar and in the nature and concentration of its minor components, notably amino acids. McDade and Kinsman's (1980) finding that nectar secretion could be suppressed by repeated sampling or by nectar-robbing was confirmed." .

In particular, a polypyrrole film was first deposited on the surface of a glassy-carbon electrode and then functionalized to incorporate nitro groups that were later electrochemically reduced to amine groups. The enzyme urease was attached to the film's amino groups through its carboxyl functionalities (i.e., C-terminus, aspartic and glutamic acid residues) by a carbodiimide reaction. The pH response of the polypyrrole film after incorporation of the enzyme was evaluated potentiometrically, resulting in a slope of —54±1 mV/pH. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, which causes a change in pH that can be detected by the polypyrrole film. The film containing the immobilized enzyme was tested for response to urea, typically showing detection limits of 1.4 × 10−4 ± 1 × 10−5 M (n = 3). Interference studies withN-methylurea and hydroxyurea were also conducted. The electrodes exhibited no response to the non-competitive inhibitorN-methylurea. The response characteristics of the electrodes towards urea remained unaffected afterN-methylurea additions. In the case of hydroxyurea, the electrodes responded slightly, but urea response was not restored afterwards." .

Because the thickness of oil film is considered, the model is more realistic than that raised in other paper in which only single rough surface is assumed. In this paper the coupled differential equations are derived and solved by full wave approach, and the simple expressions of back scattering cross section for oil film on sea surface have been obtained. According to these expressions some curves are given for different thickness of oil film. It is shown that the results obtained by the present model are in better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained by the single surface model." .

Through a content analysis of 649 US news items, we examined US media coverage of tobacco industry CSR and identified characteristics of media items associated with positive coverage. Most coverage appeared in local newspapers, and CSR initiatives unrelated to tobacco, with non-controversial beneficiaries, were most commonly mentioned. Coverage was largely positive. Tobacco control advocates were infrequently cited as sources and rarely authored opinion pieces; however, when their voices were included, coverage was less likely to have a positive slant. Media items published in the South, home to several tobacco company headquarters, were more likely than those published in the West to have a positive slant. The absence of tobacco control advocates from media coverage represents a missed opportunity to influence opinion regarding the negative public health implications of tobacco industry CSR. Countering the media narrative of virtuous companies doing good deeds could be particularly beneficial in the South, where the burdens of tobacco-caused disease are greatest, and coverage of tobacco companies more positive." .

The substrate film is made of sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, which is made insoluble in water by fixation in acid ethanol. The tissue is briefly fixed in cold formalin, washed, and sectioned with a freezing microtome. The sections are mounted on slides, and covered with a piece of carboxymethyl-cellulose film, and the slide is incubated in a warm, moist atmosphere. After incubation, the film is stained with toluidine blue, and sites of cellulase activity appear as pale or clear patches in the film. In the digestive systems of certain molluscs, cellulase has been found in the lumens of the crop and stomach, and in the lumen and absorptive cells of the digestive gland tubules. The salivary glands, and the epithelia of the crop and stomach, show no reaction. Sections of control tissue, inactivated by boiling in water, do not show any reaction." .

A critical analysis of two prevailing models, Dance/Movement Therapy and Expression Primitive, is articulated. Such analysis indicates that their development closely relates to issues of collective identity of the group in relation to their dancing cultures. From an anthropological point of view, then, issues of identity are paramount for an effective practice of dance/movement therapy." .

Even users without special musical knowledge can compose 16-bar musical works with one melody part and some backing parts using this system. The interactive Genetic Algorithm is introduced to music composition so that users’ feeling toward music is reflected in the composed music. One chromosome corresponds to 4-bar musical work information. Users participate in music composition by evaluating composed works after GA operators such as crossover, mutation, virus infection are applied to chromosomes based on the evaluation results. From the experimental results, it is found that the users’ evaluation values become high over the progress of generations. That is, the system can compose 16-bar musical works reflecting users’ feeling." .

At the same time, we compared each of these configurations to film-screen readings. This study used a treatment-by-reader-by-case factorial design. The sample included 70 mammograms with 34 malignant cases. The readers consisted of four radiologists who classified all of the cases according to the categories defined by the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). The evaluated capture devices included a specialized film digitizer and a digital camera, and the evaluated displays included liquid crystal display (LCD) and light-emitting diode (LED) consumer-grade color displays. Receiver operating characteristic curves, diagnostic accuracy (measured as the area under these curves), accuracy of the composition classification, sensitivity, specificity, and the degree of agreement between readers in the detection of malignant cases were also evaluated. Comparisons of diagnostic accuracy between film-screen and the different combinations of digital configurations showed no significant differences for nodules, calcifications, and asymmetries. In addition, no differences were observed in terms of sensibility or specificity when the degree of malignancy using the film-screen method was compared to that provided with digital configurations. Similar results were observed for the classification of breast composition. Furthermore, all observed reader agreements of malignant detection between film-screen and digital configurations were substantial. These findings indicate that the evaluated digital devices showed comparable diagnostic accuracy to the reference treatment (film-screen)." .

It is found that near the percolation threshold (on the insulating side of metal-insulator transition) the film shows the evidence for one-dimensional hopping conduction. The fluctuations of hopping conduction are observed. It is shown that such behavior of the film can be determined by a single linking chain. The presence of narrow insulating bridges in such chain is responsible for both the one-dimensional behavior of hopping conduction in the whole two-dimensional system and the observed fluctuations of conductivity. These fluctuations can be attributed to unusual manifestation of the effects of incoherent mesoscopics." .

A standardized tissue-equivalent encased human skull specimen was imaged using lateral and posteroanterior (PA) pantomographic projections with the Orthopantomograph OP 100 (Instrumentarium Imaging, Tuusula, Finland) and three different receptor modalities: (1) Ektavision film with Ektavision screens (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY); (2) DenOptix photostimulable phosphor screens (Dentsply/Gendex, Chicago, IL); and (3) the charge-coupled device (CCD) receptor, DigiPan (TREX/Trophy Radiology, Marne-la-Vallée, France). The effective focal trough was found for each receptor using lead resolution grids placed at fractional millimeter distances along empirically determined beam projection angulations. The time to acquire and process images was also established. We found that the CCD system permitted real-time display, whereas the use of traditional film took 2 minutes to load the cassette in a darkroom and perform the exposure, and then a further 2 minutes to unload and process. The storage phosphor took 3 minutes to unload the cassette and process the image and a further 20 seconds to clear the plate following laser scanning. Film produced the greatest maximum resolution followed by the storage phosphor and the CCD. In conclusion, CCD-based TMJ pantomography provided an instant image. The photostimulable phosphor system used was the least satisfactory in terms of the time expended to obtain an image, but provided better spatial resolution than the CCD. Ektavision film/screens provided the best spatial resolution in this investigation." .

The preservation of these works requires their digitalization and transformation into a machine-readable format. However, and despite the many research activities on optical music recognition (OMR), the results for handwritten musical scores are far from ideal. Each of the proposed methods lays the emphasis on different properties and therefore makes it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of a proposed method. We present in this article a comparative study of several recognition algorithms of music symbols. After a review of the most common procedures used in this context, their respective performances are compared using both real and synthetic scores. The database of scores was augmented with replicas of the existing patterns, transformed according to an elastic deformation technique. Such transformations aim to introduce invariances in the prediction with respect to the known variability in the symbols, particularly relevant on handwritten works. The following study and the adopted databases can constitute a reference scheme for any researcher who wants to confront a new OMR algorithm face to well-known ones." .

For more than 50 years, investigators of the honey bee's waggle dance have reported that richer food sources seem to elicit longer-lasting and livelier dances than do poorer sources. However, no one had measured both dance duration and liveliness as a function of food-source profitability. Using video analysis, we found that nectar foragers adjust both the duration (D) and the rate (R) of waggle-run production, thereby tuning the number of waggle runs produced per foraging trip (W, where W=DR) as a function of food-source profitability. Both duration and rate of waggle-run production increase with rising food-source profitability. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee adjusts the rate of waggle-run production (R) in relation to food-source profitability by adjusting the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. This finding raises the possibility that bees can use return-phase duration as an index of food-source profitability. Finally, dances having different levels of liveliness have different mean durations of the return phase, indicating that dance liveliness can be quantified in terms of the time interval between consecutive waggle runs." .

However, much of the previous research on agricultural information has concentrated on what information various media communicate (gatekeeping studies) or communication's role in increasing innovation adoption (diffusion studies). Few studies have concentrated specifically on organizational and structural constraints that might adversely affect agricultural journalists' ethical standards; those that have, focus largely on farm magazines. A study of newspaper reporters who cover agricultural news found that the most pressing ethical concern is the effect of advertiser (agri-business) pressure on editorial copy, and that their concerns in general parallel those of farm magazine writers and editors. The majority reported being in situations in which they might be exposed to advertiser pressure, including pressures to change or withhold editorial copy. Large minorities suggested that advertising pressures affect the overall environment in which agricultural journalists work, and more than one in ten said they allow advertiser pressures to influence editorial decisions. The newspaper reporters who cover agricultural beats showed slightly more resistance to advertiser pressure than did farm magazine editors in a parallel study." .

However, episodic memory for emotional music compared with less emotional music has not yet been examined. We investigated whether emotional music is remembered better than less emotional music. Also, we examined the influence of musical structure on memory performance. ResultsRecognition of 40 musical excerpts was investigated as a function of arousal, valence, and emotional intensity ratings of the music. In the first session the participants judged valence and arousal of the musical pieces. One week later, participants listened to the 40 old and 40 new musical excerpts randomly interspersed and were asked to make an old/new decision as well as to indicate arousal and valence of the pieces. Musical pieces that were rated as very positive were recognized significantly better. ConclusionMusical excerpts rated as very positive are remembered better. Valence seems to be an important modulator of episodic long-term memory for music. Evidently, strong emotions related to the musical experience facilitate memory formation and retrieval." .

Constraint programming has been proved to be a highly appropriate technique in this field. For the task of automated music composition, in particular, constraints have been shown to describe composition principles in a declarative, natural, and, above all, efficient way since music composition knowledge is in fact a collection of conditions rather than a sort of cookery-book. Unfortunately, many approaches stress the technical aspects of applying constraints and do not think about the concrete role of constraints, i.e. about what music really should be. In general, the composer as an artist is more concerned about what he wants to say through his music than with theoretically (or socially or psychologically) established rules. This means that automated music composition needs practical goals in order to make sense. The role of those goals as well as musical constraints and constraint technologies that help to realize the goals are to be shown in this article. As a modelling example the system COPPELIA is introduced. It generates music on the basis of the structures, goals, and contents of given multimedia presentations. In this relatively young field of constraint application that does not supply such ideal, well-defined and closed sets of conditions as technical applications do, we find it very important to also present general thoughts about the sense of our application, about the development of composition constraints and the conditions under which these constraints work effectively." .

The hypothesis that news media use at one point in time is related to subsequent levels of political knowledge is tested using crosslagged partial correlation analysis. The patterns of political knowledge and news media use in January (prior to the 1976 primaries), late May and early June, and after the general election among a panel of high school students are examined. The means indicate a small increase in news media use and a more substantial increase in political knowledge. A greater increase occurs in political knowledge about campaign and election relevant institutions and processes than about other types of political institutions and processes. Limited support is provided for the hypothesized lagged influence of news media use; the impact varies with the political interest of the student and the type of news media used." .

A technique is presented whereby two films from an angiographic sequence are digitized using a high-resolution laser digitizer, and the digitized images are aligned, subtracted, and displayed using the computer. To accommodate for some types of patient motion, an image warping algorithm is presented and discussed in detail. The warping algorithm is piecewise linear, using triangular regions for warping, resulting in a global nonlinear transform across triangle elements. An algorithm describing optimal triangle selection also is discussed. The results show that subtraction images of excellent quality can be produced by the proposed technique, and suggest that, in some settings, digitized subtraction films may be preferred over conventional film subtraction." .

The PL bands originating from exciton-exciton scattering (P emission) and biexciton (M emission) have been observed at 10 K. The ultrashort gating time of 0.6 ps has enabled us to obtain precise information of the temporal profiles of the peak energies and the intensities of the P- and M-PL bands. We have found that the decay time of the P emission becomes longer with increasing film thickness, while that of the M emission is independent of the film thickness. Although the decay time of the P emission is an increasing function of the film thickness, the relation is not in proportion, which is contrary to the predicted proportionality based on a simple model of photon-like polariton propagation." .

The middleware platform is composed of a distributed system that supports sensors and actuators on PAN. Generally, in the case of middleware for ubiquitous computing, the structure is formulated by a simple design pattern in a shared program language. On the other hand, new media art or commercial game contents have specified methodologies such as extreme programming for these developments, and so it is difficult to share information among these products. In the present paper, we propose a new design process for the ubiquitous environment on the PAN to adapt different software methodologies and construct an interactive product of new media art using the proposed method. The design process consists of the artist's proposal for media artwork, the engineer's analysis, simulation, and testing. Each cycle is considered as an individual project, and interactive products such as middleware services are provided to the artist after the project is finished. We implemented interactive audio-visual prototype by the design process." .

Notions of record and archive are critically investigated, raising questions about applying traditional archival definitions to the performing arts. Defining the nature of performances is at the root of all difficulties regarding their representation. Performances are live events, so for many people the idea of recording them for posterity is inappropriate. The challenge of creating and curating representations of an ephemeral art form are explored and performance-specific concepts of record and archive are posited. An open model of archives, encouraging multiple representations and allowing for creative reuse and reinterpretation to keep the spirit of the performance alive, is envisaged as the future of the performing arts archive." .

News media has been shown to both reflect and influence public perceptions of health and science related debates, as well as policy development. To better understand the news coverage of GMOs in China, we analyzed the content of articles in two Chinese newspapers that relate to the development and promotion of genetically modified technologies and GMOs. MethodsSearching in the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Core Newspaper Database (CNKI-CND), we collected 77 articles, including news reports, comments and notes, published between January 2002 and August 2011 in two of the major Chinese newspapers: People’s Daily and Guangming Daily. We examined articles for perspectives that were discussed and/or mentioned regarding GMOs, the risks and benefits of GMOs, and the tone of news articles. ResultsThe newspaper articles reported on 29 different kinds of GMOs. Compared with the possible risks, the benefits of GMOs were much more frequently discussed in the articles. 48.1% of articles were largely supportive of the GM technology research and development programs and the adoption of GM cottons, while 51.9% of articles were neutral on the subject of GMOs. Risks associated with GMOs were mentioned in the newspaper articles, but none of the articles expressed negative tones in regards to GMOs. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that the Chinese print media is largely supportive of GMOs. It also indicates that the print media describes the Chinese government as actively pursuing national GMO research and development programs and the promotion of GM cotton usage. So far, discussion of the risks associated with GMOs is minimal in the news reports. The media, scientists, and the government should work together to ensure that science communication is accurate and balanced." .

In the WM absorption spectra, dispersive spectral structures owing to 2P~4P states in the yellow excitons are clearly resolved in the thin film sample. A stress due to the lattice mismatch between Cu2O and MgO provides a large red shift of the band gap in the green excitonic system. However, in the yellow excitonic transitions, it is found that a red-shift of the 2P excitonic state is much smaller than that in the green excitonic system. This result suggests that a shallow potential minimum for the yellow excitons is built up in the Cu2O thin film sandwiched by MgO plates." .

A simplified two dimensional model is adopted which uses the long-bearing approximation with a π-film to account for cavitation. This model has been thoroughly studied by Myers [1] in the balanced case, where it is shown that the whirl instability is the result of a Hopf bifurcation. The implications of imbalance are studied in this paper. This leads to the study of a periodically perturbed Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that the dynamics in this situation can, especially under certain nonlinear resonance conditions, have an extremely complicated dependence on the system parameters and the rotor speed. Complete bifurcation diagrams are presented for a particular rotor model which demonstrate this dependence." .

Together they provide an in-depth look at Chace's impact on the development of dance/movement therapy. Cathy is often credited with carrying on Marian Chace's legacy. Working longer with Marian Chace than any other dance therapist, Cathy's skills, ability to work with patients, and her personality earned her the chairmanship of the dance therapy section upon Marian Chace's retirement. Cathy received her B.A. in psychology from Ohio Wesleyan University and began her full-time dance therapy work at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in 1963 under Marian Chace. When Cathy left the hospital in 1968, she had served as chief of the dance therapy section for two years. A charter member of the American Dance Therapy Association, Cathy served as the Association's first secretary. Most recently, Cathy founded and has been directing three liturgical dance companies; she also conducts workshops in the use of the arts in church and choreographs high school and community theatre musicals. Marion Gibbons first became interested in music therapy during his service in World War II. He entered the Baldwin-Wallace Conservatory and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in music. In 1955, he began work in music at St. Elizabeth's Hospital with the Chaplain's branch on a part-time basis. The following year he was hired full time by the recreation branch of the hospital and served there until 1960 when he transferred to the dance therapy section. He left St. Elizabeth's in 1970. Currently, he is the director of music at the First Church of Munson in Massachusetts. Ann Lohn received her B.S. in psychology from Purdue University and a M.A. degree in dance education from George Washington University. She was interviewed and hired by Marian Chace in 1966. Since Marian's retirement coincided with Ann's employment, her supervision and training were conducted by Cathy Pasternak. Ann worked at St. Elizabeth'sospital full time from 1966 to 1979, serving as chief of the dance therapy section from 1969 to 1979. After leaving St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Ann joined the faculty of the dance/movement therapy graduate program at Goucher College. She has also worked at Gundry Hospital and Springfield Hospital. Ann was secretary of the American Dance Therapy Association from 1968 to 1970, treasurer from 1970 to 1972, and member of the registry committee from 1972 to 1977. Currently Ann and her husband own and operate a fishing resort in Ontario." .

Both films feature Black characters who navigate a fairy tale world set in the swamps of southern Jim Crow era America in which they grapple with fears about reductive and demeaning black film stereotypes. Although they are in some ways trapped within the white gaze of the film’s meaning, I argue that in their fantasies, both Bosko and Tiana outmaneuver the regime of representation that underlies racial stereotyping, opening a space for trans-coding and revision of its meanings. In addition, a comparison of the films demonstrates a clear improvement from the 1930s in terms of an increased differentiation in the representation of Black Americans, acknowledging, if not embodying, the fact that “Black America” is a diverse and complex reality." .

Starting from a thermally relaxed state, application of a perpendicular field pulse to an in-plane medium results in fast in-plane precessional rotation. Our simulations indicate that 180° magnetization reversal of both AFC layers can be achieved by selecting the correct pulse duration, and that repeated reversal can be achieved with no significant decay of magnetization. Switching times as short as 8 ps are required, suggesting that ultra-high data rates could be achieved. Studies of the effect of pulse shape indicate that reversal and recording will be possible with the non-square pulses that would be expected from practical write heads." .

It is shown that, due to overlap of the film adsorption layers, an adsorption component of the disjoining pressure is important for the present system. The pre-exponential factor of this adsorption component was obtained by fitting to the experimental drainage curves. It corresponds to a slight repulsion, which reduces not only the thinning velocity as observed experimentally but corrects also the film equilibrium thickness." .

Subjects provided those letters suggested by the fragments for as many items as possible within a 90-second interval. It was hypothesized that students who had received college training in studio art would be able to produce a greater number of candidate images than students not trained in art, resulting in more correct answers and higher scores. Results confirmed the hypothesis. Trained subjects completed significantly more of the letters on the image-generation task than did those not trained in art (p=.0001). This suggests that superior ability to generate images is associated with artistic training. Further, these results imply that, to the degree to which artistic training reflects ability, image generation may also be related to artistic ability." .

In the case of the symmetric, thin-film mode of Néel walls, unwinding walls show an attractive and winding walls a repulsive interaction for all distances. The functional dependence of the interaction on the distance of the walls is strongly correlated with the wall profiles of the isolated walls with their characteristic extended tails. For the asymmetric Néel wall mode which occurs in thicker films, an additional repulsive interaction of the magnetization vortices in the wall core is found. This leads for unwinding walls to stable configurations of double walls with separations between two and three times the film thickness." .

The effect of the squeeze film has been represented by the damping effect in previous studies. Our goal, however, is to quantify the stiffening effect, which affects the resonance frequency of the squeeze film and the oscillator system. The finite difference method for rectangular geometries is applied to solve the nonlinear isothermal Reynold’s equation for the squeeze film. The approach is validated by theoretical results for small squeeze numbers. The stiffening effect actually appears as a negative added mass. The damping effect obtained from numerical solutions matches perfectly with the equivalent damping formula derived from the analytical formula. The dynamic response of sinusoidally forced oscillator involving one squeeze film is obtained numerically in order to demonstrate the stiffening effect of the squeeze film. Three main parameters are considered: the initial gap of the squeeze film, the excitation amplitude, and the excitation frequency. The relationship between the amplitude of the steady-state sinusoidal response and the excitation frequency is determined. Numerical results demonstrate that the squeeze film gives rise to both a shift in the resonance frequency at small amplitude oscillations and amplitude dependence of the resonance frequency known as nonlinear hardening. These effects are both observed in experiments." .

This paper reports an efficient protoplast culture technique, the “extra thin alginate film” technique. The development of this improved method of protoplast culture was an outcome of an assessment of the efficiency and shortcomings of various protoplast culture techniques. The efficiency of this technique was evaluated with two model plant systems, viz., Nicotiana tabacum and Lotus corniculatus, and a comparison was made with the “thin alginate layer” technique, another efficient protoplast culture system. Results indicate that the culture technique with extra thin alginate film is as efficient as the technique with thin alginate layer, with many additional advantages. The present innovation overcomes most of the limitations of protoplast culture techniques described so far and can now be applied to a wide variety of crops to check its general applicability." .

Representations of Africa in Western news media are heavily imbued with colonialist notions of cultural geography. In particular, Western news media have represented conflicts in Africa as ‘tribal’, a trope that erases geographic and historical context, and discourages actions that could prevent or reduce violent conflict. To determine if ‘tribalism’ remains important in coverage of African conflict, we use framing analysis to evaluate news on Sudan’s Darfur region in The New York Times and The Washington Post during 2003–2009. We find that these newspapers predictably relied on stereotypes related to tribalism to simplify Darfur’s geography and make the conflict meaningful to intended readers. Tribal portrayal of African war is inherently political, and, problematically, neither newspaper recognized that their use of the tribal narrative was parallel to the views of both the Sudanese government and external observers that challenged the actions of the Sudanese government. However, we also found that stereotypical representations became less prominent over time, apparently because reporters found that the initial, simplistic framing of the conflict did not match their encounters with geographic reality. We emphasize the decline in stereotypical tropes, because this suggests behind-the-scenes negotiation about representations in these news organizations. Recognizing voices that challenge stereotypical portrayals is necessary to developing place images that are geographically more accurate." .

In the few years that the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) has utilized social media for public relations and advocacy purposes, both ADTA membership and the general public’s awareness of DMT have already increased markedly. Inherent within the social networking paradigm is the essential role of relationship and reciprocity. These tenets encourage a cross-promotion, not only of dance/movement therapists by dance/movement therapists but of all creative arts therapists by all creative arts therapists. Fully maximizing the growth potential for the field of DMT demands a shift from a twentieth century mindset of isolationism to the social media inspired, twenty first century paradigm of collaboration and mutual support among all creative arts therapists. Fully committing to this paradigm will produce greater awareness of DMT in the general public, a deeper understanding of DMT by allied professionals, an increased consumer demand for our services, a more diverse pool of dance/movement therapists, and a visibility worthy of a profession beginning its second half century." .

It is observed that all types of stretching produces film thinning, but non-monotonic stretching produces faster thinning at small distance from the origin. Effect of the transverse magnetic field is to slow down the film thinning process. Observed flow behavior is explained physically." .

I begin by documenting the two main types of pre-cinema handheld projection from Europe and Japan, the handheld magic lantern and the utsushi-e performance. I then present a summary of projection techniques used by performers when interacting with these devices. I situate these techniques within contemporary research and illustrate how they are being used and built upon with contemporary technology. Finally, I discuss how knowledge of pre-cinema handheld projection devices, techniques, and performance can inform the design of future handheld projector systems." .

Internet, in turn, can wield effects on democracy and many scholars have investigated such relationship. Moving from this literature we use Eurobarometer data to estimate the effect of Internet on the satisfaction with the functioning of democracy among European citizens. The results show that Internet usage, per se, has no effect on the satisfaction with democracy. However, the consumption of online news can make the difference, even though this effect is positive when users consume news from online traditional media while social media has a negative effect, which is mediated by the level of online disagreement and the potential emergence of flames." .

Journalism educators must provide a new journalism curriculum, one that teaches new technology, but also stresses responsible reporting, based on independence, accuracy, and verification. This study was conducted to determine student satisfaction with a new Convergent Journalism major. The first year of the roll out of our new Major here at Metropolitan State University of Denver was 2013-14 academic year. This study is an assessment of the efficacy and relevance of our curriculum development efforts. SurveyMonkey.com was the methodology used to measure stakeholder satisfaction. A well-tested satisfaction survey template was deployed, customized to the task. The sample included all of the students pursuing the Convergent Journalism major. A web link collector was used. More waves of testing will be done this fall before the study is complete. The results so far showed 88% were either extremely satisfied or moderately satisfied. We conclude that our new curriculum for Convergent Journalism is meeting student expectations. Anecdotal feedback from several employers suggests that they too are please with the journalism, multi-platform, digital dissemination and content creating skills of our graduates." .

Several kinds of data related to news production and consumption were collected from the opening of the YouTube account to October 11, 2012. Findings suggest that news content strategies for YouTube are different across newspapers. National newspapers are likely to perceive YouTube as a new medium, whereas local newspapers tend to perceive it as an extension of the existing newspaper. The results also reveal that YouTube strategies based on strongly partisan or critical reports or oppositional parodies can work better than those providing a diverse and universally appealing range of content." .

The analysis of these data covers the issues of the number of basic dimensions in music mood, their relation to valence and arousal, the distribution of moods in the valence–arousal plane, distinctiveness of the labels, and appropriate (number of) labels for full coverage of the plane. It is also shown that subject-averaged valence and arousal ratings can be predicted from music features by a linear model." .

In the United States, 5.4 million individuals are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and researchers anticipate that number to increase 30 % by 2025. Viewers of Alive Inside can empathically climb inside the experience of an elder living with memory loss who is hearing his or her favorite song and feel overwhelmed with joy, sadness, memory, and sensation. In this way, music awakens the most profound sense of connection to ourselves and to one another. As dance/movement therapists, we know that rhythm unites, creating a sense of solidarity. The film tackles the question, “can a pair of headphones change the lives of millions of Americans suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia?” It also highlights an opportunity to address scope of practice and professionalization along the arts and health continuum from arts and health practitioners to creative arts therapists." .

However, in this “television age”, we are exposed to compelling and vivid images of crimes and cases. This raises the question of whether potential jurors may be more influenced by television media (e.g., news programs or televised hearings) then print media (e.g., newspaper and magazine articles). Using an actual case involving extensive PTP, the present study varied the type of medium (print articles, video, articles+video) presented to potential jurors. The results indicated that exposure to the various media had a prejudicial impact on people, and that they were unaware of their biases. As hypothesized, television exposure and television plus print articles biased potential jurors significantly more than exposure to print media alone." .

Such reasoning processes take place in the environment of media helping to construct the discourse of an issue. To demonstrate the reasoning processes and media influences on the processes, this study analyzes the panel data gathered from a national probability sample before and after the Persian Gulf War. The results show a process of forming one's support of the Bush administration's Gulf War policies that involved feelings toward Bush, patriotic feelings, and acceptance of the official statements of U.S. foreign policy goals. These positive contributors are all related to heavier exposure to television news. Respondents' level of public affairs information and exposure to newspaper public affairs functioned as a contingent factor in the reasoning processes: Those at the upper half of the scale showed a greater emphasis on ideology and negative emotional reactions to the destruction of the war in forming their support of the Bush administration's Gulf War policies. The importance of the homogeneity in the discourse of the issue is further demonstrated by the effects of the news media exposure on higher likelihood of dissent concerning the end of the war." .

It is found that increasing film thickness enhances phonon scattering and dispersion in the film while increasing equivalent equilibrium temperature. The rate of equivalent equilibrium temperature increase is high in the early heating period ($$\\hbox {t} \\le 50\\,\\hbox {ps}$$ t≤50ps ) and the rate of temperature increase becomes gradual in the film as the heating period progresses." .

The applied angular rate is sensed by detecting the differential change of capacitance between the bar structure electrodes and the fixed electrodes on the glass substrate. Instead of common squeeze-film damping, slide-film damping in the gap between proof masses and glass substrate plays a dominant role, which enables it to achieve high Q-factors and thus eliminate vacuum packaging. The measured Q-factors for driving and sensing modes are 965 and 716, respectively. The sensor obtained a sensitivity of 6 mV/°/s and a non-linearity of less than 0.5%." .

The key features exploited in the modular playware approach are modularity, flexibility, construction, immediate feedback to stimulate engagement, creative exploration of play activities, and in some cases activity design by end-users (e.g., DJs). We exemplify the approach with the development of 11 rock genres and 6 pop music pieces for modular I-BLOCKS, which are exhibited and in daily use at the Rock Me exhibition, and have been used at several international music events in Japan and the USA. A key finding is that professional music design is essential for the development of primitives in a musical behavior-based system, and this professional esthetics is necessary to engage the users in the activity of assembling and coordinating these “professional” musical primitives. This article describes, explores, and discusses this concept." .

Performance is often assumed to be something that can only be authentic if experienced live, yet mediated performances have the ability to disrupt this assumption in two primary ways: by creating a “shared,” though asymmetric, experience and by imploding the idea of a “live” original performance to be recorded. In this paper we bring Walter Benjamin’s concepts of aura and authenticity into conversation with Katie King’s theorizations of reenactments to explore how mediated experiences can still constitutes authentic, “shared” performance. That is, we deploy the concept of the pastpresent to problematize, complicate, and begin to break down the assumed division between live and mediated performance based on Benjamin’s ideas of aura and authenticity. As we’ll discuss, what makes this especially interesting is the relationship between space and time in mediated performances. We illustrate this basic argument using three examples: (1) dance through the medium of film; (2) street performance through the medium of the internet; and (3) pop music through the medium of digitally recorded music. In all cases, the “authenticity” of the mediated performance is based on the imagined authenticity of its first rendering, thus the viewer/listener becomes an active participant in making meaning out of the past, in the present. The changing relationships between space, time, and authenticity within performance are important for understanding how their audiences experience modern mediated performances." .

We see her move and at the same time hear her voice-over telling a dream. She turns then to art materials and draws a picture of that dream. As she draws and moves again, she reflects on the dream’s meaning and purpose. Building on the foundation of her inner work, there is a shift to Carolyn Fay’s work with others. Potent sequences from three individual psychotherapy sessions are shown, as well as with a group. Fay’s approach to dance therapy invites movement, sand play, art, clay, music, self-reflection, dialogue and exchange, guided by individual preferences and held by a trusting therapeutic relationship. In addition to the work itself, there is an added dimension of the issue of aging and how Carolyn Fay responds to it through her own self-understanding." .

Following her marriage, the birth of four children and several geographic moves, Sharon studied with Marian Chace in 1964 at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. In 1966 she helped form the American Dance Therapy Association. She served as its vice president for two years under Chace's presidency. She was then elected president of ADTA, serving in that capacity for four years. Her article, “Dance Therapy,” included in a 1975 edition of theAmerican Journal of Psychiatry, was one of the first in the field to outline a theoretical foundation for the profession and continues to be one of the most comprehensive statements available.

An equivalent circuit is suggested for simulation of interface impedance in a wide range of working electrode potentials. It is shown that regions with a different mechanism of film formation are observed at an increase in potential from 0.0 to +1.0 V. The kinetics of film formation are studied at the potentials of +0.40, +0.60, and +0.80 V. It is found that good agreement is observed between the model and experimental data when the growing film is simulated using a Warburg element with a finite diffusion length. Conductivity and the diffusion coefficient of charge carriers in it are estimated on the basis of the suggested model for a film obtained at the potential of +0.40 V. It is shown that conductivity of a polyporphyrin film grows by more than an order of magnitude at an increase in deposition potential from +0.40 to +0.80 V." .

To arrive at this conclusion, we prove that the three-dimensional minimizers converge to the two-dimensional counterparts in H 1 and in C α . We also give examples of regimes in which the vortex structure of the two-dimensional minimizers is well understood. Our results, in particular, provide insight into the behavior of the three-dimensional vortices in these regimes." .

This article presents the ArtsIN: Arts Integration and Infusion framework, a both/and approach to arts-based learning. This means that it incorporates both arts infused learning essential for process and skill development in an art form, such as art disciplines of visual arts, dance, drama, music and media arts and integrated learning experiences embedded in children’s daily experience to generate rich meaningful cognitive connections to other disciplines into the classroom. Section “WHY ARTS? Key Concepts to Support an ArtsIN Framework” details four key concepts of the framework: global universality, embodiment, arts as multi-literacies and language, and the value of arts for advancing development. The mind–body connection of the arts to understand human interactions is explained through the capacities of five aesthetic operations—repetition, formalization, dynamic variation, and surprise. Section “ HOW ARTS? Implementing an ArtsIN Framework” provides examples and explains how arts infusion and integration can be implemented in early childhood settings through dynamic teacher roles as artist, researcher, designer, co-constructor, and advocate to meet students’ learning needs while connecting and collaborating with diverse cultural contexts that include families, artists, and community." .

Ever since, the artist has kept on revisiting the same material, each time with a different technological approach. Originally hailed as a prime example of structural filmmaking, Jacobs’ more recent variations on the theme of Tom Tom the Piper’s Son beg for a broader understanding of his methods and the meanings implied. To gain a deeper insight in this on-going mise-en-abyme (and an obsession dominating a large part of his career), this essay expands comments by the artist himself with concepts taken from animation, media-archaeology and Warburg’s Mnemosyne atlas. Rereading a filmic text with minute attention, remediating it from an analogue to an electronic format, and reanimating the original action by adding a variety of intervals: all Jacobs’ strategies are aimed at demonstrating the afterlife of Tom Tom in a contemporary cultural context." .

Classical music 35 and 65 dB and rock music 65 and 85 dB in terms of loudness decreased the time of the solution. Louder classical music (85 dB) did not have this effect. Solution of tasks without musical accompaniment led to an increase in coherent values, especially in β1, β2, and γ the frequency bands in the EEG of the occipital cortex. The intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences of frontal EEG increased and EEG asymmetry (in the number of Coh connections in the left and right hemispheres) arose during the solution of the tasks accompanied by music. Classical music (35 and 65 dB) caused left-side asymmetry in the EEG. The use of more powerful classical or rock music led to a prevalence of the number of Coh connections in the right hemisphere." .

With a greater length of the section, repair costs increase, the draining process is complicated, and the fulfillment of works in the time alloted for repair is hampered." .

In the midst of their grief, colleagues, friends and family created The Andréa Rizzo Foundation, to assure that Andréa’s dream of helping children with cancer and special needs through dance therapy would become a reality. Instituting dance therapy programs at both Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and in public schools throughout the Northeast, The Andréa Rizzo Dance Therapy Program continues to touch lives and broaden the spectrum of creative therapies recognized by doctors, nurses and educators alike. This article will highlight the programs that The Andréa Rizzo Foundation has instituted and funded since its inception in September 2002, as well as the Foundation’s recent developments and achievements." .

This architecture consists of a mobile application intended to display subtitles in an ordinary cinema, as well as a server containing the subtitles of those movies available at each cinema. The mobile device will connect to this server to download the desired subtitle. Once downloaded, the device is synchronized with the film running, using timestamps provided by the server, and will display the subtitles accordingly. This architecture can be used by any person interested in the movie subtitles, such as people who want to read the subtitles in another language, like a tourist, or by hearing impaired people. It must be pointed out that it is difficult to access movies at cinemas, as there are very few movie theaters where films are shown with subtitles regularly." .

Marketing for films is a significant part of the budget, with Hollywood spending about $4 billion a year to buy TV and print advertising. Product cycles have accelerated, and studios are increasingly sensitive to criticism and market positioning. Because of its immediacy and ubiquity, Internet social networking is seen as a cost-effective alternative to traditional promotion. The current research investigates the effectiveness of Internet social networking in film success through a novel application of event study methods based on Internet search engine datasets. I find that release directed Internet social networking activities increase film revenues 64% and increase search activity 48%. I also report that increased revenue and search continue after the release period during the time that films appear on DVD, streaming and subscription TV, with revenue 14% higher than it would have been without the social networking campaign. In addition, I observe increased viewer search of around 41% over what it would have been without the Internet social networking campaign. A marginal increase of Internet social networking activity is predicted to result in a threefold increase in search intensity related to a film. The analysis shows that both budgets and the level of Internet search activity are important factors in the revenue generation of films, and Internet social networking campaigns lead to higher revenues." .

This omission is notable given both the sustained academic consideration afforded to other popular media, the medium’s significant commercial and popular success, and its status as an ‘affective’ and captivating storytelling medium. With reference to film industry advertisements, the experiential dimensions of the 3-D cinematic encounter and its (popular) framing as an ‘immersive’ consumer experience are explored. In particular, the notion of ‘immersion’ is unpacked with reference to the medium’s engineering and production techniques. In so doing, the intertwinement of the industrial desire for ever more ‘immersive’ and ‘realistic’ consumer experience is explored in relation to the engineering techniques exhibiting perceptual mimicry, or what could be termed ‘mimetic engineering’. The association between 3-D cinema and ‘tactile’ images is then explored with reference to geographic literatures on ‘haptics’ and technologies of touch. A number of recent ‘innovations’ in these fields are drawn upon in order to complicate 3-D cinema’s association with ‘tactility’. In so doing, a technological shift towards the increasingly pervasive and sophisticated engagement of the wider multi-sensory palette is explored. Drawing upon recent media technology ‘innovations’, this persistent and relentless desire for ever more ‘immersive’ and perceptually-convincing media technology is explored in light of developing media geographies." .

The assumption is that touch stimulates a variety of responses, and, that to understand the feelings that it evokes, it is essential to view its meaning within a cultural context. They discuss implications for using touch in a dance therapy session in Japan, held with schizophrenic patients in psychiatric care. To frame how interventions in a dance therapy session are affected by cultural ideas about the body and touch, the authors focus on the following: Japanese conceptualizations of the mind and body; how touch is viewed in Japan in contrast to in Western cultures; and the use of touch in psychoanalysis, psychotherapy and dance therapy. A description of a dance therapy session draws on the material presented to suggest how the natural and open use of touch in Japanese society, coupled with rhythmic touching, can lead patients toward more healthy and supportive interactions in ways that are consistent with their culture." .

It bas been shown that the magnetization in both cases decreases near surfaces of the film on the distance approximately equal to the correlation length. When the correlation length is bigger than the thickness of the film, the magnetization changes clearly across the whole film. For temperatures very close to the Curie temperature our results are consistent with those obtained by Kokowska et al. [1] and Wojtczak [4], where the iteration procedure was applied to Valenta equations. Spatial and temperature dependence of the magnetization of pure and disordered semi-infinite ferromagnet bave been obtained in the limit when the thickness of the film tends to infinity. The magnetization below the ordering temperature in the case of pure and disordered dilute three-dimensional ferromagnet has also been considered. The magnetization of the disordered dilute ferromagnetic media is smaller than the magnetization of pure ferromagnetic media." .

One requirement to realize the phenomenon is that the cavity consists of a pair of mirrors with optimal reflectivity. We calculate the reflectivity to give the highest transmittance through the cavity for various kinds of thin films. An empirical equation to reproduce the optimal reflectivity is given, in which the first term inversely depends on the film thickness and the second term is related to multiplication of the thickness and the dielectric constant of the thin film." .

The story, which concerned the potential for changes in tropical cyclone intensity in a greenhouse-warmed world, gained media interest in Australia because in the previous month Tropical Cyclone Justin had occupied public attention. The two days of media coverage essentially rewrote the committee findings. The process closely resembled the children's party game of Chinese whispers in which a simple statement is modified, sometimes beyond recognition, by repetition without understanding or correction. This paper reports and analyzes the processes involved in this miscommunication of science to and through the media and draws some salutory lessons." .

This perspective is problematised in alternative digital manifestations of music as constituted in and through interaction, in which music is emergent from interactive processes that are computationally mediated. This alternative digital approach fits with broad conceptions of music that are grounded in ethnomusicological accounts and that have increasing weight in the cognitive sciences, in which music is understood and explored as a communicative medium. This paper will outline some of the possibilities, potentials and problems for digital approaches that are likely to arise in operationalising music as communicative interaction." .

Cultural codes not only trigger technological and economic changes, but also provide pathways to control them, allowing the democratic practices of independent journalism to be sustained in new forms. Even as they successfully defend their professional ethics, however, journalists experience them as vulnerable to subversion in the face of technological and economic change. Indeed, independent journalists and the social groups who support them often feel as if they are losing the struggle for autonomy. Just as current anxieties have been triggered by computerization and digital news, so were earlier crises of journalism linked to technological shifts that demanded new forms of economic organization. Digital production has created extraordinary organizational upheaval and economic strain. At the same time, critical confrontations with digital production have triggered innovative organizational forms that allow new technologies to sustain, rather than undermine, the democratic culture and institution of news production. If news producers are making efforts to adapt professional journalism to the digital age while maintaining journalistic civil values, there are parallel adaptations from the digital side: digital journalism becoming more like professional journalism." .

The samples have been evaporated on unheated glass substrates at 5×10−5 torr without breaking vacuum. The number of short-circuited samples was evaluated in dependence on the angle of evaporation and thickness of the LiF film. It appears that the angle of evaporation of the value about ofω=20° already increases the number of short circuits in the case of Au-LiF-Au, meanwhile in the case of Al-LiF-Au it has no influence. Explanation is given by means of shadow effects which take place in thin LiF film in the system Au-LiF-Au. Replicas of LiF on Au and LiF on Al show in the first case that the layer consists of larger crystals and is less homogeneous. Difference between systems mentioned above can be seen also from the dependence of the number of short-circuited samples on the thickness of thin LiF film at the angle of evaporationω=0°. It is possible to draw boundary thicknesses of thin LiF film for obtaining non-short-circuited samples. In the case of Al-LiF-Au it is about 250 Å and in the case of Au-LiF-Au about 500 Å." .

This phenomenological study explored the meaning and essence of the TMR, as experienced by eight co-researchers who are board certified dance/movement therapists, in order to arrive at a definition. Data analysis of semi-structured interviews resulted in five textural themes that describe the essence of the TMR: (a) fundamental, foundational, and integral, (b) powerful, dimensional, and full, (c) shared presence and connection through movement, (d) creative collaboration, and (e) evidence of the TMR. In addition, three structural themes emerged that describe how the TMR is experienced: (a) presence, (b) space and time, and (c) creativity. These themes informed the creation of a definition of the TMR, which can support the teaching, learning, practice, supervision, and research of this critical component of dance/movement therapy." .

Prior to the breakthrough of television in Europe, which would usurp and standardize the art documentary, cinematic reproductions of artworks resulted in experimental shorts that were highly self-reflexive. These films became visual laboratories to investigate the tensions between movement and stasis, the two- and three-dimensional, and the real and the artificial—a film on art was self-consciously presented as an art film. Focusing on La Leggenda di Sant’Orsola (1948) by Luciano Emmer and Le Monde de Paul Delvaux (1946) by Henri Storck, this article also investigates how the animation of the static image by the film medium relates to Surrealist practices." .

The shape of an axisymmetric film of constant mass depends not only on the physical properties of the liquid, the rate of rotation and the radius of the cylinder but also on the pressure difference between the liquid and the ambient medium. By calculation and by means of a qualitative investigation of the first integral of the basic equation it is shown that for different values of the parameters the free surface of the film may be cylindrical or wavy, intersect itself or consist of periodically distributed isolated annular layers. The calculation results correspond with the experimental data the more closely the thinner the film and the greater its transverse velocity. This is attributable to the absence of gravitational acceleration from the model of the steady axisymmetric motion." .

We report on and discuss the effects of the material parameters and film orientation on the relative illuminance of the ghost image for a conventional louver-type contrast enhancement film adopting a trapezoidal black-stripe structure. The ghost image phenomenon is strongly affected by the film orientation relative to the PDP module and the difference between the refractive index of the ultraviolet curable urethane acrylate layer and that of the black stripes. We show that when the top side of the black stripes faces the PDP module and the refractive index difference is small, the ghost image phenomenon is weakened." .

Although these reflections cannot be included in the sphere of American musical phenomenology, they show remarkable similarities with phenomenological themes. A Gestalt approach centred on the description of sound phenomena is delineated, together with a conceptualization hinging on the phenomenal nature of music and the idea of perceivable structures and expressive valencies. A theory of musical wholes and parts — from the cohesion and segregation viewpoint — is followed by a theory of form predicated on an original and significant definition: that form is the perception of differences. Finally, the methodological development of Tenney's theory is traced and criticized, in particular the conflict between descriptive and non-descriptive moments." .

The elastic recovery has been examined for polypropylene (PP) film filaments, which is related to stress relaxation processes of various durations. The recovery curves in semilogarithmic coordinates are characterized by initial and final asymptotic levels, and also by an S-shaped elastic component of the process, an important characteristic of which is the relaxation time. The recovery parameters are complicated and are nonlinearly dependent on the given level of strain and the duration of the direct relaxation.

Since the creation of a film is observed only in the presence of sulfuric acid, then this indicates that sulfuric acid, in the region of potentials used for the electrodeposition of chromium facilitates not destruction of the film, as is usually assumed, but instead its formation." .

We present a study on the image quality of ink-jet printed paper copies of digital chest radiographs, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Eighty-three digital radiographs of a chest phatom with simulated tumors in the mediastinum and right lund, derived from a computed radiography (CR) system were presented in two series of hard copies as ink-jet printed paper copies and as laser recorded film. The images, with a matrix of 1,760×2,140 pixels, were printed with a spatial resolution of 10 pixels/mm in the CR film recorder as well as in the ink-jet printer. On film, every image was recorded in two versions, one optimized for the mediastinum and one for the lungs. On paper, only one image was printed; this constituted an effort to optimize both the mediastinum and the lungs. The ink-jet printed images, printed on a matt coated paper, were viewed as on-sight images with reflected light. The exdaminations were reviewed by six radiologists, and ROC curves were constructed. No significant difference was found between the performance of film and that of ink-jet paper prints. Because the cost for a paper copy is only a tenth of that of film, remarkable cost reductions can be achieved by using the ink jet technique instead. Our results show that further quality studies of ink-jet printed images are worthwhile." .

Antecedents of DMT, including the use of dance and music in traditional modes of healing, point to the potential for it to be effective for people strongly connected to traditional culture. Yet the literature regarding the application of this therapeutic modality in post-conflict and developing nations is modest. This article discusses an exploration of DMT as a vehicle for positive change in Timor-Leste. The people of this half-island developing nation have experienced trauma and dislocation over many generations as a result of waves of punitive colonization and consequent social turmoil. An introductory program of DMT that was offered to address issues including: health and well-being, peace-making, recovery from trauma and creative engagement, is described in detail. This includes exercises to develop body awareness, grounding and centering techniques, and opportunities for personal expression. An exploratory qualitative evaluation, including leaders’ observations of participants’ movement responses and participants’ post-session verbal reflections, offers evidence of the relevance of DMT for this post-conflict context and significant positive outcomes from these activities. Issues such as cultural appropriateness and the challenge of sustainability, where there are no trained professionals and few funding opportunities, are addressed. The article concludes with recommendations for the integration of DMT with the powerful role of traditional dance in this community, and reflections on more sustainable practices for visiting professionals." .

Specifically, in the limit when the normalstate resistivity of the film is large, the presence of the film causes at most a logarithmic interaction between phase slips. This is in contrast to the nearly linear confining interaction (and the consequent nearly activated behavior of the resistance) obtained when vortices are neglected." .

Using the works of Marian Chace, early conference proceedings, and some brief history about the development of psychotherapy and evidence-based practice as illustrations, this essay presents the historical affiliation between dance/movement therapy and research. The prescience of basic assumptions about dance/movement therapy conceptualized in the early days of the profession, which are now supported by newly emerging neurological and neuropsychological research, is discussed. Among the promising features of the profession noted, are the impressive growth of dance/movement therapy globally, and the fact that the embodied approach embedded in the work has kept the profession close to important body-mind parameters over time. These are argued to ensure its continued growth over the next 50 years. Finally, readers are reminded that engaging with research creates the foundation of improving practice to ultimately benefit clients." .

Dependences of the relaxation times of the photoresponses on the field directed both along the self-polarization vector and opposite to it are experimentally obtained.

The total polarization induced has been found to increase continuously with polarizing temperature but with polarizing field, it approaches a saturation. The behaviour of dark decay currents for photo and dark polarized identical samples changes with operating temperature. The phenomenon is explained in terms of the shift of electrons and hole demarcation levels under variation of temperature and illumination intensity." .

This study aims at investigating the quality of health news disseminated in the print media, its course of production and factors affecting its quality. MethodsIn the quantitative section of the study, 410 health-related news items, published during a six-month span in the Iranian public press, underwent content analysis. In the qualitative section, focus group discussions were held with journalists, editors-in-chief and news gatekeepers. ResultsThe quantitative phase showed that 18% of the news articles were not fit for dissemination in public. The qualitative phase illustrated that multiple factors at various levels affect the quality of news, namely poor knowledge, inadequate motivations and context-related barriers. ConclusionsThe quality of health news reporting is not desirable. Educational interventions need to be carried out to raise awareness among researchers and journalists. Also, certain steps should be taken to increase motivations and strengthen infrastructures, including designing guidelines and monitoring news." .

To meet the research objectives, both qualitative and quantitative methods are applied. The study used content analysis, a survey and interview techniques. It concluded that citizen journalism in the VoK uses a participatory, bottom-up approach, with the residents taking a lead role in the production and consumption of news, and that it plays its part in improving the lives of people in Kibera, contributing to governance and processes of democracy. The core development values of participation and empowerment are central to this study, which examines how these values are being impacted on by information technology interventions in the communications area. The research also concludes that citizen journalism may be sustainable if it is financed, promoted, resourced with professional journalists, equipped with new technologies and citizens continue to participate. Lack of cooperation from the audience, finance both for the running of the project, salary and technical problems were cited as the major challenges of citizen journalism." .

This study examined newspaper editorials, letters to the editor, op-ed columns, news analyses, and guest columns for three aspects: media attention, media prominence, and media valence. Results showed an increase in the number of opinion pieces covering CSR issues over the 25-year period. The prominence of each of the four CSR dimensions varied over time. Each of the four CSR dimensions had its moment of media prominence when it was more important than the other dimensions. The most prevalent valence of the opinion pieces was negative; the volume of negative pieces increased over the 25 years, whereas the number of opinions with positive, neutral, and mixed tones showed little change over time. The study concludes by tracing the implications of the role of the news media for business ethics research." .

We derive a novel thin-film equation for linear viscoelastic media describable by generalized Maxwell or Jeffreys models. As a first application of this equation we discuss the shape of a liquid rim near a dewetting front. Although the dynamics of the liquid is equivalent to that of a phenomenological model recently proposed by Herminghaus et al. (S. Herminghaus, R. Seemann, K. Jacobs, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 056101 (2002)), the liquid rim profile in our model always shows oscillatory behaviour, contrary to that obtained in the former. This difference in behaviour is attributed to a different treatment of slip in both models." .

Although existing methods of similar retrieval or sequence prediction have attained success to some extend, one important factor has not been considered in the previous work, that is, users may change their music interest in different sessions. How to define the users’ current interest is still a problem. In this paper, we propose a topic-based probabilistic model for addressing this problem by developing session-aware latent topics to model the users’ listening behavior. The model is designed based on the insight that users’ listening behavior is subjected to not only their personal interest, but also to their special interest in the session. Specifically, when making recommendation, our model estimates the probability of the song selection based on the mixture of the two aspects with a weight-based scheme. We have conducted experiments on a real music dataset from Last.fm. The empirical results demonstrate that our model performs much better than other state-of-the-art methods." .

This article presents a systematic review of game architectures using the GWG framework. The review validates the usefulness of the GWG framework through classifying game architectures described in the literature into distinct categories according to the framework. The major contribution of the paper is a state-of-the-art presentation of 40 different game architectures, which covers architectures for all kinds of games from single player games to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Previous reviews of game architectures have focused on a narrower selection of games such as only networked games, MMOGs or similar. Further, none of the previous reviews has used a systematic framework for analyzing the characteristics of game architectures. Using the framework, we can identify similarities and differences of the 40 game architectures in a systematic way. Finally, the paper outlines the evolution of the game architectures from the perspective of the GWG framework." .

She is a graduate of the C.G. Jung Institute of Los Angeles and a member of the Jung Institute of San Francisco. She has been actively involved in dance/movement therapy for the past 24 years. She studied with Trudi Schoop and Mary Whitehouse in the early 1960s, then received a MA degree in psychology and dance therapy from Goddard College. She was one of the first dance therapists in California and one of the first to be licensed as a marriage, family, and child counselor. In 1972 she coordinated the first California regional ADTA Conference, was elected vice-president of ADTA in 1972, and served as president from 1974 to 1976. She can be seen in the ADTA film “Dance Therapy: the Power of Movement.” Joan has made a unique contribution in dance/movement therapy by putting the worldless into words. Since 1971 she has written numerous articles and publications on the philosophy and practice of dance therapy. Two of her early writings—“What Is Dance Therapy, Really?” and “Philosophy and Methods of Individual Work in Dance Therapy”—were among the first efforts to build a theory of movement therapy, particularly individual work. When they appeared, these articles were among few written teaching materials available. From that beginning, she has continued to share in written form the record of her evolving thought, as represented by her recent articles, “Dance and Body Experience in Analysis” (inJungian Analysis, M. Stein [Ed.]; La Salle: Open Court, 1982), “To Move and Be Moved,” (inQuadrant 17/2:39–48, 1984), and “The Body as Symbol: Dance/Movement in Analysis” (inThe Body in Analysis, N. Schwartz-Sulant and M. Stein [Eds.]; Wilmette, IL: Chiron, 1986). Today, in addition to her private practice, she continues to write, teach, and supervise students and therapists. Each year she teaches an intensive summer course in Zurich. Joan's enthusiasm, dedication, and love of her work are clearly evident as she speaks. As she talks, one senses a subtle, not-quite-expressed movement; it seems she could as well dance as speak what she has to say. It is a movement that provides an open space for a person with her to be and to move with her—in that person's own way. Through the years of involvement Joan retains a freshness, liveliness, and curiosity about movement of the human body and about the moving body's relationship to the psyche. There is always newness to be discovered, to be met with a sense of wonder and joy. Joan welcomes me to her home with a warm smile and twinkling blue eyes. We meet for the interview in her studio at one end of her home, where she sees clients. On a wall near us, at one end of an otherwise open expanse of bare hardwood floor, are shelves filled to overflowing with sand tray figures, ready to enter the waiting sand tray. Outside, on a wood-railed balcony, are art supplies for use when talk, sandplay, or movement wants to turn into another form of expression. In this atmosphere of warmth, welcome, and choice, Joan and I seat ourselves on soft comfortable chairs and begin to talk." .

Then they listened to two musical selections, one of which they rated as evoking arousing, negative emotions while the other was rated as evoking calm, positive emotions. During the first musical selection that was presented, the arousing, negative emotion music terminated skin temperature increases and perpetuated skin temperature decreases, whereas the calm, positive emotion selection terminated skin temperature decreases and perpetuated skin temperature increases. During the second musical selection, skin temperature tended to increase whichever music was played; however, the increases were significant only during the calm, positive emotion music. It was concluded that music initially affects skin temperature in ways that can be predicted from affective rating scales, although the effect of some selections may depend upon what, if any, music had been previously heard." .

With this idea on viscous friction, we theoretically discuss instabilities on a liquid film on textured surfaces when the film is forced to move with external forces. When a film recedes due to a pressure drop, we find scaling laws for instabilities to be checked in future experiments. When a circular film expands due to centrifugal force we find that the expanding film is stable against rim fluctuations (within the linear stability analysis) with its radius determined by a simple equation. Our discussion sheds light on the curvature of the front of the moving liquid film on textured surfaces and how the film thickness is kept fixed to the texture height on textured surfaces, aspects which have not been discussed in previous studies." .

From the two ellipsometric measurements, either for two different angles of incidence or for two different surrounding media, it is in principle possible to determine the chosen parameters characterizing the thin slightly absorbing film. The graphical method, however, seems to be less accurate and very laborious. The calculation is therefore proposed for an automatic computer. The ellipsometric measurements were carried out on a SAAB computer, according to a program elaborated in Algol. The results obtained and the values computed for the optical constants and the thickness of the thin slightly absorbing film are in good agreement with those found independently." .

The Durand and Stone model (Phys. Rev. Lett., 97, 226101 (2006)) describes the growth of a film that is newly created during the T1 process, and also the evolution of surfactant concentration on this newly created film. Here some characteristic features of the Durand and Stone model (not previously described by Durand and Stone) are elucidated. In particular it is shown that the surfactant concentration on the newly created film is predicted to undergo an extremely rapid initial evolution, which occurs long before the film itself approaches anywhere near its final equilibrium length. Associated with this, the predicted length of the newly created film tends to exhibit an extremely rapid acceleration early on in its growth. An intermediate asymptotic analysis is developed to explain the above model predictions, by focussing on the regime when the film is several times larger than its initial length, but still several times smaller than its final length. A physical explanation is offered for these predictions in terms of slippage between material points instantaneously at the end of the newly created film, and the evolving location of the film endpoint itself: this slippage implies surfactant being transferred onto the newly created film from neighbouring films, overwhelming the amount of surfactant initially present. The implications of these predictions for the likely observations in an experimental study of the T1 process are discussed." .

Based on studies of radiologist film reading sessions, considerable time will be spent working at such viewing systems. If the rooms in which the workstations are placed are not conducive to comfortable work, it will certainly not favor electronic viewing over film reading. In examining existing reading environments, it is also apparent that they are not optimum, even for film. Since some of the problems for film and electronic viewing overlap, such as heat generation (by the alternators, viewboxes, or workstation electronics) and glare from light sources, it should be possible to develop solutions which are applicable to both environments or to rooms which will feature both viewing systems. This paper will discuss some of the approaches to designing environments in which viewing of images is supported by the room architecture and engineering and not degraded by it. To illustrate these points, a design based on the constraint of a real room size and available architectural materials will be developed." .

Both the “square-pattern” micro-chips and the substrate with the “square-pattern” binding sites were fabricated using one-mask micromachining process, and the self-alignment in situ observation under three different off-set orientation angles of 35°, 46°, and 90° was demonstrated using a high-speed video camera. Sequential images reveal a slow translational motion in the early stage followed by a faster rotational alignment. A novel technique has been further proposed for the conductivity evaluation by using three kinds of SAM films, i.e., C12, C18, and Terphenyl.

These artists appropriate and transform works of fine art to varying degrees to fit the themes and designs of the stories they illustrate and publish, and to increase the significance and impact of their illustrations. The intertextual-intervisual associations among picturebook illustrations and works of fine art are important considerations for understanding the meaning potentials of the designs and illustrations of contemporary narrative picturebooks. This paper focuses on the appropriation and transformation of works of fine art into contemporary narrative picturebook illustrations. The analysis of numerous picturebooks asserts three forms of appropriation, namely: (1) reproduction, (2) transfiguration, (3) stylization. These three forms of appropriation may be further conceptualized as falling along a continuum ranging from faithful reproductions to stylistic conventionalizations. Reproduction is conceptualized as a mimetic reproduction of an original work of fine art. It is a faithful rendering of an original artwork, most frequently achieved through a photographic or digital rendering process. In the second form of appropriation, transfiguration, a single work of fine art is identifiable but the picturebook artist has transformed the image to fit the context and purpose of a particular picturebook narrative and design. In stylization, a specific work of art is not readily identifiable, but a particular art movement, for example cubism, surrealism, or folk art is drawn upon by the illustrator." .

Analytical approximate solutions are proposed by using the total potential energy of the system and the Rayleigh–Ritz’s method, and their stabilities are also determined. The present analytical approximate solutions agree very well with the numerical solutions obtained via the improved shooting method. The effect of pressure mismatch together with imperfection on the critical stress (above which the film buckles) and on the film-center deflection is characterized. It is found that, compared with the classical case of the Euler column buckling, the equilibrium solutions and critical stress of the film are strongly dependent on the linear combination of the pressure mismatch and imperfection amplitude." .

As interferometry is restricted by the wavelength of the light source used, recent studies of thinner films have prompted the use of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR). In many studies the assumption of a simple exponential decay of the intensity with film thickness was used. In the present study we highlight that this model does not satisfy the Fresnel equations and thus gives an underestimation of the films. We show that the multiple reflections and transmissions at both the upper and the lower interfaces of the film must be taken into account to accurately describe the measured intensity. In order to quantitatively validate the FTIR technique, we measured the film thickness of the air gap between a convex lens of known geometry and a flat surface and obtain excellent agreement. Furthermore, we also found that we can accurately measure the elastic deformations of the lens under loads by comparing them with the results of the Herzian theory. Graphical abstract" .

We report an experimental study of the sound produced by the bursting of a thin liquid film, which initially closes an overpressurized cylindrical cavity. There is a need for a deep understanding of the phenomenon, which can be very useful in numerous practical cases. For instance, in the nature, the volcanologists observe the bursting of large, elongated, gas-bubbles at the surface of lava lakes and record the associated sound emission. One can wonder which pieces of information they can get from such acoustic measurements. For a didactic purpose, we provide also the reader with all the theoretical background necessary for the understanding of the physical processes that govern the various characteristics of the acoustic signals: the cavity geometry governs the frequency; the viscous dissipation and the radiation are responsible for the damping; the acoustic energy informs about the characteristic time associated with the film-rupture more than about the energy initially loaded in the cavity." .

In particular, whether sighted and visually impaired players could experience and recount the same story construed from the plot elements that are either manifested by audio and graphics in the case of sighted players or primarily by audio in the case of visually impaired players. To this end, we have developed a graphical point-and-click adventure game for iOS and Android devices that aims to show how inclusive game design may be used to facilitate a shared gaming experience between sighted and visually impaired players. The game provides players with audio feedback that enables visually impaired players to interact with and experience the game, but in a manner that does not interfere with the overall appearance and functionality of the game. Thus, it has been designed to be fully inclusive to both groups of players and to give the same gaming experience when it comes to story content. The game has been evaluated through formal user tests where subjects have been asked to play the first chapter of the game followed by an interview. The study shows that the perception of the story was almost identical between the two groups. Generally it took visually impaired players a little longer to play the game but they also seem to listen more carefully to the dialogue and hence also build a slightly deeper understanding of the characters. The study also shows that the sighted players did not respond negatively towards the inclusive game design employed in the game." .

Symbols of cuteness abound in nature as in the creatures of neotenous proportions: drawing in the care and concern of the parent and the care from a protector. We provide an in-depth look at the role of cuteness in interactive systems beginning with a history. We particularly focus on the Japanese culture of Kawaii, which has made large impact around the world, especially in entertainment, fashion, and animation. We then take the approach of defining cuteness in contemporary popular perception. User studies are presented offering an in-depth understanding of key perceptual elements, which are identified as cute. This knowledge provides for the possibility to create a cute filter that can transform inputs and automatically create more cute outputs. This paper also provides an insight into the next generation of interactive systems that bring happiness and comfort to users of all ages and cultures through the soft power of cute." .

Six validated music pieces in the categories of classical music, folk music and pop music were used to assess music quality in terms of its ‘pleasantness’, ‘naturalness’, ‘fullness’, ‘roughness’ and ‘sharpness’. 58 participants with sensorineural hearing loss [20 with unilateral hearing loss (UHL), 20 with bilateral symmetrical hearing loss (BSHL) and 18 with bilateral asymmetrical hearing loss (BAHL)] and 29 normal hearing (NH) subjects participated in the present study. Hearing impaired (HI) participants had greater difficulty in overall music quality perception than NH participants. Participants with BSHL rated music pleasantness and naturalness to be higher than participants with BAHL. Moreover, the hearing thresholds of the better ears from BSHL and BAHL participants as well as the hearing thresholds of the worse ears from BSHL participants were negatively correlated to the pleasantness and naturalness perception. HI participants rated the familiar music pieces higher than unfamiliar music pieces in the three music categories. Music quality perception in participants with hearing impairment appeared to be affected by symmetry of hearing loss, degree of hearing loss and music familiarity when they were assessed using the music quality rating test (MQRT). This indicates that binaural symmetrical hearing is important to achieve a high level of music quality perception in HI listeners. This emphasizes the importance of provision of bilateral hearing assistive devices for people with asymmetrical hearing impairment." .

Nuclear power license decisions are usually solely under the purview of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; but Vermont legislators required the facility to also seek approval from the Vermont Legislature, presenting a unique case where state legislators have a direct vote on a nuclear power plant. Over the 8 years of the case study, we find that opposition narratives highlighting an aging, unsafe facility managed by an untrustworthy corporation increased while pro-Vermont Yankee narratives of reliable energy, technical competence, and economic progress decreased. We analyze the changes in the media discourse through examining changes in media frames, the media actors, their sponsorship activities, and the narrative integrity of the frames. These findings are instructive in understanding the factors contributing to changes in the media culture around news coverage of nuclear power." .

Furthermore, we will also demonstrate that the regularized holographic complexity is related to the regularized holographic entanglement entropy for this system. Thus, we will obtain a holographic bound involving regularized holographic complexity, regularized holographic entanglement entropy and regularized fidelity susceptibility of a configuration of D3-brane. We will also discuss a bound for regularized holographic complexity from action, for a D3-brane configuration." .

Somatic hybridization has been identified as one method for the genetic improvement of roses. The success of somatic hybridization programmes relies to a great extent upon efficient protoplast isolation and culture and selection of heterokaryons. This paper reports the isolation of rose cell suspension protoplasts by direct sucrose flotation and demonstrates their culture using extra thin alginate film. A comparative assessment of the efficiency of conventional culture techniques versus those with extra thin alginate film or thin alginate layer is also presented. A very high plating efficiency (80%) was obtained using thin alginate layer or extra thin alginate film techniques with improved media formulations. Protoplasts of Rosa damascena and R. bourboniana were fused by using polyethylene glycol as fusogen and later immobilized in the thin layer of alginate. The fused protoplasts were tracked on the basis of differential fluorescent staining, and the hybridity of heterokaryons following their development to callus was confirmed by molecular characterization. This novel selection strategy has general applicability and is faster and simpler to perform during somatic hybridization experiments." .

For α- Al2O3(0001)-supported ceria, a desorption feature between 800 and 1300 K is shown to result from partial reduction of ceria. However, this oxygen accounts for only a small fraction of the total oxygen in the ceria film and isotopic labeling studies suggest that this oxygen does not exchange freely with the remaining oxygen in the film. In contrast, results for zirconia-supported ceria demonstrate that much more oxygen desorbs in the low temperature regime below 1300 K, and that there is significant isotope exchange throughout the ceria film and with the zirconia substrate. Finally, exposure of reduced, zirconia-supported ceria to water at 670 K resulted in reoxidation of the ceria film. Oxygen from ceria was then shown to react with CO adsorbed on supported Rh particles, completing the catalytic cycle for the water-gas-shift reaction." .

Nevertheless, studies have shown that crafting with digital media often makes these media more cherished and that people enjoy being creative with their digital media. This paper aims to open up the way for novel means for crafting, which include digital media in integrations with physical construction, here called ‘hybrid crafting’. Notions of hybrid crafting were explored to inform the design of products or systems that may support these new crafting practices. We designed ‘Materialise’—a building set that allows for the inclusion of digital images and audio files in physical constructions by using tangible building blocks that can display images or play audio files, alongside a variety of other physical components—and used this set in four hands-on creative workshops to gain insight into how people go about doing hybrid crafting; whether hybrid crafting is desirable; what the characteristics of hybrid crafting are; and how we may design to support these practices. By reflecting on the findings from these workshops, we provide concrete guidelines for the design of novel hybrid crafting products or systems that address craft context, process and result. We aim to open up the design space to designing for hybrid crafting because these new practices provide interesting new challenges and opportunities for future crafting that can lead to novel forms of creative expression." .

Through experiments, numerics, and some analysis, they found that the length and (inner) radius of the tube strongly influence the equilibrium shape of the confined soap film. In this paper, an area minimization problem associated with determining the shape of the film is formulated and analyzed to determine which surfaces are local minima. The connection between a functional inequality and the associated eigenvalue problem plays an important role in the analysis. For helical films, a more detailed analysis is carried out and stability conditions consistent with the experimental and numerical results of Cox and Jones are obtained." .

AC impedance measurements of thin 100-nm polyaniline films electrosynthesized in various acidic electrolyte solutions known to support different film morphologies are reported. By carefully defining experimental parameters obtained data could be satisfactorily explained invoking a simple equivalent circuit assuming a double layer capacity assigned to the polymer/solution interface, a pseudocapacity related to the internal redox capacity of the film, a film and a solution resistance and could be related to film morphologies. The data can be related to structural/morphological features of PANI films in close agreement with generally accepted changes of PANI films as a function of the degree of oxidation and type of anion present during electropolymerization." .

In this study, we integrated music listening with a navigation service, allowing users to follow the perceived direction of the music to reach their destination. This navigation interface provided users with two different guidance methods: route guidance and beacon guidance. The user experience of the navigation service was evaluated with pedestrians in a city center and with cyclists in a suburban area. The results show that spatialized music can be used to guide pedestrians and cyclists toward a destination without any prior training, offering a pleasant navigation experience. Both route and beacon guidance were deemed good alternatives, but the preference between them varied from person to person and depended on the situation. Beacon guidance was generally considered to be suitable for familiar surroundings, while route guidance was seen as a better alternative for areas that are unfamiliar or more difficult to navigate." .

The researcher put specific images printed on both sides of the surface of FleXpeaker™, as well as with sound effects far-distance monitored by a Bluetooth receiver to call out one’s imagination of the events, the time and the underlying environment encoded in the new media. Therefore, the devices viewed as design objects do help users to converge diverse elements in relation to artistic expression and cultural representation.

To derive the expressions of squeeze-film air-damping torque, the nonlinear Reynolds equation, which governs the air behavior of torsion mirror, is solved by the method of eigenfunction expansions in polar coordinate and elliptical coordinate, respectively. The series solutions are integrated and summed up to deduce the damping torque of circular and elliptical torsion mirrors. The formulas of circular mirror and elliptical mirror are deduced independently, and their results match when the eccentricity of the elliptical mirror approaches zero. Besides, the results of the formulas are consistent with numerical simulation. Both of them verifies the damping torque formulas in this paper." .

We systematically reviewed professional online media sources used to inform the timing, breadth of coverage, opinions and consistency in the depiction of events surrounding the gang-rape. MethodsWe searched two news databases (LexisNexis Academic and Factivia) and individual newspapers for English-language published media reports covering the gang-rape. Two reviewers screened the media reports and extracted data regarding the time, location and content of each report. Results were summarized qualitatively. ResultsWe identified 534 published media reports. Of these, 351 met our eligibility criteria. Based on a time chart, the total number of reports published increased steadily through December, but plateaued to a steady rate of articles per day by the first week of January. Content analysis revealed significant discrepancies between various media reports. From the 57 articles which discussed opinions about the victim, 56% applauded her bravery, 40% discussed outrage over the events and 11% discussed cases of victim-blaming. ConclusionsThe global media response of the December 16th gang-rape in India resulted in highly inconsistent depiction of the events. These findings suggest that although the spread of information through media is fast, it has major limitations." .

For this geometry Aharoni [Phys. Stat. Sol. 16, 3-42 (1966)] claims that there are only three different regimes: The unstable mode is either of coherent rotation type, of buckling type, or of curling type. We discover a large fourth parameter regime with an unstable mode displaying an oscillation in the infinite direction. We prove the existence of exactly four regimes by rigorously analyzing the scaling of the Rayleigh quotient of the Hessian of the energy functional. The parameters are the film width, the film thickness, and the exchange length." .

These newspapers are published under Dogan Media Group (DMG) conglomerate. The main aim of this study is to examine peace journalism principles in practice in the context of three DMG newspapers. The study examines the news coverage of the protests in order to formulate a peace journalism approach for journalists. Coverage on the protests, the framing analysis was used as a method. Gezi stories have been analyzed from the front pages of newspapers between 29 May and 30 June 2013. In Turkey, many newspapers have distorted the reality, emphasized marginality and did not pass the test of democratic examination while covering protests came to ignore the peaceful actions. However, peace journalism assumption should be used by journalists while covering the peaceful actions or protests. In democratic dispensation, representation of the electorate should continue both in public spheres and in media. The role of the media is becoming more and more important. The media should not only focus on the violence, but should give voice to nonviolence and peace protests as well. Results show that these three newspapers give more voice to former Prime Minister R.T. Erdogan than other official sources and tend to use the voices of elite authorities. This research found that, Posta quoted more elite sources in relation to the protests than Hurriyet and Radikal. At the end of this research DMG’s “Written Press Publication Principles” have been found to have little effect on coverage of newspapers." .

Our analyses show that attentiveness to campaign news significantly influenced evaluations in a manner consistent with the tone of news coverage for each candidate. We disaggregate the data by party and ideology, however, and discover this effect to be conditional, depending critically on the character and intensity of political predispositions. Throughout the paper we emphasize the interplay between political predispositions and the valence of network coverage, underscoring the contingent effect of media messages. We conclude with a brief discussion of our results and stress the importance of partisan reinforcement, which we found was a major consequence of news media reception during the fall 1992 campaign." .

Anthropocentric perspectives in aesthetics prevent the recognition of the ontological complexity of the aesthetics of nature, and the aesthetic agency of many non-human organisms. The process of evaluative coevolution is shared by all biotic advertisements. I propose that art consists of a form of communication that coevolves with its own evaluation. Art and art history are population phenomena. I expand Arthur Danto’s Artworld concept to any aesthetic population of producers and evaluators. Current concepts of art cannot exclusively circumscribe the human arts from many forms of non-human biotic art. Without assuming an arbitrarily anthropocentric perspective, any concept of art will need to engage with biodiversity, and either recognize many instances of biotic advertisements as art, or exclude some instances of human art. Coevolutionary aesthetic theory provides a heuristic account of aesthetic change in both human and biotic artworlds, including the coevolutionary origin of aesthetic properties and aesthetic value within artworlds. Restructuring aesthetics, art criticism, and art history without human beings at the organizing centers of these disciplines stimulate new progress in our understanding of art, and the unique human contributions to aesthetics and aesthetic diversity." .

Content analysis was employed to analyze leadership content in three major dance therapy books:Marian Chace: Her Papers (1975),Dance Therapy: Focus on Dance VII (1974), andEight Theoretical Approaches to Dance/Movement Therapy (1979). Content was collected and categorized into five topics: Terminology Describing the Dance Therapist, Personality Variables, Goals, Roles and Approaches. The data was analyzed to determine how dance therapists define and perceive the leadership process. The content suggests that there is consensus among the dance therapists reviewed concerning the variables describing themselves and the approaches, goals, roles and personality traits that comprise leadership in dance therapy. The discussion focuses on the implications of identifying leadership variables and on the shift from being specialists to generalists." .

We analyze the effects of media proliferation on electoral outcomes assuming voters may choose news that is too partisan, from an informational perspective, i.e., engage in partisan selective exposure. We find that if voters who prefer highly partisan news—either because they are truly ideologically extreme, or due to a tendency towards excessive selective exposure—are politically “important,” then proliferation is socially beneficial, as it makes these voters more likely to obtain informative news. Otherwise, proliferation still protects against very poor electoral outcomes that can occur when the number of outlets is small and the only media options are highly partisan. Our model’s overall implication is thus that, surprisingly, proliferation is socially beneficial regardless of the degree of selective exposure." .

The dimple ceases to exist when its free energy E d equals the excess free energy E c of a critical hole in the film, which indicates the breakdown of the metastable film. The lifetime of the metastable film upon approach of the instability is calculated. Possibilities of enhancing the instability are briefly addressed." .

Ss were in separate rooms, but their responses were tallied collectively and they were programmed as teams under various DRL and DRH schedules. The lights (conditioned reinforcement) were intermittently paired with the radio music (primary reinforcement) on a variable ratio schedule. The collective rate response stabilized under the various DRL and DRH schedules. The DRL schedules systematically decreased the collective team response rate until usually only one member of the team was responding, while the DRH schedules increased the team response rate until at least two out of three members were responding at a rate higher than operant level. DRL response rates were much easier to shape than the DRH response rates. In general, team regulation conformed to the principles of reinforcement manifested in schedules of reinforcements used on individual subjects." .

These models vary in their treatment of losses through perforations and squeezed film, in their assumptions of compressibility, rarefaction and inertia, and their treatment of various second order corrections. We present a model that improves upon our previously reported work by incorporating more accurate losses through holes proposed by Veijola and treating boundary cells and interior cell differently as proposed by Mohite et al. We benchmark all these models against experimental results obtained for a typical perforated MEMS structure with geometric parameters (e.g., perforation geometry, air gap, plate thickness) that fall well within the acceptable range of parameters for these models (with the sole exception of Blech’s model that does not include perforations but is included for historical reasons). We compare the results and discuss the sources of errors. We show that the proposed model gives the best result by predicting the damping constant within 10% of the experimental value. We study the validity of the proposed model over the entire range of perforation ratios (PR) by comparing its results with numerically computed results from 3D Navier-Stokes equation. These results are also compared with other analytical models. The proposed model shows considerably better results than other models, especially for large values of PR." .

Both, ripple and skew angle were assumed to show a Gaussian distribution with different standard deviations. Ripple and skew are superimposed in a nonlinear manner to give the fall-back angle of the entire film. By direct measurements of the ripple fall-back angle, α500, for very small spots of the film, of the fall-back angle, α50, of the entire film, and of the distribution and standard deviation of the skew, the calculation could be tested, which gave good agreement between experiment and theory. As long as the skew is unknown the fall-back angle alone is not the best measure for the “quality” of an uniaxial film." .

Aluminum film and two kinds of substrates, i.e. glass and silicon, are studied. Nanoindentation XP II and continuous stiffness mode are used during the experiments. In order to avoid the influence of the Oliver and Pharr method used in the experiments, the experiment data are analyzed with the constant Young's modulus assumption and the equal hardness assumption. The volume fraction model (CZ model) proposed by Fabes et al. (1992) is used and modified to analyze the measured hardness. The method proposed by Doerner and Nix (DN formula) (1986) is modified to analyze the measured Young's modulus. Two kinds of modified empirical formula are used to predict the present experiment results and those in the literature, which include the results of two kinds of systems, i.e., a soft film on a hard substrate and a hard film on a soft substrate. In the modified CZ model, the indentation influence angle, φ, is considered as a relevant physical parameter, which embodies the effects of the indenter tip radius, pile-up or sink-in phenomena and deformation of film and substrate." .

His model of autonomy and legitimacy in modern art was based on a study of the genesis of an avant-garde in French art in the late nineteenth century. I argue that a similar autonomization of art occurred in the mid-twentieth century in the United States. I present studies in music and film to demonstrate the genesis of an American avant-garde during this period. This general process of autonomization until now has been neglected in the work of sociologists and historians on American art. My analysis shows that the genesis of principles of autonomy in the United States, unlike France, developed in what were considered the high and popular arts. These case studies reveal a failure in Bourdieu’s model to account for the role of culture industries and popular artists in the autonomization of modern art fields. I show how the American art field generated a subfield of autonomous art that included both avant-garde high art and independent popular art. This permanent subfield of avant-garde and independent art became central to future struggles over autonomy and innovation in American art." .

The substrate prestrain, interconnector buckling amplitude and critical strain are important parameters for the buckling design. In the presented analysis, the buckled film shape was described approximately by a trigonometric function and the buckled film amplitude was obtained by minimizing the total strain energy. However, this method only generates the first-order approximate solution for the nonlinear buckling. In the present paper, an asymptotic analysis based on the rigorous nonlinear differential equation for the buckled micro-film deformations is proposed to obtain more accurate relationship of the buckling amplitude and critical strain to prestrain. The obtained results reveal the nonlinear relation and are significant to accurate buckling design of micro-films." .

Impact experiments using 3.9 mm diameter droplets were carried out for Weber numbers between 159 and 808, with a fixed Ohnesorge number of 2 × 10−3 and film parameters S f (the ratio between the thickness of the liquid film h film and the diameter of the impacting droplet d i) between 0.3 and 1. Observed results show that the deposition/splashing threshold is independent of the parameter S f in agreement with the data in the literature. The aerosol measurement results demonstrate the production of solid particles from the evaporation of secondary microdroplets with diameters less than 30 μm formed when splash occurs. The median diameter of these microdroplets is around 20 μm, corresponding to a value of d 50/d i = 5 × 10−3. Taken together, the results show that the mass and the number of particles emitted increase as the Weber number increases. Moreover, at a Weber number of 808, the results show that the mass and number of particles emitted increases as the parameter S f decreases. In this case, the mean number of microdroplets emitted per impact is equal to 14 for S f = 1 and equal to 76 for S f = 0.3." .

It draws on insights from the work of music theorist David Schwarz (1997) that bridges psychoanalysis, music, and culture; and from Daniel Levitin’s (2008) work on music and human nature, especially as it pertains to religion, ritual and songs. Schwarz describes listening to music as a process of retrospective fantasy and as a type of transference experience. If how we listen to music is shaped by traces of past experiences, then music as a resource in pastoral care has the potential to assist ministers in the process of guiding their parishioners to re-trace painful experiences in ways that “re-sound” with thoughts and feelings which have become an impediment to healing. A “case study” in which the author was a “player” (or more accurately performer) is briefly examined, and the role of music in the lives of Steve Lopez and Nathaniel Ayers (Lopez 2008) is explored to demonstrate how music—specifically religious music or song associated with religious ritual—is an overlooked resource for pastoral care. The article concludes with an illustration of how individuals’ personal associations with a hymn may have implications for pastoral care." .

Analyses revealed that both angered and nonangered subjects exhibited an increase in aggressive mood following exposure to the fight film.

Yet almost no research on voting has formally tested such mediational hypotheses. Using national survey data collected between February and September of 2004, this paper begins by illustrating how to conduct such investigations. We explored whether public approval of President Bush’s handling of a series of specific national problems (e.g., the Iraq war) influenced overall assessments of his job performance and evaluations of his likely future performance versus John Kerry’s, which in turn shaped vote choices. The results are consistent with the claim of mediation and shed additional light on the impact of various issues on the 2004 election outcome. We also tested what we term the “dosage hypothesis,” derived from news media priming theory, which posits that changes in the amount of media coverage of an issue during the course of a campaign should precipitate changes in the weight citizens place on that issue when evaluating the president’s overall job performance, particularly among citizens most exposed to the news. Surprisingly, this analysis did not yield consistent support for the venerable dosage hypothesis, suggesting that the conditions under which priming occurs should be specified much more precisely in future work." .

It is shown that the peak is the result of a parasitic reactance in the measurement circuit related to the series and parallel equivalent schemes of the measurement circuit. It is demonstrated that the top of the peak is reached when the film resistivity becomes equal to the value of the imaginary part of the circuit impedance. Thus, its location at the temperature scale is determined by the resistance curve. Simultaneously the peak height becomes correspondingly equal to half the inverse value of the imaginary part." .

Reducing years of research into a headline can be extremely difficult and certainly doesn't come naturally to every scientist, so this article provides suggestions on how to work with the media to communicate your findings." .

In this case, the homogeneity of structures over the area becomes an essential factor. Ferromagnetic resonance as a physical effect, the signal parameters of which are associated with many physical characteristics of the object under study (magnetization, anisotropy constants, etc.), makes it possible to create a highly convenient method for determining these characteristics in various segments of the object under study." .

A CCD-based digital cephalometric image of a stepless aluminum wedge containing 50 bur holes of different depth was cut into 100 isometric images. Each image was printed on glossy paper and on transparent film by means of a high-resolution desktop inkjet printer at specific settings. The printed images were viewed under standardized conditions, and the perceptibility of the bur holes was evaluated and compared to the perceptibility on a 17-in CRT monitor. Thirty observers stated their blinded decision on a five-point confidence scale. Areas (Az) under receiver operating characteristics curves were calculated and compared using the pair wise sign tests. Overall agreement was estimated using Cohen’s kappa device and observer bias using McNemar’s test. Glossy paper prints and monitor display revealed significantly higher (P < 0.001) average Az values (0.83) compared to prints on transparent film (0.79), which was caused by higher sensitivity. Specificity was similar for all modalities. The sensitivity was dependent on the mean gray scale values for the transparent film." .

The Mexican hat effect indicates such interaction. An analytical method is presented, and related dimensional analysis shows that a single dimensionless parameter can effectively evaluate the effect." .

There is a wide consensus among feature film production studios that the Internet era brings a new paradigm for film distribution to cinemas worldwide. The benefits of digital cinema to both producers and cinemas are numerous: significantly lower distribution and maintenance costs, immediate access to film libraries, higher presentation quality, and strong potential for developing new business models. Despite these advantages, the studios are still reluctant to jump into the digital age. An important concern regarding digital and conventional cinema is the danger of widespread piracy. Piracy already costs Hollywood an estimated two billion dollars annually, and digital cinema without proper copyright enforcement could increase this number. In this paper, we present a copyright management system that aims at providing the set of necessary security tools: standard cryptographic primitives and copyright protection mechanisms that enable a reliable and secure feature film delivery system." .

In Study 1, participants who watched a prodefense rape story were more likely to report that they would need more inculpatory evidence to convict a defendant of rape than were participants who watched a proprosecution rape story. In Study 2, participants watched news stories, one of which was a proprosecution rape story, a prodefense rape story, or a nonrape story. In an ostensibly unrelated study, participants indicated their attitudes toward rape, watched a rape trial, and provided trial and witness ratings. Accessibility did not mediate the media effects on participants' judgments of rape importance; however, attitudes moderated media effects. Rape news influenced juror ratings of the importance of evidence about the complainant's behavior. Finally, media altered the standards participants used to determine defendant guilt. Implications for understanding the mechanisms responsible for pretrial publicity effects are discussed." .

The underlying forces that drive the dewetting motion are given by the intermolecular potential between the liquid film and the substrate. The role of slippage in the emerging instability is studied via a sharp-interface model for the dewetting thin film, which is derived from the lubrication model via matched asymptotic expansions. Using the separation of the time-scale for the slow growth of the rim and the time-scale on which the rim destabilises, the sharp-interface results are compared to earlier results for the lubrication model and good agreement for the unstable modes is obtained. The main advantage of the sharp-interface model is that it allows for the derivation of traveling solutions for the base state and subsequently a systematic linear stability analysis via normal modes. Interestingly, unlike the dispersion relations that are typically encountered for the well-known finger-instability in thin-film flows, where the dependence of the growth rate on the wave number is quadratic, here it is linear." .

These centered on possible reregulation of rates for basic service and reduction of entry barriers for potential competitors. Using the event study methodology on a portfolio of cable firms, we find evidence that news of no reregulation caused significant positive abnormal returns. News of reregulation caused insignificant negative abnormal returns. These findings provide some support for the traditional consumer protection theory of regulation. News related to entry barriers generally had no significant effect on returns, which suggests that elements of natural monopoly may exist in the industry." .

The ZrO2 thin-film thickness is varied from 2,000–5,000 Å. The transmittance modulation and memory effect improved with increase in the thickness of ZrO2 electrolyte. The device having 5,000 Å ZrO2 thickness shows good transmittance modulation (56 %) in the wavelength range of 450–1,000 nm with open-circuit memory effect of 170 min." .

During the film each of the genital measures increased for most subjects, resulting in highly significant positive correlations between measures. However, following the erotic film presentation there was considerably less direct correspondence among the three measures; although the genital reactions of most subjects subsided to some extent following the film, none of the three measures consistently returned to prestimulation levels. Periodic estimates of subjective levels of sexual arousal were significantly correlated with each of the genital measures during the erotic film but were not significantly correlated with any after the film." .

This has led to considerable debate about why people dislike the media and how their public standing could be improved. This paper contributes to this literature by using a survey experiment to test the effect of several different considerations on evaluations of the media. It finds, consistent with the broader literature on political persuasion, that elite partisan opinion leadership can powerfully shape these attitudes. Additionally, it finds that tabloid coverage creates antipathy toward the press regardless of predispositions and that horserace coverage has a negative effect on opinions among politically aware citizens on both sides of the political spectrum. Contrary to some claims in the literature, this study finds no detectable effect of news negativity." .

An extruded-blown film of high-density polyethylene was used as the original polyethylene film. Recrystallized film was made by recrystallization from the melting of the original polyethylene film. A photoelectric dye,2-[2-[4-(dibutylamino)phenyl]ethenyl]-3-carboxymethylbenzothiazolium bromide, was coupled to the two types of polyethylene films through amide linkages. Samples of the original dye-coupled film, the dye-coupled recrystallized film, and the dye-uncoupled plain film were implanted in the subretinal space of normal adult rats. Frozen sections were cut from the eyes enucleated at 1 week or 1 month and were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin, stained immunohistochemically for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or processed for in situ apoptosis detection. The results revealed that retinal tissue damage was negligible with no inflammatory cells and few apoptotic cells. GFAP was significantly up-regulated in retinal sites with the implantation of all types of polyethylene films at 1 week, compared with the adjacent retinal sites (P < 0.005, analysis of variance). The GFAP up-regulation was also present at 1 month for the plain film and dye-coupled recrystallized film (P < 0.05). Glial cell encirclement around the films increased significantly between 1 week and 1 month (P = 0.023, two-factor analysis of variance) but was not significantly different among the three types of polyethylene films (P = 0.4531). These results showed evidence of glial reactions to the photoelectric dye-coupled polyethylene films implanted into the subretinal space of rat eyes and also proved their basic biological safety." .

Recent approaches to this problem work well for music, where the repetitions largely agree with respect to instrumentation and tempo, as is typically the case for popular music. For other classes of music such as Western classical music, however, musically similar audio segments may exhibit significant variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, execution of note groups, modulation, articulation, and tempo progression. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient algorithm for audio structure analysis, which allows to identify musically similar segments even in the presence of large variations in these parameters. To account for such variations, our main idea is to incorporate invariance at various levels simultaneously: we design a new type of statistical features to absorb microvariations, introduce an enhanced local distance measure to account for local variations, and describe a new strategy for structure extraction that can cope with the global variations. Our experimental results with classical and popular music show that our algorithm performs successfully even in the presence of significant musical variations." .

By expanding upon Erving Goffman’s performance perspective and performance theory, this article seeks to illuminate representations of celebrities in the news media, with attention to the recent news stories regarding Tiger Woods and Sandra Bullock. The analysis also explores the off-screen performance of celebrities—developed and presented in news stories, interviews and photographs—and the repercussions when reports of a celebrity’s unmanaged backstage performance exposes the front stage performance as a pretense." .
