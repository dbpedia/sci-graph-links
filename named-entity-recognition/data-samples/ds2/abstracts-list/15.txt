Using univariate statistics, we find that opportunity entrepreneurs remain in self-employment longer than necessity entrepreneurs. However, after controlling for the entrepreneurs’ education in the professional area where they start their venture, this effect is no longer significant. We therefore conclude that the difference observed is not an original effect but rather is due to selection. We then go on to discuss the implications of our findings for entrepreneurship-policy making, and give suggestions to improve governmental start-up programs." .

It is known that twenty percent customers produce eighty percent profiles. Thus, how to find these customers is very critical. Customer lifetime value (CLV) is presented to evaluate customers in terms of recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) variables. A novel model is proposed to analyze customers purchase data and RFM variables based on ordered weighting averaging (OWA) and K-Means cluster algorithm. OWA is employed to determine the weights of RFM variables in evaluating customer lifetime value or loyalty. K-Means algorithm is used to cluster customers according to RFM values. Churn customers could be found out by comparing RFM values of every cluster group with average RFM. Questionnaire is conducted to investigate which reasons cause customers dissatisfaction. Rank these reasons to help E-commerce improve services. The experimental results have demonstrated that the model is effective and reasonable." .

The objective of this study was to determine supervisor and organizational factors associated with supervisors’ support for temporary job accommodations for LBP injured workers. Methods Supervisors were recruited from 19 workplaces in the USA and Canada and completed an online survey regarding job accommodation practices and potential associated factors with respect to a case vignette of a worker with LBP. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify the most parsimonious set of factors associated with supervisors’ support for accommodations. Results A total of 804 supervisors participated with 796 eligible for inclusion in the analysis. The final set of factors explained 21 % of the variance in supervisors’ support for temporary job accommodations. Considerate leadership style (β = 0.261; 95 % CI 0.212, 0.310), workplace disability management policies and practices (β = 0.243; 95 % CI 0.188, 0.298), and supervisor autonomy for designing and providing workplace accommodations (β = 0.156; 95 % CI 0.071, 0.241) had the largest effect on supervisor support for accommodations. Conclusion Factors predicting supervisors’ likelihood to accommodate LBP injured workers include use of considerate leadership style, workplace disability management policies and practices, and supervisor autonomy. Workplace interventions targeting these factors should be developed and evaluated for their ability to improve work disability prevention outcomes." .

One common explanation for this state of affairs is that employers tend to have negative attitudes about what the handicapped have to offer as employees and what is required to integrate them into the work force. Unfortunately, relatively little recent data is available about such attitudes. Thus, a survey of Fortune 500 companies was conducted to examine employers' attitudes toward the disabled. Employers' hiring and accommodation practices were also examined. Results were encouraging for the handicapped in some areas (e.g., performance perceptions) and a cause for concern in others (e.g., the perceived cost of making workplace accommodations). Level of exposure to the handicapped was also related to attitudes and practices. Limitations, research directions, and implications for corporations are discussed." .

One appropriate solution to address these challenges is represented by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This proceeding digitized connection of industrial manufacturing, also known as “Industry 4.0”, comes along with extensive organizational consequences and opportunities for established manufacturers. Existing value chains will change providing opportunities for innovative business models (BM). Although academic literature agrees on the emergence of novel BMs, recent research mainly addressed technological challenges and benefits, whereas systematic and comprehensive examinations of novel IIoT-triggered BM types have a backlog. Consequently, we aim at systematically analyzing existing literature regarding novel BMs emerging due to the IIoT. Hence, we present a comprehensive overview of novel, innovative BMs relevant for the IIoT. Further, we assign these innovate BMs to three generic BM types. In doing so, we contribute to both academic literature and managerial practice. A systematic literature review is chosen as research method, since it is systematic, transparent, and replicable for the synthesis, evaluation, and discussion of relevant literature. It revealed 13 articles in leading business journals, conference proceedings, collected editions as well as reports of research institutions published between 2007 and 2015. They were analyzed in depth in order to develop topical categories inductively, which allows novel concepts to emerge from this process. The results show that novel IIoT-triggered BMs can be grouped into three main categories: Cloud-based BMs, Service-oriented BMs, and Process-oriented BMs. Cloud-based BMs provide an online platform, offer virtual infrastructure, or grant access to software via the internet. Hence, the cloud acts as a medium that supplies customers with several values without being in need of physically possessing any hardware. Service-oriented BMs are primarily based on data, which are utilized in order to offer various services to customers, e. g. increased availability, availability on demand, and predictive maintenance. Process-oriented BMs aim at optimizing processes, e. g. by reducing downtimes, which primarily appeals to manufacturing companies. Our findings contribute to theory by systematically synthesizing previous works studying novel, IIoT-related BMs from several perspectives and with various objectives. Thereby, we provide three generic BM types, which put themselves forward for future BM research in the context of the IIoT. From a practical perspective, our findings are highly relevant as they facilitate companies’ comprehension of innovative BMs emerging from the IIoT. By providing a comprehensive and illustrative overview of future business concepts, we enable managerial decision makers to oversee the range of different BM conceptualizations that can be put on the daily agenda in order to increase their respective companies’ future competitiveness in the context of a digitized and connected industrial environment." .

Without a doubt, e-commerce will no longer be a choice for organizations rather it will be a competitive necessity to ensure business prosperity. Integral to the success of e-commerce is having good e-commerce software that can enable organizations to offer online products and services as well as integrate their business processes and supply chains within and with their collaborators or partners in a perfect, seamless manner. One of the main obstacles for adoption of e-commerce faced by many organizations; however, has been the lack of such proper integrated e-commerce software. There have been few ready-made software solutions offered by vendors, which can be customized for organizations’ business models and processes, and these solutions are based on “piece meal” approaches and thus lack much of the enterprise capabilities organizations need to adopt. In this paper, we suggest a framework for developing an enterprise-wide integrated e-commerce portal for evolving organizations. Such a framework will help any organization to design a distributed, extensible, cross-platform, collaborative and integrated e-commerce portal." .

This paper adopts an entrepreneurial method framework to explore how social enterprises (SEs) can more efficiently and effectively provide goods and services to the needy. SEs have the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness by innovating new products, processes, strategies, and/or business models to better meet their beneficiaries’ needs. Three case studies of SEs are used to explore the process and the outcomes of the entrepreneurial method. In addition, propositions are developed to illustrate the social and economic performance advantages of SEs and offer managerial implications for enhanced practice." .

Without trade unions, privatization — modeled as a stricter control of employees — lowers wages and raises employment, output, and profits, while effort and productivity effects depend on the employees' risk aversion. However, for a utilitarian monopoly union, facing a company characterized by a constant-elasticity labor-demand schedule, privatization raises efficiency wages. If privatization is modeled as a stronger profit orientation, wages, effort, and labor productivity will rise, while employment will shrink in a wage-setting firm. Again, wage and employment effects can be reversed in the case of wage negotiations." .

Although many organizations adopt legalistic responses to cope with these concerns, the analysis presented in this article suggests that while legalistic approaches function well to protect organizational interests in terms of both legal liability and legitimacy, the are only partially able to protect employee rights. Drawing upon the limited literature on HIV/AIDS in the workplace, this article presents an agenda for future research on organizational responses to HIV/AIDS." .

A survey of 125 London-based organisations found that the majority had instituted codes of conduct designed to govern the use of ICT by their employees. However, the primary purpose of adopting such codes was to ensure the security and efficient operation of the organisation's information systems rather than for wider ethical considerations. Hence, few of the codes of conduct addressed issues relating to the collection, storage and dissemination of data about individuals (personal data); this was especially the case with codes emanating from IT departments rather than senior management. In general, codes of conduct were found to be ineffective in influencing end-user behaviour in the organisations surveyed. Codes of conduct are a means by which organisations seek to exercise power, control and ownership, but their effectiveness is compromised by the nature of ICT itself as well as the attitudes of employees. The failure of well-publicised ethical policies to influence use of ICT by business studies students – the managers of tomorrow – suggests that these tensions are likely to remain unresolved." .

Using a computer-simulated product development process, we compare the performance of generalist and specialist knowledge management strategies under conditions of market turbulence. The generalist knowledge strategy emphasizes breadth of knowledge in product development teams, while the specialist strategy focuses on depth of knowledge. Our generalist and specialist strategies are grounded in Eastern and Western perspectives of knowledge management, respectively. A primary difference between these two approaches is the strong emphasis on cross-learning, or learning across team members, in the Eastern perspective relative to the Western perspective. As such, we examine the performance implications of different modes of cross-learning for teams utilizing the generalist knowledge strategy. Specifically, we examine three modes of cross-learning, which are reflected in the use of three learning decision rules: (1) averaging, (2) majority, and (3) hot hand. A learning decision rule indicates how decision-makers learn from their fellow team members. Under the first rule, the decision-maker adopts an average of the beliefs held by fellow team members. Under the second rule, if a majority of fellow team members agree on a particular solution, then the decision-maker adopts the beliefs held by the majority. Under the third rule, the decision-maker learns from the team member whose beliefs have been consistent with market desires most recently. Surprisingly, we find that specialist strategies outperform generalist strategies under conditions of low and high market turbulence. We also find that cross-learning can be beneficial or detrimental, contingent upon the mode of learning. Generalist teams utilizing the averaging decision rule perform significantly worse, while generalist teams utilizing the hot hand decision rule perform significantly better." .

If marginal costs are increasing, public firms do not supply the entire market, leaving room for private firms to produce and possibly cooperate by restricting output. The presence of public firms makes collusion among private firms harder to sustain, and maybe even unprofitable. As the number of private firms increases, collusion may become easier or harder to sustain. Privatization makes collusion easier to sustain, and is socially detrimental whenever firms are able to collude after privatization (which is always the case if they are sufficiently patient). Coordinated effects thus reverse the traditional result according to which privatization is socially desirable if there are many firms in the industry." .

In line with descriptive evidence, we find lower job-to-job and higher job-to-nonemployment transition probabilities for women than men when controlling for individual and workplace characteristics and unobserved plant heterogeneity. These differences vanish once we allow these characteristics to affect separations differently by gender. When additionally controlling for wages, we find that both separation rates are considerably lower and also significantly less wage-elastic for women than for men, suggesting an interplay of gender differences in transition behaviour and the gender pay gap." .

The results showed that diversity of views on objectives, competitive methods, and values are positively related to objective measures of performance but negatively related to manager's own perceptions of their operating units' performance. This suggests that diversity of views may allow managerial employees to fulfill their responsibilities more effectively by improving their units' performance. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the concluding section of this article." .

There have been several models developed for this purpose. The main objectives of these models are to organize the knowledge activities to increase competitive advantage and turn the market share into a continuous and permanent superiority through utilizing the intellectual capital of the enterprise for better products and services. When existing models are carefully analyzed, it can be clearly seen that every model addresses different aspects of KM. While some of these models have been intensifying on the use of technology and production of knowledge, the others rather focus on the utilization of knowledge itself. Although these models point out the importance of managerial participation, they are mainly designed to be facilitated at operational levels. It is now obviously seen that there is a need for a new model that will deal with KM at strategic, tactic, and operational levels in an integrated manner. In this study, an enterprise knowledge management model (EKMM) is developed to facilitate this. The model is also called the “Knowledge Tower” due to its dynamics and tower-like infrastructure. EKMM does not only deal with utilizing the knowledge but also create KM strategies, knowledge culture as well as respective leveraging activities. It provides an extensive assessment capability to make sure that the KM practices are carried out as effectively as possible. This surely helps identifying the lack of implementations and areas requiring improvements." .

Nevertheless, although it is acknowledged that people can experience callings in any activity, up to now, there are few studies on this construct in the context of commercial companies. In this paper we focus on studying calling orientation in employees of a multinational company. We test three hypotheses: 1) the different ways of relating to work (as a job, a career or a calling) is also reported among corporate employees; 2) there are differences in the levels of flow at work in accordance with the different ways that employees relate to their work; and 3) there are differences in the levels of perception that employees have of the social relevance of their work in accordance with the way in which they relate to their work. In order to verify these hypotheses we applied three instruments to a sample of employees of the Latin America brand (279 Argentinean and 193 Ecuadorian employees) of a multinational corporation: The University of Pennsylvania Work Life Questionnaire, the Work Related Flow Inventory and a scale of Social Work Relevance Perception. The results suggest that callings are identifiable among corporate enterprise employees and that employees with a calling orientation have higher levels of flow at work and a greater perception of the social relevance of their work than those employees who just relate to their work as jobs or careers." .

The problem stated simply is: When is a quit a quit? Where employees are represented by a bargaining agent, the company cannot always be sure that a “quit is a quit.” It is clear that employers who do not understand the “I quit” syndrome are in an uncertain position with respect to handling such problems. The authors have also discovered that unions do not understand the “I quit” syndrome either and at times go to arbitration with all of its attendant costs when the employee has actually “quit.” The purposes of this article are to study how arbitrators have ruled, to establish the principles involved in this little-known area of union/management relations and to provide parties to such cases with information to guide them. Arbitrators have upheld grievances and reversed company actions often enough that there is a need to clarify what is a “quit” as well as a need to clarify what the rights are of both parties under the collective bargaining agreement. The authors found that many managements use the “I quit” syndrome as a substitute for disciplinary action. It is clear from arbitral decisions that it is best from the company point of view to allow the disciplinary system to handle problem employees. The authors also found that reasonable resignations by employees were upheld by arbitrators. If employers carefully handle and document employee resignations, the resignations will stand. Further, it is clear that employers must issue clear policy statements concerning resignations; this includes avoiding resignations under duress. Finally, parties to collective bargaining agreements need contract language defining a quit." .

In an effort to make up for this shortfall, by taking Theory of Planned Behavior as basic framework, the present study seeks to understand the influence of three of the most important factors, viz. (a) endogenous barriers, (b) exogenous environment, and (c) university environment and support on the entrepreneurial intention among management students. The study sample consisted of 1,097 students, wherein 526 students were from India, 252 from Singapore, and 319 were from Malaysia. The results indicates that along with positive attitude and perceived behavioral control that directly influences entrepreneurial intention, university environment and support and exogenous environment also have an indirect but significant impact on shaping of entrepreneurial intention among students. With this, it was found that exogenous environment was found to have a negative relationship with both attitude towards behavior and perceived behavioral control for all three countries." .

For this reason, many firms have focused their attention to opening up their internal innovation processes to include more external parties with the support of intermediaries of innovation. The purpose of the paper is to investigate emerging research fields on innovation intermediaries. These organizations can play an important role for developing and accelerating the combination of knowledge and competences necessary to solve innovation problems, by realizing the adequate connections and links among different actors geographically dispersed. They have also emerged as a networking platform, creating, developing, and stimulating innovation communities through interconnected networks of people and knowledge. From a mostly qualitative research, the paper stresses the findings in two specific directions. The first more theoretical layer identifies the main trends of analysis on innovation intermediaries; the second one underlines the practical involvement of the creative minds in the search and the development of innovation products and services. The outcomes can be useful to pinpoint the different mindset of researches on innovation intermediaries." .

Most entrepreneurs left their farms for salaried employment for a few years and they took professional courses in order to learn necessary skills before they opened their enterprises. They have developed new small entreprizes using local resources at times informally as means to reduce risks and they specialize mainly in internal tourism and construction related branches. While Jewish entrepreneurs develop mainly tourism activities oriented toward the national market, Arab entrepreneurs develop mainly construction related branches to local and home regional markets. Both represent two styles of peripheral activities. It seems that both styles has only limited potential to overcome their marginality." .

Building on institutional theory and actor–network theory, we advance the concept of contextualization work to describe the institutional work that sustains RI glocalization. Empirical data from two case studies highlight how entrepreneurial actors imported the notion of RI from the US to France and Québec. Our findings uncover three types of contextualization work—filtering, repurposing, and coupling—that sustain RI glocalization, and show how actors employed them in both settings to overcome the lack of technical, cultural, or political fit between the imported practice and their local context. Our results explain how divergent glocalized versions of RI are developed and adapted through contextualization work. Last, we discuss how our repertoire of contextualization work can account for local forms of a global concept and the uneven pattern of its diffusion." .

Whereas transaction-oriented marketplaces are characterized by catalogs, auctions or exchanges, and support for negotiated pricing, collaboration marketplaces are characterized by planning capabilities such as continuous planning, forecasting, and replenishment or product life-cycle management. Collaboration marketplaces have different benefits than transaction-oriented marketplaces and different adoption considerations. Therefore, theoretical frameworks such as transaction cost theory, which apply quite well to transaction-oriented marketplaces, provide only a partial explanation of collaboration marketplace adoption. We compare alternative theoretical perspectives on collaboration marketplaces and discuss their implications for future research." .

This article highlights key parts of the book that should be of interest to both Australian and international readers. A great deal of the book’s content is based on international conventions concerned with equitable principles which the authors suggest should govern the workplace, for example: a workplace free of discrimination; dignity at work; fair minimum standards and effective dispute resolution.

Research on mergers has evolved without a common direction or unifying theories and propositions. Investigators rarely replicate or extend each other’s work in articles, books, and dissertations. Interpretations of the dynamics of union mergers and conclusions about merger trends are not being critically appraised at conferences. There is no consensus among researchers on issues beyond the fundamental reasons for mergers and the forms of mergers. The result of all of this is that the research community that has little to offer legislators trying to regulate union merger activity, federation officers proposing merger policies or trying to fit mergers into their prescriptions for union revival, union officers and staff considering merger invitations, and union members evaluating claims made during merger campaigns." .

Interestingly, contrary to previous findings, we find that corruption when measured by a dummy variable, does not affect firms’ financial performance after controlling for heterogeneity, simultaneity and dynamic endogeneity. However, the intensity of bribery and the majority of the forms of corruption were found to have negative impacts on firms’ financial performance. Hence, a typical approach using only a dummy variable for bribery might not adequately evaluate the impact of bribe intensity or even ignores the negative impacts of some types of bribes on firms’ financial performance. The findings suggest that anti-corruption measures are vital for the development of the Vietnamese private SMEs." .

Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of VSM, this research proposes to enhance the model by using it in combination with Topp’s Knowledge System Diagnostics (KSD) which tries to uncover an organisation’s rules of formation making possible the creation and maintenance of knowledge within an organisation. It is thought that, equipped with this information, an adaptive application of VSM with KSD might cure unhealthy managerial practice—a lack of employee involvement in decision making and responsibility and authority sharing—observed both in a textile manufacturer and VSM. Methodological implications of this version of multimethodology are discussed, and then research site issues are revealed and recommendations are made." .

However, many corporate managers are still influenced by a widely held belief that such investments erode profits and are therefore unjustifiable from an agency perspective. In this paper, we refine and test theory regarding countervailing forces that influence community-based firm performance. We hypothesize that high levels of available slack will be associated with higher community-based performance, but that this relationship will be moderated by three important governance variables: board independence, investment fund ownership, and CEO ownership. We find support for our hypotheses in longitudinal study of a large sample of U.S. corporations." .

This situation has generally resulted in a smaller workforce confronted with voluminous information-processing requirements. Naturally, the focus has been on the design of organzations that will support effective and efficient learning processes. This specific study is on the contingency modely by Ouksel et al. (1997) on the impact of organizational structure on organizational learning and performance. It expands the empirical evaluation of the model to test its robustness. This is done by conducting extensive simulations with (a) a larger number of variables in the decision tasks, and (b) a larger set of numbers for each of the numeric variables, than has been used in the past. Overall, the validity of previous results achieved has been confirmed, but the selection of the most appropriate design, that which will indeed improve learning, is even more nuanced than past studies have concluded." .

The definition of competencies, their assessment, and their link to pay are discussed, along with the relation of competencies to organizational performance and human resource management strategy. The relatively small amount of existing empirical research is reviewed, and two case studies of the use of competency-based pay are presented. The article concludes by summarizing lessons for education from private-sector experience, which include the need to link the competencies paid for to the capabilities the organization needs to fulfill its mission, the importance of measuring competencies in behavioral and observable terms, and the need to integrate competencies into all phases of the human resources management process, including staffing and development as well as compensation." .

Results indicate that workers above 49 years are significantly less productive than their younger colleagues. Moreover, while relative productivities across age groups are not found to differ significantly between ICT and non ICT firms, the upward sloping age-wage profile appears to be somewhat steeper in ICT firms. Yet, whatever the ICT environment, findings show that young workers are paid below and older workers above their marginal productivity. This pattern is in line with the deferred payment model developed by Lazear (J Polit Econ 87:1261–1284, 1979)." .

Existing theories of the firm—whether a “goal paradigm” or an “exchange paradigm”—provide useful insights; but we find them incomplete because they miss the extent to which companies build unique and meaningful constitutional orders. Building on Vanberg (Const Polit Econ 3(2):223–253, 1992), we investigate the extent to which the field of constitutional political economy (CPE) can improve our understanding of organisations, by providing a typology of CPE that can be applied to a study of firms. We make a distinction among (1) operational; (2) institutional; and (3) constitutional levels of management, and based on the CPE literature argue that “constitutional” considerations help us to define the boundaries of a firm and its operational environment." .

The final product eroded the guidelines’ original severity, as drafts were rejected over a period of 4 years. The initial goal of the Commission was to implement organizational guidelines that were on par with individual-level sanctions in order to remove any suggestion that powerful corporations receive lesser penalties than individuals convicted of “street crimes”. This study analyzes the erosion of the Commission’s stated goal by evaluating the organizational structures, individual and group characteristics, and the social, political, economic, and historical contexts involved in the evolution of federal sentencing guidelines for organizations. Results indicate that, while structural-level variables played a large part in explaining the development of the guidelines, a more accurate and complete understanding of this process is possible by including an analysis of the individual-level characteristics of Commissioners, including their professional backgrounds, ideological perspectives, styles of leadership, and future goals." .

Interest in the economic analysis of unions was revived in the early 1980s, in large part by a paper by Ian McDonald and Robert Solow, which formalized ideas first expressed in the context of labour markets 35 years earlier by Wassily Leontief. The standard textbook model of the labour union treats the union as a conventional monopoly seller of labour, selecting the wage while the firm chooses the level of employment; McDonald & Solow, however, drew from Leontief’s work to suggest an alternative in which the firm and union negotiate to a Pareto efficient contract. Further theoretical work followed, and a still-growing empirical literature began to develop; a wide variety of empirical procedures and tests have been attempted, with a diverse and contradictory range of findings. Given the importance of the question of union contract efficiency, an up-to-date survey of the literature may be useful in synthesizing past results and pointing the way to future research, and it is this role which the current paper will attempt to fill." .

Data were collected from 142 Foundations in Portugal, which represents 50.9% of the Portuguese foundational sector. Supported by a Structural Equation Model (SEM), this study evaluates cause–effect relationship between Voluntary Disclosure, Board Structure, Organizations’ Characteristics and the existence of Auditing. Findings reveal that Organizations’ Characteristics influence the forms of Auditing, and on its turn, Auditing has a positive indirect impact on Voluntary Disclosure. Contrary to expectations, Board Structure does not affect Voluntary Disclosure.

The model of enterprise privatization in Croatia resulted with a large involvement of employees in the enterprises' ownership. As the first phase of privatization in Croatia is approaching to its end, new, genuine mechanisms of development of the employee financial participation are beginning to emerge. Among them, ESOP plans and management and employee buyouts (MEBO) seem to be most appealing. Such practices can be found primarily in enterprises where a functional symbiosis between management and employees has been preserved or developed, where assets of the enterprise have also been preserved, and an organizational culture based on identification with enterprise and confidence with management has been developed. It seems that such a mutual reliance between employees and management can be very successful in assuring good operation and financial results of (especially large) enterprises during and after the process of transition." .

By comparison, the choice of diversification mode for Chinese listed firms is largely based on organizational rationality motivation (to reduce company risks) and individual rationality motivation (in the self-serving interests of the top management). Meanwhile, such conditioning factors as company size, ownership structure, age of being listed, and the industry in which a company is all have significant effects on the choice and degree of diversification for Chinese listed firms." .

Existing literature on limited selections of well-established watershed-based organizations has provided valuable insights. The current research extends this focus by including a broad survey of watershed organizations from across the United States as a means to estimate a national portrait. Organizational characteristics include year of formation, membership size and composition, budget, guiding principles, and mechanisms of decision-making. These characteristics and the issue concerns of organizations are expected to vary with respect to location. Because this research focuses on organizations that are place based and stakeholder driven, the forces driving them are expected to differ across regions of the country. On this basis of location, we suggest basic elements for a regional assessment of watershed organizations to channel future research and to better approximate the organizational dynamics, issue concerns, and information needs unique to organizations across the country. At the broadest level, the identification of regional patterns or organizational similarities may facilitate the linkage among organizations to coordinate their actions at the much broader river basin or ecosystem scale." .

Increasing worker utilization may improve productivity in the system in the short run but at the cost of welfare of workers. This will negatively affect the capability of an organization to innovate, which is harmful for it in the long run. Hence, it becomes essential to take care of the welfare of both the employees and the organization simultaneously. An innovative model has been developed for a manufacturing system in lean environment to examine the current ‘welfare’ state which is considered as a combination of a set of welfare parameters for both the employees and the organization. Subsequently, a set of flexibility parameters have been identified and their respective impacts on the current ‘welfare’ state observed. The model has been tested with the help of an Indian case study which revealed a positive impact of flexibility." .

In contrast to Lazear’s assumptions, however, self-employed individuals do not just need more basic but also more expert skills than employees. Our results also provide rather limited support for the idea that human capital investment patterns differ between those who become self-employed and those ending up in paid employment." .

The way organizations learn to use new forms of technology has been widely researched. However, many public sector organisations have found themselves in new territory in trying to deploy and integrate this new form of technology (big data) to another fast moving and relatively new concept (smart city). This paper is a cross-sectional scoping study—from two UK smart city initiatives—on the learning processes experienced by elite (top management) stakeholders in the advent and adoption of these two novel concepts. The findings are an experiential narrative account on learning to exploit big data to address issues by developing solutions through smart city initiatives. The findings revealed a set of moves in relation to the exploration and exploitation of big data through smart city initiatives: (a) knowledge finding; (b) knowledge reframing; (c) inter-organization collaborations and (d) ex-post evaluations. Even though this is a time-sensitive scoping study it gives an account on a current state-of-play on the use of big data in public sector organizations for creating smarter cities. This study has implications for practitioners in the smart city domain and contributes to academia by operationalizing and adapting Crossan et al’s (Acad Manag Rev 24(3): 522–537, 1999) 4I model on organizational learning." .

This has lead to a situation where the amount of resources and knowledge needed in the development of new offerings has become overwhelming for a single organization. Consequently, nowadays organizations—both commercial and non-commercial—are performing research and development activities in networks consisting of multiple types of actors. This is also the case in industries developing new services for consumers’ mobile handhelds. This paper introduces a network view to new mobile service development and argues that a thorough understanding of acting in the network environment is a pre-requisite for successful mobile service creation.

It fills a gap in the literature on CSR and legitimacy that lacks empirical studies regarding the question whether CSR contributes to organisational legitimacy. The problem is discussed by referring to the case of De Beers’s diamond mining partnership with the Government of Namibia. A total of 42 interviews were conducted—41 with stakeholders and one with the focal organisation Namdeb. The 41 stakeholder interviews are analysed with regard to cognitive, pragmatic and moral legitimacy as defined by Suchman (Acad Manage Rev 20(3):571–610, 1995). The main finding is that the majority of statements on organisational legitimacy refer to moral legitimacy and most issues raised in this context challenge the company’s legitimacy despite its comprehensive CSR engagement. The study demonstrates that legitimacy gaps can be a result of communication practices that raise unrealistic stakeholder expectations and that the legitimacy gained by CSR engagement in one area cannot substitute legitimacy losses caused by failures in another." .

There has been a parallel increase in literature, both pro and con, comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of private and public prisons; however, private prison staff has been largely ignored. OLS regression analysis of a survey of 160 employees at a Midwestern private prison facility showed that the job characteristics of job stress, supervision, and job variety were far more important than personal characteristics of race/ethnicity, gender, age, tenure, education and position in influencing staff job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Specifically, job stress had the largest impact on job satisfaction, while quality of supervision had the greatest impact on organizational commitment." .

Owing to the inherent imprecision and fuzziness of the matrix, the fuzzy linear regression (FLR) is gradually applied into QFD to establish it. However, with regard to an FLR model, the h value is a critical parameter whose setting is always an aporia and it is commonly determined by decision makers. To a certain extent, this subjective assignment fades the effectiveness of FLR in the application of QFD. Aiming to this problem, FLR models with optimized parameters h obtained by maximizing system credibility are introduced into QFD in this paper, in which relationship coefficients are assumed as asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Moreover, a systematic approach is developed to identify the relationship matrix in QFD, whose application is demonstrated through a packing machine example. The final results show that FLR models with optimized h values can always achieve a more reliable relationship matrix. Besides, a comparative study on symmetric and asymmetric cases is elaborated detailedly." .

Primary data was obtained (in 1995 and again in 2001) via a self-administered mail questionnaire distributed to a census of these top 500 Australian companies. This commitment of each company to their code of ethics was indicated and measured via a range of methods used by organizations to communicate the ethos of their codes to employees. Just as they were in 1995, it would appear that companies in 2001 still are good at ensuring that their rights are protected, but at the same time they do not seem to take on the responsibility to ensure that employees' rights are just as well protected. This double standard leads to cynicism towards the current business ethics processes inherent in Australian companies." .

Subjects were 105 male and female faculty and staff members (89.5% Caucasian; 5.7% multiethnic/multicultural; 4.8% unspecified) employed by a midwestern university who reported experiencing unwanted sexual attention on the job. Results undicated that employees responded more strongly to unwanted sexual behavior if they perceived it as sexual harassment and if they perceived their work climate as encouraging the problem. Harassed employees' gender, power, and perceptions of the work climate were all associated with their satisfaction with the situation outcome. Although making a formal or informal complaint was not associated with greater satisfaction, talking to the harasser without using aggressive communication strategies increased the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome for the employee. Talking to family or friends, a response used by women more often than men, was associated with dissatisfaction. Suggestions for further research are discussed." .

Today, however, policy makers increasingly start to look at institutional frameworks for protecting whistleblowers and responding to their concerns. This article focuses on the latter by exploring the roles that trade unions might adopt in order to improve responsiveness in the whistleblowing process. Research has consistently demonstrated that the two main reasons that deter people from reporting perceived wrongdoing are fear of retaliation and a belief that the wrongdoing is unlikely to be rectified. In this article, we argue that trade unions have an important part to play in dealing with both these inhibiting factors but this requires them to be appropriately engaged in the whistleblowing process and willing to take a more proactive approach to negotiations. We use Vandekerckhove’s 3-tiered whistleblowing model and Kaine’s model of union voice level to structure our speculative analysis of the various ways in which trade unions can interact with whistleblowers and organisations they raise concerns about alleged wrongdoing in, as well as agents at a regulatory level. Our articulation of specific roles trade unions can play in the whistleblowing process uses examples from the UK as to how these trade union roles are currently linked to and embedded in employment law and whistleblowing regulation." .

Due to limitations in computational complexity, nearly all of these models have assumed a single, representative firm type. Very few have systematically investigated the implications of markets with a variety of firm types. With increases in computing power and the advent of agent-based modeling, interactions between agent types can now be explored. In this paper, a computational model of innovative firms in competitive markets is presented. Firms devote resources to R&D which can lead to new, improved products allowing firms to steal market share from their competitors. Two types of firms, differentiated by the strategies they use in pursuing new innovations, are allowed to coexist. One type pursues exclusively radical innovations, while the other pursues exclusively incremental innovations. It will be demonstrated that under certain conditions, a synergy exists between firms of different types which allows heterogeneous populations of firms to earn more than homogeneous ones." .

The results show that effective environmental quality management depend to a considerable degree on the ability to deal with the multidisciplinary organizational, technical, social, and cultural issues involved in the integration of environmental cost accounting at the enterprise level. The study suggests that the tools and techniques of modern project management can provide an important framework for developing and implementing environmental quality control systems. The recommendations put considerable emphasis on the human side, focusing on the criteria under which environmental quality is best achievable. Strong senior management leadership, people skills, organizational linkages, and alliances, all are critical for dealing with the complexities of managing responsibly toward sustained developments in today’s organizations." .

I first used interview data collected in three Chinese cities as well as ethnographic case studies in the existing literature to illustrate a typology of the distribution of job search behavior, by focusing on the match between individual qualifications and employers’ hiring requirements. Based on data drawn from the 2003 China General Social Survey, the subsequent quantitative analysis confirms that neither the formal nor the informal job search channel dominates individual job search behaviors in practice. Rather, the formal-informal joint channel is used most frequently. Quantitative findings also show that competitive individual job seekers who possess both certifiable and non-certifiable qualifications are more likely to jointly use formal and informal job search methods. This study confirms that contact use plays a positive role in job searches, but very often in combination with the use of formal job search methods, rather than being used alone." .

What are their motivations to distribute Fair Trade products? How do they organise this distribution? Do they apply and communicate the Fair Trade values? This research, based on five case studies in Switzerland, aims at understanding and structuring the strategies and the managerial practices related to Fair Trade product distribution, as well as analysing if they denote an engagement with Fair Trade principles. The results show a high heterogeneity of strategies and engagement. In general, strategies implemented by mainstream actors contribute to increase Fair Trade global sales but do not convey the transformative message of Fair Trade through their engagement. The latter is rather communicated through alternative channels. Problems and potential solutions to this issue are discussed." .

Small to medium-sized firms are assumed to be more likely to adopt an entrepreneurial orientation when it is seen as a legitimate response and aligned with the normative, regulative and cognitive aspects of the institutions that make up the environment of the firm. This assumption is first supported by a review of the prescriptions of institutional theory regarding strategic choices available to firms and then tested through the analysis of a survey of 1621 firms from seven countries and multiple manufacturing and service industries. The findings of the research indicate that the choice of an entrepreneurial orientation may be significantly motivated by drives for legitimacy through alignment with the normative, regulative and cognitive forces in the institutional environment of the firm." .

This study uses in-depth interviews to explore the experiences of female professional chefs in order to understand how women in a prestigious, yet male-dominated service occupation manage barriers relating to their balance of work and family responsibilities. Conflict between work and family responsibilities often stemmed from the long work hours expected of chefs and played a role in some of our participant’s decisions to leave kitchen work. Respondents in this study negotiate work–family conflict using three strategies: (1) delaying/forgoing childbearing to succeed as a chef; (2) leaving kitchen work for another job in the culinary field; and (3) adapting either work or family to make the two roles more compatible. Our conclusion discusses the implications of these strategies for gender inequality in the workplace, particularly for women in male-dominated occupations." .

Unlike previous studies, our approach estimates union wage premiums considering differences in the rewards to education, experience, and other personal characteristics for union and non-union workers. The approach provides a larger estimated wage gap than the traditional approach, and allows for simulations of union–nonunion wage gaps for different types of workers. Moreover, we use an Oaxaca decomposition to explain the larger union–nonunion wage gap in the private sector in comparison to that in the public sector. We find that between 50% and 60% of the difference in union wage premiums between the private and public sectors is due to differences in the way unionized workers are rewarded in the private and public sectors, while the remaining portion is due to differences in personal characteristics of private and public sector workers." .

Although traditional analysis of why firms form collaborative research arrangements have tended to focus upon firm level variables, this study takes a broader view on antecedent factors. We derive hypotheses from resource dependence theory, market forces theory, and strategic behavior model explanations for such firm behavior. Panel data from 503 firms, in 104 industries from 1978 through 1996 were used to test the hypotheses. The decision to join a CRC was modeled using multivariate binomial probit analysis. Results showed that industry competitiveness, technological opportunities and the production of complementary innovations are all positively related to propensity to join a CRC. Slack resources are related to joining propensity in a non-linear fashion." .

To determine the relationship between managers' locus of control and their moral reasoning ability, this study considered three independent variables: reported organizational ethical climate, locus of control, and selected demographic and institutional variables. For a foundation, this researcher relied on Kohlberg's theory of moral development, Victor and Cullen's ethical work climate theory, and Rotter's theory of internal—external locus of control (which evolved from Carl Jung). The short form of Rest's DIT instrument measured the moral reasoning abilities of the participants. The selected demographic and institutional variables (age, work tenure, education, gender, management level and industry category) provided the useful information to investigate these relationships of moral reasoning ability of individual managers. A survey questionnaire was sent to 400 managerial and executive level employees at a random sample of Fortune 500 firms throughout the United States: Dun and Bradstreet provided the researcher with a proportional stratified random sample of these 400 managerial and executive level employees at a variety of organizations. Interestingly, women in this study exhibited slightly higher (more external) mean I—E scores and (more principled) higher mean “P” score than men. While both of these results were anticipated, neither was significant. However, one major finding of this study was the statistically significant relationship between age and perceived organizational ethical climate types (Caring, Law and Code, Rule, Instrument, and Independence). Another major finding revealed a statistically significant relationship between management levels and organizational ethical climate." .

One line of research that has been developed quite recently in this field is the application of endogenous switching regression models. In this paper we utilize such a model to investigate firm-size wage differentials in the Netherlands. The principal findings are that larger firms pay higher returns on schooling whereas smaller firms tend to reward IQ. Combined with the finding that high IQ-workers are sorted into the largest firms, the results are consistent with a model of job screening. Furthermore, we find that employed sons of self-employed fathers are more likely to work in small firms and that wage prospects for all types of workers are indeed most favorable in larger firms." .

Creative destruction through innovation results in “Schumpeterian unemployment” of unskilled workers. By voting on firing costs, unskilled workers consider a trade-off between the benefit of fewer unemployment spells and the cost of lower quality growth of consumer goods. Skilled workers, although not threatened by unemployment, may vote for even larger firing costs. Alleviating one labor market rigidity by increasing the matching efficiency between firms and unskilled workers aggravates another rigidity by creating political support for additional firing costs." .

This paper addresses three questions. Why do people make charitable gifts? Why do they usually give to non-profit organisations? When can non-profits run by committed ideologues compete with profit-oriented entrepreneurs in the provision of services? the altruistic motives of individuals and the ideological commitments of entrepreneurs come together to support charitable organisations. The non-profit form provides a weak guarantee that gifts are not being syphoned off as profits. Furthermore, independent non-profits can often better reflect donors' desires than public agencies constrained by majoritarian claims, and ideological entrepreneurs can use the non-profit form to reify their beliefs without being accountable to profit-seeking investors. A non-profit organisation can only survive, however, if it can attract money and customers. Sometimes its ideological character will facilitate both tasks. Non-ideological customers may, nevertheless, patronise an ideological non-profit if the entrepreneur's commitment helps to guarantee high quality." .

Test services for external customers are provided to generate additional budget, and there may be a clear awareness about the need for systematic QA/QC actions. However, offering services is not of the highest priority within most university environments. The staff performance is commonly evaluated on basis of published papers and teaching activities, giving little or no weight for the test services. Therefore, implementation of a quality system is often pushed back to a lower priority leading to postponement. The efforts for creating a quality system in a laboratory from a Brazilian university are described in this paper, along with the results produced." .

Even if the high diffusion of SMEs has positively affected the performance of Italian economy during the seventies and the eighties, the new trends of technological change and global competition are expected to be unfavourable to this category of enterprises in the nineties. The analyses of a significant sample of firms makes clear that the industry is in the middle of a positive restructuring process. The structure of this sector shows a division of labour based on deverticalization of production, and a process of internationalization focused on exports and not on direct investments or joint ventures abroad. Leading firms are following growth strategies by new investments and acquisitions. Finally, as far as technological change is concerned, there is a significant increase of process innovations, thanks to the use of electronic components." .

Employers who harass, pass over for promotion, and even terminate workers because they care for children, elderly parents or spouses, or disabled family members have been sued with more frequency and have been paying increasing amounts in verdicts. Recently, the EEOC took an important step toward ending this discrimination by issuing enforcement guidelines that will educate employers and employees about family responsibilities discrimination and caregivers’ rights and responsibilities. The Guidelines explain how federal equal employment opportunity laws apply to workers who struggle to balance work and family, and what firms can do to avoid potential legal problems and accompanying liabilities with respect to family responsibilities and caregiving discrimination." .

The risks to e-business from breaches of security and privacy are well known. However, research has given very little attention to other important e-business risks. Using a socio-technical approach, in this study we survey a diverse sample of almost 200 participants to rate their perception of 16 e-business risks, compiled from the research and practitioner literature. Strategic risks, organizational risks and e-business policy risks emerged as the three underlying dimensions of e-business risk. In terms of the socio-technical model, strategic risks focus on the actor-structure component, and policy risks focus on the task-structure component. Organizational risks cover a wide spectrum of socio-technical components such as technology, actor-technology, technology structure and task-actor. The main contribution of this study is a multi dimensional scale of e-business risk perception. Practitioners can benefit by focusing their risk management efforts on the three dimensions of e-business risk, which are easier to manage than a long checklist of unrelated risks. Researchers benefit from a raised awareness on the importance of strategic and organizational risk factors in addition to policy risk factors for e-business risk management. A model that incorporates the three dimensions of e-business risks and shows theoretically based relationships with control mechanisms, trust, perceived uncertainty and profitability is proposed for testing in future research." .

The use of biospecimens is strictly controlled by ethical assessment, which complies with the laws of the country. These laws regulate the partnerships between the biobanks and industrial actors. However, private–public partnerships (PPP) can be limiting for several reasons, which can hamper the discovery of new biological tests and new active molecules targeted to human diseases. The bottlenecks and roadblocks in establishing these partnerships include: poor organization of the biobank in setting up PPP, evaluation of the cost of human samples, the absence of experience on the public side in setting up contracts with industry, and the fact that public and private partners may not share the same objectives. However, it is critical, in particular for academic biobanks, to establish strong PPP to accelerate translational research for the benefits of patients, and to allow the sustainability of the biobank.

In a model where firms first choose qualities and then prices, we find that quality decisions have strategic effects: firms react to quality disadvantages by price reductions. Because of this strategic effect, firms do not have the correct incentive to set socially efficient quality levels. Price and quality competition results in a socially suboptimal quality level. Efficiency can be restored by lump-sum transfers and price regulatory policies. Simple price regulation may result in lower price and higher quality." .

The literature in marketing focusing on the marketing strategy implications of product characteristics and customer characteristics is vast and extensive, spanning several decades. During the past four decades, literature insights from the fields of economics and management have contributed to enhancing our understanding of the marketing strategy implications of industry characteristics and firm characteristics, respectively. While the marketing strategy implications of product characteristics generalize to all competitors of a specific product offering, the marketing strategy implications of firm characteristics are idiosyncratic to individual competitors. Competing businesses strive to achieve and sustain defensible competitive positional advantages in the marketplace by effectively leveraging their organizational capabilities to deploy firm resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and/or non-substitutable. In effect, heterogeneity in resources and capabilities manifest as heterogeneity in the business and marketing strategies of competitors. A likely consequence of heterogeneity in organizational capabilities is differences among competitors in their quality of understanding the marketing strategy implications of product characteristics and, in turn, their marketing strategies informed by the distinctive characteristics of the product offering. Against this backdrop, this article explores the relative influence of product characteristics and firm characteristics on a business’s marketing strategy and the moderating effect of firm characteristics." .

The mean decomposition reveals that as much as 55 % of the caste earnings gap could be attributed to the unexplained component. Quantile regressions suggest that gaps are higher at lower deciles, providing some evidence of a sticky floor. Finally, quantile decompositions reveal that the unexplained component is greater at the lower and middle deciles than higher, suggesting that SCST-owned businesses at the lower and middle end of the conditional earnings distribution face greater discrimination." .

In a traditional retail environment, the reputation value of a brand name leads profitable firms with established brands to work hard to maintain quality. A store may rely on its reputation to signal that its goods are of high quality. A retailer that expects repeated purchases by a consumer – if it provides high-quality products – has a strong incentive not to provide defective products or poor service. Translating this type of quality assurance into digital sales media poses unique challenges, particularly for small businesses. Retailers that have only a local geographic reputation require innovative strategies to convince a potential global market that the products or services they provide are of appropriate quality when they make the move into electronic commerce retailing. This paper provides a model that identifies a number of unique factors that should be considered when estimating the optimal level of investment into an e-commerce initiative. Decisions of this type are particularly difficult for small businesses because they may lack expertise in digital marketing and sales and they may have insufficient resources required for ideal levels of investment. These constraints have led to some creative cost and risk minimizing solutions that have been adopted by certain small businesses in their effort to make the transition into the digital marketplace." .

Firstly, it maps the existing EU level security strategies, their accompanying action plans and implementation reports in order to identify and critically asses the prevailing conceptual frameworks – public-private partnerships and resilience – evoked by EU policy-makers when it comes to the contributions of the private sector in the provision of security. Secondly, it explores a hitherto overlooked conceptual framework for analyzing the contributions of private businesses in the provision of security in the EU (and beyond): political corporate social responsibility. Thirdly, it surveys the key challenges of the growing role of private businesses in the provision of security (responsibilization, depoliticization, and commodification) which are important reminders that no matter what conceptual framework one prefers, the engagement of private businesses in the provision of security is always bound to raise a number of profound dilemmas. This in turn implies the need for (re-)consideration of the more traditional regulatory frameworks in order to safeguard important public goods and/or values." .

Many major e-commerce businesses have begun to leverage the platform to co-create with customers in new product development (NPD), in anticipation of new products that are more innovative and sell better. Yet, empirical evidence for the impact of customer co-creation is still scarce. This study investigates the impact by distinguishing among different co-creation tasks (idea co-creation and decision co-creation) and NPD stages (product design and commercialization). Based on the co-creation and innovation literature, it is hypothesized that idea co-creation has a stronger impact when there is also decision co-creation. Further, co-creation in the product design stage is expected to have a stronger effect on product innovativeness, while co-creation in the commercialization stage has a stronger effect on product sales. The hypotheses were tested with data on 107 actual products. Looking beyond a homogenous conceptualization of co-creation enhances our understanding of how it influences different aspects of new product success. This is also one of the earliest studies to report empirical evidence for the impact of customer co-creation in e-commerce. The findings offer specific insights into the co-creation tasks and NPD stages to open for customer co-creation in practice." .

It is shown that a possible outcome of the wage bargaining is the wage level where all insiders keep their job, but no outsiders are taken on. In this situation, small variations in the bargaining situation of the union will not affect the wage and employment outcome. Furthermore, it may even be the case that the union does not wish a higher wage, because this would lead to lay-offs among the insiders. Thus, the monopoly union model and the bargaining model may yield the same wage and employment levels." .

The authors give several arguments in support of their position that the benefits outweigh the costs of such a procedure for unorganized staff whether viewed in terms of society, the employee, or the labor market parties. Next the article briefly summarizes the empirical literature reporting on the operation of nonunion grievance procedures in a number of private-sector firms. These results are linked to the two conceptual models of an effective grievance procedure advanced by Yenney and Epstein. The authors, based on their assessment of organizational practice, identify several potential and real problems with the presently operating nonunion grievance systems in most American firms. Finally, the article concludes with a set of research propositions that systematically address both the current criticisms of the viability of such a procedure and whether most grievance procedures covering unorganized employees meet the standards of due process and organizational justice generally found in union grievance systems." .

It was developed by UN Global Compact, GRI and WBCSD. The SDG Compass focusses on large corporations and offers them a framework and method to translate the SDGs to their business. The SDG framework, with the goals and the implementation method, only partially meets the criteria of a hands-on and actionable tool. Much attention is being paid to external motivators instead of focusing on tangible business impact. Currently, prioritization of themes that matter most for European SMEs is not possible. Tools to link the SDGs with the business processes of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises or SMEs do not exist. SMEs lack resources, experience and incentives to implement sustainability in their daily management but their potential contribution to sustainable development is large. In this article we show how the SDGs can be linked bottom-up to the Sustatool, a practical PDCA-based management tool that offers SMEs the opportunity to implement sustainability in their daily practices. We have prioritized the SDGs that SMEs can impact most. We make SDG targets material by linking them to concrete actions in the thematic catalogue." .

The major function of cross-organizational ERP solutions is to coordinate work in two or more organizations. However, how to align ERP application components and business requirements for coordination and cooperation is hardly known. This paper reports on the outcomes of applying a coordination theory perspective to an analysis of the ERP misalignment problem. We present a conceptual framework for analyzing coordination and cooperation requirements in inter-organizational ERP projects. The framework makes explicit the undocumented built-in assumptions for coordination and cooperation that may have significant implications for the ERP adopters and incorporates a library of existing coordination mechanisms supported by modern ERP systems. We use it to develop a proposal for how to achieve a better alignment between ERP implementations and supported business coordination processes in inter-organizational settings. We report on some early assessments of the implications of our framework for practicing requirements engineers. Both our framework and library rest on a literature survey and the first author’s experience with ERP implementation. In future empirical research, we will further validate and refine our framework." .

We use Community Innovation Survey data on 3,696 Italian manufacturing firms. In line with our model we find that members of a group of firms invest significantly more into product, process, and aggregate R&D than independent firms. Further, their R&D portfolios tend to show a higher product versus process ratio. However, with regard to R&D performance and efficiency we find that independent firms are superior." .

In total, 220 men and 125 women working in high-level jobs in a large multinational organization completed a written questionnaire. Using hierarchical regression analyses, and controlling for differences between men and women in age, the presence of children, and number of working hours, we found no significant gender differences in the 3 work attitudes. The results further show that although career salience, job involvement, and organizational commitment increase with age, these work attitudes decrease with professional tenure. In terms of organizational commitment, the negative influence of professional tenure was significantly stronger for women than for men. Finally, the implications for future studies and for organizational practice are discussed." .

Comparable compensation is not otherwise available in the U.S. to workers displaced by technology. Nine pairs of arguments are presented to show how fundamentally management and labor disagree about a company's responsibility for its former employees. These arguments, born of years of labor-management debate, are kaleidoscopic claims about which side has what power. Ultimately, however, not even both together can solve without creative public intervention the emerging problem of massive technological unemployment — the other side of the corporate dream of profit without payrolls." .

The mean work load was 90 Watt in men and 60 Watt in women, the amplitudes being 50 and 30 Watt respectively. Nine different frequencies were used, the periods varying from 0.5 to 15.0 min. By means of harmonic analysis, the fundamental components in the response of the heart rate have been shown to prevail over the 2nd and 3rd harmonics, indicating a mainly linear behaviour of the control system in the work-load range studied. A comparison of the frequency response of untrained males and females observed in this study and of trained sportsmen, investigated by Wigertz (1970), reveals differences between the groups. The individual and ensemble mean frequency responses have been described by several transfer functions, the best fit having been obtained with functions containing two time constants including one with a highly damped oscillating element. The dominating dynamic parameter is a time constant of about 20 to 30 sec. This time constant tends to be shorter and its portion of the frequency response diminishes in order from the untrained females and males to the trained sportsmen. The individual time constant decreases as the PWC170 increases, and is therefore a suitable criterion for estimating the physical performance of individuals under dynamic conditions." .

Both the number of actors involved, as well as the importance of the technological activity carried out abroad, has considerably increased. We aim to quantify the international generation of knowledge for the case of Belgium, using indicators based on EPO and USPTO patent data (1978-2001). We distinguish among Belgian applicants, affiliates of foreign firms located in Belgium as well as Belgian based firms with affiliates abroad. This approach allows to improve existing indicators of internationalisation of technology based on patent data. The results are consistent with what can be expected for a small open economy as Belgium. A large part of patents with Belgian inventors are assigned to Belgian affiliates of foreign firms. Hence our more complete indicator of foreign ownership gives a substantially higher foreign control of Belgian inventors. Relatively more knowledge generated by Belgian inventors flows out of the country towards foreign owners of technology, than that knowledge generated abroad is owned by Belgian patent applicants. But the share of foreign inventors to Belgian assigned patents is considerably increasing over time, especially in the subcategory of Belgian firms with foreign affiliates." .

Our evidence suggests that the skill level and skill scope matter for balance and increase with formal education levels but decrease with the number of previous occupations. We find a positive relationship between skill balance and income that is strongest for entrepreneurs. For employees, the relationship remains positive but the magnitude of the association decreases when business size increases." .

The following study intends to show that it is possible to find a balance between happiness and work (Csikszentmihalyi in Gestão qualificada: a conexão entre felicidade e negócio, Bookman, Porto Alegre, 2004), by diagnosing the level of happiness shown by people in their working environment’s, proposing solutions to enhance happiness and productive in certain enterprise’s staff (Tidd and Bessant in Innovation and entrepreneurship, Wiley, London, 2007; Gestão da Inovação, Bookman, Porto Alegre, 2008). It is necessary, hence, an analysis beyond the happy-unhappy dichotomy when observing the different happiness levels presented in the routine and in the working hours, based on the interactions between creativity and innovation (Amabile in KEYS to creativity and innovation: user’s guide, Center For Creative Leadership, Greensboro, 2010; Sawyer in Explaining creativity: the science of human innovation, 2nd edn, Oxford University Press, Cambridge, 2012; West and Richter in Handbook of organizational creativity, 1st edn, Taylor and Francis, New York, 2008). Furthermore, this article shows that it is essential to combine the present’s happiness to a long-term project, an optimistic vision for the future (James and Drown in Handbook of organizational creativity, 1st edn, Elsevier, San Diego, 2012). To evaluate the work and a person’s life, this article develops a Multi Criteria Model of Work Organization and Evaluation and a Map of the Corporate Happiness Levels as a conscious path through workplace, collaboration in the enterprise, the marketplace and society, up to the personal and social life of a subject (Kamel in Artesão da minha própria felicidade, 1st edn. E-papers Serviços Editoriais Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, 2007). It offers ten practical recommendations to raise corporation rates of happiness. Accordingly, this paper proves its relevance by offering reference material to professionals and enterprises who search changes in its current personal management policy, willing to move towards a society with increasingly fulfilled professionals, happy and productive in their own employment." .

Case characteristics, classification of conduct unbecoming, proposed discipline, arbitrator behavior, reasons for reversing management’s penalty other than conduct unbecoming, procedural outcomes and findings were analyzed. The frequency of the finding for the employer was actually higher for police than for the nonpolice cases. Managerial actions that resulted in reversing the disciplinary penalty were not as suggested by the literature. Multivariate analyses of the case characteristics led to the conclusion that police discipline may have been distinctive from nonpolice public employee discipline in the past, but is no longer so distinctive." .

Thus, a structured approach is needed to identify, prioritize and evaluate risks in CRM projects. This helps project managers of CRM implementation to find out how to treat such risks. The nature of CRM is multi-dimensional, and it is one of the most complicated innovations in organizations. In this paper, because of multi-dimensional nature of CRM projects, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used to evaluate CRM risk factors based on active project managers’ judgments as experts in organizations which sale CRM software or provide service and consult in Iran. The analyses are performed by the judgments of CRM experts using a questionnaire including 49 pair-wise comparisons. In Iranian organizations, based on experts’ judgments, in the first life cycle phases of CRM, “changes in the stakeholders and top management” has the highest importance among risk factors in CRM projects. According to our experts’ beliefs, management permanence is one of the most important factors for IS projects failure in Iran which is resulted from Iranian organizations’ culture. In the next life cycle phases of CRM, the risk factors such as general factors of classification “dynamic assessment and monitoring” have the lowest priority." .

Additionally, accounting academics have recently been questioned as to their commitment to accounting ethics education (Gunz and McCutcheon, 1998). The current study examines whether accounting students' perceptions of business ethics and the goals of accounting ethics education are fundamentally different from the perceptions of accounting faculty members. The study uses a survey instrument to elicit student and faculty responses to various questions concerning the importance of business ethics and accounting ethics education. Statistical analyses indicate that students consider both business ethics and the goals of accounting ethics education to be more important than faculty members. Implications of these results for accounting faculty members interested in accounting ethics education are discussed." .

Nine sectors are considered, comprising the total enterprises sector. For this total enterprises sector an (amended) clay-clay vintage model is also (re-)estimated. The results indicate that in the process of adjustments, real labour costs are the strategic variable, though capacity utilization is also recognized as a factor affecting employment directly and indirectly. Projections of employment with the macro vintage model are satisfactory. Specifically, they are more satisfactory than the extrapolations for either manufacturing or non-manufacturing taken separately, and the macro projections compete fairly well with those based on an overall aggregation of employment projections over all nine sectors considered." .

We propose a structuring for the negotiation that captures two main features: First, we take into account that the supplier can strategically change its production facilities. The impact of this strategic decision is captured by the corresponding change of the supplier's cost situation. Second, we consider the uncertainty about the retailer's future demand due to its own customers. The negotiation takes place with respect to different demand scenarios, yielding a variety of possibilities of avoiding negotiation deadlocks." .

These regulations, based on both total quality management (TQM) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) principles, reshaped the environment for more than 90% of laboratories. CLIA'88 represented a revolutionary change by imposing universal, uniform regulations based on test complexity for all sites examining materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA'88 specifies minimum requirements for personnel, quality control, and proficiency testing (PT). In addition, laboratories are required to follow manufacturers' directions and comply with other specified good laboratory practices. PT is mandated for most of the frequently run analyses and quality assurance requirements integrate the principles of CQI as well as TQM into the regulatory process. Biannual inspection is integral to CLIA'88, however, laboratories can choose other federally approved (\"deemed\") professional organizations, such as the Commission on Office Laboratory Accreditation, the College of American Pathologists, or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization, having standards that meet or exceed those of CLIA'88. CLIA'88 has still not been finalized. This article discusses the impact and changes since CLIA's implementation in 1992." .

Drawing from the strategic leaning perspective on adaptation, this study investigates how the nature of inter-organizational ties among top management impact the cost and the effectiveness of an organizational level change process. To build on the existing empirical work in this area, this study employs a virtual experiment to create a controlled laboratory investigation of the hypothesized relationships among the strength, formalization, and functional equivalence of network ties; and the cost and effectiveness of an organizational change process. The findings of this study provide support for the strength of weak ties argument and structural hole theory, in addition to suggesting a caveat to Galbraith's information processing model. Furthermore, the results reveal that the tradeoff between increasing effectiveness and decreasing costs is not universally applicable across all decisions regarding network structure." .

By creating inter-organizational business-ICT alignment between the actors in the constellation, e 3 alignment ultimately contributes to a sustainable and profitable constellation. To actually create alignment, e 3 alignment iteratively takes three specific steps: (1) identification of alignment issues, (2) solution design, and (3) impact analysis.

Today businesses are interacting and collaborating more often in the context of a business value chain involving a variety of partners to deliver products and services. Business to business (B2B) connectivity, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and general business collaboration processes are becoming more critical in operating and managing efficient enterprises. The required level of inter and intra enterprise integration is generally a large undertaking and involves substantial development and customization efforts. In this paper, we propose an adaptive integration activity management approach based on web services technologies to reduce code changes associated with business process integration in a distributed collaboration environment. Specifically, we present a concept of activity chain to capture non-deterministic process flows as well as deterministic process flows in a uniform manner. Then an Activity Ontology is introduced to capture the integration requirements that include adaptation behaviors, action properties, business rules, and access control policy references. The unique ontology representation and management of the integration activities provides a uniform way to integrate additional internal and external business applications to reduce the need for pre-defined and hard-wired integration methods and to minimize code changes to existing components in an existing business collaboration and integration (B2B/EAI) infrastructure. In addition, a Petri-Net modeling exercise of the proposed integration activity management is performed to help better understand the actual system and improve the system design beforehand." .

In this paper, we study the effects of two commonly observed subsidy systems on the strategic behavior of competing firms. We compare a per unit subsidy to a subsidy allocated according to the firms’ market shares. We show that, holding the total subsidy budget constant, the per unit subsidy results in lower prices, higher output, lower profits and higher overall welfare as compared to the market-share based alternative. However, we also find that a market-share based subsidy makes collusive behavior between firms much harder. Our results suggest a potential trade-off between short-run and long-run objectives: subsidy systems designed to widen participation may favor collusive behavior. The welfare implications of this trade-off are discussed. Our findings have important policy implications for the design of subsidy systems." .

This strategy enables the carrier to deny boarding of economy-class passengers in an event of a high show-up of business-class (high-paying) passengers by simply enlarging the business-class section at the expense of the economy-class section (and of course, the other way around, in a case of a low show-up of business passengers). This paper develops a simple method of computing a profit-maximizing reservation policy which determines the number of business- and economy-class bookings taking into account that the adjustable-curtain strategy will be utilized prior to boarding." .

These two roles highlight the need to recognize and consider both the ethical and economic implications of their decisions. Practicing industry accountants are commonly involved in a broad range of their firm’s business practices and decision making, and are increasingly exposed to the commercial aspects of their companies. Also, during their education, they were trained on their professional responsibilities. However, in general, this education was not recent and may not have been reinforced. By contrast, accounting students have been recently and repeatedly exposed to and have knowledge about their professional responsibilities as an accountant, but limited, if any, exposure to the commercial aspects of business. Consequently, our first hypothesis predicts that the ethical sensitivity of practicing industry accountants will be lower than that of accounting students. We find limited support for this hypothesis. Second, we also examine company reward structure and predict that ethical sensitivity will be lower for those in a company with a reward structure narrowly focused only on financial goals as compared to those in a company with a broad reward structure (e.g., including rewards for both financial and non-financial goals). Third, we predict that the difference in ethical sensitivity levels between those in a company with a narrow reward structure as compared to those in a company with a broad financial reward structure will be higher for practicing industry accountants compared to accounting students. Results from our study generally support these last two predictions. Ethical sensitivity is lower for those in a company with a reward structure narrowly focused only on financial goals as compared to those in a company with a broad reward structure, suggesting that companies may be able to increase ethical awareness in their organizations by including non-financial goals in their reward structures." .

We also show the implications of entry of non-innovating firms and endogenous probability of success in patent applications." .

Thus, patent analysis is important for defining business strategies and supporting decision-making in organizations. However, patent analysis can involve vast data sets and are difficult to analyze. The purpose of this study is to apply artificial immune system hybrid collaborative filtering to build a patent quality classification model. We apply the model to predicting the quality of radio frequency identification patents. Using a simple definition of quality, we define each patent’s data as an antigen and then compute the affinities of the target patent to all immune networks. If the affinity is larger than a given threshold, the antibody is cloned to the related immune network. After the immune networks are constructed, they exhibit high affinity to the target patent. Finally, a series of experiments show that the proposed model can accurately predict the quality of new patents. The resulting automatic patent quality classification model provides manufacturers with improved insights into their company’s intellectual property strategy, product direction and long-term vision." .

We compare the impact of these two forms of customer returns on the decisions and profits of the manufacturer and the retailer under various types of channel interaction: Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS), Vertical Nash (VN), and Retailer Stackelberg (RS). We find that when the level of customer returns that are proportional to quantity sold is extremely high, the retailer prefers the MS rather than the RS channel interaction. We also examine the impact of the asymmetric customer returns information on the decisions of the manufacturer and the retailer and on profits under MS and VN channel interactions. We show that in the MS case, the retailer can decide whether or not to share customer returns information with its manufacturer without knowing the manufacturer’s estimates of customer returns and in the VN case, both the retailer and the manufacturer can decide whether or not to share/acquire the information based on observation of the other’s behavior. The issues of sharing this information are also discussed." .

Over the years an independent European Accreditation system has been developed, which many member states of the European Union have joined. The existing accreditation organizations joined to form the unified organization EA (European Cooperation for Accreditation) in 1997. Members of this organization are, inter alia, one representative of the accreditation authorities of each of the member states. The German accreditation system is different to the European system in that it is split. Here, we differentiate between the sector established by law and that which is not. Both sectors, however, pursue the same goal. Because of this double certification of competence and the resulting multiple reviews, German testing laboratories face a considerably greater load in comparison to their European colleagues. Several authorities are already working on the removal of this split accreditation system. The efforts must, however, be concentrated and brought into line. Efforts by the DAP and DACH for flexible accreditation and the creation of a standardized registration authority for testing laboratories in the field of workplace measures are examples of how the German accreditation system could develop in the future." .

Union densities have declined for nearly half a century, and structural and demographic changes, global competition, and various other factors have caused much of this decline. However, as recognized by early union leaders, legislative successes that diminish the role of collective bargaining naturally contribute to a diminished role for unions in the workplace and union decline must inevitably follow." .

We present results derived from an interrelated series of statistical analyses based on Private-to-Public Citations (PrPuCs) within reference lists of the research articles produced by industrial researchers during the years 1996-2003. The first part of the results provides an overview of PrPuC statistics worldwide for OECD countries. Overall, 70% to 80% of those references within corporate research papers relate to papers produced by public research organizations. When controlling for the size of their public sector research bases, Switzerland and the United States appear to be the major suppliers of 'citable' scientific knowledge for industrial research - the value of their Corporate Citation Intensity (CCI) exceeds their statistically expected value by more than 25%. A country's CCI performance turns out to be closely related to the citation impact of the entire domestic science base. The second section deals with an exploratory case study devoted to Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, one of the corporate sector's major research areas. The findings include a list of the major citing and cited sources at the level of countries and organizations, as well as an analysis of PrPuCs as a “missing link”connection intra-science citations and citations received from corporate science-based patents." .

We show for a homogeneous goods duopoly that the intuition can be misleading, as the intensity of price competition depends on the initial market split. We derive mixed-strategy equilibria, and show that competition is often most intense when the market is split evenly. As a result, firms coordinate on an asymmetric split when consumers are not yet attached to firms. We also allow for asymmetric costs, and analyze when firms with a larger customer base are more eager to innovate." .

Chief among these strategies has been “salting,” a process by which unions attempt to organize employees from the inside rather than the outside. The Supreme Court has ruled that, under the National Labor Relations Act, “salts” cannot be discriminated against solely on the basis of their status as salts. This paper examines employer responses to resist salting efforts, including a recent decision by the National Labor Relations Board, which redefines the landscape under which salting activities can be conducted and considered protected activity." .

However, no conclusive evidence currently exists as to how either of these strategies affects the performance of international sales. This paper contributes to a better understanding of geographic diversification as a key dimension of the internationalization process for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In it, we analyze a comprehensive database of Polish exporters over a 3-year period to better understand the geographic diversification patterns of exporters. Based on this analysis, six propositions emerged from the export patterns examined and two viable strategies for exporting SMEs are identified: (1) concentrating on a single market and (2) a balanced approach aimed at targeting a small number of key markets, combined with a strategy of penetrating other markets. Implications for practice and future research are also discussed herein." .

Since the eighties, several studies and reports have been made in an attempt to further the integration of safe working conditions into the design of fishing vessels. This paper presents various ergonomical interventions, performed on several very different projects: one industrial vessel, and smaller vessels built in co-operation with small firms. The ergonomical follow-up on the design and construction of a large halieutic research vessel was performed along standard principles: work analysis in typical situations, definition and simulation of possible future activity, and input from future users. The experience of work with smaller firms (when they were either the owner or the contractor) has shown the limitations of these principles. The difficulties were mainly related to the projects’ lack of structure (no specifications, no plans), the lack of availability of the different actors, and the lack of any real demand as far as safety was concerned." .

It was hypothesized that negative experiences downwardly moderated (i) the impact of the charity's internal market activities on satisfaction and commitment, and (ii) the influences of certain job attributes (autonomy, teamworking, and supervisory support) on these variables. Three personal characteristics (affect intensity, vulnerability to stress, and a person's reasons for having become a volunteer) were also posited to moderate the effects of negative experiences on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Linkages between the last two variables and a volunteer's desire to provide high-quality client services were explored. The results indicated strong connections between job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and a volunteer's personal commitment to providing high-quality services. Levels of organizational commitment were influenced positively and significantly by the charity's internal marketing activities and negatively by the number of unpleasant client-contact experiences that a volunteer had to endure." .

Role theory and grounded theory methods were used to explore the experience and the implications it had on how participants understood and managed their roles as mothers and pastors. The resulting model for role management through the process of negotiating maternity leave identifies and describes the causal conditions, contributing factors, experience of the phenomenon, and consequences. Major findings are that the most influential church factor seems to be the overall stability and organizational health of the congregation and its leadership and that a judicatory-level policy may be the only effective intervention in a difficult negotiation." .

Unfortunately, practice management education may be inadequate during anesthesiology residency training. The authors describe the design and implementation of a weekend retreat curriculum in business-of-medicine education for anesthesiology residents. Experts were recruited to discuss interviewing skills, contract law and negotiation, billing and reimbursement, insurance, malpractice, and financial planning. A strict lecture didactic format was avoided, and presentations were designed to encourage speaker–audience interaction. The program was relatively simple to design and implement, satisfied several Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education core competencies for US anesthesiology education, may be altered as practice management evolves, and may be adapted to accommodate the needs of programs in other countries." .

Supply Chain Management Information Systems (SCM IS) play an increasingly critical role in the ability of firms to reduce costs and increase the responsiveness of their supply chain. This paper develops an empirically supported model of the organizational capabilities enabled by SCM IS. The model integrates and enriches theoretical and empirical studies of competitive strategy, supply chain management, and interorganizational information systems. Evidence from an exploratory case study of three large firms in the electronics manufacturing industry is examined to build a better-supported theory of SCM IS capabilities. The findings suggest the organizational capabilities enabled by SCM IS can be conceptualized as the level of support provided for: operational efficiency; operational flexibility; internal planning and analysis; and external planning and analysis. The theoretical model furthers an understanding of SCM IS capabilities and is sufficiently developed to permit operationalization for future studies evaluating the effectiveness of SCM IS." .

In the latter case learning relates to the quality rather than to the quantity of experience. Regarding the antecedents of organizational learning especially, there are still unanswered questions remaining; for example, the questions what kind of experience has a positive effect on performance and what kind of experience is more of a hindrance than a help. This becomes obvious when looking at acquisitions as examples of strategic management decisions. Results of prior empirical studies analyzing the relationship of acquisition experience and acquisition performance have been mixed. By introducing the concept of strategic consistency, we intend to facilitate a better understanding of the kind of experience necessary for organizational learning. Therefore, we measure the concordance and frequency of change in strategic actions. Employing a sample of 379 acquisition series, we find evidence for a positive transfer effect of strategic consistency within series and, therefore, a positive relationship between strategic consistency and acquisition performance." .

At the end of the 1990s, bodies for evaluating conformity of measurement at different levels have been instituted to meet calibration and testing needs of the national industry. These bodies were divided into three categories: Class A where we find mainly the Central Laboratory for Analysis and Testing LCAE and the National Defence Laboratory DEFNAT; these two laboratories are in charge of the technological upgrading of the other bodies of Class B which, in turn, would transfer their knowledge to the industries, the latter constituting Class C. Nowadays, the accreditation of Tunisian laboratories at the international level by recognized reference foreign bodies and participation in the European proficiency network enabled the national laboratories of Tunisia to establish the degree of equivalence between their measurement results and those of other foreign laboratories." .

Firms can price discriminate based on perfect data on consumer addresses and (possibly) imperfect data on consumer flexibility. We show that firms’ location choices depend on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility. Precisely, when consumers are relatively homogeneous, equilibrium locations are socially optimal regardless of the quality of customer flexibility data. However, when consumers are relatively differentiated, firms make socially optimal location choices only when customer flexibility data becomes perfect. These results are driven by the optimal strategy of a firm on its turf, monopolization or market-sharing, which in turn depends on consumer heterogeneity in flexibility. Our analysis is motivated by the availability of customer data, which allows firms to practice third-degree price discrimination based on both consumer characteristics relevant in spatial competition, addresses and transport cost parameters." .

However, such decision-making is problematic due to the behavior of channel members with characteristics of individual rationality and concerns of fairness. The two characteristics matter much to the performance and service quality of the supply chain. Therefore, a service quality coordination contract for the OSSSC should be designed based on these two behavioral elements. This paper proposes two novel models, which take into account the two important elements mentioned above and designs coordination contracts for the OSSSC with two competing third party logistics (TPL) companies and a single online store. Equilibrium decisions in two benchmark scenarios (decentralized and centralized control) were analyzed, revealing that the use of a traditional price-only contract cannot appropriately coordinate the supply chain. Both proposed contracts can be used to realize global and partial coordination of the OSSSC, respectively. This is caused since both models utilize the game theory to achieve unification of individual and collective rationality, and fair allocation of the system surplus profits based on individual decisions. Numerical experiments were conducted to examine the impact of the intensity of the competition between both TPL companies on their decisions and the attention of the online store to the ratio of service level to the service price on the coordination effect." .

A comparison of the financial structure of Italian large enterprises with those of other European countries (France, Germany, and Spain), using Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonised data, shows their financial fragility, where the prevalence of debt over equity justifies the still strong and close relationship between ownership control and management in their strategies and the prevalence of obsolete bank–firm relationships based on short-term external finance and multiple business lendings. These factors slow down firms’ expansion and consequently the need for companies to grow so as to face the new global market. Finance is confirmed as a determinant of growth both in size and in organisation. We conclude that a pivotal role for the growth of Italian firms lies in a “revised” relationship between size, governance, and the firms’ financial structure." .

It identifies the e-commerce benefits realized by these SMEs and investigates the relationship between the levels of e-commerce adoption and the benefits thus realized. The study was motivated by the limited studies related to e-commerce adoption by SMEs, especially in developing countries. In addition, it seems that most e-commerce studies are focused more on upstream issues: to see the factors that facilitate, or barriers faced regarding e-commerce adoption, rather than downstream issues: to see post-adoption benefits. This certainly limits our understanding about e-commerce adoption by SMEs in developing countries, as well as the post-adoption benefits of e-commerce. Indonesia was chosen as the place in which to conduct the study. A survey of 292 SMEs shows that the majority of them are still at an early stage in their adoption of e-commerce. Their use of e-commerce is dominated by marketing and purchasing and procurement activities. “Extending market reach”, “increased sales”, “improved external communication”, “improved company image”, “improved speed of processing”, and “increased employee productivity” are reported as the top six e-commerce benefits perceived by these SMEs. This study also shows that SMEs at the higher level of e-commerce adoption experience greater e-commerce benefits than those at other levels of adoption." .

The reality of trade is that it takes two or more parties to do business, and therefore the capabilities of both selling and buying firms are important. Where over 60% of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the USA and Canada have adopted some form of business process through a computer mediated network, such as the Internet, other countries have significantly lower adoption rates. In Asia and Latin America, where as many as 99% of all firms are classified as SMEs, low adoption rates may be an impediment to increased international trade. This paper takes a critical look at the existing research on adoption of e-business technology by SMEs internationally. In particular, we identify the gap in our knowledge about what makes SMEs in different countries capable of using the technology in their domestic and international supply chains. We present a typology of the business processes networked over computer-mediated processes from our preliminary empirical field research, interviewing 40 SMEs in Canada, Japan, China and Mexico. This is used to propose a model of international SME capability to guide future empirical research." .

Our results indicated that a clear hierarchy exists for men in term of how status within the labour market was associated with subjective life satisfaction. Unemployed men were the least satisfied, followed by men who were not in the labour market, while men in leadership positions reported the highest level of subjective life satisfaction. For women, no statistically significant differences were observed among women in high-level managerial positions, women who worked in non-high-level positions, and women who specialized in household production, with no market work. Only women who were unemployed reported lower levels of life satisfaction, compared with women in other labour-market statuses. Our results lend evidence to the contention that men can “have it all”, but women must still choose between career and family in Germany. We argue that interventions need to address how the non-pecuniary rewards associated with high-level managerial and leadership positions can be increased for women. Such policies would also likely serve to mitigate the “pipeline” problem concerning the number of women who are available to move into high positions in the private sector." .

The introduction of normative concerns with requirements of openness and adaptation stresses this issue. The corresponding mechanisms for the current infrastructures appear to be not appropriate for managing distributed and open normative organisations. There is still the need of proper abstractions and tools to facilitate application agents taking part in the monitoring of the organisation on one hand, and in the adaptation and definition of the organisation in which they are situated on the other hand.

This contribution investigates, with respect to measurement uncertainty, the methodical basis of this practice in general and examines specifically two very different groups of products: asphalt, with its major components mineral aggregates and bitumen, and metal wire cloth. The author concludes that both the general and the specific situations are incoherent. The practice of accepting standardised test procedures a priori as validated does not have a sound basis in all cases. Both the concept, and the practical application, of validation or fitness for purpose vary in different product groups. The impact of this situation on the practice of accreditation should be taken into account in order to reduce market distortions in single-product groups. Laboratories face fundamental consequences from this practice." .

The results revealed that participation in the GVC can considerably improve the green technology levels in all enterprises, except state-owned ones. However, the older an enterprise, the higher the sluggishness is likely to be in its R&D activities; this is particularly true for state-owned enterprises.

A review of the literature reveals that the extant conclusions are fragmented, inconclusive and limited in geographical scope. This study aims to address these limitations by analysing small, locally owned firms’ export behaviour from a novel location that has never been studied in the extant literature. The study draws on data from Jamaica, a small, open Caribbean economy. The statistical analysis revealed that size, not age, has a significant impact on export behaviour. Furthermore, other factors such as the owner’s previous international job experience and foreign travel experience also play an important role. These findings have implications for future research on the export behaviour of small firms, especially those from emerging environments. In addition, they provide export policy makers who are engaged in export stimulation among small, locally owned firms, with profile of firms that have a greater proclivity to export." .

The analysis suggests that national wages are likely to be strategic complements (substitutes) if products are ordinary substitutes (complements). Under the assumption of linear demand, it is shown that bilateral trade liberalization always leads to higher union set wages and union utilities, regardless of the nature of product rivalry. An analysis of the consequences of unilateral tariff reductions shows that foreign tariff reductions always give rise to higher union wages and utilities, whereas the impact of unilateral domestic tariff reductions depends on the nature of product rivalry." .

Findings show that managers use a range of strategies, including overlooking, as interventions for employees’ disputes, instead of favoring the use of any particular one. Choices of intervention strategies were influenced by the type of issue being disputed, the seriousness of the dispute, and managers’ self-efficacy with mediation. Specifically, managers most frequently used mediation to resolve task-related disputes, and tended to use a variety of different strategies to intervene in personality conflicts. When managers perceived conflicts to be highly serious, they most frequently used mediation, followed by arbitration, offering incentives, and lastly, overlooking. Managers with a high degree of mediation self-efficacy more frequently mediated employees’ disputes, whereas managers with a low degree of mediation self-efficacy more frequently overlooked employees’ disputes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed." .

Using five organization oriented enablers and four result oriented focused criteria, any organization, or substantial part of it, can be characterized. This accounts certainly for a medical laboratory in a hospital setting. The model tries to encourage practical usefulness and self-guidance, continuous improvement in a natural, stepwise way, and change management focused on the positive things within the organization. Application leads to consciousness of the quality of the entire operation, diagnoses, and advises for quality improvement and managerial control, i.e., through indicators. As the work of Islin and Thystrup illustrated, the EFQM model can be very elegantly and effectively applied to medical laboratories [1]. This paper is a compilation of nine lectures given in sequence to elaborate on each of the nine EFQM criteria. The following compilation explores the possibilities of using in a dedicated laboratory service this general quality management model by each of the criteria." .

There exists an intricate link between public sector marketing and social effectiveness however, within public sector this relationship has rarely been analyzed. Whether social effectiveness can be a useful tool to maximize benefits of public sector marketing, a study was designed to test the hypothesis and investigate the factors responsible for enhancing the social effectiveness in some major organizations of Anuhi province of China. Our results show that good organization within public sector has most significant contribution in improving social effectiveness (β = 0.30, p < 0.05) followed by culture (β = 0.27, p < 0.05). The other key influencing factors emerged in our study with positive impact on social effectiveness includes management (β = 0.22, p < 0.05) and information (β = 0.19, p < 0.05). It appears that provincial government of Anhui has developed a great deal of sense in realizing the role of public sector marketing as an effective tool to cater the needs of general public. Moreover, there is a definite direction and policy guideline available for public sector organizations to focus on social effectiveness. That was the prime reason organizations surveyed in this study have shown excellent discipline, harmony and culture of conducive working environment to perform professional responsibilities. Our study has therefore provides valuable insight that how government performs its role towards society integration and social effectiveness within the domain of public sector marketing." .

The reform emanated from a historic and unique coming together of all teacher unions throughout the country to make a joint submission to the Industrial Relations Commission. Potentially, the AST constituted one of the most progressive educational initiatives ever adopted in Australia. In this article we review what happened in practice. Our findings point to a dilemma for those who might attempt to introduce professional career paths for teachers in the future. Fundamental improvements to teachers' pay systems and career structures undoubtedly depend on initiatives within the industrial relations arena. However, this arena proved to be an unsuitable context in which to develop the kind of teaching standards and performance assessments that are essential for career paths based on quality of practice. We concl ude that these tasks require instead the creation of stable, national, expert professional bodies that embrace all stakeholders." .

Information technology is providing manufacturers with additional flexibility with regard to their supply chain network choices. Our research studies supply chain network organization structures categorized by the organic and mechanistic management control structures. The structural impacts on cost and fill rate performance are studied in two-echelon and two-supply-chain network organization models under different market coordination conditions using system dynamic simulations. Our results show significant effects of demand and network structural factors, and their interactions, on these measures. As demand becomes dynamic, the cooperative interaction model, where supply chains cooperate to satisfy customer demand, is found to have better system performance than the competitive supply chain model. The analysis also suggests that increasing the responsiveness at the downstream plant is particularly important to the overall system performance improvement." .

Implementing new technology entails change and challenges, and these aspects of Enterprise 2.0 have not been adequately addressed by research. This study investigates change factors specific to Enterprise 2.0 initiatives to contribute to our understanding of their characteristics and idiosyncrasies. Drawing upon grounded theory, we analyze 16 case studies and integrate the results in the context of socio-technical change. To contrast the findings, similarities and distinctions between Enterprise 2.0 and ERP projects are discussed. We further explore and evaluate the conclusions by conducting expert interviews with senior professionals in the field of Enterprise 2.0. Our results indicate Enterprise 2.0 initiatives involve specific change factors, require distinct management strategies and shape new roles in the organization. The findings can enable practitioners in navigating the pitfalls of transferring and applying change management to a new field. For researchers, the study constitutes a point of departure to empirically examine change in Enterprise 2.0 initiatives." .

This network has the aim of providing integral metrological services to industry throughout the country, with uniform standards of quality and consistency. The fulfillment of this aim has been possible because of a number of factors that have made the MESURA Program an attractor for the integration of metrological services. Among these factors are: an unswerving focus on the customer needs, an integral and logical problem solving approach to consultancy, adequate modular classification of the consultants functions, clear-cut definition of the functions of each member of interdisciplinary groups, and a uniform code of communication among the members of the network. The next stage of the strategy is to strengthen the link between metrology and its industrial applications forming a new type of consultant with the technical experts from R&D Centers. These will be consultants with general knowledge and experience in metrology, specialized in certain type of industrial processes and products. The strategy will be initiated in the year 2000 and with it the MESURA Network is expected to make a strong contribution to fostering the optimum use of metrology in industry and to act as a channel for the integration of other technologies in which the participating Centers have expertise." .

While PMSCs produce security for profit, most other private sector actors make profit by selling goods and services that were originally not connected with security in the traditional understanding of the term. However, due to the continuous introduction of new legal and technical regulations by public authorities, many non- security related private businesses nowadays have to perform at least some security functions. Little research, however, has been done thus far, both in terms of security practices of non- security related private businesses and their impact on security governance. This introduction explains how this special issue contributes to closing this glaring gap by 1) extending the conceptual and theoretical arguments in the existing body of literature; and 2) offering a range of original case studies on the specific roles of non- security related private companies of all sizes, areas of businesses, and geographic origin." .

As discourses express specific stances expressed by a group of people who share particular beliefs and values, they constitute an important means of restoring organisational legitimacy when social rules and norms have been violated. Using an analytical framework based on legitimacy as a process of reciprocal sense-making and consisting of three levels of analysis which capture the relationship between text and context, we investigate the discourse used by CEOs in their initial and subsequent accounts of the incident. We find that CEOs aim to negotiate a resolution between their initial account and organisational audiences’ incongruent interpretations of the event by adopting an ad hoc normative attitude to stakeholders. This manifests itself in the strategic use of the discourse of stakeholder engagement as a means of signalling change, yet maintaining the status quo. It suggests that CEOs strategically use discourse to manufacture organisational audiences’ consent regarding the continued operation of the nuclear power plant affected by the incident. Our findings contribute to the critical corporate communication literature which regards corporate narrative reporting as a means of consolidating the private interests of corporations, rather than increasing transparency and accountability." .

The success of new products can be a competitive weapon and advantage for a firm to survive in the current dynamic markets. The most important aspect of the product design is identifying customers’ needs of products. One of the most common methods to satisfy customers’ needs is improvement of customers’ satisfaction. The present paper applies the aspects of the 4P marketing mix (product, price, place, and promotion) for modeling the relationship between customers’ satisfaction and new product design with handling nonlinearity as well as fuzziness. A methodology based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) approach is presented to improve customers’ satisfaction while setting products’ design attributes in a fuzzy environment. The intelligent approach of the present study is then applied to predict customers’ satisfaction and design new product through 4P marketing mix concept in an actual case in the freezer refrigerator industry. A complete sensitivity analysis is run to assess significance or influence of each input variable on customers’ satisfaction. The superiority of ANFIS is proved by error analysis. The proposed approach would help practitioners within the field of marketing and new product design teams to enhance customers’ satisfaction and set new products’ attributes." .

Pay increases, however, can influence labor productivity. But what about the case of a corporatist economy, in which wage setting is highly coordinated? With cor-poratist cooperation between unions and management, is pay de-coupled from productivity? Using an innovative technique, this study disentangles the rela-tionship between pay and productivity in Germany. Citing high unemployment and increasingly global competition, critics have argued that Germany's brand of corporatist labor relations cannot survive. Our findings show that links between productivity and pay were different in the 1990s than in earlier years, suggesting that the collective bargaining process now works differently." .

While the United States Supreme Court has not yet involved itself in adjudicating issues of sexual favoritism, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, however, has issued guidelines. The California Supreme Court recently addressed the “sexual favoritism as sexual harassment/discrimination” issue and, absent better guidance from the federal courts, the California decision provides interesting insights for the legal and business communities. This article explores key issues involving workplace romances, sexual favoritism, and Title VII’s prohibition of sexual harassment as an illegal form of discrimination based on sex. We use the recent California Supreme Court decision in Miller to illustrate the legal and managerial challenges facing policy makers and management practitioners. We conclude with a discussion of policy alternatives for creating a discrimination- and harassment-free workplace while effectively managing workplace romances and instances of sexual favoritism." .

It consisted of two action research projects - the thesis action research and the core action research - which were done in a parallel manner, both following the iterative cycles of constructing, planning, taking, and evaluating action. The thesis action research was aimed at developing a theory on building organizational identity from the viewpoint of an organizational founder. On the other hand, the core action research was focused on promoting the specific identity of the Institute for Integrality, Inc. Quality and rigor were observed in the implementation of the action research cycles. In the fieldwork, there were three main cycles undertaken – understanding organizational identity, fine-tuning the practice of this identity, and designing the integration of this identity in organizational culture. Thereafter, significant learnings were derived from meta-learning in the form of content, process, and premise reflections. Finally, through the critical reflection of the project in the light of the experience and theory, A-Founder’s Integrative Theory of Organizational Identity Building was derived." .

This study empirically investigates the relationship between MO and EO on a sample of 2500 Swedish SMEs. A new measure of MO that takes into consideration SMEs specific conditions has been developed and used. Findings suggest that MO is the main determinant of EO in SMEs." .

Tests were conducted at 3 different speeds to examine the applicability of similarity laws. The results show that cambered profiles generated much higher pressure and flow rate as compared to a flat plate profile. For flat plate profiles, a maximum pressure of 0.55 Pa and a flow rate of 9.9 cm3/s are generated with a blade angle of 42° when the fan is operating at 20,000 rpm. This is much lower than that obtained by cambered profiles where a maximum pressure of 1.15 Pa and a flow rate of 14.6 cm3/s are generated with a blade angle of 60°. The effects of increasing blade number and blade angle have a positive effect on the flow rate delivered and pressure generated but the effects of increasing blade number is more effective in enhancing fan performance. The results also show that dynamic similarity is observed for rotational speeds of 15,000 and 20,000 rpm." .

It is shown that a firm only prefers a profit-sharing system if its own union does not have “too much” bargaining power, and if the union in the other firm does not have “too much” bargaining power. However, if a firm introduces profit-sharing, the employment increases, and the price in the goods market decreases. Hence, even if it is not in the own interest of a firm to introduce profit-sharing, it may be in the interest of the society." .

As a result, many business processes leave their “footprints” in transactional information systems, i.e., business events are recorded in so-called event logs. Process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs, i.e., the basic idea of process mining is to diagnose business processes by mining event logs for knowledge. In this paper we focus on the potential use of process mining for measuring business alignment, i.e., comparing the real behavior of an information system or its users with the intended or expected behavior. We identify two ways to create and/or maintain the fit between business processes and supporting information systems: Delta analysis and conformance testing. Delta analysis compares the discovered model (i.e., an abstraction derived from the actual process) with some predefined processes model (e.g., the workflow model or reference model used to configure the system). Conformance testing attempts to quantify the “fit” between the event log and some predefined processes model. In this paper, we show that Delta analysis and conformance testing can be used to analyze business alignment as long as the actual events are logged and users have some control over the process." .

This critical review of this justification examines the analytical meaning of the concept of an inequality of bargaining power, the factors responsible for this inequality, the change that has taken place in labor’s disadvantage since the 1930s, and the implications for national labor policy. It is concluded that some employers continue to have significant market power over wages but that the extent and degree of labor’s disadvantage in bargaining has diminished substantially since World War II. The implication is that the Wagner Act’s protection of the right to organize remains in the social interest but that the bargaining power of labor unions should be further circumscribed to preserve a balance of power in wage determination." .

Data gathered from a sample of 110 graduating college business majors partially supported the hypotheses (p < 0.05), revealing a dynamic influence of the organizational attributes across decision making stages and a differential impact of the attributes depending on their framing as family-friendly or life-friendly. Salary was especially important in initial screening of organizational options, and the organizational culture support of work–nonwork challenges was increasingly influential as the final choice was formed.

In contrast with most other UV research this study does not refer to a search-theoretical framework, but focuses on skill differences between labour supply and demand. Three significant causes of labour market frictions appear to be: the development of the skill composition of labour demand, the apprenticeship possibilities and the relatively high wages of older workers. Some other hypotheses show weakly significant results: bumping-down processes, reschooling of unemployed older workers and the development of secondary labour market segments." .

While we support the desire for both rigor and regional relevance in this research, we wish to demonstrate a strong commonality between the performance of large Asian firms and others from Europe and North America. This prompts us to question the need for a new theory of the MNE based on the experience of Asian firms. Like their counterparts elsewhere, the large Asian firms mostly operate on an intra-regional basis. While in the literature it has been assumed that the path to success for Asian firms is globalization, we show that the data supporting this is confined to a handful of unrepresentative case studies. We also present a bibliometric analysis which shows an overwhelming case study sample selection bias in academic studies towards this small number of unrepresentative cases." .

On the other hand, the supply chain parties act under some restrictions, and ignoring these limitations results in infeasible solutions in many real-world case studies. The purpose of this paper is to present a joint economic lot size (JELS) model, which considers the buyer's and the vendor's budget limitations to achieve a more reliable model solution. The idea is to present an extension of the model originally proposed by Ben-Daya et al. (Eur J Oper Res 185:726–742, 14). In addition, a solution algorithm is presented to make the solution procedure of proposed constrained model less complex. Numerical analysis is conducted to show the effect of applying the budget constraints." .

That model took into account both the activity information of the territory and the legal status of the enterprises working inside it. The model presented, which had a twofold form, developed and came together into a unique formulation. The present proposal is able to suitably catch the neighborhood’s effect on the variation of an economical variable measured on the examined territory. This paper does not intend to repropose the aspects regarding the theoretical evolution of the first model. Instead, the principal goal is to make a comparison ceteris paribus between the results obtained with the new model and those reached through the application of the previous one, so to highlight the role of the association between the two factors included inside the decomposition. Italian industrial districts represent the economical context for this application since each model proposed is applicable to each district case without modifying the theoretical structure which is related, to the neighborhood definition. The application proposed here focuses on data on the chair industrial district located in the border region Friuli Venezia Giulia, with reference to the entire period 2000–2004." .

Yet politics has a more benign meaning as well: responsible participation in decision-making processes, keeping informed, and promoting innovative ideas that serve long-term organizational interests. To date, the negative image of organizational politics among managers and scholars has limited research on the positive contributions of responsible political participation, a form of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) known as civic virtue. This paper draws on political philosophy and organizational research to consider two forms of civic virtue OCB: gathering information and exercising influence. Both are proactive and can have beneficial results for individuals, organizations, and society. Conceptually, the two forms of civic virtue are related. Yet they also are different. Results of a field study of 245 employees and their supervisors provide support for similarities and differences in the two forms of civic virtue. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our study, and the benefits of continued research on both aspects of civic virtue OCB." .

A review of the reported court opinions indicates that plaintiff employees often encounter difficulty in these cases. Some plaintiffs are unable to prove that they are “qualified” employees at the time of the adverse employment action, and other plaintiffs find it difficult to prove that a determinative factor in the adverse employment action was the disability of the associate or relative. However, plaintiffs have achieved some success as evidenced in the 2008 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals holdings in Dewitt v. Proctor Hospital and Trujillo v. PacifiCorp. This paper describes reported U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinions about ADA association discrimination, its relationship to the Family and Medical Leave Act and Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the implications for employers, employees, and lawmakers. It also offers practical guidance to both employees and employers for asserting and managing rights and potential liability in this area." .

Going beyond the trading view of electronic commerce, collaborative commerce (c-commerce) is concerned with electronic means to enable and facilitate collaborative relationships involving knowledge flows among distributed participants engaged in various joint activities such as those that make up the value chain. C-commerce experience among practitioners is in an emergent stage and c-commerce research has yet to be well-developed. There are many open questions about c-commerce practices and fundamentals. Drawing on a wide range of literature, this paper introduces a theoretical foundation for investigating the nature and outcomes of c-commerce. This foundation takes the form of a relatively comprehensive theoretical framework that identifies salient factors and relationships for practitioners to consider in launching a c-commerce initiative or for researchers to consider in designing c-commerce research studies." .

By addressing the question of exactly when a prohibited retaliatory action has been taken against an employee, the United States Supreme Court’s June 2006 decision in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Sheila White ended a significant disagreement among the various appellate courts on the issue. The Supreme Court answered two specific questions regarding retaliation for raising a claim of sexual discrimination. First, the Court decided that the retaliatory conduct need not take place within the employment setting; and, second, it held that a materially adverse action requires only that a reasonable employee would be deterred from making, filing, or supporting a claim of workplace discrimination to the EEOC, the courts, or the employer. Employers need to revise and update their internal policies and procedures to ensure that their firms comply with these new standards." .

The central influencing factor on schedule reliability is the lateness of supply chain processes. In order to comprehend possible interdependencies between logistical objectives and the influencing factor lateness various approaches have been developed for mathematically describing lateness in a supply chain’s primary processes. This paper focuses on the mathematical description of output lateness distributions in inventory systems. The developed logistic model describes the relationships between stock and service levels as well as the resulting inventory system’s output lateness distribution. Within a comprehensive simulation study the quality of the model’s depiction is demonstrated. The paper concludes with an overview of possibilities for applying the developed model for describing the lateness behaviour in supply chains." .

This paper focuses on the influence of the regional environment on the early adoption of micro-electronic components in product development in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs). Drawing upon existing literature we compare the role of enterprise characteristics, innovation networks and, in particular, the regional environment for an early use of micro-electronic components in product development in SMEs and LEs using a tobit model. Our central hypothesis is that SMEs are more dependent upon their regional environment than LEs for an early adoption. However, this hypothesis is rejected by our empirical results that show that location in a large, dense region has a significant positive effect on product innovation in LEs, while it has a negative but non-significant effect on product innovation in SMEs. Our results imply peripheral regions are able to provide an innovative environment for SMEs, whereas LEs need the richer environment offered by the core regions. The results are also interesting from a policy point of view because they indicate that SMEs can be early users of new technologies even if they are located outside the large urban areas." .

To accomplish this task, the AICPA relies on various stakeholders to report known violations of its CPC. We examine the full population of sanctions imposed by the AICPA on its members under its CPC from 2008–2013 to identify recent trends in the misconduct of accounting professionals. While we find that multiple stakeholders identify and report violations, we also find that the most common types of violations remain consistent with those reported in the 1990s. Further, we develop a taxonomy based on prior accounting literature to determine whether the AICPA CPC is being enforced to defend the public interest and/or the private interests of the accounting profession. In contrast to prior studies, our results suggest that as the accounting profession emerges from a recession and period of intense public scrutiny, the AICPA CPC is largely being enforced to defend the public interest. This public interest focus was most pronounced during the recessionary years of 2008–2010, as evident from misconduct reported by parties such as the Internal Revenue Service, Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and state boards of accountancy. Although key stakeholders have recently focused on reporting misconduct that threatens the public interest, we believe there are still areas in need of improvement, especially around the level of detail provided in the AICPA’s sanction records. We propose some possible solutions to improve public transparency." .

We show that while the ability of SMEs to build a strong knowledge-capital remains weak (mainly due to fewer resources), SMEs play an important role in the continuous enrichment of larger companies' ones.

A variety of procedures exists to evaluate multiple hypotheses, for instance the ones of Benjamini–Hochberg, Bonferroni, Holm or Sidak. We are particularly interested in multiple testing procedures with two desired properties: (solely) monotonic and well-behaved procedures. This article investigates to which extent the classes of (monotonic or well-behaved) multiple testing procedures, in particular the subclasses of so-called step-up and step-down procedures, are closed under basic set operations, specifically the union, intersection, difference and the complement of sets of rejected or non-rejected hypotheses. The present article proves two main results: First, taking the union or intersection of arbitrary (monotonic or well-behaved) multiple testing procedures results in new procedures which are monotonic but not well-behaved, whereas the complement or difference generally preserves neither property. Second, the two classes of (solely monotonic or well-behaved) step-up and step-down procedures are closed under taking the union or intersection, but not the complement or difference." .

What is the academic productivity of an Italian researcher working in Italy compared with one working abroad? Does academic productivity depend on their well-being at work? The aim of this study is to find explanations for these questions and to demonstrate the relationship that exists between academic productivity and organizational well-being and work, both for researchers who are Italian emigrants abroad (project IRA) and for those who remain in Italy (IRI project).This goal was achieved through two surveys. Where there is an atmosphere of a wellness organization, it creates a productive work environment (vision abroad); conversely, a poor working environment that is associated with an organizational system that is below the average level negatively affects the overall academic productivity (in Italy). We can confirm that working environments with better organizational climate produce more productive academics." .

First, a critical view is presented relating to the internal organization of this sector; the most important problem observed is the marketing system which is atomized, heterogeneous and significantly difficult for raising funds from the individual partners in order to begin innovative projects. Second, to establish whether this area is losing market share, the sector is compared to the other principal tomato suppliers of the European Union (the Netherlands, Morocco, and other areas of Spain). The analysis shows Almeria has defended its market share in the most recent years. Finally, the most influential variables in the commercial process are analyzed by a tomato export model that shows there are substitution effects of the Almerian tomato for products from others origins, mostly the Netherlands." .

This occurs against a background of an increasingly professionalized and managerialist charity sector. Trustees are seen, in public policy terms, as a homogeneous and leadership-oriented group, while some charity managers aspire to or are already fulfilling leadership roles. This research note reviews these developments, considering trustees' strategy-making and controlling functions, and the nature of the relations between charity staffs and trustees. It describes the development of a tentative typology by the authors, characterizing trustees' approaches to their roles, as a means of illustrating the heterogeneous rather than homogeneous nature of the overall charity trustee body. The research process, leading toward the typology's development, is outlined and critiqued. Reflections on the value of the typology are given and possible future developments in trusteeship are considered. The authors consider that those trustees willing to remain in role are likely to adopt custodial rather than entrepreneurial approaches to their trusteeship. Such a role is likely to be increasingly at odds with the role sought or adopted by senior managers in some charities, and also with the proactive model of trusteeship that is being encouraged by the regulatory systems for British charities." .

The subsidies were awarded according to a ranking system that favored young, growing and productive firms with a strong cash flow, granting subsidies to the highest scoring firms until the depletion of funds. The nature of this allocation system creates a sharp cutoff in granting the subsidy according to the score, allowing us to estimate the causal impact of the subsidies using a regression discontinuity design. We find a positive effect on firm-level investment, employment, output and productivity for the firms that were granted the subsidy, but only for the small firms. However, the effect is small relative to the cost of the subsidy." .

Drawing on the emerging narrative perspective of SE, we examine the biographical narratives of 317 self-identified social entrepreneurs who were selected as fellows by two of the world’s largest SE support organizations: Ashoka and the Schwab Foundation. We employ Gioia’s methodology and principal component analysis to derive and subsequently classify the biographical antecedents of SE emergence. This study makes a novel contribution to the SE-as-hybrid-organization literature by revealing eight biographical antecedents of SE emergence, four of which can be categorized into social skills, and four others can be categorized into economic skills, which constitute SE’s social position. We also develop a typology of SE based on different combinations of individuals’ social skills and social position. Finally, we discuss the implications of this study for the SE-as-hybrid-organization literature, highlight its limitations, and present possible avenues for future research." .

The modern corporation is characterized by the conflict that ensues when ownership and control are independent. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), in theory, serve to realign these disparate interests between the owners and managers of the firm. This article will explore the mechanisms by which ESOPs serve to empower those who possess ownership rights in the corporation. The application of trusteeship theory serves to explain the agency problem that may arise when managers serve as both trustee and beneficiary. Workplace, ownership, and corporate rights are integrated into a stakeholder perspective of rights conflicts." .

The first type of Markov chain goes only in one direction, either up or down in the poset (an up chain or down chain). The second type toggles between two adjacent rank levels (an up-and-down chain). We introduce two compatibility concepts between the up-directed transition probabilities (an up rule) and the down-directed (a down rule), and we relate these to compatibility between up-and-down chains. This framework is used to prove a conjecture about a limit shape for a process on Young’s lattice. Finally, we settle the questions whether the reverse of an up chain is a down chain for some down rule and whether there exists an up or down chain at all if the rank function is not bounded." .

It is shown that the relative bargaining power of the confederation of employers and the union, respectively, affects not only the level of the endogenous variables but also their reaction to exogenous disturbances. If the union's power exceeds a critical value, positive aggregate demand shocks increase unemployment since the actual nominal wage rises more than the market clearing one. Moreover, if the union's power is sufficiently close to its upper bound, the overreaction of wages becomes so large that positive aggregate demand shocks even lead to a decrease in output and employment, i.e., the multipliers become negative." .

This paper explores whether the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the productivity of Italian domestically-owned firms (DOFs) is dependent on their absorptive capacity. In particular, given the peculiar characteristics of the Italian productive system, our analysis focuses on three different dimensions of the absorptive capacity: the size of the technological gap between foreign-owned firms (FOFs) and DOFs, firm size, and the regional distribution of firms. Our findings suggest that technological gap and firm size matter considerably for the spillover effect. Moreover, spillovers exhibit a sub-national dimension present only in the northeastern region of the peninsula." .

It examines the changing processes and the role of key institutional actors in the grievance management system. This study reveals varied practices in grievance management in part due to firm history and ownership forms. It highlights the inadequacy of India’s public institutions for grievance redressal on the one hand, and the growing space for firms to introduce private and informal practices on the other, leaving employee welfare largely in the goodwill and competence of the management. We argue that future research on grievance management should adopt a finer contextual and temporal approach to uncover processes and the deeper causes of employee dissatisfaction. It should also adopt an interdisciplinary approach to eliminate the demarcation between the existing human resource management (HRM) and industrial relations research domains and provide a more holistic understanding of what HRM practices may be conducive to developing a healthy workplace relationship and productivity enhancement." .

In general, the literature identifies conflicts between various groups of stakeholders and then proceeds in two very different directions. The first is supportive of the non-profit sector, suggesting that non-profit organisations resolve those conflicts more effectively than other types of institutions. This provides a positive theory of the non-profit sector, explaining that non-profit institutions evolve when they are more effective in providing a particular good or service than other possible institutional arrangements. The second direction is more critical of the non-profit sector, suggesting that those conflicts will persist in non-profit institutions and will require some kind of resolution, including perhaps government intervention. Of course, a stakeholder approach to non-profit theory focuses on conflict and ignores some other views of the sector." .

Buyer and supplier agents into multi-agent system architecture of the e-commerce system negotiate with others through an automated negotiation mechanism. In this study, an automated negotiation to interact between buyer and supplier and attain agreement for both is presented. A fuzzy inference system was used to automate negotiation process and consider two effective factors in the negotiation process: requirements and preferences. Requirements are qualitative or quantitative values which the participants assign to the issues of negotiation. Preferences of the participants are priorities assigned by them to issues. These values express an importance measure of issues from a participant perspective. Proposed model applies different fuzzy inference system (FIS) schemes for qualitative and quantitative negotiation issues to enhance the satisfaction level of the buyer and supplier. The FISs infer based on the preferences and requirements of both parties. Additionally, analytic hierarchy process was used to get preferences of the issues. In this proposal, mediator uses issue trade-offs strategy in which multiple issues are traded-offs against one another. The model applies a fuzzy system approach to make trade-offs." .

This paper describes the design and implementation of a replicable, Internet-based negotiation server for conducting bargaining-type negotiations between enterprises involved in e-commerce and e-business. Enterprises can be buyers and sellers of products/services or participants of a complex supply chain engaged in purchasing, planning, and scheduling. Multiple copies of our server can be installed to complement the services of Web servers. Each enterprise can install or select a trusted negotiation server to represent his/her interests. Web-based GUI tools are used during the build-time registration process to specify the requirements, constraints, and rules that represent negotiation policies and strategies, preference scoring of different data conditions, and aggregation methods for deriving a global cost-benefit score for the item(s) under negotiation. The registration information is used by the negotiation servers to automatically conduct bargaining type negotiations on behalf of their clients. In this paper, we present the architecture of our implementation as well as a framework for automated negotiations, and describe a number of communication primitives which are used in the underlying negotiation protocol. A constraint satisfaction processor (CSP) is used to evaluate a negotiation proposal or counterproposal against the registered requirements and constraints of a client company. In case of a constraint violation, an event is posted to trigger the execution of negotiation strategic rules, which either automatically relax the violated constraint, ask for human intervention, invoke an application, or perform other remedial operations. An Event-Trigger-Rule (ETR) server is used to manage events, triggers, and rules. Negotiation strategic rules can be added or modified at run-time. A cost-benefit analysis component is used to perform quantitative analysis of alternatives. The use of negotiation servers to conduct automated negotiation has been demonstrated in the context of an integrated supply chain scenario." .

The argument is developed through an ethnographic case study of a nonprofit hybrid organization (in the United States) that is training welfare recipients in their own in-house businesses. First, this paper provides an overview of the commercial trends in the nonprofit sector and the rise of social purpose enterprises. Then, employing key concepts from neo-institutional theory, the author proposes framing nonprofit-business hybrids as organizations positioned in two different organizational fields—each necessitating different internal organizational technologies—to elucidate the structural tensions that can emerge inside these new hybrid models. Internal organizational tensions identified in the case study are highlighted. Finally, the proposed use of organizational field theory developed from the case analysis is discussed in terms of social enterprise more generally." .

The legislation accomplishes two main functions. The first part establishes an Office of Industrial Technology in the Department of Commerce which will oversee the establishment of a wide variety of university-affiliated centers. The Centers will: 1) Perform research supportive of technological and industrial innovation including cooperative industry-university basic and applied research; 2) provide assistance to individuals and small businesses in the generation, evaluation and development of technological ideas supportive of industrial innovation and new business ventures; 3) provide technical assistance and advisory services to industry, particularly small businesses; and 4) provide curriculum development, training, and instruction in invention, entrepreneurship, and industrial innovation. The second part of the Act is concerned with the utilization of Federal Technology. Some of the provisions are: 1) Each Federal Laboratory shall establish an Office of Research and Technology Applications; 2) each Federal laboratory having a total annual budget exceeding $20,000,000 shall provide at least one professional individual full-time as staff for its Office of Research and Technology Application; and 3) after September 30, 1981 each Federal agency shall make available not less than 0.5 percent of the agency's research and development budget to support the technology transfer function of the Office of Research and Technology Applications. The legislation also establishes a Center for the Utilization of Federal Technology in the Department of Commerce to serve as a central clearinghouse for the collection, dissemination, and transfer of information on Federally owned or originated technology having potential application to State and local government and to private industry." .

The plurality and interactions of the evaluation criteria involved in the problem complicates the decision-making process. This study successfully proposes a set of systematic procedure for location selection using fuzzy-connective-based aggregation networks. The fuzzy-connective-based aggregation network can aggregate the relative status or achievement among locations in various location-related variables through a hierarchical decision-making structure. Finally, an overall evaluation of location is produced from various aspects. The trained model approximates the relationship between turnover and individual location-related factors, which can be used to predict the potential performance of candidate sites and to answer “what if” questions. The transparency and interpretation ability also makes the proposed method desirable. The weights and parameters in the evaluation model help identify the major factors influencing the turnover and the compensatory relationship among location-related factors. The effectiveness and applicability are confirmed through a case study of the food and beverage chain industry in Taiwan." .

Our study finds that firms with successful pollution prevention programs shared three main characteristics. First, they took a proactive approach towards cutting pollution. Proactive firms in our research employed pollution prevention as an overall environmental management strategy for their companies, and they possessed leaders and managers who demonstrated a strong commitment to pollution reduction goals and activities. Firms with successful pollution prevention programs also employed comprehensive environmental management systems. These systems assigned managers and workers responsibilities for pollution prevention through the use of rules, training, monitoring, and penalties and rewards. Finally, firms that undertook extensive pollution prevention measures employed staff with relatively high levels of technical knowledge and ability. Our results suggest that the aggressive adoption of pollution prevention by Chinese firms can help China address the widespread problems of inefficiency and poor management in Chinese firms, and the rapid spread of industrial pollution in rural areas." .

The regulation includes specific quality systems such as good laboratory practice (GLP), good clinical practice (GCP) and good manufacture practice (GMP). The principles of GLP mainly cover the formal quality aspects of a procedure and do not evaluate the technical aspects in depth. On the other hand, EN 45001 accreditation covers technical performance and is not suitable for pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) as it is almost impossible to comply with the requirements of the European standard in the pharmaceutical environment. The challenge to the pharmaceutical industry is, therefore, to develop quality systems, compatible with GLP principles, that not only cover formal quality items but also ensure good scientific and technical performance. An implementation process focused on real quality improvement is the best way to achieve this objective, culminating in formal recognition of the quality system by third-party assessment. In the case of analytical R&D, the EURACHEM/CITAC Guide CG2 is a very good tool that can help in the definition, analysis and selection of the non GLP quality elements that will be useful." .

With comparative advantage, the returns to skills differ across pay methods. I find that comparative advantage along with learning about worker skills seem to play a role for workers who are either at an early stage in their career or who are observed for the first time in a given job-match. For older workers, the return to skills is basically the same across pay methods." .

However, empirical research is scarce on these aspects of automotive RE and warrants closer examination. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify problems or challenges in automotive RE with respect to communication and organisation structure. Using a multiple-case study approach, we collected data via 14 semi-structured interviews at one car manufacturer and one supplier. We tested our findings from the case study with a questionnaire distributed to practitioners in the automotive industry. Our results indicate that it is difficult but increasingly important to establish communication channels outside the fixed organisation structure and that responsibilities are often unclear. Product knowledge during early requirements elicitation and context knowledge later on is lacking. Furthermore, abstraction gaps between requirements on different abstraction levels leads to inconsistencies. For academia, we formulate a concrete agenda for future research. Practitioners can use the findings to broaden their understanding of how the problems manifest and to improve their organisations." .

Disclosure clienteles refer to the ability of different types of disclosure activities to differentially benefit investors with varying levels of sophistication. Disclosure clienteles exist because variation in investor sophistication affects investors’ ability to utilize disclosed information and thus their preferences for distinct disclosure activities. I use cross-sectional variation in inefficient exercise activity in the options market to identify variation in sophistication (e.g., investors’ attention, knowledge, and expertise) and then present empirical evidence consistent with disclosure clienteles. The results show that sophisticated investors concentrate their trading in firms that regularly issue earnings guidance. This relation is stronger before RegFD, when sophisticated investors’ preferences for forecasting firms are predicted to be greater. Alternatively, less sophisticated investors are more prevalent in firms with increased levels of press-dissemination and superior investor relations (e.g., better access to information on the corporate website). These results suggest investors’ demand for disclosure is partially driven by their ability to use disclosed information." .

Our results from dyadic data on 234 supervisor–subordinate relationships in China revealed that (1) workplace negative gossip was negatively related to proactive behavior; (2) emotional exhaustion mediated this relationship; and (3) traditionality strengthened both the relationship between workplace negative gossip and emotional exhaustion and the indirect effect of workplace negative gossip on proactive behavior via emotional exhaustion. Our findings have a number of theoretical and practical implications for the research on mistreatment and proactive behavior." .

Professions are part of the category of self-employment and the study presents empirical findings drawn from a unique empirical dataset from Finland: a survey (N = 733) including freelance journalists, translators, interpreters and artists at the blurred boundaries between waged work and entrepreneurship. Findings reveal that the professions are clearly different and the manifestations of entrepreneurship vary, reflecting the work and the labor market situation within the profession. Life and work situations of liberal professions cannot be interpreted in simple black-and-white schemes of winners and losers. Instead, many different socioeconomic situations can be found ‘in between,’ which are driven by different social logics. For entrepreneurship research, the study opens up new avenues by taking us beyond the push-pull dichotomy, which over-simplifies the decision to enter self-employment. The term entrepreneurship is often used in an undifferentiated way, and it easily generates myths and stereotypes which are challenged by the study. A narrower and more realistic view shows that there are diverse agents under the flag of entrepreneurship, who are usually not regarded as core entrepreneurs although they exist in everyday life." .

Financing can rely on the spot, or it can be obtained from options in the form of loan commitments. In that context, we analyze whether the owners of the firms centralize financing and output decisions or delegate these decisions to managers. We show a multiplicity of equilibria from a number of organizational modes under delegation. An organizational form where the owner decides on short-term financing but delegates production with a long-term managerial scheme is not an equilibrium organizational form." .

Because of that, they may find themselves with an internal labour reserve at one moment, and be short of labour at another. This phenomenon is called ‘labour hoarding.’ In this article we propose a new method for the measurement of labour hoarding and apply it to the Dutch manufacturing industry. The results suggest that in the period 1972 to 1982, labour surpluses in that sector varied between five and fifteen percent of employment. Labour shortages appear to have been minor in the same period. Output uncertainty and real wage costs are supposed to be the main causes of the discrepancy between actual and technically efficient employment. Under this assumption an employment function is derived and fitted. The results are in accordance with the theoretical model on which the employment function was based." .

We first study the formation and the performance of a JV when the partners’ contribution has a different impact on the JV profits. Then, we check whether the JV is more likely as well as the welfare level improves when the decision on JV profit sharing among partners is delegated to an independent JV management (Management sharing) rather than jointly taken by partners (Coordinated sharing). We find that the firm whose effort has a higher impact on the JV’s profits should have a larger profit share. Moreover, at least in some cases, Management sharing increases both welfare and the probability that the JV is formed." .

And how does the optimal design depend on the type of strategic interaction between defectors and remaining organizational members? This paper addresses such issues in a game theoretic model of cooperation, in which an organization is formally represented by a connected network, and where gains from cooperation are given by a partition function. We show that critical structural features of the organization depend in a clear-cut way on the sign of spillovers. In particular, positive spillovers favor the adoption of dispersed and centralized forms, while negative spillovers favor cohesive and horizontal ones. Moreover, if the organizational form determines all the communication possibilities of members, a highly centralized organization—the star—emerges under positive spillovers, whereas two horizontal architectures—the circle and the complete—emerge under negative spillovers." .

The amount of financial aid may be a key feature for firms’ employment policies. We study the impact on employment of the amount of financial aid attributed to enterprises located in Piedmont, a region in northern Italy, analysing small-sized firms and medium- or large-sized firms separately. We apply generalized propensity score methods under the unconfoundedness assumption that adjusting for differences in a set of observed pre-treatment variables removes all biases in comparisons by different amounts of financial aid. We find that the estimated effects are increasing with amount of financial aid for both small-sized and medium- or large-sized firms, whereas the marginal effects of additional incentives are decreasing with amount of financial aid for small-sized firms, and have an inverse J-shape for medium- or large-sized firms." .

At the market stage we assume a Stackelberg structure, i.e. the leader commits to a quantity and the follower reacts to it. We allow the owners of both firms to select the internal organization and the production technology before quantities are set. That is, leader and follower can additionally use two commitment strategies alternatively or in combination: investing in R&D and delegating quantity decisions to managers. Despite the symmetry of options for the two firms, we find that there is a unique equilibrium in which both firms invest in process R&D, only the follower delegates, and the follower can overcome the first-mover advantage of the quantity leader and obtain a higher profit than the leader. Our analysis reveals that there are some important differences between the two commitment devices “cost-reducing R&Dt” and “delegation to managers”." .

To account for this, a range of thermodynamic hypotheses and models based on the physicochemical properties of various hydrophobic systems have been put forward. All these hypotheses and models predict that temperature should have some simple effect equivalent to that of pressure. The present work was undertaken to study the relationship between n-butanol concentration, temperature and the performance of a conditioned response in the goldfish, to see if it fitted any of the theories. It was found that the concentration of n-butanol required to just block the conditioned response in the goldfish was maximal (18mM) at about 18 °C and that both raising the temperature and lowering it reduced the required concentration. The sharp reduction in successful behaviour at the normal thermal limits were little changed by the presence of the alcohol. The absence of a simple relationship between temperature and concentration indicates the necessity of proposing a more complex model than the simple hydrophobic site, and a cellular mechanism is put forward linking both membrane and metabolic events." .

This study initially concentrates on identifying differences in the personal and demographic characteristics of women and men in four potential labour market states, namely; unemployment; waged employment; single self-employment, and; job creating self-employment. It then goes on to consider labour market transitions over a four year period between 1991 and 1995. The key findings are firstly that women entrepreneurs are better educated than their male counterparts and secondly that flows into self-employment were considerably higher for men than women. Furthermore, proportionately, three times as many male self-employed in 1991 had gone on to become job creating self-employed by 1995." .

Twenty-six nurses who had experience of workplace bullying were recruited from two Australian public sector health care organizations. Examining the narrative data from the viewpoint of bullying being a corrupt activity we present an alternative perspective on group acts of bullying. By exploring bullying as corrupt behaviour, this paper challenges the assumption that bullying can be principally considered a series of isolated events stemming from interpersonal conflict, organizational pressures, or poor work design. Corruption in organizations has not previously been linked with or compared to bullying. In revealing the manner in which actors can engage in corrupt conduct that includes bullying, the findings from our study offer important implications for the management of workplace bullying as a serious and corrupt activity." .

One commonly used market model is the purchaser–provider split, which implies that purchasers use contracts to control the providers. A hierarchical organizational solution is replaced by a contractual relation. This article shows that creating quasi-markets in public organizations is complicated by the need to balance the market actors’ (the sub-units) autonomy and the efficiency of the entire public organization. The market actors have limited opportunities to work as autonomous units. The initial aim when creating market actors is to reduce their complexity by giving them distinct responsibilities and authorities. Reducing complexity in some parts of the organization, however, seems to cause problems in other parts. In the article, this effect is called quasi-market externalities or “overflows.” The overflows result in less autonomy for the market actor because the market frame has to be changed. Fiscal pressures, volatile political actors and strong professions are sources of overflow and subsequent changes in the market frame. The conclusion is that it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to create and maintain contractual relationships when both parties are dependent on the same principal." .

Therefore, drawing from the extant research in the groups domain, we attempt to ground the definition of a virtual team in well-established group-level constructs, and design a simulation study to investigate the impact of different virtual team characteristics on team performance. Essentially, we argue that the virtual team is defined by three key characteristics—the virtual team context, the virtual team composition, and the virtual team structure. Using the VDT computational discrete event simulation model as our experimental platform, we simulated different virtual team models, and examined their impact on various team performance dimensions. We found that virtual team characteristics have different effects on different aspects of team performance. The virtual context team had a lower rework volume but higher coordination volume and longer project duration than the virtual composition team. Interestingly, we also found that the virtual structure team performed better than the software development team baseline model in all aspects of team performance. Based on these results, we proposed strategies to improve performance in different types of virtual team. Specifically, we propose (1) increasing the ease of communication and availability of routines in the virtual context team; (2) clarifying role expectations and fostering a team culture in the virtual composition team; and (3) implementing a lateral structure in the virtual team. Our results also suggest that firms should consider situational demands, specifically tolerance for errors and coordination volume, when considering the design of virtual teams." .

We examined momentary affect and cortisol from a within-day and between-day perspective, comparing working time to nonworking time for employees in engaging and disengaging workplaces. Findings indicate significantly lower momentary happiness and interest and higher stress and sadness are associated with work, and, in particular, with disengaging work environments. The connections between momentary affect and cortisol confirmed prior research, but cortisol was higher during non-work weekday moments. Employees with engaging work conditions had lower cortisol during weekday (working) mornings in comparison to employees with disengaging work conditions. There was no difference on Saturdays. These results provide evidence that work, and especially the work situation, is associated with affective and physiological momentary states." .

Business organizations, typified by semi-autonomous organizational members interacting at many levels of cognition and action, can be portrayed by the generic constructs and driving mechanisms of complex adaptive systems theory. The purpose of this paper is to forge a unified description of complex adaptive systems from several sources, and then investigate the issue of change in a business organization via the framework of complex adaptive systems. The theory of complex adaptive systems uses components from three paradigms of management thought: systems theory, population ecology, and information processing. Specific propositions regarding the nature of dynamical change will be developed, driven by the complex adaptive systems model. Supporting evidence for these propositions is then sought within the existing management theory literature. In doing so, the complex adaptive systems approach to understanding organization change will be better grounded in domain-specific theory, and new insights and research areas will come to light." .

Through an analysis of some issues and challenges in internationalization on the one hand and an overview of recent developments in quality assurance on the other, our objective is to question how internationalization and quality assurance can be integrated. Internationalization policies and practices are lacking a quality assurance dimension and quality assurance approaches are too much confined to national contexts. Can quality assurance give answers to the challenges facing internationalization and can the introduction of an international dimension give a solution to issues in the field of quality assurance.

As these guides and standards are intended for use by a range of organisations and accreditation bodies, operating in different disciplines, they are written in general terms in order to be widely applicable. It follows that some interpretation of the requirements is needed in order to address the different ways in which both organisations and accreditation bodies operate. This may be seen by accredited organisations as providing an opportunity for accreditation bodies to 'change the goalposts'; the needs of these organisations and of their clients must be accommodated as far as possible, without diminishing the value of, or undermining confidence in, accreditation. The United Kingdom Accreditation Service has been listening to its customers, reviewing its activities and is offering a more flexible pragmatic approach to assessment and accreditation; some of the new developments are described." .

Yet many of the insights found in Bourdieu are being pursued piecemeal, in distinct paradigmatic projects that explore the character of fields, the emergence of organizational habitus, and the changing forms of capital that are key to the control of modern organizations. A number of these programs build on the same sociological classics that Bourdieu built his own theory on. These share the same lineage, even if they were not directly influenced by Bourdieu." .

It is thus essential to characterize the traffic behavior at these sites, a study that will facilitate the design and development of high-performance, reliable e-commerce servers. This paper makes an effort in this direction. Aggregated traffic arriving at a Business-to-Business (B2B) and a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) e-commerce site was collected and analyzed. High degree of self-similarity was found in the traffic (higher than that observed in general Web-environment). Heavy-tailed behavior of transfer times was established at both the sites. Traditionally this behavior has been attributed to the distribution of transfer sizes, which was not the case in B2C space. This implies that the heavy-tailed transfer times are actually caused by the behavior of back-end service time. In B2B space, transfer-sizes were found to be heavy-tailed. A detailed study of the traffic and load at theback-end servers was also conducted and the inferences are included in this paper." .

Applying the core as a solution concept, we analyze which market structure(s) remain(s) stable when three firms—two symmetric private firms and one inefficient public firm—are allowed to merge with each other in a mixed Cournot industry. We show that according to the value of the marginal cost of the public firm, there always exists a pair of share ratios of the owners of both the (pre-merged) public firm and the (pre-merged) private firm such that the market structure with the merger between the public firm and one private firm belongs to the core. When the initial market structure is a mixed triopoly, it can only be blocked when one public firm and one private firm merge. Furthermore, we conduct a similar analysis in a general mixed oligopoly with one public firm and n private firms." .

The paper begins by reviewing my own experience. This is expressed as anecdote from my diary. Following this, the downside of e-work is argued to be characterized by atomization and fragmentation and is depicted under four headings: being an e-worker, engaging with work as an e-worker, contextualizing experience as an e-worker, and managing self and work as an e-worker. This section is followed by a brief review of how this downside has been achieved. The paper then goes on to discuss two models for developing the e-work process beyond the current debacle. The first model is one based on conventional practices and is concentrated on relieving the pressure. This conventional approach is also referred to as the “provision for...” model. The model deals with providing technologies and inducements and meeting expenses of e-workers as fragmented elements of the workforce. It is a patchwork quilt of piecemeal planning. The second model, arising from the research behind the paper, involves thinking again—Where might we be? The process develops an “invitation to join...” model, focusing on relationships. The paper goes on to describe a process for developing a systemic approach to e-work and non-e-work for large organizations and a means for applying the systemic development of e-work in full, and not just gesture. The paper concludes with an overview of the key learning points emergent from the research to date. Concerning the style of the paper, it is set out in the form of a Kolb learning cycle—this is the overarching methodology applied to the enquiry as a whole." .

As a general rule, this literature points to the leader being either the most efficient, the largest or the best informed player. However, there tend to be exceptions to this rule and it is unclear who will become the leader when firms at the same time are different in size, efficiency of production and/or the quality of the information they have. The present paper reveals insights regarding this last question. As such, it points to the elements “that really matter” to explain for leadership when firms are different from each other in more than one respect. It turns out that the most efficient firm becomes the leader, regardless whether or not its rival has invested in more capacity. While this result tends to be in line with the previous findings regarding the identity of the leader being the relatively more efficient firm, it contradicts the “dominant firm” scenario regarding price leadership. This is the result of enlarging the strategy space of the players, by including a buyout option. As such, the paper provides the foundations and hence a theoretical justification for price leadership out of a collusive motive. Since a priori the model also does not exclude a barometric price leadership outcome, it is appropriate to conclude that the buyout option truly is a collusive device strong enough to suppress other reasons for price leadership. Therefore, the arrangements observed in reality aiming at the implementation of buyout possibilities have to be watched very closely from an antitrust perspective." .

The role of self-directedness is considered paramount in maintaining one’s employability. However, it also requires certain competences on part of employees to invest in learning and career development. This study examines the influence of self-directedness in learning and career of low-qualified employees on their employability. In a follow-up study of 284 low-qualified employees, we find that higher levels of self-directedness in learning and career of employees corresponds with higher chance to be promoted to higher-level job positions (vertical job mobility). However, no relationship was found between different formats of self-directedness and job retention or horizontal job mobility of lower qualified personnel." .

Both globalization of markets and stronger regulation throughout the world puts pressure on banking firms to either spend more money coordinating business activities in the traditional hierarchical ways or to employ new forms of organizations enabled by (lower costs of) IT. When facing uncertain demand in multiple horizontal markets, resource allocation problems occur. Accordingly, the location of decision authority in a multilevel hierarchical organization has profound impact on the performance of the firm. The firm has to design its coordination structure, which determines who makes the resource allocation decisions. Considering the tradeoff between pooling effects in the case of centralized decision-making and better assessment of local markets in the case of decentralized decision-making, the decision problem where to locate decision rights to maximize total profits has to be solved. In this paper we investigate for both independent and dependent demands the total profits for each of the possible coordination mechanisms: centralized decision-making, decentralized decision-making, and intermediate-level decision-making. It turns out that—depending on the crucial parameters of the firm—decentralized decision-making or centralized decision-making may be optimal. But in many relevant cases the optimal location of decision rights is at an intermediate level of the hierarchy. We illustrate the findings by considering the banking firm coordinating equity capital allocation by granting alternative decision rights to their employees as participants on electronic financial markets. Finally we discuss the generality of the approach and its applicability in other areas such as inventory management." .

Fifty eight female sales clerks filled out a questionnaire which assessed their perceptions with respect to the fairness of the two evaluation methods and their job satisfaction. Given apparent differences in the evaluating agent, the extent of process consistency, the breadth of behaviors evaluated, and the extent of employees' awareness of the evaluation process, we hypothesize and find that evaluation procedures conducted by supervisors are perceived as more fair both procedurally and distributively than those conducted by means of the mystery customer method.The expected relationship between perception of fairness and job satisfaction was, however, foundonly in the correlations with supervisor evaluations and not in the correlations with the mystery customer evaluation method. Though the results are limited by the restricted sample, they shed an important light on the perceived fairness of the mystery customer procedure, and suggest that the choice of this procedure should take into account the fairness aspect of it when assessing its effectiveness and value." .

Having knowledge of client values within contracting services in the post disaster situation, service providers are able to provide better service in the disaster rebuild environment. The construction management literature is focused on business-as-usual construction and its relative values, rather than post disaster reconstruction. The objective of this paper is to explore the most important client values within contractor’s services in post disaster reconstruction situations from public and private sector clients’ perspectives. The study includes a literature review and questionnaire survey. Key client values within contracting services under the nine Project Management Institute knowledge management categories were identified. These values can be used as a basis for developing good practice for reconstruction following a disaster. As part of a aim to develop an assessment tool towards improving client value, by providing better contracting services, a client value index is proposed." .

Our study suggests that in spite of the rapid expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area, central business districts still function as centers of the industry and transportation system; the agglomeration of most industrial subsectors are occurring in central areas and only primary and manufacturing sectors’ clusters are located out of these areas; both of subway and road networks show higher level of accessibility in central Seoul and big cities. This implies a strong relationship between the industrial agglomeration and the transport accessibility, and such hypothetical relationship is tested for every industrial subsector using logit analysis. Our findings indicate that although there are industrial variations in the magnitude of impacts and the significance level, transport networks are, in general, positively associated with industrial agglomeration and this is especially true for service sectors." .

National and international strategies have been considered to attempt to overcome the most prominent hazards while patients are receiving health care. Thereby, clinical risk management (CRM) plays a dominant role in enabling the identification, analysis, and management of potential risks. CRM implementation into routine procedures within complex hospital organizations is challenging, as in the past, organizational change strategies using a top-down approach have often failed. Therefore, one of our main objectives was to educate a certain number of risk managers in facilitating CRM using a bottom-up approach. MethodsTo achieve our primary purpose, five project strands were developed, and consequently followed, introducing CRM: corporate governance, risk management (RM) training, CRM process, information, and involvement. The core part of the CRM process involved the education of risk managers within each organizational unit. To account for the size of the existing organization, we assumed that a minimum of 1 % of the workforce had to be trained in RM to disseminate the continuous improvement of quality and safety. Following a roll-out plan, CRM was introduced in each unit and potential risks were identified. ResultsAlongside the changes in the corporate governance, a hospital-wide CRM process was introduced resulting in 158 trained risk managers correlating to 2.0 % of the total workforce. Currently, risk managers are present in every unit and have identified 360 operational risks. Among those, 176 risks were scored as strategic and clustered together into top risks. Effective meeting structures and opportunities to share information and knowledge were introduced. Thus far, 31 units have been externally audited in CRM. ConclusionThe CRM approach is unique with respect to its dimension; members of all health care professions were trained to be able to identify potential risks. A network of risk managers supported the centrally coordinated CRM process. There is a strong commitment among management, academia, clinicians, and administration to foster cooperation. The introduction of CRM led to a visible shift with regard to patient safety culture throughout the entire organization. Still, there is a long way to go to keep people engaged in CRM and work on national and international patient safety initiatives to continuously decrease potential hazards." .

Such concerns should be reflected in the strategic planning of sustainable corporations. Strategic intentions of this nature are operationalized through the adoption of a long-term focus and a more inclusive set of responsibilities focusing on ethical practices, employees, environment, and customers. A central hypothesis, that we test in this paper is that companies which attend to this set of responsibilities under the term superior sustainable practices, have higher financial performance compared to those that do not engage in such practices. The target population of this study consists of the top 100 sustainable global companies in 2008 which have been selected from a universe of 3,000 firms from the developed countries and emerging markets. We find significant higher mean sales growth, return on assets, profit before taxation, and cash flows from operations in some activity sectors of the sample companies compared to the control companies over the period of 2006–2010. Furthermore, our findings show that the higher financial performance of sustainable companies has increased and been sustained over the sample. Notwithstanding sample limitation, causal evidence reported in this paper suggests that, there is bi-directional relationship between corporate social responsibilities practices and corporate financial performance." .

We offer a new measure of entrepreneurship which accounts for variations in persistence in self-employment and as a result avoids the weakness of approaches which categorise an individual as an entrepreneur by observing their occupation at just one point in their career. We outline an econometric methodology to account for this approach and find, via a statistical test of model selection, that it is superior to probit/logit models, which have dominated the literature. While our results indicate that this existing literature is good at explaining an individual’s propensity to try self-employment, we find that entrepreneurial persistence is determined by a different model and unearth some new insights. Early self-employment encourages entrepreneurial persistence. For men, inheritance encourages persistence, and facilitates initial self-employment. Having a self-employed father as a role model makes sons persist longer. However, somewhat surprisingly, early experience of unemployment does not affect the probability of self-employment, while reducing persistence. The popular ‘unemployment push effect’ is thus rejected in our sample." .

We examined all U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation files in 1984-89 in 47 U.S. states of fatal injuries in the chemical industry, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2800–2899. OSHA investigates all reported deaths over which it has jurisdiction; this includes most causes of work-related death except for homicide and motor vehicle crashes. For the 6 year period, there were 234 fatalities in the chemical industry, for a work-related fatality rate of 0.55 per 10,000 workers/year. The largest category of deaths was from explosions, with 99 (42%), followed by fire & burns, with 32 (14%), poisoning, with 31 (13%), and falls, with 18 (8%). Of the 99 deaths from explosions, 45 (45%) involved manufacture or handling of fireworks or other explosives. The fatality rate at firms with fewer than 50 employees was more than twice that of larger firms (P < 0.05) and employees at small firms were less likely to have been covered by a union contract (P < 0.05). OSHA issued citations for safety violations in 73% of the deaths. While regulatory authorities and the media often focus attention on large, multinational chemical corporations, the highest worker fatality rates are found at the smallest chemical firms." .

Three different approaches, modified from Kauffman's NK model, are proposed. Each model includes controllable parameters whose values reflect the amount of interaction among the workers as well as the skill and variance of the leader in achieving cooperation. Computer simulations are used to show how the skill level and variance of the leader affect the expected performance of the team. Managerial insights into the value of the leader—such as the fact that finding a more skillful leader can be more important to team performance than controlling the amount of interaction among the team members—are provided." .

Contestants are ranked in descending order based on their perceived performance, which is subject to random perturbation, and they are rewarded based on their ranks. Under plausible conditions, we establish that our noisy performance ranking model is stochastically equivalent to the family of multi-prize lottery contests built upon ratio-form contest success functions. We further establish the equivalence of our model to a contest model that ranks contestants by their best performance out of multiple independent attempts. These results therefore shed light on the micro-foundations of the popularly adopted lottery contest models. The “best-shot ranking rule” reveals a common thread that connects a broad class of seemingly disparate competitive activities (such as rent-seeking contests, patent races, research tournaments), and unifies them through a common performance evaluation mechanism." .

A number of reasons for this fact are given. Clients of laboratories do not specify methodology, which may lead to the application of systematically different methods or to methodology with improper performance characteristics. Laboratories do not always validate methodology sufficiently which is, however, among others provoked by a lack of reference materials. It is argued that accreditation cannot enforce comparability on itself, but needs to be embedded in a “measurement infrastructure”. The quality systems which underly accreditation form a basic element. In addition, adequate methods, good laboratory performance studies and certified reference materials are required." .

In this article, we propose an extension for the business process modelling notation to express non-functional authorisations requirements in a process model to enable the collaboration between security experts and business analysts. To capture multi-level, role-based and Separation of Duty authorisation requirements, new model element attributes and authorisation artefacts are introduced. To enhance the usability of this approach, simple visual decorators are specified to ease the communication of requirements between various stakeholders. To provide an early validation of these authorisation requirements during the definition of a process model, formal semantics are applied to the process model and model-checking techniques are used to provide feedback. As a pragmatic proof-of-concepts, a first prototype implementation is briefly discussed." .

The advantages of embedding cooperative outsourcing in strategic alliances are then addressed, with special relevance to small and medium-size firms. Five types of network structures that may develop within alliances are considered, relating their main characteristics and internal division of labor to various aspects of interfirm cooperation, such as embeddedness, disparities, commitment and trust." .

Many employers are increasingly acting as “social arbiters”—regulators of the private conduct, personal behaviors, and habits of their employees. Relying on historical perspectives from (1) an exchange transaction economic view of the employment relationship, and (2) the origins and nature of the corporate form, a framework is developed to analyze the conditions under which employer involvement in employee personal matters may be appropriate. Our criteria generally guide an employer to act conservatively in invoking mandatory policies that affect employees' personal lives unless there is a clear individual employee performance problem or the personal behavior imposes harm on employees or customers. Two tests should be satisfied for mandatory programs: (1) the policy must have a discernible impact on the employee's performance on the current job based on individually based data, or (2) the behavior poses an immediate danger to or has an established discernible impact on the safety of co-workers or customers. The difficulties that may arise in administering specific polices such as no smoking, drug and medical testing, child care, and fitness policies are discussed." .

The aggregate environment resulting from self-interested, objective function-maximizing decision rules on wages, productivity gains, savings and investment, is described by a two-dimensional dynamical system in the employment rate and output/capital ratio. The economy converges cyclically to a long-run equilibrium involving a Harrod-neutral profile of technical change, a constant rate of employment of labor, and constant input shares. The type of oscillations predicted by the model is qualitatively consistent with the available data on the United States (1963–2003), replicates the dynamics found in earlier models of growth cycles such as Goodwin (A growth cycle, in C.H. Feinstein (ed). Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1967. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1967); Shah and Desai (Econ J 91:1006–1010, 1981); van der Ploeg (J Macroecon 9:1–12, 1987); Flaschel (J Econ: Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie 44:63–69, 1984) and Sportelli (J Econ: Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie 61(1):35–64, 1995), and can be verified numerically in simulations. Institutional change, as captured by variations in workers’ bargaining power, has a positive effect on the long-run rate of growth of output per worker but a negative effect on long-run employment. Economic policy can also affect the growth and distribution pattern through changes in the unemployment compensation, which also have a positive long-run impact on labor productivity growth but a negative long-run impact on employment. In both cases, employment can overshoot its new equilibrium value along the transitional dynamics." .

During the last years, the business process management and the production/operations management communities have proposed numerous approaches that investigate how to valuate and determine an appropriate level of process flexibility. Most of these approaches are very restrictive regarding their application domain, neglect characteristics of the involved processes and outputs other than demand and capacity, and do not conduct a thorough economic analysis of process flexibility. Against this backdrop, the authors propose an optimization model that determines an appropriate level of process flexibility in line with the principles of value-based business process management. The model includes demand uncertainty, variability, criticality, and similarity as process characteristics. The paper also reports on the insights gained from applying the optimization model to the coverage switching processes of an insurance broker pool company." .

We examine the managerial and technical challenges of designing adequate evaluation and the tension of collecting adequate data without a fully functional, deployed system. The CALO project was a seminal multi-institution effort to develop a personalized cognitive assistant. It included a significant attempt to rigorously quantify learning capability, which this article discusses for the first time, and ultimately the project led to multiple spin-outs including Siri. Retrospection on negative and positive experiences over the 6 years of the project underscores best practice in evaluating user-adaptive systems. Lessons for knowledge system evaluation include: the interests of multiple stakeholders, early consideration of evaluation and deployment, layered evaluation at system and component levels, characteristics of technology and domains that determine the appropriateness of controlled evaluations, implications of ‘in-the-wild’ versus variations of ‘in-the-lab’ evaluation, and the effect of technology-enabled functionality and its impact upon existing tools and work practices. In the conclusion, we discuss—through the lessons illustrated from this case study of intelligent knowledge system evaluation—how development and infusion of innovative technology must be supported by adequate evaluation of its efficacy." .

Researchers have widely argued that organizations that are engaged in collaborative processes create value. Because researchers have tended to focus on the identification of organizational motivations and on key success factors for collaboration, however, both the nature and processes of value creation in inter-organizational collaboration have yet to be examined. A recent theory by Austin and Seitanidi (Nonprofit Volunt Sect Q 41(5):726–758, 2012a; Nonprofit Volunt Sect Q 41(6):929–968, 2012b) has proposed an analytical framework for analyzing value creation in inter-organizational collaboration, based on four types of value. The purpose of this current study is to empirically test this framework, and to provide key pointers for analyzing the nature of value, particularly in relation to learning. Our detailed empirical research is based on a 6-year retrospective case study of an inter-organizational partnership within an international development project for local economic development in Guatemala. The study’s contributions are twofold. First, it provides evidence of the critical path of the creation of diverse types of values in a collaborative process; second, it links the different types of value creation with the types of learning that occur in an inter-organizational process." .

I argue that high-tech companies take advantage of the inherent fear in production employees to organize in order to defeat unionization campaigns. That is, they negatively affect employee support for unionization through the development of inhibiting conditions of the emotional path of the Wheeler–McClendon theory to prevent unionization. The use of this widespread strategy is crucial for understanding such low rates of unionization in this industry." .

Utilizing data from the 1995 through 2007 Current Population Surveys, unadjusted earnings are highest in the private nonprofit sector and lowest in private for-profit firms. Once measurable characteristics are accounted for, health practitioners in for-profit and nonprofit hospitals earn similar wages while public sector workers earn small but significant wage penalties. Nonprofit hospitals tend to attract workers with higher levels of skill as measured by schooling and potential experience. This could be explained in part by worker sorting and lower cost containment incentives in nonprofit hospitals. Wage change analysis using pooled 2-year panels constructed from the CPS indicate no significant differences in earnings between the three sectors of employment. Whatever the role of the sector of employment on the overall earnings of hospital workers, there is sufficient worker mobility within the industry to largely eliminate systematic wage differences across type of hospital." .

This study offers a pair-wise cross-case analysis of the transitioning of Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) and Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) to become entrepreneurial universities through the Corporate Helix model. POSTECH and SKKU demonstrated divergent routes but convergent outcomes in technological catch-up during the double helix formation stage. Through the relationship triad POSTECH shares with the Industry and Government after being established by Pohang Steel Company, it has been committed to launching Korea into the forefront of innovative science and technology in the twenty-first century. As a result of its acquisition and intensive investment from Samsung for almost over two decades, SKKU has become one of the top schools in South Korea while interacting closely with the industry and government to cultivate the efficacy of South Korea’s national innovation system. The Corporate Helix model takes into account the university which lacks the resources and capability to become entrepreneurial and to participate in a nation’s technological catch-up to innovation-based growth. The cases of POSTECH and SKKU offer key propositions that a university can be established or acquired by the industry and through this partnership undergo transformation to become entrepreneurial.

It offers a view of related theory and a preliminary analysis of “request for quotation” documents. On this basis, several hypotheses are formulated. A questionnaire survey and structural equation modeling (SEM) are then used to test the hypotheses. The analysis shows that adaptations by logistics service providers exert positive influences on performance and customer loyalty. On the other hand, there is a negative impact of customers’ adaptations on performance because own adaptations are perceived as an effort. Nevertheless, the study provides evidence that the total effect of customers’ adaptations on customer loyalty is positive. The results suggest that third-party logistics providers should adapt systems and procedures to their customers’ specific requirements. Despite the negative impact found of customers’ adaptations upon the level of perceived performance, providers should promote moderate customers’ adaptations in order to increase customer loyalty." .

Achieved goals and levels of quality can be successfully measured by a multidimensional approach like Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The aim of the study was to verify the opportunity to introduce BSC framework to measure performance in St. Anna University Hospital of Ferrara, applying it to the Clinical Laboratory Operative Unit in order to compare over time performance results and achievements of assigned targets. MethodsIn the first experience with BSC we distinguished four perspectives, according to Kaplan and Norton, identified Key Performance Areas and Key Performance Indicators, set standards and weights for each objective, collected data for all indicators, recognized cause-and-effect relationships in a strategic map. One year later we proceeded with the next data collection and analysed the preservation of framework aptitude to measure Operative Unit performance. In addition, we verified the ability to underline links between strategic actions belonging to different perspectives in producing outcomes changes. ResultsThe BSC was found to be effective for underlining existing problems and identifying opportunities for improvements. The BSC also revealed the specific perspective contribution to overall performance enhancement. After time results comparison was possible depending on the selection of feasible and appropriate key performance indicators, which was occasionally limited by data collection problems. ConclusionsThe first use of BSC to compare performance at Operative Unit level, in course of time, suggested this framework can be successfully adopted for results measuring and revealing effective health factors, allowing health-care quality improvements." .

The defensive strategies employed by these two businesses to deal with allegations of crime will be analysed on the basis of Stanley Cohen’s theoretical work on processes of denial and neutralisation techniques. This paper will focus on a particular form of denial, namely the appeal to higher loyalties, whereby the businesses try to explain why they have been doing business despite the risks that this has involved. The paper links together the companies’ communications with the contexts in which they occur and the structures that might be expected to influence how the companies choose to frame their communications. The presence of the corporations in areas where crimes have been committed is not denied, but implicatory denials are employed to justify the corporations’ operations by referring to the societal benefits of their business activities. When the corporations frame their businesses as contributing to development, democracy and peace in the countries in which they operate, the corporations use well-known discourses that underline Swedish or Nordic generosity, helpfulness and decency. Thus, the analysis also draws on post-colonial theory and the image of the Nordic countries as being particularly “good” in relation to the rest of the world." .

In the modern highly competitive transportation branch freight forwarders reduce their fulfillment costs by exploiting different execution modes (self-fulfillment and subcontraction). For self-fulfillment they use their own vehicles to execute the requests and for subcontracting they forward the orders to external freight carriers. Further enhancement of competitiveness can be achieved if the freight forwarders cooperate in coalitions in order to balance their request portfolios. Participation in such a coalition gains additional profit for the entire coalition and for each participant, therefore reinforcing the market position of the partners. The integrated operational transport problem as well as existing collaboration approaches are introduced. The presented model for collaboration is based on theoretical foundations in the field of combinatorial auctions and operational research game theory. It is applicable for coalitions of freight forwarders, especially for the collaboration of Profit Centres within large freight forwarding companies. The proposed theoretical approach and the presented collaboration model are suitable for a coalition of freight forwarding companies with nearly similar potential on the market." .

The paper has two primary research aims: (i) to investigate the recent transformation of the Prato industrial district through the foundings and failure flows of its firms’ populations, and (ii) to examine the co-evolution and reciprocal influences between the populations of the district’s Italian and Chinese firms. Through an in-depth study of the foundings and failures that have occurred in Chinese and Italian textile and clothing firms over the last two decades, this study develops analysis of demographic and organisational ecology, and investigates the processes of legitimation and competition. The results of the study indicate that the district’s Italian and Chinese firms experienced two distinct evolutionary phases during the research period: while the former declined, the latter saw development in spite of recent economic crises. The analyses also demonstrate how the evolution of Italian and Chinese populations moved in opposite directions: as the first failed, the second saw increases in the number of its foundings. This indicates the presence of a substitution effect between each firms’ population at the district level." .

We look at the response of the real interest rate to innovations in the banks' technology and in the nonbank firms' technology. While technological innovations in the nonbanking sector put upward pressure on the interest rate, technological innovations in banks exert downward pressure on the interest rate. This implies that, if the technological innovations in banks are strong enough, stochastic simulation experiments generate negative correlations between the real interest rate and current and future values of real output. This is especially significant because negative correlations between the interest rate and output are a key post-war U.S. business cycle fact difficult to replicate in benchmark dynamic models." .

It argues that the relationship between market turbulence and sustainability is mediated by network embeddedness, and this mediating role in turn is moderated by a firm’s innovative orientation. Data collected from a sample of Ontario restaurants inform predictions about firms’ propensity to adopt local wines in their portfolios, despite the limited market and normative support that these wines receive compared with imported wines. The study shows that market turbulence enhances sustainable firm behavior, through the development of strong network relationships. Furthermore, the mediating effect of network embeddedness is particularly salient among firms that exhibit a stronger innovative orientation. These findings reveal how and when turbulent market conditions can contribute to a firm’s sustainable behaviors in the presence of limited institutional support for such behaviors." .

The four facets of citizenship—civil, political, industrial, and social—impinge in a variety of ways on the employment relationship. Civil citizenship, by barring discrimination on account of race or sex, interferes with maintenance of segregated pools of cheap secondary labor. Political citizenship enfranchises propertyless workers and alters the enactments of legislatures. Industrial citizenship creates the institutional basis for collective bargaining. Social citizenship confers economic benefits and protective regulations not driven directly by market forces. Political ascendancy of laissez-faire advocates undermines rights of citizenship and has a retrograde effect on industrial relations." .

Additionally, we study the robustness of such forward-looking strategic heuristic against aggressive selfish strategic heuristic called vindictive bidding. We investigate three types of such bidding strategies and substantiate that the pure Nash equilibrium still exists under two types even if there is an arbitrary portion of vindictive bidders." .

There is concern that these approaches are constantly undermining the mission of community service nonprofit organizations (Darcy, 2002). In this research, we analyzed the management of funding relationships by examining dynamics within a nonprofit funding relationship in New Zealand. Through focus groups we explored the relationship between 17 representatives from nonprofit organizations and four Board members of a funding Trust. The management of this funding relationship was characterized by an appreciation of the diverse nature of nonprofit organizations, a balance between trust and control, and communication. We suggest that elements of these dynamics could be incorporated into nonprofit funding relationships in order to challenge an over-reliance on audit culture systems, and to re-establish relationships characterized by interaction between nonprofit organizations and their funders. Finally, we call for future research in this area." .

A literature review was conducted in order to develop an integrative model of the phenomenon under study. Three sets of internal variables were identified in the literature which seemed to explain why a firm would follow a born global, rather than a traditional, internationalization process: firm, network, and entrepreneur variables. The final conceptual model was tested in a Brazilian sample of 79 software firms, of which 35 followed the born-global process of internationalization and 44 followed the traditional process. Logistic regression was used to test the research hypotheses. Results showed that certain firm and entrepreneur variables seemed to be associated to the type of internationalization process chosen by these firms. Network variables did not significantly differentiate the two groups." .

Despite the fact that women business owners comprise a significant portion of the economy, women face challenges in acquiring the resources needed to expand their businesses. This article details both the myths and realities associated with women’s entrepreneurship in their quest for growth. In particular, we examine the strategies that women entrepreneurs use to position their firms for growth, especially those strategies related to growth capital. Our results show that women seeking venture capital (VC) have degrees, graduate degrees, and experience that should not preclude them from obtaining financing. We also found that even though women-led businesses are frequently clustered in industries less attractive to financiers, women seeking equity funding are in the appropriate industries. Further, women spend a considerable amount of time using both formal and informal networks in their search for capital and in seeking capital. Because of the importance of the VC industry as a provider of growth capital and its reliance on its network for investment referrals, we also examined the participation and role of women as decision-makers in industry. Women’s participation in the VC industry has not kept pace with industry growth, and women have exited the industry at a faster rate than men, thus creating a significant barrier for women entrepreneurs in that it is less likely that their networks will overlap with the financial supplier networks, despite any effort they may expend networking and seeking capital." .

In order to reduce the flood risks in Europe on a sustainable basis, the European Union adopted the Flood Risk Management Directive in 2007. The implementation of the directive in the national laws of all member states has laid the foundation for intergovernmental integrated flood risk management on an European scale. The following article is intended to compare and briefly assess the implementation process on inland waters at the technical level in selected European countries in the middle of the process. It covers the different basic structural, methodological, and data conditions for preparing the preliminary flood risk assessment, the flood hazard maps, the flood risk maps, and the flood risk management plans as a result of two EU projects. The technical differences in the various European countries need to be reduced in the next cycles of implementation of the Flood Risk Management Directive." .

Hence, within the store, all of the products are not available on shelf for sales either because the replenishment of the shelf from the backroom is subject to execution errors that mainly result in products lost in the backroom or products misplaced on the other shelves of the store. We compare two situations: in the first situation, the two supply chain actors are aware of errors and optimize their ordering decisions by taking into account this issue. The second situation deals with the case where an advanced automatic identification system such as the Radio Frequency Identification technology is deployed in order to eliminate errors. Each situation is developed for three scenarios: in the centralized scenario, we consider a single decision-maker who is concerned with maximizing the entire supply chain’s profit; in the decentralized uncoordinated scenario, the retailer and the manufacturer act as different parties and do not cooperate. The third scenario is the decentralized coordinated scenario where we give conditions for coordinating the channel by designing a buyback contract." .

Many companies are now involved in on-line retailing of goods and services to consumers through the Web. In some industries, business partnerships are being fostered in order to broaden the scope of their markets. One example is the telecommunications industry, where changes in business structure, spirited by deregulation, have resulted in alliances amongst different communications providers, including new players like the utilities and entertainment providers. In this environment, business processes may involve multiple co-operating entities and, supporting such interorganizational business processes can be achieved through the use of workflow management systems. In this paper, we present an approach for designing interorganizational workflows that supports co-operation of business partners, while preserving the autonomy of the partner organizations." .

The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is initiated by His Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. The philosophy reflecting the principle of Thai culture is a method of development on the three foundations of moderation, reasonableness, and self-immunity. These three bases are performed with the provision of knowledge and integrity as well as the intelligence and perseverance leading to the true happiness or progress of the organization. The philosophy has been increasingly recognized. Thailand’s Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (2012–2016) has included this philosophy as a guideline for private and public sectors. Noticeably, there are many studies and research on the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy in various areas including individual levels, public and private sector levels. Purchasing as a strategic sourcing contributes a great deal in the organizations. Strategic sourcing emphasizes the four elements of strategic orientation, cross-functional team, process-driven approach, and supply base management. Purchasing is one of the most important logistics activities, as an original upstream function of the supply chains. In addition, it is also closely related to other logistics activities such as transportation, customer service, etc. Literatures reveal several actions and strategies in purchasing that are consistent with the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. In spite of several research on this philosophy, there is a limited number of studies focused mainly on the application in organizational purchasing. Therefore, these provide a good venue for this research. This research investigates how organizations can use the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy in purchasing activities. As for the methodology, firstly the researcher reviews the literatures from books, articles, and research on the ‘Philosophy of Sufficiency Economy’, strategic sourcing and sustainable sourcing in order to analyze the linkage of the Philosophy of Sufficiency Economy and purchasing. Secondly, document analysis is used as a qualitative research method, which the documents such as the annual reports of the companies that adopt the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy are investigated to evidence such a linkage. The finding section proposes the conceptual model for purchasing based on the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy. The model expects that the three foundations and the two conditions of the philosophy can be applied with organizational purchasing. Finally, further research directions and limitations are discussed." .

In this study, we aim to create a broader understanding about business perspectives of forestry service markets covering the whole array of market and institutional based services offered to the NIPFs in case of Finland. The more specific empirical objective of the paper is to describe market drivers and underlying challenges in existing and potential service business models based on the concepts of service-dominant logic and dynamic capabilities. Using a qualitative approach and 22 thematic expert interviews in service organisations, we strive to analyse the drivers and opportunities for creating new services within the NIPF market and also build insight in possible barriers for new service value creation. According to our results, the ongoing structural changes offer new opportunities to change traditional mindsets and search for new types of offerings that support the renewal of this traditional forestry sector. As one of the major barriers for new innovations we identified the dominant role of established organisations securing their current positions, mainly driven by the forest industry timber procurement needs. From a managerial perspective, the changing institutional base of the current service organisations may facilitate new innovative business start-ups in addition to enhancing the strategic capabilities and competitiveness of the established firms in Finnish forestry sector." .

Trademarks may become associated with a favorable public recognition and evaluation that sustains the advantages from a horizontally differentiated market position. A favorable public assessment appears more important for firms in service sectors where production exhibits usually more experience characteristics than in manufacturing and for firms with vertically-differentiating product innovation. Using data from the 2011 German innovation survey, we find that for firms in service sectors, the use of trademarks increases the probability that the firm’s products and services are not easily substitutable by rival ones. This product-differentiating effect of trademarks in services is present for firms with new-to-the-market product innovation but not for firms without product innovation. This suggests that trademarks supplement the appropriation of product innovation rents in services. The number of trademarks exhibits a product-differentiating effect for service sector firms with imitative new-to-the-firm product innovation, which suggests differentiation due to proliferating product variants. Regarding firms in manufacturing sectors, trademarks do not show a conclusive product-differentiating effect." .

As time has progressed, with new issues affecting the supply chain and the performance metrics being continually rewritten, the responsibility of the information systems has increased manifold. Nowadays, information systems are expected to perform a number of functions such as information security, big data handling, green supply chain and risk management and thus the basic problem of system selection is now more complex. Also, adding to the complexity is the fact that these new issues are interdependent and most of the times influence other issues in a variety of direct or indirect ways. This study addresses this problem by proposing a new model for information system selection by incorporating the latest trends in the supply chain. It also proposes an integrated methodology, to solve such a problem where interdependence between criteria exists. The advantages of this methodology over other existing techniques are delinking the evaluation of interdependent criteria weights from performance evaluation, flexibility of inputs, ability to handle vagueness and uncertainty in judgements. The methodology is illustrated using a numerical example." .

It was predicted that such a comparison may boost the test performance of both groups of students rather than comparison with their counterparts who are not stigmatized. In line with this hypothesis, we found that female European students (Study 1) performed better on a math test when they were led to compare with a female immigrant rather than with another female European student. Study 2 replicated this finding in regard to the performance of native students with low socioeconomic status on a general intelligence test. Results are discussed in terms of stereotype susceptibility predicaments and their implications for native-immigrant performance gaps." .

Using the WISE of Pro-Love for marginalized women as a case study, the article examines the meaning of employment and social disadvantage in the organization. The ethnographic data reveal that while the WISE encourages women to participate in the paid labor market, it constructs employment in the social enterprise as part-time jobs for supplementary family income, restricts the extension of social networks for the female workers, and reinforces the cultural stereotypes of marginalized women. The study reflects on the mechanisms of the project of WISE in the welfare contexts of Hong Kong, and argues that programs targeted at labor participation cannot be automatically translated into reduction of exclusion in other domains. Long-term planning, policy coordination, and social advocacy are necessary to achieve social integration." .

We draw on a recent survey of US SMEs to determine whether entrepreneurial ventures have dynamic capabilities, and, if so, whether differences in the characteristics of those ventures lead to differences in how dynamic capabilities benefit firm performance. We find that most entrepreneurial ventures report having such capabilities and that their differences in age and size lead to differences in how dynamic capabilities affect firm performance. We consider how these results redefine the overlap of the dynamic capabilities view literature with the entrepreneurship literature, because the redeployment of resources to create and adapt to opportunities that defines what are dynamic capabilities lies at the core of what is entrepreneurial activity." .

The paper exposes fresh perspectives about the management of hospitals and CDs, and suggests that the most important axis on which hospital decision-making rests continues to be profession rather than the CD, even though CDs are designed at least in part to mitigate professional tribalism and bridge professional divides. In empiricising social structural and cultural theories it seems clear that changes to the prescribed organisational framework, which CDs represent, have had negligible effects on behaviour. This being the case, the paper questions the benefits alleged to have accrued from establishing CDs and calls for more effective, micro-behavioural change strategies than merely altering the structure." .

Our inquiry is informed by findings of US scholars that show that the adoption of a recommended set of volunteer management practices is related to the level of effectiveness achieved with volunteer involvement in NPOs. The paper advances a path model to explain volunteer program effectiveness, with volunteer management practices the crucial intermediate variable. Based on data collected in a survey of Almaty (Kazakhstan) NPOs in 2004, the empirical analysis yields considerable support for a path model that focuses on both the adoption of these practices and the attainment of program effectiveness. Given the heterogeneity of NPOs, not every organization can be expected to benefit from the adoption of the recommended practices. Nevertheless, results suggest that they offer one workable means for successfully integrating volunteers." .

To analyse and abate this predicament, the organisers of the end-of-project Conference put together a game-like experiment, asking students and other participants to think innovatively by answering the question “in how many ways can you peel an apple?”. The surprising results have verified the expectations from the test. The list of the more than 100 replies received is dominated by very innovative, especially mid-to-high-tech (50%), as well as unconventional, such as lateral thinking (10–20%) ones, whereas the low-to-mid tech responses (less than 1/3 of the total) appear to cover functional niches.

In the short term, however, organisations operate in a stochastic environment as operational variability arises. This variability leads to the occurrence of unexpected events such as employee absenteeism and/or a demand for personnel that is higher or lower than expected. In order to deal with these uncertainties, organisations need to adopt proactive and reactive scheduling strategies to protect the personnel roster and to respond to this operational variability, respectively. In this paper, we discuss a proactive approach that exploits the concept of employee substitutability to improve the flexibility of a personnel shift roster to respond to schedule disruptions. We propose a pre-emptive programming approach to construct a medium-term personnel shift roster that maximises the employee substitutability value. Moreover, we assess different proactive strategies to introduce robustness with respect to the definition and formulation of employee substitutability and different reactive strategies that impact the decision freedom for schedule recovery. The robustness of the generated personnel shift rosters is evaluated using a three-step methodology of roster construction, daily simulation and optimisation, and evaluation." .

It showed that embedded relationship, embedded structure and embedded resource in enterprise organization network can effectively improve the enterprise’s knowledge management capability, bringing significant promotion in technological innovation performance. Wherein, the embedded relationship and embedded resource can promote not only the technological innovation performance of the enterprise, but also the performance by improving the knowledge management ability of the enterprise.

This paper analyzes the design of optimal divisional structure within an organization where ex post bargaining between the potential divisional managers is possible. In much the same light as Aghion and Tirole (J Political Econ 105(1):1–29, 1997), we study the control problem in the context of search for projects. Our model shows that when the managers cannot bargain with one another, internal integration is preferred to internal separation. Where bargaining is possible, formal divisional structure defines both the ex post bargaining position of the two managers and their incentive to search ex ante. When the managers tend to arrive at a more favorable project to the principal via bargaining, the general leader of a firm may want to choose separation instead to increase the probability of bargaining, as the symmetrical incentive requires both managers to search and get informed." .

This article offers a game-theoretic investigation of the possibility and effectiveness of strategic technology development: environmental leaders setting policies that reduce the global cost of clean technology. The game-theoretic model combines technology development and adoption with pollution abatement, and it allows technology costs to differ across countries. The key theoretical findings are as follows. First, free riding is an obstacle to technology development in two ways: countries fail to fully internalize the beneficial effect of technology development on (i) global pollution abatement and (ii) the reduced cost of technology adoption in outsider countries. Second, strategic technology development can be effective when (i) a key group of frontrunner countries prefers to invest in research and development and (ii) many other countries are willing to adopt the new technology. The findings suggest that strategic technology deployment by a group of frontrunners can enable more effective climate cooperation in the future." .

In general, a supply chain faces the “problem” of information asymmetry, members having their own objectives and constraints which may be in conflict with those of the other members. Still, activities have to be aligned in such a way that the supply chain as a whole stays or becomes competitive while each member wins by cooperating. A number of collaborative planning schemes have been put forward in the last two decades with different assumptions and different areas of application. This paper intends to provide a framework and an overview on the state-of-the-art of collaborative planning. The criteria of the framework will allow us to position existing concepts and to identify areas where more research is needed. The focus of the literature reviewed here will be on model-based decision support at the operational planning level." .

Knowledge of the risk and return of entrepreneurial ventures for outside investors is consequently limited. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the Canadian context, where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are allowed to list on a stock market. We analyze seasoned equity offerings launched by SMEs over the last decade. These public issuers can be considered low quality firms with poor operating performance. Managers issue equity before a large decrease in operating and stock market performance. Individual investors do not price the stocks correctly around the issue and incur significant negative returns in the years following the issue. This is particularly true for constrained issuers. We confirm that entrepreneurial outside equity attracts lemons and that individual investors cannot invest wisely in emerging ventures. Probably as a consequence of individual investors’ lack of skill and rationality, the cost of outside equity financing of Canadian public SMEs is abnormally low." .

Most studies find evidence for inefficiency but provide no theoretical explanations for differences in efficiency. This study used principal agent theory to explain differences in efficiency between hospitals. Two agency issues are examined: (1) quality of care in the relationship between hospital and patient, and (2) internal organisation, i.e. the relationship between the hospital and its main departments. It was found that efficiency and quality go together. This implies that the potential harmful information asymmetry between hospitals and patients does not appear to be a major problem, because increasing efficiency does not seem to reduce quality. Further, we find no relationship between the efficiency of departments and the efficiency of the entire hospital. The interest of hospital departments is currently not in line with the interests of the entire hospital." .

Nevertheless, changes in agents’ behaviour or in the dynamics of the environment may lead to a poor fulfilment of the system’s purposes, and so the entire organisation needs to be adapted. In this paper we focus on endowing the organisation with adaptation capabilities, instead of expecting agents to be capable of adapting the organisation by themselves. We regard this organisational adaptation as an assisting service provided by what we call the Assistance Layer. Our generic Two Level Assisted MAS Architecture (2-LAMA) incorporates such a layer. We empirically evaluate this approach by means of an agent-based simulator we have developed for the P2P sharing network domain. This simulator implements 2-LAMA architecture and supports the comparison between different adaptation methods, as well as, with the standard BitTorrent protocol. In particular, we present two alternatives to perform norm adaptation and one method to adapt agents’ relationships. The results show improved performance and demonstrate that the cost of introducing an additional layer in charge of the system’s adaptation is lower than its benefits." .

Brand new solutions for enterprise IT, such as three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD) systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and product lifecycle management systems have been adopted and customized to shipyards and contribute to productivity enhancement. As part of IT convergence in the shipbuilding industry, we examine the adoption of business process management (BPM) for the ship hull production design process. Ship hull production design, a process-based task, requires the most man-hours among all ship design processes and is directly coupled with ship production; thus, improvements in this task can contribute hugely toward enhancing productivity. First, we explain the concept of the executable model, which is an essential condition for executing defined processes in a business process management system (BPMS). In addition, we analyze the hull production design task and use this as the basis of a process to build executable BPM models. Thus, we present detailed implementations and the expected effects for the BPM execution of the hull production design process. The executable BPM model of the hull production design process is implemented using Bonita Open-Solution 5.5, a representative open-source BPMS." .

Initial rounds of proficiency testing have shown a tendency for laboratories to over-estimate GM levels, results obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection methods to be significantly different and that data are skewed and not normally distributed until log-transformed. During the initial rounds, it was found that for analysis and quantification of GM material, it was not possible to assign a target value for standard deviation external to the round data, from which performance could be assessed. However, when working in a log scale, the internally derived, robust standard deviation (^σ) was found to be constant and could be used directly to predict a target value (σ) for performance assessment. Results from the first four rounds have provided valuable information and a general overview of laboratory ability. Choosing a target value for standard deviation which reflects current best practice has enabled laboratory performance to be assessed. Issues surrounding the assessment of performance are discussed which highlight some of the implications raised as a result of this initial assessment, regarding the enforcement of European labelling legislation." .

Not surprisingly, many research efforts have proposed new privacy-aware technologies. Among them, Hippocratic databases offer mechanisms for enforcing privacy rules in database systems for inter-organizational business processes (also known as virtual organizations). This paper extends these mechanisms to allow for hierarchical purposes, distributed authorizations and minimal disclosure supporting the business processes of virtual organizations that want to offer their clients a number of ways to fulfill a service. Specifically, we use a goal-oriented approach to analyze privacy policies of the enterprises involved in a business process. On the basis of the purpose hierarchy derived through a goal refinement process, we provide algorithms for determining the minimum set of authorizations needed to achieve a service. This allows us to automatically derive access control policies for an inter-organizational business process from the collection of privacy policies associated with different participating enterprises. By using effective on-line algorithms, the derivation of such minimal information can also be done on-the-fly by the customer wishing to access a service." .

The richness of the media influences how well the organization might maintain its culture. On the other hand, a strong organizational culture allows a more effective use of the media by providing members with some of the necessary common ground to better understand the information exchanged. These relationships are investigated using an agent-based simulation model (ABM). Our ABM incorporates many partial theories into a coherent and fully defined model, which helps formalize and integrate those theories. Our model allows us to analyze non-linearities and interaction effects, which are difficult to investigate using other techniques. Additionally, the ABM allows us to investigate the dynamics of the phenomenon and generate hypotheses that could then be tested using empirical studies. Given the substantial resources necessary to conduct empirical studies, we think that the present ABM is valuable in helping guide data collection efforts. In this paper, we present results that show that organizational culture can influence the effectiveness of the media used for organizational communication and that a high media richness can help maintain and stabilize a culture. The effect of media richness on organizational culture depends on the initial strength of the culture. In general, for a given richness of the media, an initially strong culture stabilizes faster and becomes stronger through time than an initially weak culture. Additionally, the model suggests that a stable network of contacts among agents fosters a high achievement of organizational tasks. Conversely, when agents are forced to establish contacts with agents outside the usual network for doing their work, the accomplishment of tasks decreases." .

It has been realized that sustainable competitive advantage can only be created through the workforce, the people who are the organization. In order to get the best from employees so that they go the extra mile for the organization, they must be “engaged.” Employee engagement as a construct has become very popular in recent times as it has shown correlations with productivity, profitability, employee turnover, safety, absenteeism, etc. The shipping industry is also going through a lean period where efficiency of operations is becoming fundamental to survival. In such a scenario, the use of engagement practices, as practiced ashore, may greatly assist ship owners in developing an engaged, motivated, and dedicated work force. This paper analyses the drivers of engagement from a review of literature, identifies the drivers in shipping, and develops a questionnaire to measure engagement levels of Indian seagoing officers and compares this with levels reported from other industries. It explores whether engagement levels increase with tenure with the shipping company, as reported in literature, and whether senior officers are more engaged in their jobs as compared with junior officers. The drivers of engagement were found to be similar, but engagement levels were found to be much lower than reported in other industries. Additionally, engagement was negatively correlated with tenure, while senior officers were found to be marginally more engaged than junior officers." .

This article proposes a DEA model for supply-chain management. Traditional studies focused on the selection of partners and the construction of the supply chain. Therefore, this study considers how to optimize the supply chain itself in order to maximize the benefit by DEA. In addition, a significant matter is that supply chains have sometimes unbalanced business processes. This means that some particular DMUs on the supply chain have a superiority which maintains efficiency. That is why the other DMUs on the supply chain need to operate in unfavorable conditions. As a result, their operations badly affect the total efficiency of the supply chain. Therefore, the proposed method introduces an adjustment variable to calculate the optimum operation of the supply chain. The utility and effectiveness of the proposed method are shown by numerical experiments." .

This is somewhat surprising given that employees are essentially the face of their organization and are largely expected to act as ambassadors for the organization’s CSR program (Collier and Esteban in Bus Ethics 16:19–33, 2007). The current research, by conducting depth interviews with employees, builds a better understanding of how employees differentiate between authentic and inauthentic CSR programs, and how these judgments influence their perceptions of the organization. We find that employees rely on two different referent standards to form authenticity judgments—the extent to which the image put forth in the CSR program aligns with the organization’s true identity and the extent to which the CSR program itself is developmental. To assess the former, employees draw on cues about resource commitment, alignment between elements of the organization’s CSR program, emotional engagement, justice, and embeddedness. The latter assessments are based on the extent to which the organization adopts a leadership role with regards to its CSR initiatives. We also find that perceived authenticity can lead to positive outcomes such as organizational identification and employee connections. This study contributes to the broad literatures on both CSR and authenticity, as well as more specifically adding to the conversation on authenticity as a potentially valuable lens for enriching business ethics theorizing." .

A total of three managerial work value factors emerged, which was supported by the current value literature. It was found that there was a relationship between work values and organizational size. The lower the organizational size, the higher the proper values are held. However, organizational tenure, the number of subordinates a manager is responsible, and the educational level of a manager had no significant effect on holding work values. The proper values outnumbered the improper values significantly. The three most held work values were integrity, doing work with care and discipline, and achievement. The three least held values were cliquishness, laziness, and hypocrisy." .

However, do unions, through their presence in a firm, affect executive compensation? While there is con-siderable research on the determinants and correlates of executive compensation, the literature is silent on the role of unions.

Legislation, cost reductions, resource constraints, societal demands and moral concepts are analyzed as drivers of product responsibility and assessed according to their level of complexity. Simultaneously, the potential contributions of resulting measures for business success and sustainable development are derived. The analysis shows that the consideration of additional drivers may confront businesses with substantial challenges, however, can simultaneously also increase added value for the company and the corporate contribution to sustainable development." .

Based on the assumption that businesses in different sectors of the economy will require IT for different reasons and in different ways, this article introduces the EU project plugIT that aspires to develop an IT-Socket that will realize the vision of businesses \"plugging-in\" to IT. Three demonstration scenarios deal with: (1) \"Certification\" of IT infrastructure to stay compliant with regulations, (2) \"Virtual Organisation\" by evolving the current service orientation to a higher and more business driven abstraction as well as, (3) \"Governance\" of IT infrastructure introducing business context into highly distributed and complex systems. The IT-Socket follows a model-driven approach by introducing graphical modelling languages as mediators between the domain experts and IT. The research challenge is to link human interpretable graphical models – partly semi-formal – with machine interpretable semantic formalisms to enable: (1) a tighter involvement of domain experts when expressing formal knowledge specifying business requirements on IT infrastructure and services, (2) different graphical modelling languages for different views on the IT-Socket to provide modelling languages the domain expert is used to work with as well as, (3) a domain specific notation for semantics by integrating formal concepts of semantics with the graphic notation from modelling languages." .

Moreover, these concepts are seldom deployed within a relational perspective that was fundamental to Bourdieu’s thinking. The article “Bourdieu and Organizational Analysis” by Mustafa Emirbayer and Victoria Johnson is a welcomed exception, for it draws on all three of Bourdieu’s pillar concepts to propose a relational approach to the study of organizations. It both reframes existing thinking about organizations, particularly from the neo-institutional and resource dependence schools, and indicates new directions for research in organizations to move.

We find that an increase in the stockholding ratio of foreign investors in a privatized firm increases the optimal degree of privatization, whereas an increase in the penetration of foreign firms in product markets reduces it. These results imply that the degree of openness of financial markets and that of product markets have contrasting implications for the optimal privatization policy." .

For day-to-day practice, however, consideration of the purpose for which information is required allows construction of simple strategies for data collection. Recommendations are made for short and convenient data sets for use in personal audit, clinical governance, benchmarking, patient selection and business planning. No simple data set can measure in detail every aspect of practice, but use of these recommendations will provide information that will be of great value to the spinal surgeon and ultimately to his patients." .

When both the general questions concerning attitudes about cheating and the opinions on the ethical statements are considered, the business students were generally more unethical in their behavior and attitudes than non-business majors. These results indicate a need for more ethical exposure in business courses to help students distinguish ethical from unethical decisions." .

Representatives from 34 randomly selected restaurants participated in both the pre- and post-interviews. Although 26.5 percent of the respondents were concerned that the ordinance would be difficult to enforce, 94 percent found the ordinance easy or very easy to enforce. While some customers appeared to have negative reactions to an ordinance that prohibited smoking, four times that many appeared to have positive reactions to the ordinance. Although approximately 12 percent of the respondents indicated that the ordinance had “a slightly negative effect on employees,” the majority (88.2%) felt that the ordinance had either no effect or a positive effect on employees. Most respondents believed that the ordinance would have no effect on their business and most reported that the ordinance had no or no known effect on business. Although many restaurant representatives had concerns about a non-smoking ordinance prior to its enactment, restaurant representatives' self-reported experience with the ordinance suggests that most of these concerns were not realized." .

Because of this, Juravich argues, if and when the workers’ knowledge is integrated into the production system, the workers no longer will experience “chaos on the shop floor.” Extending Devinatz’s (1993) analysis in response to Juravich, this article argues that workers use resistance as a logical strategy for rationalizing what they perceive to be the irrationality of the shop floor. Utilizing Kusterer’s (1978) work, I argue that the use of many, but not all, resistance strategies constitutes a type of “survival knowledge” acquired and used by workers in response to managerial control. I maintain that these strategies constitute a special type of workplace resistance which I refer to as “pure and simple resistance.”" .

It reviews the nation's e-commerce readiness and surveys local firms, a majority of them small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), on their Web presence and e-commerce initiatives, management, capabilities and performance. Overall, while e-commerce in Malaysia is in its formative phases, a majority of firms in the survey sample have progressed beyond “brochureware” into the “interactions” phase; few have reached the “e-commerce” phase but many are planning to. They are driven primarily by marketing considerations and have seen the greatest impact of e-commerce on their marketing and overall business operations. Taking the lead are SMEs in IT/Internet services and solutions that see great opportunities in the nation's need to build the foundation layers for its emerging Internet economy. Most reluctant and least satisfied to date are SMEs in manufacturing that find the business-to-business sector largely undeveloped. The government can take some credits for its leadership in addressing the barriers to e-commerce development but the most significant barriers falls squarely within the private sector's domain. They will have to be overcome by entrepreneurial talents and management foresight." .

The symposium was divided into four parts in which different aspects of the reference values were discussed: legal and normative aspects, alternatives to the production of own reference values, methodology, and diffusion and teaching. The main conclusions were the need to clarify the requirements described by the EU Directive 98/79-EC and EN-ISO 15189:2003 regarding reference values, and the need for cooperation between industry, clinical laboratories, and health authorities to achieve common reference intervals, including multicentric reference intervals." .

However, perception and acceptance towards climate change is a significant barrier to voluntary adoption of best practice techniques. A number of countries have set targets for reducing emissions, of which Scotland has one of the most ambitious agendas. This paper presents results from an extensive survey of 540 dairy farmers, conducted in 2009, with the aim of understanding attitudes, values and intentions towards climate change. Only half of these farmers agreed that temperatures would rise in the future and this could significantly hinder adoption of voluntary measures to meet emissions targets. To explore this further a typology was developed on the responses to attitude and value statements, using principal components and cluster analysis methods. Six distinct types were found to exist which had a range of outlooks towards the impact of climate change in the future. However, five of the six types stated no intention to adopt practices which would reduce emissions. The typology approach supports diversified engagement strategies and a more innovation-led or resource maximisation view towards farming was expressed by several of these types. This may indicate that policy makers should focus on ‘win-win’ technologies as a means to effectively engage with these. However, a number of types were disengaged from the process which was driven by uncertainties towards projections for global warming and this needs to be addressed by both scientists and policy makers to ensure greater participation within the farming community." .

The study made use of hospitalization data and heat stress measurement data in Hong Kong from 2007 to 2011. The heat index, which is called Hong Kong Heat Index (HKHI), is calculated from the natural wet bulb temperature, the globe temperature, and the dry bulb temperature together with a set of coefficients applicable to the high humidity condition in the summer of Hong Kong. Analysis of the response of hospitalization rate to variation in HKHI and two other heat indices, namely Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) and Net Effective Temperature (NET), revealed that HKHI performed generally better than WBGT and NET in reflecting the heat stress impact on excess hospitalization ratio in Hong Kong. Based on the study results, two reference criteria of HKHI were identified to establish a two-tier approach for the enhancement of the heat stress information service in Hong Kong." .

When small companies grow, they face a range of strategic managerial challenges. Stage models for small company growth predict that a ‘crisis of control’ can occur when existing information systems for communication and control are no longer able to cope with increased throughput, nor are they able to respond flexibly to opportunities and challenges in the business environment. In response, owner-managers (OMs) may seek technological enterprise-wide ‘solutions’, in a drive towards ‘integrated information systems (IIS)’. This paper reports a case study in which the Viable Systems Model (VSM) was used during an integration project in a small manufacturing company. In this case, the ‘solution’ was found in organisational learning, rather than technology. It is argued that such a phase may be an essential step to the adoption of ERP/MRP at a later date for small growing companies." .

The firm is the less likely to choose offshoring the more wage-oriented is the union and the higher is the union bargaining power in the wage negotiation." .

We also carry out an empirical analysis on the average number of workers in given productivity sectors on the basis of an exhaustive dataset in Japan. The theoretical formula succeeds in explaining the two distinctive observational facts in a unified way, that is, a Boltzmann distribution with negative temperature on low-to-medium productivity side and a decreasing part in a power–law form on high productivity side." .

Today’s clinicians demand realtime test data at the point of care. This has led to a new generation of compact, portable instruments permitting ”laboratory” testing to be performed at or near the patient’s bedside by nonlaboratory workers who are unfamiliar with testing practices. Poorly controlled testing processes leading to poor quality test results are an insidious problem facing point of care testing today. Manufacturers are addressing this issue through instrument design. Providers of clinical test results, regardless of location, working with manufacturers and regulators must create and manage complete test systems that eliminate or minimize sources of error. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) in its EP18 guideline, ”Quality management for unit-use testing,” has developed a quality management system approach specifically for test devices used for point of care testing (POCT). Simply stated, EP18 utilizes a ”sources of error” matrix to identify and address potential errors that can impact the test result. The key is the quality systems approach where all stakeholders – professionals, manufacturers and regulators – collaboratively seek ways to manage errors and ensure quality. We illustrate the use of one quality systems approach, EP18, as a means to advance the quality of test results at point of care." .

Theory and previous empirical research indicate that the entrepreneurial attributes most likely to influence the characteristics and performance of new firms are motivation, workskills and information. The results of a regression analysis confirm these hypotheses when turnover and total assets are the dependent variables but are less conclusive when employment is the dependent variable. Possibly the most interesting finding is that the entrepreneurs who create the most jobs are those who are highly motivated, have managerial skills and whose firms are in the manufacturing sector." .

Existing theoretical models emphasize the importance of the employee’s motivation and output control for the effectiveness of PfP-systems. However, empirical evidence on which factors influence PfP-system’s introduction in NPOs is still lacking. Based on an exploratory study of nine Austrian NPOs, this paper develops hypotheses on what organizational factors distinguish NPOs that rely on PfP-systems for managing employees’ performance differences from those that use alternative approaches (e.g., job enrichment, NPO-spirit). Findings suggest that decisions on the application of PfP-systems are influenced by five determinants: perceived degree of competitiveness regarding funding and service provision; degree of strategic freedom; clarity of strategic objectives; existence of management instruments; and organizational culture." .

At a time when the wellness of individuals is increasingly being threatened in our workplaces, I argue that one way wellness can be sought is through careful examination of routine organizational practices. To make this point, I look to the problem of bullying in organizations and, in particular, traditional organizational responses to bullying. The paradoxes of protective legislation and protective workplace policies are explored, before numerous organizational masks that serve to bolster these paradoxes are discussed: the mask of stereotypes; the mask of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR); the mask of counseling; and the mask of training. The way towards wellness in organizations lies with the recognition of unintended distortions and limitations on existing legislation, policy and process, and the critical assessment of traditional remedies." .

Firm characteristics and relationships, value chain positioning, and factors associated with product entry are examined for a set of 65 graphene-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises located in 16 different countries. As well as secondary sources and bibliometric methods to profile developments in graphene, we use computerized data mining and analytical techniques, including cluster and regression modeling, to identify patterns from publicly available online information on enterprise web sites. We identify groups of graphene small and medium-sized enterprises differentiated by how they are involved with graphene, the materials they target, whether they make equipment, and their orientation toward science and intellectual property. In general, access to finance and the firms’ location are significant factors that are associated with graphene product introductions. We also find that patents and scientific publications are not statistically significant predictors of product development in our sample of graphene enterprises. We further identify a cohort of graphene-oriented firms that are signaling plans to develop intermediate graphene products that should have higher value in the marketplace. Our findings suggest that policy needs to ensure attention to the introduction and scale-up of downstream intermediate and final graphene products and associated financial, intermediary, and market identification support. The paper demonstrates novel data methods that can be combined with existing information for real-time intelligence to understand and map enterprise development and commercialization in a rapidly emerging and growing new technology." .

In addition, do authorization cards provide a sufficiently valid basis for establishing bargaining unit recognition as is the case in Canada? In order to explore these possibilities, the relationship between card signing behavior and certification vote in six union representation elections is examined. Although card signing and vote for certification are significantly related, overall results indicate that relying on union authorization card data as an indicator of vote at the individual level is questionable." .

The aim was to identify key factors leading to the emergence of industrial leadership. A few lessons have come to the fore. First, firms that become dominant on world markets first became strong in their home market. Second, important sources of comparative advantage often reside in sectoral support systems e.g. a university especially strong in organic chemistry. As to the debate about industrial policy, history shows many instances that support the case for targeted support. On the other hand, we should not ignore that the success of industrial policy depends to a large extent on the interaction between firms and the relevant government agencies." .

A broad concept of union instrumentality, including a place for the concept of union political instrumentality (e.g., union influence on general elections or legislation), is suggested. The practical importance and applicability of the political instrumentality concept is demonstrated in empirical models of nonunion worker voting intent in union representation elections. As predicted, workers perceiving higher levels of union political instrumentality are significantly more likely than others to indicate a pro-union voting intent. Given the importance of political versus economic activity as a defining characteristic of labor movements and given recent increases in political activity by U.S. unions, these results have significant implications for the way we think about U.S. unions and for future union organizing and political activities." .

The capacity of ships and the amount of containers being transshipped at container terminals increases significantly. Terminals should handle their operations efficiently to provide the necessary capacity and customer service. In designing a container terminal, terminal management has to consider the choice for a certain type of berth. In this paper, we compare by means of a simulation study the performance of traditional one-sided marginal berths and indented berths. An indented berth enables quay cranes to unload and load containers from both sides of the ship. As a result, more quay cranes can work on a single ship. As main performance measure in this comparison we use the total vessel operation time required to unload and load a ship. This time depends next to crane productivity also on the efficiency of the transportation and storage and retrieval processes in the terminal. We have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we also study the relation between the selection of an indented berth and other design and control issues in the terminal." .

We show that for imperfect patent enforcement, licensing contract leads to more innovation in the North relative to subsidiary or exports. When both subsidiary and exports are very costly options, no patent enforcement in the South is best for the South. However, when either subsidiary operation or exports can be organized cheaply, the Southern government chooses some positive degree of patent enforcement. We also establish that strengthening of patent enforcement in the South may lead to more licensing and less subsidiary operations or exports." .

It is shown that, as trade costs decrease, more entrepreneurs choose to provide foreign brands. Furthermore, the shift to foreign brands is shown to magnify the negative impact of trade liberalization on the profits of firms selling domestic brands." .

The present study therefore examines generational cohort differences in workplace expectations between professional (i.e., “white-collar,” largely college educated) and production (i.e., “blue-collar,” largely non-college educated) workers. Using online survey data from 2,799 union workers employed by the same organization, we compared expectations when first hired as well as current workplace expectations between professional and production workers from three different generational cohorts (i.e., Gen Y, Gen X, and Baby Boomer). We found evidence for generational differences that confirms some of the common characterizations of Gen Y workers; however, this characterization was principally found within our professional subgroup of Gen Y employees. Further, the data suggest that other factors (e.g., workplace experiences, maturation effects) may shape current workplace expectations more than do generational differences. These results suggest that concern over generational differences may be limited to certain workplace expectations and to specific subgroups of employees." .

The research was conducted in enterprises with more than 200 employees. The value of HRM was assessed using the HR audit approach. Fifty-five HR indicators were analyzed from the top 10 Croatian HR enterprises to serve as benchmarks for the final sample of 80 enterprises. Results indicate Croatian enterprises have deficient HR practices, on average. Independent sample t-tests showed 61.82% of HR indicators were significantly better in the benchmark firms. Consequently, HRM in Croatia can not be considered solid ground for achieving competitiveness through people." .

RFID technology is named as a foundation for an integer and counterfeit-resistant pharmaceutical supply chain. A transformation toward an RFID-aided supply chain involves both technical and business adaptions. We share technical insights of our proposed architecture for storing and searching pharmaceutical RFID event data. From the business perspective, we discuss the viability of RFID-based anti-counterfeiting with respect to its monetary impacts. We define qualitative requirements for software components developed for RFID and provide a quantitative analysis of operational costs for a dedicated service provider for anti-counterfeiting. Its implementation and amortization is discussed for different operating setups to enable access to RFID technology for all participants of pharmaceutical the supply chain" .

However, little research has been carried out in understanding the complex concepts of Guanxi (relationship) in a Chinese society. This research describes a study to operate the constructs of guanxi and explores the importance of guanxi in relationship development in order to present a new Guanxi framework. A study of both Western and Chinese literature provides foundations of the Guanxi perspectives. The constructs of adaptation, trust, opportunism and favour are identified. Adaptation and trust are found to be positively correlated with sales stability and quality. Whilst, adaptation is negatively correlated with relationship termination costs. Both theoretical framework (a new perceptual map) and managerial implications are given. In addition, recommendations for future research are made." .

The timing of the bargaining process is endogeously determined. We obtain that bargaining is simultaneous if and only if both firms decide when negotiations take place. Otherwise negotiation takes place sequentially. Under simultaneous or sequential negotiations, the market is equally shared and both firms have the same price-cost margins and profits. When bargaining is sequential firms have higher profits, the leader locates closer to the market than in the simultaneous case, the follower locates further away and the distance between the two firms is greater." .

It is vital for every company to successfully select suppliers, to undertake selection evaluation process for a long time, and to invest enormous of capital and effort to manage supply chain efficiently. This study aims to propose a new fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method for the efficiency evaluation of suppliers with bell-shaped membership functions. Since the MSS is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, we decomposed the problem into two main clusters grouping criteria, including the criterion of capability and the criterion of willingness in the first phase. Then the modified FAHP method is applied to acquire a ranking of the candidate suppliers in the second phase with evaluation of different alternatives. A study from the case company was conducted to choose the best solution alternative(s) for the case company. From the experiments, we show that the proposed method is a very practical and efficient technique for the decision makers to select best options for the MSS in managing supply chain." .

These workplaces, as many others, often offer the key ingredients for the emergence of stress and the performance drop of its long-term effects: long hours sitting, sustained cognitive effort, pressure from competitiveness, among others. This has a toll on productivity and work quality, with significant costs for both organizations and workers. Moreover, a tired workforce is generally more susceptible to negative feelings and mood, which results in a negative environment. This paper contributes to the current need for the development of non-intrusive methods for monitoring and managing worker performance in real time. We propose a framework that assesses worker performance and a case study in which this approach was validated. We also show the relationship between performance and mood." .

The political framing of the Games as a leverageable resource stimulated VSOs’ engagement, but it was more on a tactical than strategic basis. Three main leveraging processes were employed by VSOs including aligning organisational objectives with the Games’ strategic visions, using structured Olympic programmes and teaming up with a development partner. VSOs used the Games to enhance their organisational capacity in three areas of staff qualifications, organisational learning and performance management and created public value." .

As part of this ‘eRevolution’ corporate businesses are looking at migrating new applications on to their existing IP infrastructures. Computer/telephony integration and unified messaging are applications that will drive forward the integration of voice and data networks for BT's corporate customers, enabling the use of a flexible, shared IP infrastructure for voice and data. While ‘voice over IP’ is widely seen as the ‘obvious way forward’ there are many issues to be resolved before this can deliver the anticipated benefits. This paper provides an insight into the building blocks required to enable the development/deployment of shared infrastructure, for quality of service (QoS) capable, unified, IP network solutions. It highlights the detailed understanding and careful design approach required (particularly in the complex area of network QoS) to engineer custom voice solutions as part of a unified IP network design based on today's technology. Emerging protocols and technology, which may turn the unified network dream into reaility, are identified." .

Demazeau and E. Werner (Eds.) Decentralized AI-3, Elsevier, North Holland) to modelling multiagent and group dependence. These have theoretical potentialities for the study of emerging groups and collective structures, and more generally for understanding social and organisational complexity, and practical utility for both social-organisational and agent systems purposes. In the paper, the dependence theory is extended to describe multiagent links, with a special reference to group and collective phenomena, and is proposed as a framework for the study of emerging social structures, such as groups and collectives. In order to do so, we propose to extend the notion of dependence networks (applied to a single agent) to dependence graphs (applied to an agency). In its present version, the dependence theory is argued to provide (a) a theoretical instrument for the study of social complexity, and (b) a computational system for managing the negotiation process in competitive contexts and for monitoring complexity in organisational and other cooperative contexts." .

In this paper we present a constructive, behavioural and axiomatic approach to the notion of a stable set as a model of the standard of behaviour of a social organisation. The socially stable set we introduce is a generalisation of the von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set. In contrast with the original version, our stability concept is always solvable. The standard of behaviour, reflecting the established conceptual order of a society or organisation, emerges from a dominance relation on alternative conceptions that are relevant with regard to a certain issue. This common social choice phenomenon, that permeates our societies and organisations, we have tried to clarify. Two axiomatic characterisations as well as a construction algorithm for socially stable sets are presented. These characterisations are based on behavioural postulates regarding the individual or collective strategic behaviour of effective sets. Relations between socially stable sets and other notions of stability are discussed." .

While most virtual worlds have adopted subscription models there is an increasing trend toward selling digital items directly to users. This arises from the emergent markets linking real world currency to items existing on company servers. This practice has resulted in controversial and unresolved legal issues. Communities that arise from virtual worlds can be classified according to level and type of control. Lack of control can lead to a Hobbesian world of predation and vigilantism. Strong developer control can be exerted to protect users but communities adopting shared governance with users are likely to become more common." .

This addresses continuous surveillance of the current practice. A brief questionnaire on vertical audits was distributed to 74 of 120 employees at a Finnish private medical laboratory, Medix Laboratories Ltd. A positive feed-back was received from the current management of audits. However, the study revealed that continuous supervision of audits is needed. Many employees were not willing to perform audits if they had no previous experience. Additionally, audits performed at the workbench were not considered as the best possible for fruitful discussions." .

The laboratories had to go through an organizational and monetary change imposed by the growing and changing needs of the state of Israel. The laboratories had to become more modern and to implement new and more sophisticated testing methods. Another requirement was to perform a steadily increasing number of tests and to be more flexible towards customers’ demands. Yet, the budget was not changed accordingly, as the Public Service to which the laboratories belong to do not respond to changing needs. Management realization was that the accreditation process could be used as a tool to achieve organizational and cultural change. Understanding and transformation were required throughout the organization, including management. Proficiency testing is performed for all testing methods in all areas even for non-accredited tests such as clinical tests. Proficiency testing was used as a tool for organizational culture change. It is a great index with game elements, that gives employees and managers the possibility for comparison, fixing problems and corrective action. The demands of ISO 17025 made it necessary to change peoples’ attitudes and views on both professional and communication levels. Laboratory quality consists now on the four main principles, described in the 5M&E model which is typical to small organizations and which ensures a constantly improving system: ”Policy statement”, ”Machine”, ”Material”, ”Measurement”, ”Method”, ”Manpower”, and ”Environment” targeted to achieve ”Quality upgrade”. Slowly we succeeded in providing better and more reliable services and have increased our income on what would hopefully become our way to financial independence. We hope this process would provide the Ministry of Health with a better chance to public health using the same financial sources." .

To discuss the law and economics of corporations, their performance on the market and management control by legislation and government, is to discuss Corporate Governance. Now, Corporate Governance is being challenged by a new concept to conceive the role of corporations in the world and to control their managers: this is the concept of Corporate Social Responsibilty (CSR). This concept focuses on other than merely profit centered functions of corporations; rather, performance of corporations is measured by criteria of good corporate citizenship. In the Non-Profit sector, corporations also play a major role, although organizations in this sector typically differ from business corporations in several aspects. Yet, deficits of transparency and control of NPO are being discussed here as well. The tendency is to draw from the concept of corporate governance to develop appropriate remedies. Furthermore, the discussion of Corporate Social Responsibilty has also made its way to the NPO sector." .

Enterprises seek to implement collaborative integration in order to realize the value-added benefits and cost savings of superior supply chain management, while enabling intelligent action and faster response to environmental variability. Increasingly, supply chain leaders are building private trading exchanges (PTXs) in order to more effectively enable and manage such collaborative integration. This paper examines the value proposition and the spectrum of solutions and services around collaborative integration through PTXs. The paper first identifies the challenges of collaborative integration in near-real-time supply chains. It then describes the building blocks of a PTX solution. It develops a comparative value proposition for collaborative integration. It then provides an illustrative case example from Viacore Inc. The paper ends with an examination of the future of collaborative integration in lean e-business environments." .

As a result, new directions have emerged in the reform of Public Administration together with the introduction of innovative models. The aim is to achieve a type of management that focusses on results as well as on effort and efficiency. We intend to analyse to what extent the adoption of business management models by hospital healthcare units can improve their performance, mainly in terms of standards of efficiency. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to investigate the efficiency of a set of public Portuguese hospitals. The aim was to evaluate the impact of business management in Portuguese public hospitals with regards to efficiency, specifically taking into account the fact that lack of resources and increased health care needs are a present and future reality. From a total of 83 public hospitals, a sample of 59 hospitals was chosen, of which 21 are state-owned hospital enterprises (SA) and 38 are traditional public administration sector hospitals (SPA). This study evaluates hospital performance by calculating two efficiency measures associated with two categories of inputs. The first efficiency measures the costs associated with hospital production lines and the number of beds (representing fixed capacity) as inputs. The annual costs generated by the hospitals in the consumption of capital and work (direct and indirect costs) are used. A second measure of efficiency is calculated separately. This measure includes in the inputs the number of beds as well as the human resources available (number of doctors, number of nurses and other personnel) in each hospital. With regard to output, the variables that best reflect the hospital services rendered were considered: number of inpatient days, patients discharged, outpatient visits, emergencies services, sessions in hospital day care services and the number of surgeries. The results seem to suggest that the introduction of market processes and changes in organisational structure—such as managerial autonomy and corporatisation of public hospitals—have had a positive impact on Portuguese public hospitals. This positive evolution was particularly evident in SA hospitals, but further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results." .

It also considers the fact that the firms must incur export costs in addition to production costs. Thus, this paper shows, among others, that the effects of export policies on firms' output and export choices do not depend on the slopes of firms' reaction curves. It is also shown that firms' total outputs are independent of the export policies, and the optimal domestic and foreign export subsidies are zero (laissez-faire)." .

Including Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in research activities is an integral part of a broad drive towards integration of science and society. Interest in CSO inclusion in research is widespread, but lacks a coherent focus and clarity on what CSOs are. Without this clarity, CSO-inclusive research, or policy, may be ineffective. This article addresses this gap in knowledge by presenting findings from an exploration of academic, policy and research project literature in order to come to a view on CSOs in research. This culminates in a typology of CSOs and provides a means of identifying types of CSOs. The typology shows four main types of CSO (common cause, shared voice, research-oriented, commercially oriented) and provides a definition for each type, along with a basis for the definition; an example of each; some typical terminology; typical area of activity; properties; typical mission; key areas of interest and their ‘action logic’ in research." .

Using panel data from the European Community Household Panel for the EU-15 countries, we show that own-account workers are less likely to hire employees during recessions. Next, we focus on identifying the underlying mechanisms of this negative relationship, while bearing in mind that liquidity constraints, unemployment and the prevalence of unpaid family workers are more common during recessions. First, we observe how liquidity constraints reduce the probability of transitioning from own-account worker to employer. Second, additional results from our paper suggest that formal education and former work experience (both work experience in paid employment and venture-specific work experience) are important assets for own-account workers which increase the probability that they create new jobs. Third, as a mechanism partly offsetting the lower probability of job creation during recessions, we also find that own-account workers who are assisted by unpaid family workers are more likely to start employing (salaried) personnel." .

Given this environment, the purpose of this study is to explore the impact of moral judgment on sales performance and sellers engaging in a customer-oriented selling approach. Specifically, by utilizing a sample of 345 business-to-business salespeople, this study examines the relationships between moral judgment, customer-oriented selling, and outcome and behavior based performance.

We investigate the optimal behavior of a public firm in a mixed market involving private firms and one public firm. Existing works show that welfare-maximizing behavior by the public firm is suboptimal when the number of firms is given exogenously. We allow free entry of private firms and find that, in contrast to the case with the fixed number of firms, welfare-maximizing behavior by the public firm is always optimal in mixed markets. Furthermore, we find that mixed markets are better than pure markets involving no public firm if and only if the public firm earns nonnegative profits." .

Results suggest that high minimum labour costs are an important source of unemployment. Secondly, the reduced-form participation equation is replaced by a neoclassical labour supply equation. Thus, also the effect of high minimum wage rates on employment through labour supply is taken into account. Supply appears to be forward bending and participation is insensitive with respect to unemployment benefits. Simulations suggest that the effect of lowering the ‘productivity threshold’ by reducing before-tax minimum wages dominates supply effects." .

The strength of both parties has been analyzed, firstly under the assumption of perfect information and thereafter under the assumption of imperfect information. Important determinants of wage increases appear to be the strike costs, the horizon, the bargaining skills and the self confidence of both parties and the wage elasticity of the demand for labour." .

The risk associated to such managerial decisions affects directly the continuity, profitability and reputation of the enterprise. This paper presents a knowledge modeling methodology tool to act as a decision support mechanism for geographically dispersed financial enterprises. The underlying research addresses the problem of financial information capture and representation by utilizing the soft computing characteristics of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). By using FCMs, the proposed mechanism generates a hierarchical and dynamic network of interconnected financial knowledge concepts, simulates the operational efficiency of distributed organizational models with imprecise relationships and quantifies the impact of geographically dispersed activities to the overall business performance. Generic adaptive maps offer an alternative approach to financial management based on strategic level knowledge modeling and integrate hierarchical FCMs into the decision making model of typical financial sector enterprises. Finally, this paper discusses experiments with the proposed mechanism and comments on its usability." .

The consumer affairs department provides the consumer with an opportunity to make his voice heard in management decision making, and business firms with an opportunity to develop a better understanding of consumer concerns. This paper aims at laying a first foundation for the understanding of the consumer affairs function within profit-seeking organizations that operate in essentially market-directed economies. Using a communications approach, it is attempted to show that the consumer affairs department can, if properly integrated within the corporate decision making structure, perform a valuable function as a consumer communications channel." .

We find that an organization's income, paid staff, membership size, and library resources are significantly related to getting media publicity, whereas the number of chapter affiliations is inversely related to publicity. Association type is also a significant factor that influences an organization's ability to get publicity.

The selected firms represent performance differences between firms that have received external support and those that did not. Due to lack of support, some entrepreneurs had to independently sustain themselves through their creativeabilities. Findings from the study revealed that Small Plastic Manufacturing Entrepreneurs in Nigeria are constrained by certain external and internal factors. Ironically, these constraints seem to have challenged some entrepreneurs to invent original strategies on their own, to cope, survive and to remain in business. Lack of financial capital, especially foreign exchange needed to import vital operating inputs from abroad has been the most serious constraint. Other serious external constraints identified are inadequate infrastructure facilities, competition from large firms, unfavorable government policies, dearth of machines and spare parts and paucity of raw materials. Internal obstacles like incompetent planning, poor organizational skills and limited knowledge among others were common obstacles faced by the entrepreneurs. In addition, another discovery is that funding assistance to entrepreneurs by relevant institutions concerned is not free from bias on the basis, of favoritism. It is therefore recommended that funding institutions should give due consideration and encouragement to promising talents. Two have especially been identified from the study as typical examples of potential avant-garde entrepreneurs and such should not be neglected or wasted. Guidance for further progress through training is another helpful approach to take and give succor to such admirable talents. Entrepreneurs, who qualify for grants from institutions, should completely be decided on compliance to standard selection procedures, rules and evidence of superior entrepreneurial qualities. In addition, those who qualify for support should be determined only after feasible business plans have been presented." .

From healthcare to automotive to food, demands from national legislation, directives of each target market, and edicts from specific clients are creating a patchwork of requirements for compliance and audit. Managing these disconnected frameworks involves considerable overhead, duplications, and conflicts. But integrating and harmonizing these requirements needs the collaboration of varied stakeholders, with different trainings and backgrounds, capable of translating the impacts of the various norms in the different sectors of the organization. We propose a participative goal-oriented approach, consisting of four steps, to assist in this process. It brings together the requirements from the various regulations, the organizational goals, and measurement indicators. We describe its use in a company operating in the food industry, one of the most regulated in the world, where audits are very frequent, to integrate ISO 22000, IFS Food, and BRC Global Standards. Our findings show that an effective integration of the multiple regulations was possible and that the resulting goal diagrams are an effective tool for communicating with various stakeholders, such as employees, clients, auditors, consultants, and representatives of industry initiatives." .

This paper studies the effects of complementarities in work attendance on absenteeism. It investigates the case where workers, who turn up for work, cover the workload of absent colleagues. Thus, externalities arise from workers being absent from work. The effort workers exert in the workplace is negatively related to worker turnout. Attendance levels of workers are strategic complements, as workers are more likely to turn up when turnout is high. Firms increase wages and improve working conditions in response. In contrast to the more standard shirking literature, the firm sets employment levels higher. Workers may benefit from draconian firing rules." .

Discarding from the previous literature, this article sets up to analyze the Private Equity channel, which is shown to have the potentiality to foster sustainable practices in unlisted companies. The fast integration of the environmental, social and governance issues by mainstream Private Equity investors is unveiled and appears to have benefited from the maturation of SRI on public financial markets and the impetus of large conventional actors. Hypotheses on the characteristics and drivers of this movement are proposed and tested on a unique database covering the French Private Equity industry in 2011. Empirical findings support that Private Equity socially responsible investing is characterized by investor engagement and strategically driven by a need for new value creation sources, increased risk management and differentiation. In particular, results show that independent funds, which need to attract investors, are more likely than captive funds to develop socially responsible practices. Evolution of the movement and future research paths are proposed." .

We consider the online scenario where a sequence of n jobs has to be scheduled non-preemptively on m machines so as to minimize the maximum completion time of any job. The best competitive ratio that can be achieved by deterministic online algorithms is in the range [1.88, 1.9201]. Currently no randomized online algorithm with a smaller competitiveness is known, for general m. In this paper we explore the power of job migration, i.e. an online scheduler is allowed to perform a limited number of job reassignments. Migration is a common technique used in theory and practice to balance load in parallel processing environments. As our main result we settle the performance that can be achieved by deterministic online algorithms. We develop an algorithm that is $$\\alpha _m$$ αm -competitive, for any $$m\\ge 2$$ m≥2 , where $$\\alpha _m$$ αm is the solution of a certain equation. For $$m=2$$ m=2 , $$\\alpha _2 = 4/3$$ α2=4/3 and $$\\lim _{m\\rightarrow \\infty } \\alpha _m = W_{-1}(-1/e^2)/(1+ W_{-1}(-1/e^2)) \\approx 1.4659$$ limm→∞αm=W-1(-1/e2)/(1+W-1(-1/e2))≈1.4659 . Here $$W_{-1}$$ W-1 is the lower branch of the Lambert W function. For $$m\\ge 11$$ m≥11 , the algorithm uses at most 7m migration operations. For smaller m, 8m to 10m operations may be performed. We complement this result by a matching lower bound: No online algorithm that uses o(n) job migrations can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than $$\\alpha _m$$ αm . We finally trade performance for migrations. We give a family of algorithms that is c-competitive, for any $$5/3\\le c \\le 2$$ 5/3≤c≤2 . For $$c= 5/3$$ c=5/3 , the strategy uses at most 4m job migrations. For $$c=1.75$$ c=1.75 , at most 2.5m migrations are used." .

Without transferable rights in the union, union members lack the means and incentive to bring forth the innovative agent controls common to the modern corporation. Considerations of the bargaining strengths of employers and employees, each represented by an agent, provide an explanation of the simultaneous decline of private sector union membership (corporate share holders have been more successful at lowering agency costs) and growth of public sector union representation (where the union official, a “double agent,” serves the interest of both employee and bureaucratic employer)." .

In many cases, buyer is prone to use supply chain flexibility rather than inventory holding strategy to withstand demand uncertainty. We assume that the buyer releases a replenishment order to the supplier for each cycle (or period) under the contract which is mainly composed of four parameters: (1) supply cost per unit, (2) minimum order quantity, (3) order quantity reduction penalty and (4) maximum capacity of the supplier. Based on these parameters, there are two flexibility options that buyer should evaluate in the order of cycle (1) issue an order smaller than the minimum order quantity and pay the related penalty and (2) place no order and lose the sales. Hence, Q lost emerges as a critical buyer decision, the order quantity, below which no order is placed. Total expected supply cost plus lost sales, as a function of Q lost is presented. We derive the optimal Q lost that minimises the total cost function. Since capacity of each supplier is finite, we then develop a supplier selection model with total cost minimisation over the suppliers subject to capacity constraint that has a stochastic nature stemming from demand behaviour. Linearisation on the model is performed using chance-constrained programming approach. From a given set of supply bids from the potential supply chain partners, the buyer is able to make a quantifiable choice." .

These changes are both cultural and behavioral including changes in decision-making processes, organizational norms, and values. The decision of any organization to adopt quality assurance, specifically via accreditation, should be regarded as a strategic one. As such, it prerequisites top management commitment, budgeting the process and promoting active inter-collaboration of all organizational members. The accreditation process according to ISO/IEC 17025:1999 of the Haifa Public Health Laboratory, will be used as a case study. A number of practical benefits of such organizational changes will be demonstrated and discussed, among them improved quality customer service and handling customer's complaints, establishing multichannel communication, enhanced interlaboratory collaboration and coordination. It is important to note that the accreditation process was accompaniment by extensive training of both management and employees on-site and off-site." .

With regard to the treatment of employees, both concepts largely assume equality to be an indicator (as well as a goal) of organizational ‘goodness’, e.g. in terms of equal treatment, or affording equal opportunities. Additionally, research on this issue predominantly refers to prescriptive and imperative moralities that address the initiatives themselves, and values them morally. Schopenhauer opposes these moralities by conceptualizing morality as exclusively being based on the incentives of acting instead of the actions themselves. He identifies egoism, compassion, and malice as the sole incentives for every human action, whereby only those actions solely motivated by compassion can be ascribed genuine moral worth. In this context, this article shows that from a Schopenhauerian perspective, CSR and DM initiatives only have a genuine moral worth in so far as the individuals who have initiated or supported their implementation were exclusively motivated by compassion. Stressing the narrative of a business case, if utilized as a façade for true compassion that attaches economic legitimacy to these initiatives, does not necessarily harm their moral worth. The approach and the findings developed in this paper contribute to the discourse on the ethical behavior of organizations, as well as to the discourse on CSR and DM." .

Guidance will be defined as an economic instrument contributing to active ageing of the population. Taking Spain as an example, it will be demonstrated that there is a need for more policy making in third age guidance. After a brief revision of guidance provision in Spain, the methodology is based on a combination of techniques aimed at gathering qualitative and quantitative information, including statistical analysis data obtained from 369 personal interviews with the participants of the Guidance Service of the Business Confederation of the Province of Alicante (Spain), ten individual interviews with social partners: employers’ organisations and trade unions representatives, and a working session with six guidance experts. Spain is a country where some progress in terms of active labour policies, specially guidance, and older workers, has occurred in the recent years, but the age is not still considered as a relevant factor in policy making in this country. Age guidance is very well valued by social actors and old workers but still insufficient. Spanish survey showed that in order to get real effectiveness, career guidance must give response to old workers’ needs, by paying full and specific attention to this collective." .

The purpose of this study is to explore ways in which the discourses and their subtexts used by directors of Dutch national sport organizations to talk about their work, sustain homologous reproduction. Close reading of the transcripts of interviews by both researchers followed by a continuous cycle of data reduction and verification and researcher agreement enabled four dominant discursive themes to emerge. We show how an overlap of various discursive practices related to instrumentality, relationality, emotionality/passion and homogeneity strengthen the gendered nature of senior managerial work in large sport organizations." .

In order for enterprises to collaborate at the business-process level, they must deal with two kinds of processes: the public conversation processes specifying inter-enterprise document flows, and the private business processes specifying local workflows of document manipulation and other related tasks. The provisioning, interaction and integration of conversation management and business process management, have become the common interest of the e-business industry. In this paper we discuss the relationship and interaction between conversation management and business process management; point out the difference between public conversation processes (e.g. BPSS processes) and peer-conversation processes (e.g. BPEL4WS processes). We then illustrate our collaborative process management system that has functionally separated conversation manager and business process manager. The conversation manager is based on the ebXML BPSS standard; it is used for validating document exchange at run-time and for activating corresponding process tasks. We have also proposed the conversation model driven asynchronous task activation mechanism for interaction between a conversation process and the coupled business process dynamically. With this mechanism, generic APIs between the conversation manager and the business process manager can be easily defined and used by multiple plugged-in conversation managers." .

Many theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Structure-conduct-performance model suggest that industry structure influences the firm behavior and determines the performance of individual firms and of the industry as a whole. Strategy-structure-performance model suggest that strategy must dictate organizational structure, which in turn influences performance. The environmental perspective considers external environments. Resource-Based View suggests that management must focus on the values of resources to generate sustained competitive advantages and to improve performance. Dynamic adjustment among environment, strategy, structure, and resources can become primary causes of the firm performance. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the gaps between different theories and to complement the existing theories. This paper confirmed the measurement of the constructs first and competing models were used to examine dynamic adjustment among constructs and the relationships to firm performance. The results demonstrated that most of the relationships among constructs were supported and support the dynamic adjustment of the constructs. When facing uncertain environments, firms tend to use competition strategies as well as cooperation strategies; firms tend to formalize organizational structures and to amass resources. Firms which conduct cooperation strategies and possess more resources will attain better performance levels than those that do not. As to the theoretical models, the structure-conduct-performance model and the environmental perspective were supported. Practitioners should recognize the importance of the industrial and environmental factors." .

Empirical evidence reveals that effective strategic alignment leads to superior financial performance for organizations. This observation has spurred extensive research into business-IT alignment. Yet, the issue of alignment remains a top concern for CIOs. We argue that the parochial view undertaken by past research into business-IT alignment is a probable cause for continuing system failures. Furthermore, strategic alignment research is limited and devoid within the requirements engineering discipline. In this paper, we highlight existing shortfalls of research in business-IT alignment, and bring to light insights that may be offered by other disciplines to augment this field. Subscribing to a multi-disciplinary perspective, we develop a goal-based framework that incorporates goals from various literatures in investigating business-IT alignment. One of the novelties of our proposed framework lies in its delineation between goals that have been originally assigned to stakeholders versus those interpreted by stakeholders. Additionally, the framework includes constructs at the strategic level for supporting the rationale of strategic level goals. We tested the usefulness and usability of this methodology in an organization with a newly developed information system founded on strategic business goals and reported lessons learnt from both researchers’ and practitioners’ perspectives." .

This theoretical model is tested on data collected from 1,200 senior managers in Canadian firms. Findings indicate that a firm’s past experience in e-commerce, as well as the factors relating to its business relationships ultimately affect its future use of e-marketplaces. Results of TOBIT regressions also show that the complexity of sophisticated e-commerce implementations is negatively correlated with the future level of use of e-marketplaces, and that consultants and other experts play an essential role in encouraging and facilitating the use of this new type of electronic platform. Finally, our survey data demonstrate that the relative influence of some determinants differs according to the firms’ size." .

The model endogenously determines not only the timing of investments but also their capacities, the degree of overlap between the initial and the subsequent innovations, and the way the competitors resolve the dispute. It shows that the firms’ R&D competition in the burgeoning market is more likely to entail a lawsuit and distinctly differentiated products, while they easily agree on cross licensing to utilize each other’s works in the slow-growing market, leaving little difference between the products. From the perspective of public policy, it is clarified that the policy on patent scope cannot yield the first-best result in terms of the speed of innovation, and the welfare analysis shows that social welfare is higher when the conflict is settled via cross licensing. However, the weak protection on patent rights, which is shown to encourage cross licensing, does not always guarantee the highest level of social welfare since it weakens the leader’s bargaining power in the negotiation, leading to fewer advanced products with higher prices." .

In some cases, service delivery is accomplished using programs that directly engage volunteers, including key public services like community-based and nonprofit volunteer fire departments. Volunteers in fire departments—often highly engaged volunteers with specialized training—provide vital services for a substantial portion of the United States, allowing local governments to realize considerable cost savings. Thus, issues of volunteer retention are a critical challenge for fire departments. Existing research has addressed issues of retention in a variety of settings; we argue that the challenging and particular context of fire departments is worthy of focused research. This article is an exploratory study of the predictors of voluntary firefighter retention in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We use data from a web-based survey of volunteer firefighters to examine the factors that influence volunteer retention, focusing specifically on volunteer management practices and broader job-related concepts. Results indicate that volunteer training, performance management, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment influence both short- and mid-term intent to remain, indicating that management practices and programs, as well as other contextual factors that shape satisfaction and commitment, are important in retaining volunteers." .

The effectiveness of these organisations in coordinating adaptation efforts is underexplored in the academic literature, and this paper helps to fill the gap. By developing the Framework for Assessing Regional Organisations Coordinating Climate Change Adaptation, it qualitatively assesses the adaptation-related inputs, projects/programmes and outputs of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme. This assessment is enriched by data gathered through interviews with national and regional climate change and development officials in the Caribbean and Pacific. It finds that regional organisations are more effective with respect to their adaptation-related inputs and outputs, but are less effective in coordinating adaptation projects/programmes. It recommends that, in addition to differentiating organisational mandates, regional organisations should focus on resolving the major climate-related information deficit issues, helping countries to develop ready to finance investment projects, building national-level capacities to adapt and supporting the creation of an enabling environment for climate change adaptation." .

In spite of this relevance, the current performance appraisal models are not sufficiently well-defined either designed for the evaluation framework in which they are defined. This paper proposes a performance appraisal model where the assessments are modelled by means of linguistic information provided by different sets of reviewers in order to manage the uncertainty and subjectivity of such assessments. Therefore, the reviewers could express their assessments in different linguistic scales according to their knowledge about the evaluated employees, defining a multi-granular linguistic evaluation framework. Additionally, the proposed model will manage the multi-granular linguistic labels provided by appraisers in order to compute collective assessments about the employees that will be used by the management team to make the final decision about them." .

To do so, first, we discuss the construct of EE through a detailed review of the relevant literature and the insights gleaned from our interviews with managers from across five continents. Second, we provide a formal definition for EE, develop scales for measuring EE, and then argue how enhancing EE can improve firm performance. After refining the measurement scales, we collect data from two countries and analyze the process of EE by conducting a path analysis and validating the findings from the popular press articles. This research provides guidance to managers on measuring and managing the different factors that drive employee engagement, thereby generating a blueprint for enhancing the firm’s service delivery, customer satisfaction, and resultant firm performance." .

Seven hundred and eighty employees and top management from logistics companies were sampled. The data were analyzed using factor analysis, structural equation modeling techniques, and one-way analysis of variance. The results showed that social expectations, organizational support, and stakeholder pressure were the important antecedents for the adoption of corporate environmental responsibility and green practices. In the path analysis, social expectations had the greatest impact on both stakeholder pressure and green practice adoption. Moreover, we found that the higher the job titles were, the more willing they were to adopt green practices. This indicated that the current top management of Korean logistics companies is well aware of being mandated to make a commitment to corporate environmental responsibility and green practices." .

As such value is certainly topical, but the importance of values as a separate but related concept is less well understood. Most construction firms have well-defined and well-articulated values, expressed in annual reports and on websites; however, the lack of rigorous and structured approaches published within construction management research and the practical, unsupported advice on construction institution websites may indicate a shortfall in the approaches used. This article reviews and compares the content and␣structure of some of the most widely used values approaches, and discusses their application within the construction sector. One of the most advanced and empirically tested theories of human values is appraised, and subsequently adopted as a suitable approach to eliciting and defining shared organisational values. Three studies within six construction organisations demonstrate the potential application of this individually grounded approach to reveal and align the relative values priorities of individuals and organisations to understand the strength of their similarity and difference. The results of these case studies show that this new universal values structure can be used along with more qualitative elicitation techniques to understand organisational cultures." .

Panel data analysis shows that the performance effects of those strategic factors are contingent on macroeconomic environments, rather than showing consistent relationships. The potentially positive or negative effects of particular diversification strategies and keiretsu financing are neutralized in the munificent environments, as exogenous macroeconomic factors overwhelm endogenous decision-making by the management. In the scarce setting, by contrast, it is those strategic factors that influence financial outcomes. Keiretsu financing moderates the relationship between international diversification strategy and profitability positively only during times of economic scarcity." .

The Malaysian Government has established the Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) managed by the Human Resource Development Limited (HRDL) to enhance and monitor the aspect of workers’ training. The HRDF has managed to increase the workers’ training activities; nevertheless, the issue raised here is to elucidate whether the training has adversely encouraged the workers’ mobility. This paper aims to analyze this issue based on 817 workers in a selected services sub-sector, namely, the information and communication technology (ICT) and the hotel sub-sector in the Klang Valley, Johor Bahru, and Penang, collected in the period of 2008/2009.

Motivated by some stylized facts, in a model with firm heterogeneity, including firms that differ in their skill intensity even within a narrowly defined industry, firms with relatively high skill intensity that are more likely to be exporters, and a positive association between a firm’s skill intensity and its product quality, I develop a general equilibrium model where firms with a higher skill intensity endogenously choose a higher-quality product, and tend to be more profitable. In this framework, a reduction in trade costs allows members of the workforce to reallocate to more efficient firms that produce higher-quality products, using their skilled labor more intensively, resulting in a rising skill premium. The main sources of the increasing wage inequality that followed trade openness are a positive link between a firm’s skill intensity, its product quality, and quality competition." .
